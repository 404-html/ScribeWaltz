3
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>There is a lion that is hugging a bear and the lion has a tear rolling down his</v>

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>face and the bear has a tear rolling down his face and it says,</v>

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Ban,</v>

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Ban the bear hunt.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

10
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>First makes me want to punch somebody in the face.</v>

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.330
<v Speaker 1>What kind of fucking crazy person living,</v>

12
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 1>living some weird bubble made this billboard and spent actual human money on it.</v>

13
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

15
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>This fantasy land if they haven't seen.</v>

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>They have a giant problem with bears in New Jersey.</v>

18
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.051
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

19
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>this is this facts behind this.</v>

20
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:40.781
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

21
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>a student from rutgers was fucking killed by a bear right outside of rutgers.</v>

22
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:45.251
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

23
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>that photograph student took this photo of a bear just before it killed them.</v>

24
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a guy who is,</v>

26
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>who knows rangers out there and they're telling people not to hike.</v>

27
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>They have so many Goddamn bear in New Jersey.</v>

28
00:00:58.451 --> 00:00:59.770
<v Speaker 1>And why do they have so many bear?</v>

29
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Because they didn't have a hunt for them.</v>

30
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>So these God damn things,</v>

31
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>they got overpopulated and they have now they're,</v>

32
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>they're entering into residential neighborhoods and these,</v>

33
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking video.</v>

34
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Bear fight far rockaway,</v>

35
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:13.631
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>

36
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>August 14th of 2014.</v>

37
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>These bears are duking it out.</v>

38
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Speaker 1>These are big black bears like seven foot bears,</v>

39
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>400 plus pound bears,</v>

40
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and they are going to war in this guy's front lawn.</v>

41
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>These are huge.</v>

42
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were an Alberta and you saw one of these bears coming in,</v>

43
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

44
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.203
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

45
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.460
<v Speaker 1>that's a trophy bear.</v>

46
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant bear.</v>

47
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>That's hundreds of pounds of meat for the grill.</v>

48
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And these bears are in this guy's lawn.</v>

49
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean this isn't a,</v>

50
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>this isn't some crazy rural,</v>

51
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Akins living in the middle of the nowhere.</v>

53
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

54
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>this jersey,</v>

55
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>this thing just knocked over a lamp post and now it's colliding with these</v>

56
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.870
<v Speaker 1>garbage pails.</v>

57
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.853
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

58
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>They come.</v>

59
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting over territory by the way.</v>

60
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>That's created by garbage.</v>

61
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what the territory is.</v>

62
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>They attack people's garbage and these two bears,</v>

63
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.130
<v Speaker 1>they bite each other and then they do get out.</v>

64
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of these bears know these are huge,</v>

65
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.653
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

67
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.613
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

68
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

69
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>so maybe there was before there's houses that was perfect bear habitat,</v>

70
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:17.261
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

71
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>There's houses now.</v>

72
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So that means we have to control the bare numbers that's hunting.</v>

73
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>here's another part of the problem.</v>

75
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 1>These bears weren't here 30 years ago.</v>

76
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.770
<v Speaker 1>These bears are overpopulating and moving into these neighborhoods and they're</v>

77
00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:33.220
<v Speaker 1>doing it because they know that people live there and it's a steady supply of</v>

78
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

79
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.450
<v Speaker 2>So the cancer thing,</v>

80
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 2>and I get there probably is linked to cancer,</v>

81
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 2>but they've pulled back on the red meat in general.</v>

82
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 2>They're not sure about it,</v>

83
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.611
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

84
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 2>and I think the study is skewed because you talk about cancer and Ph.</v>

85
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.363
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

86
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

87
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 2>grass fed beef has a neutral Ph,</v>

88
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.721
<v Speaker 2>corn fed,</v>

89
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 2>grain fed beef,</v>

90
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:58.561
<v Speaker 2>that Ph goes up and we know that cancer thrives in an acidic environment</v>

91
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.101
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

92
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

93
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.031
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

94
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:06.031
<v Speaker 2>there's other things that the cows that have a high acid guts basically is what</v>

95
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

96
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 2>They're more prone to acidosis,</v>

97
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

98
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 2>which needs more medication.</v>

99
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 2>You need antibiotics.</v>

100
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

101
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 2>and it's also a prime harbor for Ecolab.</v>

102
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.583
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>

103
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.971
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

104
00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:18.101
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

105
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll find a stat for you,</v>

106
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 2>but the Akola it's,</v>

107
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 6 million,</v>

108
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>300,000 milligrams per.</v>

109
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.361
<v Speaker 2>I'll look that up.</v>

110
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll chime back in and you guys talk.</v>

111
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

112
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.013
<v Speaker 2>that's an important.</v>

113
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

114
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.501
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and look that up.</v>

115
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:32.970
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

116
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a very important point I think you're making about,</v>

117
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

118
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 2>about how these animals that are unhealthy,</v>

119
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of unhealthy to eat an unhealthy animal.</v>

120
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 2>That seems logical.</v>

121
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

122
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>so this is now we're talking cells per gram of meat.</v>

123
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.231
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

124
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:46.601
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

125
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 2>So in your grain fed the count of Ecolab,</v>

126
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.160
<v Speaker 2>the grain fed and the count will be coli,</v>

127
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 2>6 million,</v>

128
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 2>300,000 cells per gram in the grass fed 20,000.</v>

129
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.221
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

130
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

131
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

132
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 3>Why is nobody doing this?</v>

133
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Why is nobody just leave it here?</v>

134
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Just hit them a little bit.</v>

135
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Do look away.</v>

136
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 3>Because most times when you look away they think a book just flat hand on the</v>

137
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 3>center of the chest and just shoved it over the chest.</v>

138
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:17.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

139
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

140
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 3>That does make sense.</v>

141
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 3>But when I work with a punch as well with the.</v>

142
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

143
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 3>but you have more space with a poem on this distance.</v>

144
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 3>This is much shorter than this.</v>

145
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 3>This is like an extra 15 percent,</v>

146
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 3>which will make a lot of difference.</v>

147
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 3>That's that distance.</v>

148
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:34.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point.</v>

149
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 3>Like another five or six inches at least.</v>

150
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

151
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 3>that's why I never understood.</v>

152
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's throwing palm strikes.</v>

153
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Now that left Hook,</v>

154
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:42.761
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

155
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Straight combination,</v>

156
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:43.811
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

157
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 3>In boxing,</v>

158
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

159
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a dump combination.</v>

160
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 3>If you really think about it,</v>

161
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 3>if there's a short left hook.</v>

162
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm way too close with my straight punch.</v>

163
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:50.231
<v Speaker 3>It has no power.</v>

164
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't stretch my arm,</v>

165
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 3>but if I do a palm strike and then a straight punch,</v>

166
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 3>now I got space for my straight punch.</v>

167
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.323
<v Speaker 3>It's much harder.</v>

168
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 3>So why is nobody doing that?</v>

169
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.851
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

170
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:02.070
<v Speaker 3>I do closed lines.</v>

171
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I posted a thing on facebook like a year ago when I hit a bag with a</v>

172
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.083
<v Speaker 3>clothesline.</v>

173
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

174
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people can imitate me.</v>

175
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 3>My weight with a kick like that,</v>

176
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.123
<v Speaker 3>they can kick.</v>

177
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.761
<v Speaker 3>And then I said,</v>

178
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:12.971
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

179
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 3>now I show a clothesline.</v>

180
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Is she the back folding or out?</v>

181
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 3>My whole arm is the courageous thing you can block with.</v>

182
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Tim had tried to block whatever you want.</v>

183
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.861
<v Speaker 3>If I closed line,</v>

184
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 3>you have you stand still.</v>

185
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 3>It goes straight through everything.</v>

186
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you and knock you out.</v>

187
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.611
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

188
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Why is it close on so path?</v>

189
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 3>It is so powerful because you can really lock it up.</v>

190
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Don't stretch your arm because if you miss time and you hit your,</v>

191
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 3>you got to hyperextend,</v>

192
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 3>but you can drag your whole body weight in there because you like it and your</v>

193
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 3>legs are planted on the ground.</v>

194
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

195
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 3>you're getting all that hip torque and it is such a powerful strike and also</v>

196
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 3>with the clinch when even when they stand like this,</v>

197
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 3>if I do this,</v>

198
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 3>it loops around to defense and it hits the back of their head still the legal</v>

199
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:52.640
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

200
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

201
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Because it's outside the Mohawk.</v>

202
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.031
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

203
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 3>he's in the back of the head.</v>

204
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Standing never seems to get like in boxing they get penalized for punching the</v>

205
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 3>back of the head.</v>

206
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 3>People say no rabbit punches,</v>

207
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 3>but when you think about a head kick,</v>

208
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 3>a lot of head kicks,</v>

209
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 3>especially the ones that go over the shoulder there,</v>

210
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 3>there the back of the head and it's,</v>

211
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 3>and it's legal and that's why they're effective and that's why it was so</v>

212
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 3>effective with me with,</v>

213
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

214
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

215
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 3>with pancreas,</v>

216
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 3>I hid behind the ear.</v>

217
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 3>If you look at Mike Tyson's fights,</v>

218
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

219
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he did it,</v>

220
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:19.911
<v Speaker 3>but he did it.</v>

221
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 3>He was always the shorter guy.</v>

222
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 3>But if you see him hooking somebody,</v>

223
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 3>he hits almost the back of the head.</v>

224
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 3>He just got very short hooks.</v>

225
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.153
<v Speaker 3>Now the body,</v>

226
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 3>it's ready for impact from the front,</v>

227
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.471
<v Speaker 3>from the side,</v>

228
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:31.281
<v Speaker 3>because you're used to it.</v>

229
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:31.461
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

230
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 3>if you can see the punch coming,</v>

231
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 3>the behind,</v>

232
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.821
<v Speaker 3>I always tell people,</v>

233
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 3>just do it with the palm.</v>

234
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Just do this to the back of your head and see what happens.</v>

235
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Like just me doing this.</v>

236
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:40.544
<v Speaker 3>It's all ready to go.</v>

237
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 3>You're not ready for that.</v>

238
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.410
<v Speaker 3>So you can already imagine if you go hit as hard as you can be here.</v>

239
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a sweet,</v>

240
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 3>the sweet bunch.</v>

241
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.201
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

242
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 3>understand nobody's doing it the head that much more dangerous.</v>

243
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

244
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 3>do this,</v>

245
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.361
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

246
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

247
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 3>is it that much more digital than just behind the ear?</v>

248
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.213
<v Speaker 3>Just do that.</v>

249
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

250
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.893
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

251
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 3>And I was down here do and sound like</v>

252
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.440
<v Speaker 4>would do platform where cry would demonstrate how to do stuff for other</v>

253
00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:11.460
<v Speaker 4>hairdressers and people.</v>

254
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.630
<v Speaker 4>And I went to a,</v>

255
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.453
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

256
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.740
<v Speaker 4>not the viper room,</v>

257
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.460
<v Speaker 4>one of those clubs and this pretty woman comes up to me and says,</v>

258
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

259
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.560
<v Speaker 4>are you a musician?</v>

260
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:23.010
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

261
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.280
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

262
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 4>but I'm kind of about to say,</v>

263
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 4>but I live in Canada and uh,</v>

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.301

266
00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:27.451
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

268
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.250

269
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:38.850
<v Speaker 4>But to somebody who was really into like motley crue and stuff like that,</v>

285
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.800

291
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Like something's not making a lot of sense.</v>

292
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.140
<v Speaker 4>And then around day two I figured out,</v>

293
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:19.501
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

294
00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:21.330
<v Speaker 4>it's because everyone's on heroin.</v>

295
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.920
<v Speaker 4>And it started.</v>

296
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.150
<v Speaker 4>We had smoked some pot,</v>

297
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.290
<v Speaker 4>which in Winnipeg,</v>

298
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.580
<v Speaker 4>in Manitoba we called that dope,</v>

299
00:08:26.581 --> 00:08:27.480
<v Speaker 4>you want to smoke some dope?</v>

300
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:27.810
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

301
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.290
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

302
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:28.890
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

303
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:29.370
<v Speaker 4>so it goes,</v>

304
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 4>do you do dope?</v>

305
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.281
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

306
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:30.441
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

307
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:32.100
<v Speaker 4>I just smoked it with you like 20 minutes ago.</v>

308
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.520
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

309
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.353
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

310
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.830
<v Speaker 4>and then before I knew it he had injected me with heroin conversation sorta</v>

311
00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:38.640
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

312
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.810
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to be a,</v>

313
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.890
<v Speaker 4>not super uncool but like not saying yes I want to do heroin and then four days</v>

314
00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:50.271
<v Speaker 4>went by like literally just shooting up for days and then I just about ms.my</v>

315
00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 4>plane home and so I had a girl and a and a home and a job and all those kinds of</v>

316
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.920
<v Speaker 4>things that I'm kind of looking at like the plane ticket and I know it's like</v>

317
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.261
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

318
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 4>if I get a cab in the next two hours I'll get the plane,</v>

319
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 4>I'll get home and whatever.</v>

320
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.181
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

321
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 4>well just,</v>

322
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:06.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

323
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 4>and you're not even thinking.</v>

324
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like barely even there and somewhere along the line I was just like,</v>

325
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:12.601
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about it.</v>

326
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Just fine.</v>

327
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to go get on the plane.</v>

328
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I probably got $100 to my name and if I didn't get on that play and not have no</v>

329
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>

330
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.353
<v Speaker 4>no girl,</v>

331
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I'd be a heroin addict with no money in woodland hills with a guy who's doesn't</v>

332
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:26.641
<v Speaker 4>have his shit together.</v>

333
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 4>I think in the years since he's got his shit together,</v>

334
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen him since then and uh,</v>

335
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 4>I've made myself go and I was sick for two or three days and I realized like</v>

336
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.240
<v Speaker 4>literally that second in time if I don't convince myself to get on that plane,</v>

337
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 4>my whole life is fucking ruined.</v>

338
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.470
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

339
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
