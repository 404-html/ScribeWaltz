00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.630
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.291
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

3
00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>we bring up a lot.</v>

4
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I hope I haven't overdone it in the shows,</v>

5
00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:09.661
<v Speaker 1>but I'm fascinated by this idea that we're never going to go backwards.</v>

6
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:10.781
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7
00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:10.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:11.824
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about,</v>

9
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>this modern world and you look around and you think,</v>

11
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.111
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

12
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>basically since the renaissance,</v>

13
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it's been all,</v>

14
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>this is the stock market.</v>

15
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:21.580
<v Speaker 1>We've been going up ever since the renaissance and the idea that everybody has</v>

16
00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:22.240
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

17
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>and we're never going to go backwards.</v>

18
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to go look at a thousand years from now and see people who</v>

19
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>don't know about DNA sequencing anymore.</v>

20
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>It's planet of the apes,</v>

21
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:31.511
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

22
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>where you've gone backwards and Oh,</v>

23
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>the statue of Liberty's partly buried in the sand.</v>

24
00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.051
<v Speaker 1>And I mean we,</v>

25
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

26
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>but every other culture,</v>

27
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 1>every other country in the civilization,</v>

28
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>in the history of the world has thought that.</v>

29
00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:43.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you didn't think the Romans were thinking,</v>

31
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:45.281
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

32
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:45.641
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

33
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Now pity it can't last.</v>

34
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Speaker 1>But we learned from them.</v>

36
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>

37
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can not just that maybe the whole globalization of the fact that</v>

38
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>everybody's connected.</v>

39
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>We'll change that dynamic.</v>

40
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you're gonna,</v>

41
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to learn from history one thing,</v>

42
00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:02.290
<v Speaker 1>history shows us these stock market upticks in the civilization stock market</v>

43
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:03.124
<v Speaker 1>don't last.</v>

44
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>So what does that,</v>

45
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.171
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

46
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 2>we like to think we're more special than all the other animals first and</v>

47
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:07.621
<v Speaker 2>foremost.</v>

48
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 2>So we would like to think that,</v>

49
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 2>even me,</v>

51
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty of this guilty,</v>

52
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 2>absolutely as charged.</v>

53
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 2>We'd like to think that we are eventually going to cheese,</v>

54
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 2>achieve the highest levels of understanding and that that's the trend that</v>

55
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 2>things are going and eventually going to work everything out.</v>

56
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And we won't have war someday in the future.</v>

57
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 2>And that somehow or another,</v>

58
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 2>we are basically human beings are basically good and uh,</v>

59
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 2>we're going to work this out in the universe is going to reward that.</v>

60
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 2>But I got one word,</v>

61
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 2>the one word that refutes that.</v>

62
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Dinosaurs.</v>

63
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

64
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 2>The whole world was fucking run by Conti,</v>

65
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 2>heartless lizards,</v>

66
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 2>cold blooded monsters without a fucking Spec of emotion that never wrote a</v>

67
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing down,</v>

68
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 2>didn't give a shit about culture,</v>

69
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 2>would eat their babies,</v>

70
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 2>would eat anything that stood still.</v>

71
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 2>That's what dominated this earth for the longest time,</v>

72
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 2>and if it wasn't for an asteroid impact,</v>

73
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 2>very likely would still be a version of that animal still running shit.</v>

74
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.023
<v Speaker 2>Bad cops.</v>

75
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Ed Asner.</v>

76
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

77
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

78
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Bad Cop shows or one of my favorite things of all time,</v>

79
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 2>so much so that there was a show called Della Ventura.</v>

80
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I remembered the name of my manager also manages Kevin James,</v>

81
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 2>who's a the king of Queens.</v>

82
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

83
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 2>And they were on the same network as Danny Aiello when he had this show called</v>

84
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:28.191
<v Speaker 2>Delavan.</v>

85
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Tara and I had them get me the tapes because that you couldn't find them.</v>

86
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I have I trailer the original master</v>

87
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.413
<v Speaker 2>tapes,</v>

88
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.061
<v Speaker 2>great show.</v>

89
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible and awesome at the same time.</v>

90
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I cherish these tapes.</v>

91
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 2>I have people over for Delavan tour watching parties,</v>

92
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not walking around bump them over to a digital.</v>

93
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.353
<v Speaker 2>I have to do that.</v>

94
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.293
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

95
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad.</v>

96
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:53.334
<v Speaker 2>It's so awesome.</v>

97
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Only get so many runs on the tape so you to you gotta transfer that should not,</v>

98
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 2>haven't watched them in years.</v>

99
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll over transfer.</v>

100
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

101
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I have them like in a sacred spot.</v>

102
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Have candles around them and make sure it keeps him safe.</v>

103
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I thought it'd be a really good idea to buy first season,</v>

104
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>macgyver DVD box set.</v>

105
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.751
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

106
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.110
<v Speaker 2>fuck where you're at a meeting dollars.</v>

107
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you about macgyver.</v>

108
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Macgyver is infinitely better than Delavan.</v>

109
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

110
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not measurable.</v>

111
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Dell inventory is one of the worst shows the world has ever known.</v>

112
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>That's where man beats up every young punk that crosses his eye.</v>

113
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.270
<v Speaker 2>He's the best at everything he does or the grants.</v>

114
00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Marino fucking you will drown in Danny Aiello Ego.</v>

115
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 2>You will drown.</v>

116
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 2>You will never make it out alive.</v>

117
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>She was good and do the right thing so well.</v>

118
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.900
<v Speaker 2>He's an amazing listener,</v>

119
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

120
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.601
<v Speaker 2>No bullshit.</v>

121
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who made the script.</v>

122
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

123
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 2>That show.</v>

124
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about shitty.</v>

125
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.843
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking shit.</v>

126
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Danny thought it was a subtle comedy,</v>

127
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 2>but he's an amazing actor.</v>

128
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.051
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

129
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 2>you can't take that away from them.</v>

130
00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:57.641
<v Speaker 2>The Guy,</v>

131
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 2>he's an incredible actor and so of course he has a bit of an ego.</v>

132
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.890
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

133
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.141
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

134
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking bad ass.</v>

135
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:03.244
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad ass actor,</v>

136
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 2>but still,</v>

137
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>that show was so bad.</v>

138
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 2>It hurt your feelings.</v>

139
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.923
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

140
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.011
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad.</v>

141
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 2>You would watch it and go,</v>

142
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

143
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.673
<v Speaker 2>Like he plays,</v>

144
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 2>he plays pool with this guy,</v>

145
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.491
<v Speaker 2>this young punk,</v>

146
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.800

164
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 2>they might have been just one season.</v>

165
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:44.914
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

166
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I have a nice box of them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bullshit thing really that bad.</v>

175
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>They could have shot the entire thing are seasoned and about four days.</v>

176
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

177
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

178
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.781

179
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

180
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about your personal situation,</v>

181
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:12.451
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

182
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're in love.</v>

183
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 2>You're found the girl.</v>

184
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 2>This is the one you want to marry.</v>

185
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:16.524
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

186
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 2>And you have the opportunity for one day or one hour,</v>

187
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:25.911
<v Speaker 2>let's say an hour to feel what it's like for you to fuck her and she gets to</v>

188
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:31.371
<v Speaker 2>feel what it's like to be you having sex with her so you,</v>

189
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:35.970
<v Speaker 2>you feel what it's like to be her getting fucked by you and she feels what it's</v>

190
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:38.880
<v Speaker 2>like for you to fuck her.</v>

191
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.860
<v Speaker 2>We think you could do that.</v>

192
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you could lie there and get fucked by yourself?</v>

193
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could handle an hour.</v>

194
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can handle it.</v>

195
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Our of what I'm dealing with.</v>

196
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you could do that.</v>

197
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you could deal with like kissing you and do you think you'd love</v>

198
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 2>her enough to let her be you for an hour and you'd be her?</v>

199
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I really love myself so I'm pretty sure that if I got fucked by me and if I was</v>

200
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 2>a chick for an hour,</v>

201
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably really enjoy it.</v>

202
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:07.814
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably be,</v>

203
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.493
<v Speaker 2>if I was,</v>

204
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 2>if I was a check,</v>

205
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably be a squirter.</v>

206
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you'd give up the booty?</v>

207
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>What'd you go anal.</v>

208
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Would I give it a check and just taking the ask from yourself?</v>

209
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.691

<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm yourself.</v>

212
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

213
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 2>You spit on your hand or writing around solar analogy back and open it up wide</v>

214
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.903
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

215
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't Dunno if I should go ask them out for yourself.</v>

216
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the real quick question.</v>

217
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 2>How much do you really love yourself?</v>

218
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Because you probably don't love yourself enough to go after ass to mouth on</v>

219
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

221
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 2>But if you watch porn,</v>

222
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 2>girls who don't even love guys are willing to go ask to mouth.</v>

223
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

224
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 2>So consider,</v>

225
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.901

00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 2>So do I hope for two thousand five thousand to fuck myself?</v>

228
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 2>If that's all it takes for you to go ask him mouth,</v>

229
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:54.380
