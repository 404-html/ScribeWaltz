1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:01.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think that activities are really important for people.</v>

4
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that unfortunately don't engage in activity.</v>

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 1>They don't engage and tell him to have hobbies or anything like that.</v>

6
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I learn a language.</v>

7
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>They did do something,</v>

8
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>do something that's exciting</v>

9
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.591
<v Speaker 2>art of learning.</v>

10
00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 2>You know the problem with our education system,</v>

11
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Garvey,</v>

12
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I was saying this is what it was,</v>

13
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.030
<v Speaker 2>that we don't have an education system that teaches you how to think.</v>

14
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>We don't like so true.</v>

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.061
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

16
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

17
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.171
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

18
00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 2>there is an art to learning,</v>

19
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:30.671
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

20
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 2>There's an art to learning.</v>

21
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 2>It's an art.</v>

22
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>It's an art to be in a human beings.</v>

23
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

24
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.901
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

25
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 1>And no one teaches us.</v>

26
00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the fuck we're doing.</v>

27
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:42.061
<v Speaker 1>We're all idiots raising other people by the same flaws that we were raised</v>

28
00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:42.461
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

29
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no manual for it.</v>

30
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

31
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And there's an,</v>

32
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>when you look at what we consider our are our source of education as far as like</v>

33
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>what is distributed to us nightly,</v>

34
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>what's the news?</v>

35
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.361
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

36
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really the education that people have today.</v>

37
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Once you get out of school,</v>

38
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>unless you're reading books on your own,</v>

39
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.220
<v Speaker 1>where are you getting your information about the world?</v>

40
00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>You're getting it from the fucking news.</v>

41
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>the news doesn't really represent what's a going on in the world and B,</v>

43
00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't say anything about how you should be dealing with this,</v>

44
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>how you should be thinking,</v>

45
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:13.991
<v Speaker 1>how we,</v>

46
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>how we should resolve these issues.</v>

47
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like this tattle tale that just goes running over and tells us about all</v>

48
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>the fucked up shit that's happening in the world,</v>

49
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>but they don't,</v>

50
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>there's not a dialogue with a person.</v>

51
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like a source of information</v>

52
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 2>shy.</v>

53
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 2>The way that that complaint goes back at least 3,500 years.</v>

54
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Socrates,</v>

55
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 2>when he was in his trial said,</v>

56
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 2>you take a,</v>

57
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't take a horse to try to ride it and not train it.</v>

58
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>The same applies to a human being.</v>

59
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.521
<v Speaker 2>You got to,</v>

60
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you got to start with,</v>

61
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 2>with the notion of he was trying to teach philosophy in the sense that you</v>

62
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

63
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 2>you better know what questions to ask throughout your life.</v>

64
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 2>And we should start with young people,</v>

65
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 2>educate young people the right way with the right questions.</v>

66
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do that,</v>

67
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:55.741
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

68
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:56.461
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

69
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 2>you've got to start with a base almost,</v>

70
00:01:58.261 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.330
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

72
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.163
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

73
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.051
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

74
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 2>we don't do that.</v>

75
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>

76
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

77
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

78
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like learning Jujitsu,</v>

79
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 2>just learning moves without learning the principles behind it first.</v>

80
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also like learning Jujitsu without going over the real correct drills,</v>

82
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.250
<v Speaker 1>learning real live applications and,</v>

83
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

84
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

86
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>the way school is set up,</v>

87
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the first two emails I got back from this like loving list of parents was how</v>

149
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 1>dare you see exactly where it happened.</v>

150
00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:58.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

151
00:03:58.261 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 1>we live right across the street,</v>

152
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lower our property values and like are you selling now?</v>

154
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.901
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

155
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:05.220
<v Speaker 1>is that now we're not selling.</v>

156
00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:09.060
<v Speaker 1>But it was a really weird time when people needed their property values to go up</v>

157
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>because they were trying to get bigger mortgages and pay down and do all that.</v>

158
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

159
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>and it was just like so panicky there about that,</v>

160
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 1>that some,</v>

161
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.830
<v Speaker 1>someone was afraid of,</v>

163
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.390
<v Speaker 1>what if a newspaper covers it and it's bad.</v>

164
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:22.224
<v Speaker 1>And what if I,</v>

165
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.320
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird when one's and zero's Trump humanity,</v>

166
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.671
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

167
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:29.810
<v Speaker 1>And in that case,</v>

168
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.980
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what that is.</v>

169
00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:32.450
<v Speaker 1>It's ones and Zeros.</v>

170
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.901
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

171
00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:33.734
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

172
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.591
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

173
00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>in two kinds of ones and Zeros,</v>

174
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

175
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.291
<v Speaker 1>the ones and zeroes,</v>

176
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>that money.</v>

177
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

178
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

179
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And the ones and Zeros,</v>

180
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:41.400
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of of digital technology,</v>

181
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:45.840
<v Speaker 1>which I think can create a kind of a distance</v>

182
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.831
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

183
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:50.270
<v Speaker 1>The impact of saying that to someone's face that you're,</v>

184
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

185
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird communication that takes place online.</v>

186
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

187
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any consequence.</v>

188
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

189
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:58.061
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

190
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>you can do it anonymously and this is this,</v>

191
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like these barbs that you can just send out and illogically like in,</v>

192
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.841
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

193
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>in ways that you would never,</v>

194
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 1>if you had to deal with someone one on one because you would feel it and you</v>

195
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>would look at them,</v>

196
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>you would feel their response.</v>

197
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:11.291
<v Speaker 1>You would be like,</v>

198
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>why are you saying this?</v>

199
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

200
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.091
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>

201
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Why are you being such an asshole?</v>

202
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>But because you are anonymous,</v>

203
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you can just,</v>

204
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>so people are just like in this unnatural communication thing.</v>

205
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

206
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.080
<v Speaker 1>But then the,</v>

207
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

208
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.931
<v Speaker 1>the part that,</v>

209
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 1>that worries me after that is if you get used to doing it like that in an</v>

210
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.030
<v Speaker 1>anonymous way online,</v>

211
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>does that start to make the behavior a bit more normative when you're even with</v>

212
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:33.744
<v Speaker 1>your identity?</v>

213
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

214
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee it has to.</v>

215
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>It has to.</v>

216
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.751
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

217
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>there's no free rides when it comes to that.</v>

218
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I really feel like your thoughts,</v>

219
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of like,</v>

220
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>there was always a thing.</v>

221
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was in high school,</v>

222
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>this was someone in my school newspaper wrote like a funny critique about the</v>

223
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:51.724
<v Speaker 1>boy scouts.</v>

224
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he didn't like about the boy scouts was that they</v>

225
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>wanted you to keep your thoughts pure.</v>

226
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.011
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

227
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:58.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:58.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

229
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts are my own thoughts.</v>

230
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:00.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

231
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

232
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>as long as I don't do anything,</v>

233
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong with my thoughts.</v>

234
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.610
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

235
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Know if that was really smartly argued.</v>

236
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading that going,</v>

237
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:09.121
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

238
00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>this kid's pretty clever.</v>

239
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.271
<v Speaker 1>But then I thought about it.</v>

240
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:11.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

241
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

242
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about creepy shit,</v>

243
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you probably are kind of creepy.</v>

244
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

245
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:16.651
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

246
00:06:16.651 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to get any better.</v>

247
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

248
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to eventually one day going to snap and then you got to do</v>

250
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

251
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.581
<v Speaker 1>He'd be thing.</v>

252
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:22.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:24.640
<v Speaker 1>If you really are like the,</v>

254
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.161
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

255
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone has their own definition of thoughts being pure,</v>

256
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:34.091
<v Speaker 1>like a more lenient person might allow a lot of like healthy sexual things and</v>

258
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>the idea of thoughts being pure as long as it's not creepy,</v>

259
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>but there's other people that would just sit around and say,</v>

260
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:39.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

261
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 1>let me just think about creepy shit all day and not do it and I'm fine,</v>

262
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.053
<v Speaker 1>but they're not,</v>

263
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no free ride.</v>

264
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>There may be though,</v>

265
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.223
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>

266
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

267
00:06:47.521 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

268
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>what you're describing,</v>

269
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>what you're describing is,</v>

270
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:50.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of an absolute police state as long as it was always right.</v>

272
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.253
<v Speaker 1>That's no problem.</v>

274
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

275
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

276
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>you can always get your minority report,</v>

277
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:01.600
<v Speaker 1>just in case maybe they're wrong.</v>

279
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I really subscribing to that.</v>

280
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that you really can be nice.</v>

281
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't have really shitty thoughts and get through.</v>

282
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if you're really shitty online,</v>

283
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:09.824
<v Speaker 1>you have those thoughts.</v>

284
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's only online,</v>

285
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that negative energy is going to leak.</v>

286
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.661
<v Speaker 1>Genuinely shitty.</v>

287
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:14.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

288
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>it's just how do you decide what's,</v>

289
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

290
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>what's shitty and whatnot.</v>

291
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.344
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

292
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

293
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.530
