<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about opera before we</v>

6
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 2>started the podcast and that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that those people are like</v>

7
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 2>aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what they can do with their voice</v>

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 2>is so far beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like I could look at someone</v>

9
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 2>doing a backhand spring and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I bet if I practiced for a long time I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to do that.</v>

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I would need some help but it takes some</v>
<v Speaker 2>time but that doesn't seem</v>

12
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 2>insurmountable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I hear,</v>

13
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I hear these fucking dudes or</v>

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has to start with some kind of</v>

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 2>natural gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's maybe it's just like</v>

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 2>getting them when they're really young</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then developing those muscle ups</v>

18
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 2>talking totally out of my ass.</v>

31
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

32
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he really wanted a</v>

33
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 2>career in it and who's doing some acting</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and shit too.</v>

34
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 2>he's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 2>he's at his best doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to chase other shit on</v>

37
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 2>top of the stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

38
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the standup is the most fun,</v>

39
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 2>it's always going to be the most fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>

40
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 2>And I do think radio in a capacity as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

41
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 2>there were similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a similar beast.</v>

42
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what this is cool is like it allows</v>

43
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>someone who's not near us to have a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>time talking to a guy like,</v>

44
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

45
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely it does.</v>

46
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>It brings people in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

47
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 2>your is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

48
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it feeds the same beast as</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

49
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 2>It's also when you're live it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate reactions to like as soon as</v>

50
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you're done you check social media or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and people like the feedback is</v>

51
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 2>immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like when you're on stage,</v>

52
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

53
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely that aspect of it.</v>

54
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's also cool aspect because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows people to kind of work out ideas,</v>

55
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.400
<v Speaker 2>workout ideas in the sort of open forum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 2>talk about stuff and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

57
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different places that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't do that though.</v>

58
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 2>They really just stick to the 25 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were so on and just do forever.</v>

59
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well as far as standups.</v>

60
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's brutal.</v>

61
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean that used to go across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was such a fan of comedy growing up,</v>

62
00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:08.520
<v Speaker 2>but I remember like you'd see people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like five,</v>

63
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>six TV shows and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

64
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Like I know their act.</v>

65
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a problem in the early days,</v>

66
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 2>right before the early to mid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess like all through the</v>

67
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a weird way,</v>

68
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 2>def jam really did like make comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to step his game up across the</v>

69
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as a comedy on that was always that</v>

70
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean like it brought it back until</v>

71
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just be like,</v>

72
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there with your blazer sleeves</v>

73
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>rolled up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean.</v>

74
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>You might have to like just show a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different version of comedy act.</v>

75
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Really attacking the people with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing comedy at people.</v>

76
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few examples of that,</v>

77
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:42.941
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

78
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Kennison was definitely an example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

79
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Kennison came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

80
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've probably have told this story.</v>

81
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard anybody listening?</v>

82
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I found out about Kennison through a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl that worked with.</v>

84
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 2>I was 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working at the Boston athletic</v>

85
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this little health club and that</v>

86
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 2>was a teaching people how to lift</v>
<v Speaker 2>weights and shit.</v>

87
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl who worked at the front desk</v>

88
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 2>was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just like big volleyball check.</v>

89
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 2>She was like six feet tall but fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

90
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:12.510
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had gotten into standup.</v>

91
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>This girl was really funny and she was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fan of standup and she knew that I was a</v>

92
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.500
<v Speaker 2>fan of standup too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she told me about this guy who was</v>

93
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>doing this bit about these dead people</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fucked in the ass.</v>

94
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.160
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said his name is Sam kinison and how</v>

95
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 2>she did the bit she laid on the Sam</v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate had an all time classic bit</v>

96
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 2>and it was about a homosexual.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the bit in the parking lot of the</v>

98
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>athletic club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got down on her stomach and she was</v>

99
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:42.620

<v Speaker 2>couldn't imagine what this guy was like.</v>

103
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.010

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 2>We lost Sam Kinison so young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he always looked 40.</v>

119
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Like Sam kinison never looked here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always have like a 40 year old,</v>

120
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 2>like your uncle who will come over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his star appearances were like</v>

121
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 2>legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he was.</v>

122
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 2>He just went for a man who was such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pioneer.</v>

123
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to imagine,</v>

124
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but all guys like us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those guys,</v>

125
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be so far behind as far as like</v>

126
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>what we can and can't say what we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>and can't get away with what,</v>

127
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>what is and isn't taboo and what,</v>

128
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.560
<v Speaker 5>what and also the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

129
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 5>the recognition that when someone's</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying something fucked up like that,</v>

130
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's doing it for humor.</v>

131
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's no different than someone making a</v>

132
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 5>movie about someone shooting people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not actually killing people.</v>

133
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not like the intent behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Intent behind it is humor and</v>

134
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 5>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which people do have to get a grip on</v>

135
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I also think that like,</v>

136
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 5>even like that def jam version of comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>should pay more homage,</v>

137
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 5>I think to like Sam kinison dice very</v>
<v Speaker 5>much because that was like,</v>

138
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 5>to my knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're the first braggadocious comedy.</v>

139
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 5>Most comedies brooded in such like self</v>
<v Speaker 5>deprecation with dice,</v>

140
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 5>but Sam kinison till was never a belly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He never talked about being like a big</v>

141
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:45.550
<v Speaker 5>fat guy or it was always outward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

142
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.190
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know the answers and you idiots got to</v>

143
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 5>listen to me and dice was more of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

144
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 5>how great he is and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that is like,</v>

145
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.700
<v Speaker 5>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the main difference between like</v>

146
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 5>that black circuit comedy and like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mainstream circuit because the</v>

147
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 5>mainstream circuit is not white comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the black circuit comedy is its own</v>

148
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 5>kind of beast and that still has all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

149
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a big old Dick and I'd be choking</v>

150
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 5>the bitches with it because one bitch</v>
<v Speaker 5>last night and you're like,</v>

151
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are you relating to?</v>

152
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 5>All these black people in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it was also the rap culture,</v>

153
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 5>which is very braggadocious as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

154
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

155
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 5>There's like a bunch of things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of different elements,</v>

156
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:29.111
<v Speaker 5>but for sure just as the art form for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the art form as a whole dice is super</v>

157
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 5>important and kinison and super</v>
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>

158
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because both those guys came out with</v>

159
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 5>like really controversial acts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of blowback,</v>

160
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of like a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you could listen to some of the</v>

161
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some of the stuff in the eighties,</v>

162
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 5>it's really homophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

163
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in a mean,</v>

164
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 5>nasty way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is where I always seen it for</v>

165
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

166
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 5>But we don't do gay jokes like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

167
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 5>Like gay jokes today or like it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a geek.</v>

168
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of wrapped around the idea</v>

169
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 5>that you could completely accept someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>being gay,</v>

170
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't make it not funny if a</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude is sucking the dude's Dick.</v>

171
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

172
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Funny Concept.</v>

173
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:07.661
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

174
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 5>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people are coming.</v>

175
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 5>I think we're actually leveling out</v>
<v Speaker 5>where now the pc police are running</v>

176
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 5>rampant of course funding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they are funny.</v>

177
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 5>But they really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

178
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.090
<v Speaker 5>the best point is like the person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're joking,</v>

179
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 5>supposedly offending rarely offended</v>
<v Speaker 5>that person.</v>

180
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always a white college girl who</v>

181
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 5>wants to like write a blog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

182
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 5>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also the choosing to be offended</v>

183
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:34.130
<v Speaker 5>recreationally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

184
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 5>that this is something that's a hot</v>
<v Speaker 5>topic.</v>

185
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.250
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this big Jay Oakerson guy eats.</v>

186
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take him down a peg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep after him.</v>

187
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 5>I can't fucking believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never had blowback at all.</v>

188
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm just probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My name's not out there enough,</v>

189
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's comics like a little lower</v>

190
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 5>down the totem pole than me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just happened to be performing at a</v>

191
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 5>night where there was a blog writer and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that goes viral and that becomes a whole</v>

192
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.393
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

193
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:55.921
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

194
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had some like viciously offensive</v>

195
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 5>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that,</v>

196
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

197
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a weird x factor to comedy.</v>

198
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about this recently too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>

199
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 5>I've got on stage and said horribly</v>
<v Speaker 5>heinous things,</v>

200
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's somebody who just got oozing.</v>

201
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 5>All is like the most benign jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the crowds too much.</v>

202
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.130
<v Speaker 5>I've said terrible things and those same</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are laughing.</v>

203
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.080
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a lot of that is a process.</v>

204
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 5>Not even talent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about very talented guys</v>

205
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 5>getting a weird reaction for something</v>
<v Speaker 5>not dirty or offensive at all.</v>

206
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.720
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

207
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 5>some people when you get on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is an organic thing where you</v>

208
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 5>don't like Kurt Metzger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's brilliant,</v>

209
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 5>brilliant comic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I honor his jokes are the testament</v>

210
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 5>to how good his jokes are is that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>kills because they don't like him when</v>

211
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 5>he gets on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like right away he just like,</v>

212
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just don't want to like um,</v>

213
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 5>a Mike Vecchio is on the great comic but</v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like a state trooper,</v>

214
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

215
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 5>So when he gets on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people are kind of like,</v>

216
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 5>who's this asshole?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For some reason I think when I get on</v>

217
00:09:58.111 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 5>stage people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

218
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 5>I want to like this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like my game to lose</v>

219
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 5>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's an intangible.</v>

220
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 5>It's something you could learn going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're an easy going looking guy.</v>

221
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 5>He looks like you're a guy that be fun</v>
<v Speaker 5>to hang around with,</v>

222
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.870
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

223
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 5>People actually think I'm much more</v>
<v Speaker 5>liberal than I even am with certain</v>

224
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

225
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm liberal overall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean like,</v>

226
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like I think people will be</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

227
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 5>I've had a lot of people might just pull</v>
<v Speaker 5>out coke in front of you start doing</v>

228
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 5>coke and I still get like a man that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>

229
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 5>That's why we get a reaction like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not a liberal thing though.</v>

230
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just A.</v>

231
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

235
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem when you're doing as</v>

237
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just recorded a comedy central</v>

238
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 5>special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were really just doing blow all</v>

239
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of that shit would get done.</v>

<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

241
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.710

00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 5>specials.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

243
00:10:56.581 --> 00:11:01.581

<v Speaker 5>they tested him when he was dead and he</v>

244
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 5>had coconut system and they'd said he'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>done some coke when he got married</v>

245
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.850

<v Speaker 5>he so good.</v>

323
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:15.030
<v Speaker 5>There's so many different levels of</v>
<v Speaker 5>standup,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and he's so good at the comedy of words.</v>

326
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.950
<v Speaker 5>That's what I've tried to learn from</v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

327
00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:25.460
<v Speaker 5>Just picking the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the one who got me on this last</v>

328
00:14:25.461 --> 00:14:28.550
<v Speaker 5>thing was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard a lot of the jokes already that</v>

329
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:29.301
<v Speaker 5>he did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

330
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:32.260
<v Speaker 5>and then he just goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this chick's down their club or in your</v>

331
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.203
<v Speaker 5>balls.</v>

332
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Clobbering such a great word to pick</v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

333
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Well he is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's deiced too,</v>

334
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.210
<v Speaker 2>so it's like you come to the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting that.</v>

335
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's its own thing.</v>

336
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.130
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Mitch Hedberg was sort of like</v>

337
00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Mitch Hedberg had a special thing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

338
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 2>you would hear his jokes and coming</v>

339
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 5>from him like you couldn't imagine them</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming from anybody else coming from</v>

340
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were hilarious and that's sort of</v>

341
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 5>the same with dice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like anybody else that would say that</v>

342
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

343
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 5>When he says that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just got that thing down and you</v>

344
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 5>know what that thing is when you go to</v>
<v Speaker 5>see him.</v>

345
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 5>I think every special starts with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>formula of like,</v>

346
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 5>so I'm doing this thing with some chick</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a place where it shouldn't be</v>

347
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 5>happening at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's weird.</v>

348

<v Speaker 5>I don't remember it honestly.</v>

356
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:47.140
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing about dice that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like about his act as opposed to</v>

357
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 5>everybody else's act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to know the jokes and you</v>

360
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:57.950
<v Speaker 5>thing where people would come to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

361
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.910
<v Speaker 5>What's in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking place?</v>

362
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 5>Inter rubbed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like killing the harder.</v>

363
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't kill any harder and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

365
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.760
<v Speaker 5>where you say it's rock and roll was in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rockford.</v>

366
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to go hear the band.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You love through the new songs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

369
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 5>If a band has a new science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trust sneaking in between hits</v>

370
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:22.890
<v Speaker 5>people like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the new trailer for the,</v>

579
00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.870

<v Speaker 5>comedies first ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mogul gas sort of.</v>

581
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.790
<v Speaker 5>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean for sure.</v>

582
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:06.780
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

583
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.760
<v Speaker 5>Who gives a fuck about first ever this</v>
<v Speaker 5>or that he's about to say.</v>

584
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:14.040
<v Speaker 5>But what other comedian was a mogul you</v>
<v Speaker 5>think was a real,</v>

585
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.690
<v Speaker 5>like Jerry Seinfeld running a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

586
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.750
<v Speaker 5>the branch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

587
00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:20.580
<v Speaker 5>Kim's got sneakers.</v>

588
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.890
<v Speaker 5>He's got Nike sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

589
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.761
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

590
00:25:23.761 --> 00:25:26.280
<v Speaker 5>I would assume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say he's the first.</v>

591
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.300
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's first of all the quickest ascent of</v>

592
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.270
<v Speaker 5>stardom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at him like to where he's</v>

593
00:25:33.271 --> 00:25:35.520
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where he's at.</v>

594
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's me and him,</v>

595
00:25:37.141 --> 00:25:40.080
<v Speaker 5>it's almost 18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long has he been famous for?</v>

596
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Household.</v>

597
00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:47.100
<v Speaker 5>He's been known from about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without exaggeration,</v>

598
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.310
<v Speaker 5>five years in [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was working like a lot,</v>

599
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.500
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't even move to New York.</v>

600
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 5>Me and him and Keith Robinson would go</v>
<v Speaker 5>up to New York every day and uh,</v>

601
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.640
<v Speaker 5>he never had to move to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He jumped right.</v>

602
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.350
<v Speaker 5>He got the Montreal festival,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got a pilot with Judd apatow and moved</v>

603
00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:09.210
<v Speaker 5>to La.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like overnight where he was in</v>

604
00:26:09.211 --> 00:26:10.770
<v Speaker 5>the business working,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making money,</v>

605
00:26:10.771 --> 00:26:11.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>surviving.</v>

606
00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:14.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there were peaks and valleys in</v>

607
00:26:14.371 --> 00:26:15.000
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

608
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.260
<v Speaker 5>I remember I did a show he hosted like</v>
<v Speaker 5>beatty's one mic stands,</v>

609
00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:21.930
<v Speaker 5>like a comic view season.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hosted that,</v>

610
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at that point I'd say he was still like</v>

611
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.040
<v Speaker 5>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in the black community.</v>

612
00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:26.874
<v Speaker 5>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

613
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.930
<v Speaker 5>soul plane and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'd say like a household name maybe</v>

614
00:26:30.931 --> 00:26:32.640
<v Speaker 5>like six or seven years now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

615
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.150
<v Speaker 5>so think about that international world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>famous gun from,</v>

616
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.350
<v Speaker 5>but six or seven years to like these</v>
<v Speaker 5>50,000,</v>

617
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.660
<v Speaker 5>60,000 seat arena.</v>

618
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.960
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't a um,</v>

619
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if he had any doubt in his mind</v>
<v Speaker 5>that data,</v>

620
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.280
<v Speaker 5>they would fill that fucking room</v>
<v Speaker 5>eagle,</v>

621
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 5>the Eagle stadium,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's from philly and everybody knew</v>

622
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.300
<v Speaker 5>it was like a big event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

623
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think uh,</v>

624
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 5>I think he knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it worked,</v>

625
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean he's got,</v>

626
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 5>he's got the production things where he</v>
<v Speaker 5>produces specials for other people.</v>

627
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 5>That's great and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know where a guy like that</v>

628
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:11.360
<v Speaker 5>has that kind of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it seems,</v>

629
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.650
<v Speaker 5>seems like I know how much I work and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

630
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy works like twice as much as me.</v>

631
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.910
<v Speaker 5>How's it going know where you find the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time to do this podcast?</v>

632
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 5>I mean really it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels like you're running around for</v>

633
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 5>UFC a ton and then it would have up.</v>

634
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the standup,</v>

635
00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:28.260
<v Speaker 5>is it night podcasts during the day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a real job.</v>

636
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 5>The UFC stuff like the stuff in studio</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I do like countdown shows and</v>

637
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only like once a month,</v>

638
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 5>the events,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not that often,</v>

639
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 5>twice a month,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three times a month at the maximum.</v>

640
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.600
<v Speaker 5>Then there's stand up in between.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not that hard.</v>

641
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.110
<v Speaker 5>It's just appears harder than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It appears like there's more going on in</v>

642
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:49.280
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know.</v>

643
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.740
<v Speaker 5>But if you're doing a television show or</v>
<v Speaker 5>even more so if you're doing a movie,</v>

644
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.940
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking gone for 16 hours a day</v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

645
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.080
<v Speaker 5>Committed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that that is the big.</v>

646
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 5>The big trap is the movie trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's awesome if you want to make</v>

647
00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 5>a shit ton of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is not nearly as fun as doing</v>

648
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 5>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

649
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think it be fun.</v>

650
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:09.911
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

651
00:28:09.911 --> 00:28:11.740
<v Speaker 5>I think in general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

652
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 5>it was never a reason why I got into</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>

653
00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:19.140
<v Speaker 5>which just takes too much time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the hold I did a scene a,</v>

654
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.790
<v Speaker 5>me and Doug Benson and Louis j Gomez did</v>
<v Speaker 5>a scene together for Jim Gaffigan show</v>

655
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:30.600
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a 15 second dream sequence he</v>

656
00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 5>has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if we were there,</v>

657
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:38.571
<v Speaker 5>I mean just the 15 second scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they shot it even like eight times.</v>

658
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.360
<v Speaker 5>How much filming that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were there for like nine hours,</v>

659
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.350
<v Speaker 5>nine hours that day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't do a thing.</v>

660
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.340
<v Speaker 5>Got there at like 4:30 in the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't do a thing until 8:30.</v>

661
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 5>And you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand the point of that.</v>

662
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 5>The laziest I ever got with my standup</v>
<v Speaker 5>was when I was doing news radio because</v>

663
00:28:57.241 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we first started out we were um,</v>

664
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.080
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of struggles in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning and when a show is trying to</v>

665
00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:05.210
<v Speaker 5>find its legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

666
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.360
<v Speaker 5>writing wise and story wise and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>networks notes versus the producer's</v>

667
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:11.340
<v Speaker 5>notes and all that shit has to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>worked out.</v>

668
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.800
<v Speaker 5>We were doing like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 5>13 hour days.</v>

669
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:18.490
<v Speaker 5>There were long ass days and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>was exhausted and I would just do no</v>

670
00:29:18.491 --> 00:29:21.750
<v Speaker 5>stand up or if I did something I would</v>
<v Speaker 5>do like a spot on the weekend and I</v>

671
00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 5>wasn't writing at all because I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>never going up.</v>

672
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.410
<v Speaker 5>I did a show for two seasons on IFC</v>
<v Speaker 5>channel and it was so like I was still</v>

673
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:34.470
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not established enough in my mind in the</v>

674
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:38.160
<v Speaker 5>clubs in New York that I would like</v>
<v Speaker 5>really it was a killing myself.</v>

675
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.420
<v Speaker 5>It was bad for her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was still doing standup and I</v>

676
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't go onto comedy central tool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was back when the show is ran on</v>

677
00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 5>the weekdays to like three in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>morning.</v>

678
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 5>So I'd be getting home at like 3:30 in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the morning and like sleeping til 5:30</v>

679
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:55.060
<v Speaker 5>in the morning going right to set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh I didn't do it every night I try to</v>

680
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:57.160
<v Speaker 5>pace it like to be every other night.</v>

681
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 5>So one that I'd go home and I'd fall</v>
<v Speaker 5>asleep like right after filming which</v>

682
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:02.080
<v Speaker 5>could be like 7:00 at night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

683
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.160
<v Speaker 5>and just pass out for the night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I try to pace it but I couldn't walk</v>

684
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 5>away from it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like especially in New York</v>

685
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 5>and they really let you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's someone waiting to take your</v>

686
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:13.540
<v Speaker 5>spot in a heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there is.</v>

687
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 5>And there are three comics thanked me</v>
<v Speaker 5>for being on the road so much now</v>

688
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 5>because it clears up some of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>weekends.</v>

689
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:19.531
<v Speaker 5>But you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

690
00:30:19.531 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was the show that you were doing?</v>

691
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.850
<v Speaker 5>It's called Xerox on the IFC channel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fun.</v>

692
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.133
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

693
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 5>they kind of let me have the reins as</v>
<v Speaker 5>far as like kind of telling them like</v>

694
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 5>what comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like stamps,</v>

695
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.370
<v Speaker 5>we should have like guest star on it.</v>

696
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 5>But what was the premise?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was about a band called [inaudible].</v>

697
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:40.690
<v Speaker 5>They were a real band at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

698
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just their story.</v>

699
00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:44.770
<v Speaker 5>They played like they try to become rock</v>
<v Speaker 5>stars at night,</v>

700
00:30:44.771 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 5>but during the day they would play kid's</v>
<v Speaker 5>parties,</v>

701
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.280
<v Speaker 5>like kids' birthday parties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a.</v>

702
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 5>So it was like a sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

703
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 5>it was a half hour show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a,</v>

704
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 5>what are they called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the single cameras,</v>

705
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:57.883
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

706
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.620
<v Speaker 5>Like Marin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

707
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.960
<v Speaker 5>And it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was fun because it was curb your</v>

708
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 5>enthusiasm style,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scripted outline only.</v>

709
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.640
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just make up your own lives.</v>

710
00:31:06.641 --> 00:31:08.940
<v Speaker 5>And they had a bunch of Maitland</v>
<v Speaker 5>caplets.</v>

711
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.520
<v Speaker 5>Patrice was on a few episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Geraldo got on a few episodes a why</v>

712
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.363
<v Speaker 5>didn't get them all?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

713
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:18.390
<v Speaker 5>but he was on a few episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Geoff Ralston and episode Kurt</v>

714
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.100
<v Speaker 5>Metzger rallies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

715
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.680
<v Speaker 5>it was pretty crazy.</v>

716
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 5>So tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

717
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 5>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Acting is fucking so great and I</v>

718
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 5>couldn't make up his own lines to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can People Watch those now?</v>

719
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.440
<v Speaker 5>The other one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazon.</v>

720
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 5>What's again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Xerox.</v>

721
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 5>Xerox.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fun show.</v>

722
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:34.204
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

723
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.280
<v Speaker 5>it was a little ambitious too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said before,</v>

724
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:39.700
<v Speaker 5>these guys were mostly read at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>director of production team is mostly</v>

725
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 5>reality show guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

726
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 5>you would think that doing a show like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that with a bunch of comics completely</v>

727
00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 5>ad Lib style curby enthusiasm style is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>great idea.</v>

728
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.970
<v Speaker 5>You know what guys like Joey Diaz or it</v>
<v Speaker 5>did well in the show actually did very</v>

729
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just like it was arguments between</v>

730
00:31:57.461 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Speaker 5>the production and the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>network.</v>

731
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See it's always that way,</v>

732
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:04.670
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's everything I've ever done that's on</v>

733
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 5>television.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's been some arguments between the</v>

734
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:09.870
<v Speaker 5>production and the network and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>always weird shit later.</v>

735
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.750
<v Speaker 5>Like why can't we have coke cans sitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>facing camera on the show and was like,</v>

736
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 5>when I was on news radio is infuriating</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you would watch these guys come</v>

737
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:23.890
<v Speaker 5>up with these ideas about like we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to bring in a love interest who</v>

738
00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 5>want to do this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the writers would get so pissed off</v>

739
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 5>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

740
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.370
<v Speaker 5>this is a really good show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

741
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:34.720
<v Speaker 5>the fucking problem is you guys keep</v>
<v Speaker 5>moving it from time slot to time slot,</v>

742
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 5>but then the network is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

743
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do this or we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that and we're going to bring a hot</v>

744
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 5>girl and we're going to bring in a hot</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy and we're going to.</v>

745
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 5>It was just so goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so goofy to watch all these different</v>

746
00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 5>people battle in a lot of the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are putting in the input.</v>

747
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 5>They're not professional creative</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

748
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.480
<v Speaker 5>They're executives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

749
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 5>And then they have to take those notes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seriously.</v>

750
00:32:56.031 --> 00:32:56.864
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

751
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:02.470
<v Speaker 5>I used to get a note a bunch better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pilot that I wrote my stop pitching it</v>

752
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:05.010
<v Speaker 5>even because it was just getting so</v>
<v Speaker 5>frustrated with my.</v>

753
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 5>We definitely wrote like a funny thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>right here,</v>

754
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:13.060
<v Speaker 5>me and to me and Lewis and Dave actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>we wrote a funny thing that can be maybe</v>

755
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 5>stretched to movie length or a pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked it as a pilot.</v>

756
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 5>It was something to live in a world of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like true stories that I have.</v>

757
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 5>Cause I said I used to do a job ironic</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the xerox story,</v>

758
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.760
<v Speaker 5>but a real job where I drove strippers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>escorts around at night to gigs and then</v>

759
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.420
<v Speaker 5>during the day the same company was I'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>go dressed as like elmo to a kid's</v>

760
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:35.720
<v Speaker 5>birthday party,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it existed in that world.</v>

761
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 5>We were a really funny thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just start saying things like</v>

762
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.630
<v Speaker 5>having a strong female lead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

763
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:44.510
<v Speaker 5>just fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I promise you there's women in the show.</v>

764
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.160
<v Speaker 5>What about diversity?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big J.</v>

765
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:46.881
<v Speaker 5>just like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

766
00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:48.420
<v Speaker 5>it's like one of the friends black or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

767
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.380
<v Speaker 5>The most important thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big So ridiculous.</v>

768
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 5>Every body has to be completely and</v>
<v Speaker 5>unique.</v>

769
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's a black show,</v>

770
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 5>you have to have a wacky way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

771
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.583
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

772
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.010
<v Speaker 5>Those kinds of conversations are very</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird because there's nothing wrong with</v>

773
00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 5>having a strong female lead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's what you wrote.</v>

774
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoever the person is,</v>

775
00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:11.240
<v Speaker 5>it's writing it or the group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to leave them to their own</v>

776
00:34:11.241 --> 00:34:13.280
<v Speaker 5>creative visions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as you start saying,</v>

777
00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:15.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's have a black guy do this,</v>

778
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:18.980
<v Speaker 5>so let's make this a Chinese lady like</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop.</v>

779
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.880
<v Speaker 5>If you have a really funny person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like leading the charge,</v>

780
00:34:22.881 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 5>like a comic who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wrote something and they have a</v>

781
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:29.750
<v Speaker 5>picture in their head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of the confidence I've tried</v>

782
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:34.751
<v Speaker 5>to build and stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I feel like if I say it like I'm</v>

783
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.040
<v Speaker 5>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to make myself laugh first</v>

784
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 5>and foremost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I say it,</v>

785
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 5>I think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's funny,</v>

786
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that I just like didn't convey</v>

787
00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 5>it to you the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

788
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 5>you didn't get it fully or you're being</v>
<v Speaker 5>tight.</v>

789
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:48.560
<v Speaker 5>Asked about some other reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

790
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:51.230
<v Speaker 5>So it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they don't put that kind of faith</v>

791
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:53.320
<v Speaker 5>like the networks never put that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>faith in the complicated gill.</v>

792
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 5>If you make my vision with how I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 5>this in my head,</v>

793
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.720
<v Speaker 5>if you give me the tools to create it</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way I see my head,</v>

794
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.950
<v Speaker 5>it will be funny.</v>

795
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.220
<v Speaker 5>I think with day worry about is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences of anything that you might</v>

796
00:35:06.981 --> 00:35:09.900
<v Speaker 5>do that could fuck their career up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

797
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.460
<v Speaker 5>Green light a show and you go off the</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep end with something completely</v>

798
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes social justice warrior news,</v>

799
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.680
<v Speaker 5>but you're one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

800
00:35:18.681 --> 00:35:19.160
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

801
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 5>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know something's good fast.</v>

802
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:22.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about just someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly me out of the picture.</v>

803
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.040
<v Speaker 5>Just if you trust and someone that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>genuinely funny,</v>

804
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you let Dave attell make,</v>

805
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.610
<v Speaker 5>given the endless funds to make whatever</v>
<v Speaker 5>his vision is,</v>

806
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.620
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

807
00:35:33.621 --> 00:35:35.080
<v Speaker 5>that's what Louie did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

808
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's his show was exactly</v>

809
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he directs it,</v>

810
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 2>produces it and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was editing it all on his fucking</v>

811
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:44.790
<v Speaker 2>laptop in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he kept doing it that</v>

812
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's as Christ,</v>

813
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 2>but that's why it was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

814
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a single vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from his mind and so like the dice</v>

815
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:55.470
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>louise got the Louis thing and you know</v>

816
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 2>what to expect when you go into watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Louis thing,</v>

817
00:35:57.601 --> 00:36:01.080
<v Speaker 2>so it makes it even more funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows exactly how to do it and when</v>

818
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:04.200
<v Speaker 2>you watch that show that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so clear that that's right out of</v>

819
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 2>his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's his perfect presentation of what</v>

820
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 2>his thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's never.</v>

821
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.460
<v Speaker 2>That's such a rare story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Rare.</v>

822
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.030
<v Speaker 2>It's super rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why television is not going</v>

823
00:36:14.031 --> 00:36:16.110
<v Speaker 2>to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not going to make it.</v>

824
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:19.830
<v Speaker 2>If it keeps going this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the only people that are doing</v>

825
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:19.950
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

826
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like comedy central.</v>

827
00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Take some crazy fucking chances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take crazy chances with their</v>

828
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 2>roasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a roast battle last night.</v>

829
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.420
<v Speaker 2>They took grazie chances with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is a raw buck wild comedy</v>

<v Speaker 2>And comedy central apparently is going</v>

832
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.490
<v Speaker 2>to air it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was downstairs last night from that</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>crush.</v>

839
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A person can't crush any harder.</v>

840
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.750
<v Speaker 2>He hit every note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like it was scripted.</v>

841
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was adlibs that were</v>

844
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.740
<v Speaker 2>He threw water all over his head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>threw the water under the crowd.</v>

849
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I judged a few weeks ago,</v>

850
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:25.350
<v Speaker 2>he came out and did the trip go triple h</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrance.</v>

851
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:30.250
<v Speaker 2>He came out and like ran to the audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and climate on tables and water and</v>

852
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.270
<v Speaker 2>threw it in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madman.</v>

853
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking madman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he'd beat up on Jesse Joyce,</v>

854
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 2>who has to help me write jokes for at</v>
<v Speaker 2>midnight tonight.</v>

855
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just joyce is really funny.</v>

856
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Jesse crushed him out of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesse crushed him out of the box.</v>

857
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 2>The first one was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is a joke about him opening up for</v>

858
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Rob Schneider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then earl just opened them up and</v>

859
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:51.900
<v Speaker 2>fucked his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

860
00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just smashed him.</v>

861
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so much fun though.</v>

862
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>It was Dane Cook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Lee,</v>

863
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 2>me and Jimmy Kimmel was there too.</v>

864
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.840
<v Speaker 2>He didn't judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was like in.</v>

865
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.230
<v Speaker 2>They gave him a microphone and Jeff Ross</v>
<v Speaker 2>running the whole thing and Brian Moses,</v>

866
00:38:10.231 --> 00:38:12.650
<v Speaker 2>who the perfect host for that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

867
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Speaker 2>that's a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she could show me grow waves.</v>

868
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

869
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.420
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything about that show.</v>

870
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.710
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>

871
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.330
<v Speaker 2>It's the most wild show in all of La</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a version of New York</v>

872
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.040
<v Speaker 2>caught a roastmaster is at Lewis hosts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

873
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like sanctions sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrong word,</v>

874
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:34.011
<v Speaker 2>but like Jeff Ross signs off on that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they run it in like New York for</v>

875
00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:35.304
<v Speaker 2>some reason.</v>

876
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 5>Some great rose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some great writing,</v>

877
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:43.171
<v Speaker 5>like amazing actual battles talent wise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it is missing that thing that like</v>

878
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:45.791
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

879
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

880
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 5>just the insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the noises.</v>

881
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean they have a Dj and he does his</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

882
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that room,</v>

883
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.750
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like A.</v>

884
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you guys know for sure.</v>

885
00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 5>But it's also like everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's just so in tune with it.</v>

886
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not talking about that last</v>
<v Speaker 5>night,</v>

887
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

888
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 5>when was it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget who it was with somebody.</v>

889
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 5>Somebody crushed so hard that I was Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ross and I were clinging to each other.</v>

890
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 5>We're clinging to each other because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>joke was so fucking brutal.</v>

891
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to butcher the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The suicide job.</v>

892
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.940
<v Speaker 5>It was so goddamn brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were like hanging on to each other.</v>

893
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 5>Like this is the only sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment where that would be even</v>

894
00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:24.340
<v Speaker 5>justified because everybody's completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>smushed in there.</v>

895
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 5>The belly room at the comedy store is</v>
<v Speaker 5>only supposed to seat 70 people.</v>

896
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:34.050
<v Speaker 5>They get 100 in their shoes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's smashed in like this.</v>

897
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:35.950
<v Speaker 5>And when everybody is smashed in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this is.</v>

898
00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 5>So there's doors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's four different ways to get out.</v>

899
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like a trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because like literally four different</v>

900
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 5>exits to Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an easy room to get out of.</v>

901
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 5>So it's not dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's so intimate that when people</v>

902
00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 5>laugh and they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

903
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:52.870
<v Speaker 5>like the people behind you a high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's high fiving,</v>

904
00:39:52.871 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 5>everybody all squished in together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People like slapping people in the head</v>

905
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.430
<v Speaker 5>and then when they're doing it in New</v>
<v Speaker 5>York,</v>

906
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.830
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be the grammercy theater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is not intimate.</v>

907
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can't do that all.</v>

908
00:40:04.281 --> 00:40:06.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious to see how that goes.</v>

909
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.190
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Jeff's doing that.</v>

910
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 5>Jeff's version of it.</v>

911
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why didn't they do know the one in New</v>

912
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:15.821
<v Speaker 5>York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the show they do.</v>

913
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 5>The biweekly show is actually is at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>stand.</v>

914
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.960
<v Speaker 5>That's actually a good room for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

915
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.010
<v Speaker 5>it's really small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the one and uh,</v>

916
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.360
<v Speaker 5>but the one for tv they're doing at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>gramercy theater and that's.</v>

917
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.100
<v Speaker 5>They always wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They always want to take something</v>

918
00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:33.040
<v Speaker 5>that's awesome when it's intimate and</v>
<v Speaker 5>move it into a big giant place.</v>

919
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 5>The seller would be great for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

920
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.850
<v Speaker 5>or even like they have the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a room or in the corner now to village</v>

924
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.780
<v Speaker 5>That looks like a very cool role and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good size stage to walk around on.</v>

925
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.010
<v Speaker 5>It's very wide and long and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically recreated the cellar down</v>

926
00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just a bigger room.</v>

927
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like 200 people maybe.</v>

928
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.091
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

929

<v Speaker 5>Same.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get back there.</v>

933
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 5>That stage looked amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the setup of perfect.</v>

934
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:06.231
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

936
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.450
<v Speaker 5>No Shit.</v>

937
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:14.740
<v Speaker 5>thing he's doing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

942
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.620
<v Speaker 5>I got to check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Check it out through their live podcasts</v>

943
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.081
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

944
00:41:26.081 --> 00:41:26.914
<v Speaker 5>they do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

945
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know they did it live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just did one recently.</v>

946
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 5>It was there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>been so stressed for a show in life.</v>

947
00:41:33.381 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 5>They had four girl calm.</v>

948
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't like turning over control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like having control in the comedic</v>

949
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 5>situations and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we performed five minutes.</v>

950
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 5>It was like five or six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six of us.</v>

951
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 5>And then for girl comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just straight off your comedy,</v>

952
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:50.070
<v Speaker 5>would they fuck you or not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>

953
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

954
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with comments about it.</v>

955
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:53.000
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hated it.</v>

956
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.401
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did well.</v>

957
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:56.570
<v Speaker 5>I did fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was like A.</v>

958
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm actually hasn't worked out good for</v>
<v Speaker 5>me really.</v>

959
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:01.070
<v Speaker 5>But like going into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

960
00:42:01.071 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 5>I did not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't felt that in a while where</v>

961
00:42:03.261 --> 00:42:04.970
<v Speaker 5>it's at now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess every night we're being judged,</v>

962
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 5>but like you do stand behind your wall</v>
<v Speaker 5>of comedy.</v>

963
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:09.650
<v Speaker 5>This just seems like they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me if they'd fucked me or not.</v>

964
00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:12.140
<v Speaker 5>Like no matter what my comedy was on</v>
<v Speaker 5>pure looks,</v>

965
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting.</v>

966
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.490
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't be something that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do with a woman.</v>

967
00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the joke of it,</v>

968
00:42:19.151 --> 00:42:19.920
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

969
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.860
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd be there.</v>

970
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.200
<v Speaker 5>Your blogs would be rolling.</v>

971
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's acknowledging that there's some</v>

972
00:42:24.571 --> 00:42:27.240
<v Speaker 2>sort of an imbalance in their approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

973
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:31.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they don't want you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>insult them and be sexist.</v>

974
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.050
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want the exclusive right to do</v>

975
00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.490
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I say they,</v>

976
00:42:35.491 --> 00:42:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean only people that think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you if you don't think that way,</v>

977
00:42:39.031 --> 00:42:40.770
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people that think that's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

978
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 2>It's cool as shit on a guy and and knock</v>
<v Speaker 2>you down by your looks and your five</v>

979
00:42:45.811 --> 00:42:47.850
<v Speaker 2>minutes of material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a woman did that,</v>

980
00:42:47.851 --> 00:42:52.020
<v Speaker 2>like if you had a woman get on stage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell a joke and a bunch of guys like you</v>

981
00:42:52.021 --> 00:42:54.360
<v Speaker 2>and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting around deciding whether or</v>

982
00:42:54.361 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 2>not we would fuck this girl based on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny her jokes were.</v>

983
00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.740
<v Speaker 2>There'll be brutal show.</v>

984
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it's funny that the nerves have a</v>

985
00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:06.320
<v Speaker 5>show like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that like if it got into some kind of</v>

986
00:43:06.321 --> 00:43:06.890
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

987
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.230
<v Speaker 5>wit battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that they wouldn't say funny things</v>

988
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 5>are shit on me in a funny way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like I could probably be</v>

989
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:15.400
<v Speaker 5>meaner</v>
<v Speaker 5>and probably make them more upset than</v>

990
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.270
<v Speaker 5>they can make me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

991
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 5>you also have a lot more experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More like what would that kind of thing,</v>

992
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:19.830
<v Speaker 5>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

993
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you should always just kind of like,</v>

994
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it gets to the core of like,</v>

995
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:25.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making a woman pretty upset if you want</v>

996
00:43:25.751 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 5>to go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

997
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.610
<v Speaker 5>And they with us also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just saying for some reason like</v>

998
00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.010
<v Speaker 5>were just a little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not always,</v>

999
00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:32.600
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like just a little thicker</v>
<v Speaker 5>skin.</v>

1000
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 5>So just having the kind of take</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1001
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.180
<v Speaker 5>And there was the comments like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a fun show the other day,</v>

1002
00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:40.430
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to take the show down</v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

1003
00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:42.770
<v Speaker 5>I love rich and body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1011
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:30.344
<v Speaker 5>that's why the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1032
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:35.450
<v Speaker 5>the lack of control I meant was that</v>
<v Speaker 5>like almost I have to keep my own</v>

1033
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:37.870
<v Speaker 5>control myself and you're like I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>want this to get where I don't have the</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's just going to get ugly and I think</v>

1037
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.330
<v Speaker 5>are actually fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He actually got a weird,</v>

1038
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.420
<v Speaker 5>was one of the judges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it wasn't like super bad,</v>

1039
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 5>but like she added the gates was going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to say no because like they just had</v>

1040
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 5>such a weird back and forth.</v>

1041
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they knew each other already.</v>

1042
00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:58.411
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We knew all.</v>

1043
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 5>I knew all four girls but have been</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1044
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:02.430
<v Speaker 5>even though I know them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a still a thing.</v>

1045
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:05.460
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't cross a certain line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1046
00:45:05.461 --> 00:45:07.140
<v Speaker 5>Like there's certain things you can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>say.</v>

1047
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's one of the weird things</v>

1048
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 5>about roast battles in general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at least with rose petals are doing</v>

1049
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 5>it back and forth to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This seems like you have to do your</v>

1050
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:17.190
<v Speaker 5>standup and then they shit on you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1051
00:45:17.191 --> 00:45:20.040
<v Speaker 5>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really can't ship back too much.</v>

1052
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:22.680
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean not as bad as you would.</v>

1053
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 5>I guess what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You always have to be like Kinda like</v>

1054
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.780
<v Speaker 5>keep control over yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Made a good point in that it's a</v>

1055
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 5>controlled environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1056
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 5>so kate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what you do,</v>

1057
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.080
<v Speaker 5>they set up these artificial time limits</v>
<v Speaker 5>and rules.</v>

1058
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.390
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The artificial thing being not by</v>

1059
00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:37.240
<v Speaker 5>artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1060
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:42.340
<v Speaker 5>they just decided five minutes stand up</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the girls get to decide and</v>

1061
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:46.320
<v Speaker 5>then they talk like this is the rules</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the game and they set up but well,</v>

1062
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 5>what is that then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because really what you would do is you</v>

1063
00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:52.910
<v Speaker 5>would just play it out as long as it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>entertaining and if you were just going</v>

1064
00:45:52.911 --> 00:45:55.740
<v Speaker 5>to play it out as long as it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>entertaining and give you a microphone</v>

1065
00:45:55.741 --> 00:45:57.300
<v Speaker 5>and give her a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they did.</v>

1066
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:59.160
<v Speaker 5>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I had a microphone for sure.</v>

1067
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:02.280
<v Speaker 5>I had listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's options there to just haul if,</v>

1068
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they shit on you,</v>

1069
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 5>you could definitely haul off on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it's a position where</v>

1070
00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:12.930
<v Speaker 5>it's like it's almost asking for you to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get made fun of and then you're just</v>

1071
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:14.070
<v Speaker 5>kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well alright.</v>

1072
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 5>But I really can't make fun of them back</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way I would make fun of them.</v>

1073
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I dunno.</v>

1074
00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 5>I guess I could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just kinda like these four girls</v>

1075
00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:23.730
<v Speaker 5>who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1076
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 5>quote unquote friends for the most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them closer than others,</v>

1077
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 5>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want them to be all upset them.</v>

1078
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.030
<v Speaker 5>They'll say whatever they want to be and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll let it roll off and who gives a</v>

1079
00:46:33.031 --> 00:46:33.864
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1080
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.400
<v Speaker 5>if it stings for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it stings.</v>

1081
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:38.370
<v Speaker 5>But like these are phone calls later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1082
00:46:38.371 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 5>Where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1083
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 5>well why would you bring that up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That the thing you know about me?</v>

1084
00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:42.751
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1085
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 5>I thought we were swinging for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fences.</v>

1086
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1087
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a,</v>

1088
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.820
<v Speaker 5>it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1089
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.550
<v Speaker 5>you're playing a game and it's a fun</v>
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>

1090
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it is.</v>

1091
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>

1092
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 5>it is kind of weird that you could never</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it with a bunch of men judging women.</v>

1093
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:00.551
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1094
00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:01.384
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will be.</v>

1095
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>

1096
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.020
<v Speaker 5>you probably could do it 50 years ago if</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1097
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.600
<v Speaker 5>if he could probably do it today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1098
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.780
<v Speaker 5>you know that Mike favor man story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1099
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:14.070
<v Speaker 5>If you flip that story around just the</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy girl roles in that one that goes</v>

1100
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 5>like it goes nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>

1101
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:17.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one gives a fuck.</v>

1102
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.470
<v Speaker 5>Girls could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1103
00:47:19.471 --> 00:47:21.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>girls can make fun of a lot of things</v>

1104
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Speaker 5>about a guy and it's totally different</v>
<v Speaker 5>than the guy doing it about a girl.</v>

1105
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.540
<v Speaker 5>I've got all my newest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few jokes since special are rooted in</v>

1106
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 5>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like women,</v>

1107
00:47:33.191 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1108
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.751
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm all,</v>

1109
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:37.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm so pro women as far as the equal</v>
<v Speaker 5>pay.</v>

1110
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 5>And I said everything that they want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly do in the world,</v>

1111
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.910
<v Speaker 5>achieve all your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like a dude,</v>

1112
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like manhood is being stripped down</v>

1113
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 5>big time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1114
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the example I use,</v>

1115
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:56.190
<v Speaker 5>it all came up from a speaking to my</v>
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend and my buddy about UFC.</v>

1116
00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 5>It was a conversation with the three of</v>
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

1117
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 5>I never knew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My chick thought this way.</v>

1118
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.710
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing,</v>

1119
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 5>but the UFC guys house together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did that whole documentary about</v>

1120
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 5>the domestic abuse problems running</v>
<v Speaker 5>through now and my girlfriend goes,</v>

1121
00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never want to date a guy like</v>

1122
00:48:13.001 --> 00:48:14.110
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if he could just like,</v>

1123
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 5>lose control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he just beat the shit out of you</v>

1124
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.010
<v Speaker 5>and it's like I could beat the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of you.</v>

1125
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 5>Control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>

1126
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.160
<v Speaker 5>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think that I can't do that?</v>

1127
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Like why would you say that to me in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of the friendly.</v>

1128
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.720
<v Speaker 5>Of course they can beat the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1129
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:30.721
<v Speaker 5>I just don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she thinks she's at.</v>

1130
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.590
<v Speaker 5>She would have a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1131
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:33.720
<v Speaker 5>I think there really isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>affect.</v>

1132
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just dumb guys.</v>

1133
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Reagan used to have that great fucking</v>

1134
00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:38.840
<v Speaker 5>joke by the commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1135
00:48:38.841 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 5>And then the guy's like stuck in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mini blinds.</v>

1136
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:43.480
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you work this crazy thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1137
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.790
<v Speaker 5>my husband's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I have pop tarts.</v>

1138
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 5>Joker ethic isn't like you really think</v>
<v Speaker 5>that manhood is being torn down though?</v>

1139
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 5>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1140
00:48:56.471 --> 00:48:58.990
<v Speaker 5>I think masculinity is like attacked</v>
<v Speaker 5>more than anything.</v>

1141
00:48:58.991 --> 00:48:59.440
<v Speaker 5>Probably.</v>

1142
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's effective.</v>

1143
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I think that I don't think it's having</v>
<v Speaker 2>an effect on whether or not things are</v>

1144
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:09.190
<v Speaker 2>still masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real problematic for two reasons.</v>

1145
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:12.700
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's okay to be really feminine,</v>

1146
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.540
<v Speaker 2>so if it's okay to be really feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it not okay to be masculine?</v>

1147
00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>being masculine and being rude,</v>

1148
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.150
<v Speaker 2>being mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being homophobic,</v>

1149
00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:24.520
<v Speaker 2>but they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be.</v>

1150
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.653
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1151
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying,</v>

1152
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.080
<v Speaker 2>but they are in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm saying though.</v>

1153
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:33.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like being pretty and feminine</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean you're a cunt who stuck up.</v>

1154
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those get lumped together too sometimes</v>

1155
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:38.290
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just dummies and it's the</v>

1156
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 2>same dummies that are attacking</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity for just being masculine.</v>

1157
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Like here's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is this crazy fucking phrase that</v>

1158
00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.690
<v Speaker 2>these dummies like to throw around</v>
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>

1159
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Regressive left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like to throw around this phrase,</v>

1160
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.960
<v Speaker 2>toxic masculinity and they're blaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>toxic masculinity on this guy.</v>

1161
00:49:56.081 --> 00:50:01.081
<v Speaker 2>Shooting up that gay crowd in Orlando.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was this article and they were</v>

1162
00:50:02.441 --> 00:50:04.720
<v Speaker 2>using the term toxic masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's first of all,</v>

1163
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.790
<v Speaker 2>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1164
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>there's no amount of being masculine</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you toxic.</v>

1165
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:10.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1166
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:12.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a shitty,</v>

1167
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 2>nasty person has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity.</v>

1168
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 2>If you're an evil person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it happens at mass shooters</v>

1169
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.760
<v Speaker 2>are almost exclusively men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:27.190
<v Speaker 2>But that's not toxic masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking psychopath.</v>

1171
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with masculine or</v>

1172
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:32.410
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not gender determined.</v>

1173
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.380
<v Speaker 2>That guy was already chemically off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he was like a,</v>

1174
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a repressed homosexual by all accounts.</v>

1175
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you can't.</v>

1176
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

1177
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.160
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing to do with masculinity.</v>

1178
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:45.970
<v Speaker 2>So was the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it la apparently the guy that</v>

1179
00:50:45.971 --> 00:50:48.620
<v Speaker 2>they caught in la who had one of his way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the explosives.</v>

1180
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an arsenal in his car.</v>

1181
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.380
<v Speaker 2>They caught him on his way to the gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>pride parade.</v>

1182
00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he is allegedly bisexual as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1183
00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a pride parade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy fucks out there in this world and</v>

1184
00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:05.720
<v Speaker 2>to start breaking it down by gender or</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity and femininity,</v>

1185
00:51:05.721 --> 00:51:08.330
<v Speaker 2>it smacks to me of like some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ulterior motive.</v>

1186
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.230
<v Speaker 2>And I always feel like the ulterior</v>
<v Speaker 2>motive when you see these guys were</v>

1187
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.790
<v Speaker 2>writing these articles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're weak people,</v>

1188
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like powerful forces of</v>

1189
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.810
<v Speaker 2>genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weak people and I think a lot of</v>

1190
00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:25.811
<v Speaker 2>times weak people they want in some way</v>
<v Speaker 2>or another to even the playing field in</v>

1191
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:31.190
<v Speaker 2>one way to do that is by pulling down</v>
<v Speaker 2>examples of masculinity that they can't</v>

1192
00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:32.210
<v Speaker 2>possibly approach.</v>

1193
00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:32.901
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1194
00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a type of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly who stands behind the feminist</v>

1195
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really like vehemently like</v>

1196
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 2>bitching at some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1197
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 2>It's called virtue signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gets that man.</v>

1198
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:45.430
<v Speaker 2>If you like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1199
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.870
<v Speaker 2>a joke or something that you say were</v>
<v Speaker 2>you included were like,</v>

1200
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:53.290
<v Speaker 2>oh these dinky broads over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go broads really brilliant.</v>

1201
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1202
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>

1203
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get Outta here.</v>

1204
00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're doing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the virtue signaling phrase that</v>

1205
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Michael Shermer uses is a great one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got this interesting point of view</v>

1206
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is like what they're doing is they're</v>

1207
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:10.820
<v Speaker 2>just trying to let everybody know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more ethical than you.</v>

1208
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.180
<v Speaker 2>They're more moral than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a better person than you look at</v>

1209
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:14.781
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at me.</v>

1210
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1211
00:52:15.801 --> 00:52:18.410
<v Speaker 2>It turns it on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just looking for.</v>

1212
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Even if they don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably don't even know whether or</v>

1213
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:24.680
<v Speaker 2>not it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just know that it's an effective</v>

1214
00:52:24.681 --> 00:52:28.280
<v Speaker 2>stance to take to look like a super</v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive person.</v>

1215
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 2>So you just go after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go after the hardest levels of it.</v>

1216
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people like that.</v>

1217
00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:37.400
<v Speaker 2>These days they're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because of social media.</v>

1218
00:52:37.401 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 2>It's given morons and opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>blurt out and to get reactions from</v>

1219
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 2>their blurt outs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they haven't really thought them</v>

1220
00:52:43.881 --> 00:52:48.560
<v Speaker 2>through and they're almost always</v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusively insulting and mean and</v>

1221
00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:50.630
<v Speaker 2>nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these people that are trying to</v>

1222
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.910
<v Speaker 2>proclaim their virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't even like argue a point while</v>

1223
00:52:55.911 --> 00:53:00.911
<v Speaker 2>being just a decent human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even like say what you feel</v>

1224
00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:04.700
<v Speaker 2>about something without being some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an insulting,</v>

1225
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.500
<v Speaker 2>like nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>condescending,</v>

1226
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.890
<v Speaker 2>defining that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Define you like big Jay.</v>

1227
00:53:09.891 --> 00:53:12.900
<v Speaker 2>You're a sexist piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Tj,</v>

1228
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I said the same thing where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.700
<v Speaker 2>clap for handicapped people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1230
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:19.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like it's the same like,</v>

1231
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:21.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to feel a certain way</v>

1232
00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:24.380
<v Speaker 2>about something and it's always attacked</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever it is.</v>

1233
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.410
<v Speaker 2>It's what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1234
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:26.244
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1235
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 5>am I getting that wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1236
00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 5>I think we're both too high for this</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation,</v>

1237
00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 5>but I know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just it's,</v>

1238
00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.860
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some sort of like dishonest</v>

1239
00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:39.690
<v Speaker 5>communication that's happening with some</v>
<v Speaker 5>of this.</v>

1240
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of the outreach is not</v>
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

1241
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 5>I think what a lot of it is they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>acting outraged because they know they</v>

1242
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:49.650
<v Speaker 5>can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course it's not balanced and it's</v>

1243
00:53:49.651 --> 00:53:52.260
<v Speaker 5>also what I'm saying is it's really</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty and insulting.</v>

1244
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.160
<v Speaker 5>Like when you get to a point of view on</v>
<v Speaker 5>something and there'll be really shitty</v>

1245
00:53:56.161 --> 00:53:58.800
<v Speaker 5>and insulting about you and your point</v>
<v Speaker 5>of view,</v>

1246
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:04.010
<v Speaker 5>like an intelligent rational person</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's examining the thoughts and words</v>

1247
00:54:04.381 --> 00:54:06.780
<v Speaker 5>of someone that they're not involved in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a conversation where they come to you</v>

1248
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:09.200
<v Speaker 5>and say like only a racist would say</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1249
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 5>They define you and some sort of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1250
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:16.170
<v Speaker 5>If you have a point of view that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like they can attack or you start</v>

1251
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:19.410
<v Speaker 5>with that one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd say if you say a a bad neighborhood</v>

1252
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.080
<v Speaker 5>or even black people know you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about a black neighborhood,</v>

1253
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 5>that's a racist to say it's like as</v>
<v Speaker 5>black people,</v>

1254
00:54:25.021 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 5>if that's a racist thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just kind of a thing,</v>

1255
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:27.984
<v Speaker 5>but it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's never.</v>

1256
00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.510
<v Speaker 5>I've never been called racist or or</v>
<v Speaker 5>massages.</v>

1257
00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.260
<v Speaker 5>Massages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been called by a woman before but</v>

1258
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.110
<v Speaker 5>never been called racist by any one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>color of any sort.</v>

1259
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:39.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>congratulations on that as well.</v>

1260
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:42.900
<v Speaker 5>So you've got four flux use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not a racist.</v>

1261
00:54:42.901 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 5>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1301
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 5>We used,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and Kurt used to do a Gig in</v>

1302
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 5>affiliate was where you could do comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>once in a while at a burlesque place</v>

1303
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:34.660
<v Speaker 5>called the five spot for less like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>leg.</v>

1330
00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.350
<v Speaker 5>because it's about to go to a nude beach</v>
<v Speaker 5>and look at it as like for me and Jeff</v>

1331
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:53.770
<v Speaker 5>Ross were in Australia and we were just</v>
<v Speaker 5>staring at the topless girls on the</v>

1332
00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:55.120
<v Speaker 5>beach and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1333
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:56.040
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1334
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 5>it's very common here to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not a big deal.</v>

1335
00:57:58.331 --> 00:57:58.721
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

00:57:58.721 --> 00:58:02.020
<v Speaker 5>it's not coming from me and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to stare at this girl's tits for awhile.</v>

1337
00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.750
<v Speaker 5>Like I think it's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She has them out.</v>

1338
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:08.350
<v Speaker 5>Who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you would you stare at someone if</v>

1339
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.760
<v Speaker 5>they had clothes on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1340
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:13.510
<v Speaker 5>and I don't stare in a sense the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1341
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a girl was wearing jeans that a great</v>

1342
00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:18.280
<v Speaker 5>ass and I like moments to take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1343
00:58:18.281 --> 00:58:19.620
<v Speaker 5>to pick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to look at her ass shit.</v>

1344
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.040
<v Speaker 5>If she knew that you were staring at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1345
00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:23.590
<v Speaker 5>where you avert your gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never thought that.</v>

1346
00:58:23.591 --> 00:58:24.011
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1347
00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:25.780
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never thought,</v>

1348
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was being like the girls who had their</v>

1349
00:58:29.771 --> 00:58:32.530
<v Speaker 5>pussies that I think they think like</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought that I was staring at them.</v>

1350
00:58:32.531 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to be as tactful as</v>
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>

1351
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:37.780
<v Speaker 5>You being slick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was constantly looking and enough</v>

1352
00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:40.870
<v Speaker 5>so that like I couldn't be slick enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess that they figured it out.</v>

1353
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you just have like a,</v>

1354
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 5>a quick scan of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one thing.</v>

1355
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 5>But if you keep looking in the general</v>
<v Speaker 5>direction of naked people,</v>

1356
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:51.940
<v Speaker 5>even if you looking over their shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to know what you're doing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Remember when John Candy was a kid,</v>

1359
00:58:58.391 --> 00:59:01.570
<v Speaker 5>like dropping the quarters to look up</v>
<v Speaker 5>skirts and shit.</v>

1360
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was his big thing to draw who</v>

1361
00:59:04.151 --> 00:59:07.630
<v Speaker 5>dropped by quarters and then go down and</v>
<v Speaker 5>look up scrutinized clash with Tom Hanks</v>

<v Speaker 5>Daryl Hannah.</v>

1363
00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:10.540
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>

1364
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never did like a obnoxious,</v>

1365
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:15.650
<v Speaker 5>like look up a girl's skirt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like getting on the ground or pick</v>

1366
00:59:15.651 --> 00:59:18.060
<v Speaker 5>something up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like if I'd go to like a,</v>

1367
00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 5>like a rock concert when I was younger</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's,</v>

1368
00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:22.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the lawn and there's a girl sitting</v>

1369
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:24.530
<v Speaker 5>like very purposefully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1370
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's naked or body painted.</v>

1371
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.460
<v Speaker 5>And her pussies out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing,</v>

1372
00:59:28.461 --> 00:59:31.100
<v Speaker 5>like a posture up at a place where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>could check her pussy,</v>

1373
00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 5>eating her pussy out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like someone opened the door,</v>

1374
00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:37.170
<v Speaker 5>let a cat out</v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

1375
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:39.130
<v Speaker 5>close the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing a out.</v>

1376
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:43.160
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like it's a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit pussies out.</v>

1377
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:48.080
<v Speaker 5>It's wandered around the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you have a girl just comes to body</v>

1378
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:48.810
<v Speaker 5>painted naked.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Of course you should.</v>

1381
00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.530
<v Speaker 5>And so you should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's part of the game of being</v>

1382
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:58.330
<v Speaker 5>outside naked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want you to see it just part of the</v>

1383
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.950
<v Speaker 5>way you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But someones watching you watch that and</v>

1384
01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:03.860

<v Speaker 5>objectifying.</v>

1385
01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll come to that and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>But those men are almost entirely week.</v>

1388
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 5>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.420
<v Speaker 5>This wise,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pedophile porn on their computers at one</v>

1393
01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 5>point when they die or they're just</v>
<v Speaker 5>socially retarded and they just don't</v>

1394
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:28.000
<v Speaker 5>know how to communicate with girls and</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the,</v>

1395
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.490
<v Speaker 5>by being incredibly virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've picked up this extra personality</v>

1396
01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:35.600
<v Speaker 5>trait that they think's gonna ask them</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the top and whenever you're looking</v>

1397
01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.910
<v Speaker 5>to find,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the connection to fund with a</v>

1398
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 5>woman when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to find,</v>

1399
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.870
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to find it.</v>

1400
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.090
<v Speaker 5>She did not gonna you're not gonna find</v>
<v Speaker 5>that or you're like,</v>

1401
01:00:44.091 --> 01:00:46.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>repressing something yourself because</v>

1402
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 5>there really is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day,</v>

1403
01:00:50.691 --> 01:00:53.090
<v Speaker 5>like most women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never speak for all of them.</v>

1404
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 5>Do one a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 5>And most men want a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1406
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1407
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A manly man in whatever way.</v>

1408
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:07.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like a handy guide necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like my girlfriend feels like secure</v>

1409
01:01:07.671 --> 01:01:08.391
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1410
01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:11.400
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm a guy with a wild run away from</v>
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>

1411
01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:13.590
<v Speaker 5>If we get held up or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1412
01:01:13.591 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't try to fight for myself or like</v>
<v Speaker 5>she feels like secure with me in several</v>

1413
01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:20.600
<v Speaker 5>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My manhood is in whatever ways they are.</v>

1414
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 5>Have there been like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't fix cars.</v>

1415
01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to do any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1416
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.400
<v Speaker 5>The problem isn't that there's men and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's weak people and that</v>

1417
01:01:28.401 --> 01:01:31.070
<v Speaker 5>there's inbetween.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's women and weak women and strong</v>

1418
01:01:31.071 --> 01:01:33.890
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is when people lash out</v>

1419
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.920
<v Speaker 5>against one group that has nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with something that happened in the</v>

1420
01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:41.450
<v Speaker 5>news,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you talk about masculinity,</v>

1421
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 5>toxic masculinity in this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>assassination,</v>

1422
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.940
<v Speaker 5>that guy was mentally unbalanced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy,</v>

1423
01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tormented.</v>

1424
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:50.360
<v Speaker 5>Evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sociopath,</v>

1425
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:52.670
<v Speaker 5>psychopath would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whichever you want you want to call it,</v>

1426
01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:56.240
<v Speaker 5>who did a heinous thing has nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do with masculine or feminine.</v>

1427
01:01:56.241 --> 01:01:59.540
<v Speaker 5>It's just a stupid argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just to start that,</v>

1428
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:01.760
<v Speaker 5>to start that conversation conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1429
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 5>you're separating the teams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're making the left and the right.</v>

1430
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.260
<v Speaker 5>You're making the cowboys versus the</v>
<v Speaker 5>raiders.</v>

1431
01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:08.420
<v Speaker 5>You're doing something there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're doing something there.</v>

1432
01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:09.050
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1433
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 5>you're establishing boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just people that suck.</v>

1434
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.500
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This world has nothing to do with</v>

1435
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.140
<v Speaker 5>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing to do with sexual orientation,</v>

1436
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 5>and as soon as you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those things,</v>

1437
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 2>you confuse the fuck out of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument because if you can't make fun</v>

1438
01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 2>of any women or you can't talk shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about any women,</v>

1439
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.680
<v Speaker 2>well then you're admitting that women</v>
<v Speaker 2>are weaker.</v>

1440
01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Just like if I can make fun of men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't make fun of women.</v>

1441
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 2>If I make fun of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to massage this.</v>

1442
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:35.220
<v Speaker 2>If I make fun of men too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate myself.</v>

1443
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work,</v>

1444
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:39.523
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1445
01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 2>you gotta speak to her old friend Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kilstein about those subjects.</v>

1446
01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:45.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what he means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1447
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:47.250
<v Speaker 5>I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>

1448
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 5>he seems like a different human being</v>
<v Speaker 5>than the one that I knew.</v>

1449
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.100
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over a decade ago,</v>

1450
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 2>people change big j.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sure do.</v>

1451
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 2>They eat a lot of granola.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alfalfa.</v>

1452
01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.880
<v Speaker 2>So bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what we're talking about.</v>

1454
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1455
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:08.410
<v Speaker 2>they just see people go too far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the ideas because there's</v>

1456
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:11.790
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with being</v>

1457
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:13.230
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with being a</v>

1458
01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:14.490
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with being a man.</v>

1459
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when people are shitty to</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

1460
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.720
<v Speaker 2>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only problem.</v>

1461
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.370
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the.</v>

1462
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 2>There is definitely a problem when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to mass shooters being all men.</v>

1463
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably looking at what the</v>

1464
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>fuck's going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't just jump,</v>

1465
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:35.090
<v Speaker 2>don't just jump and assume and Delta put</v>
<v Speaker 2>it out on the other $150 million men</v>

1466
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:40.020
<v Speaker 2>that live in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the dumbest fucking percentage</v>

1467
01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:43.320
<v Speaker 2>point ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mass shooters and the rest of the men</v>

1468
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:45.000
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1469
01:03:45.001 --> 01:03:47.520
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they'll jump on this thing,</v>

1470
01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:51.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People jump on this gender thing and</v>

1471
01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:54.560
<v Speaker 2>they jump on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you got as a religious idea.</v>

1472
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Logically poison psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you got.</v>

1473
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.090
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Talk Right now.</v>

1474
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:00.924
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

1475
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.000
<v Speaker 5>His Dad says some things where he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1476

<v Speaker 5>I'm appalled at what my son's done.</v>

1478
01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:10.630
<v Speaker 5>Like God will work out the gaze himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1481
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.740

<v Speaker 5>like now that we had that back,</v>

1488
01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:41.010
<v Speaker 5>if we had the same science then we have</v>
<v Speaker 5>now they would have found out he had a,</v>

1489
01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:46.011
<v Speaker 5>a temporal lobe</v>
<v Speaker 5>tumor that was pushing on it.</v>

1490
01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.150
<v Speaker 5>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he woke up,</v>

1491
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 5>he would have been found guilty of</v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1492
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 5>obviously murdered people.</v>

1493
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:56.460
<v Speaker 5>But like I wonder how that would've gone</v>
<v Speaker 5>legally because he woke up not his</v>

1494
01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 5>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pure rage.</v>

1495
01:04:57.931 --> 01:05:00.820
<v Speaker 5>Like he killed his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he killed his,</v>

1496
01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.270
<v Speaker 5>his own girlfriend or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He killed,</v>

1497
01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:05.060
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people on the way to the tower,</v>

1498
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 5>just like everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He kind of came across,</v>

1499
01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:09.760
<v Speaker 5>he just did something to him killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

1500
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.400
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might not be found guilty,</v>

1501
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 5>sentenced to life in jail anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>

1502
01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 5>I would've always wondered for something</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that there because man,</v>

1503
01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:19.670
<v Speaker 5>pulling a trigger on people's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1504
01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.610
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just at a totally different.</v>

1505
01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:26.020
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't even wrap my brain around</v>
<v Speaker 5>what that is that can make you do that,</v>

1506
01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:27.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the columbine kids and everything.</v>

1507
01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:29.540
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

1508
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get in the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill Maher trouble where he said,</v>

1509
01:05:32.321 --> 01:05:32.950
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1510
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:36.370
<v Speaker 5>that 9:11 suicide bombers are cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1511
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:37.570
<v Speaker 5>you've got a lot of trouble for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

1512
01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:39.580
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I got what he was saying where</v>

1513
01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:41.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm still kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1514
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:41.981
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

1515
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:44.340
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think seeing somebody get shot with</v>

1516
01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 5>like affect me for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long couch.</v>

1517
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:49.750
<v Speaker 5>The wrong wing allowed to fucking coward</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the wrong word.</v>

1518
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:50.990
<v Speaker 5>Being being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1519
01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:56.010
<v Speaker 5>having the ability to go and just like</v>
<v Speaker 5>spray down a bunch of people,</v>

1520
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:59.410
<v Speaker 5>but it's fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an intense thing to dive in.</v>

1521
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a foolish thing to call them</v>

1522
01:06:01.131 --> 01:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>cowards because I think when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you call a murderer cowards,</v>

1523
01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like set your,</v>

1524
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.190

<v Speaker 2>The manhood of other murderers.</v>

1525
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:11.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're calling me coward.</v>

1527
01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take five.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You want to the other one up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You after you insult them.</v>

1529
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Comic Little Dicks after they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1530
01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel better with your little Dick</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

1533
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>This may be the shooter had a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

1534
01:06:29.241 --> 01:06:30.074
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1535
01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read that on twitter.</v>

1536
01:06:33.441 --> 01:06:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Men like a little Dick thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1537
01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Coward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So psycho.</v>

1538
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coward is the wrong word.</v>

1539
01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:43.760
<v Speaker 2>They're evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That takes a lot of balls to fly a</v>

1540
01:06:43.761 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 2>fucking plane right into a building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1541
01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:46.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

1542
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're definitely,</v>

1543
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:54.110
<v Speaker 2>you're going sideways to your banking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard into the building.</v>

1544
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's watch it.</v>

1545
01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:00.880
<v Speaker 5>Let's watch a real quick video just to</v>
<v Speaker 5>freak me out.</v>

1546
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm freaking out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking it's going in the building.</v>

1547
01:07:03.611 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Speaker 5>I'd say it's too tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The beginning of,</v>

1548
01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of most of that footage.</v>

1549
01:07:08.081 --> 01:07:09.460
<v Speaker 5>The underneath one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1550
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.520
<v Speaker 5>you just see the building swallow it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1551
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:15.670
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember watching it on tv that</v>

1552
01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:16.504
<v Speaker 5>morning</v>

1553
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:20.090
<v Speaker 2>just watching the plane hit the building</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>

1554
01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Just going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1555
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.780
<v Speaker 2>how am I even seeing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this even really?</v>

1556
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Am I seeing this?</v>

1557
01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:29.010
<v Speaker 5>The second one was one of the most like</v>
<v Speaker 5>tense moments I've ever had in my life</v>

1558
01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.090
<v Speaker 5>where I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1559
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.560
<v Speaker 5>because that's when you knew right away</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1560
01:07:31.561 --> 01:07:33.240
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this isn't an accident.</v>

1561
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:34.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the first one they were still</v>

1562
01:07:34.861 --> 01:07:37.950
<v Speaker 5>kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there must be some kind of radar issues.</v>

1563
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:42.980
<v Speaker 5>There's still a hell of a radar issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They flew to fucking planes filled with</v>

1564
01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:48.630
<v Speaker 5>people in the buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is one of the craziest moments in</v>

1565
01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:51.810
<v Speaker 5>human history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it happened during our lives and</v>

1566
01:07:51.811 --> 01:07:55.410
<v Speaker 5>then after they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we imploded the building with our seven.</v>

1567
01:07:55.411 --> 01:07:57.300
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

1568
01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.790
<v Speaker 2>That is so crazy.</v>

1569
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scale,</v>

1570
01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.610
<v Speaker 5>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like so far away because it's so</v>

1571
01:08:07.611 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 5>high up that you can't like how big that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

1572
01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:12.650
<v Speaker 5>The people in that bill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1573
01:08:12.651 --> 01:08:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Like the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like six.</v>

1574
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The situation that seems</v>

1575
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.521
<v Speaker 2>like it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
01:08:16.521 --> 01:08:18.220
<v Speaker 2>just like finger lengths away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1577
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:22.320
<v Speaker 2>but I mean like it how huge a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>jet play on the floor,</v>

1578
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>on the floor of a building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

1579
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at the video of the tower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second plane crashed the World Trade</v>

1580
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Center from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1581
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 2>from the ground looking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

1582
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.290
<v Speaker 2>It's still insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still hard to believe,</v>

1583
01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:37.700
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still hard to believe.</v>

1584
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This 15 years.</v>

1585
01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:41.160
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still is that,</v>

1586
01:08:41.161 --> 01:08:44.090
<v Speaker 2>that was in our lifetime in New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>

1587
01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 2>That the thing about those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1588
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:46.581
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so.</v>

1589
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 2>There's so much scary going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1590
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Because there's the scary of someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has the conviction of fly a plane</v>

1591
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>right into a building that's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary.</v>

1592
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.510
<v Speaker 2>There's the scary that they will take</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of innocent people with them.</v>

1593
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.640
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a scared they're going to fly</v>

1594
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 2>into a building they know is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill random people with kids,</v>

1595
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 2>with moms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Dads,</v>

1596
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:08.620
<v Speaker 2>with best friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1597
01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck.</v>

1598
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:14.060
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fly right into that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill all those people.</v>

1599
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:17.090
<v Speaker 2>And then the damage to the building of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course was killed.</v>

1600
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the whole thing is just bananas and</v>

1601
01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:22.100
<v Speaker 2>will never have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1602
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them a turn to debone it.</v>

1603
01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how much that,</v>

1604
01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:28.400
<v Speaker 2>if it could ever happen at gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will never.</v>

1605
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:32.090
<v Speaker 2>If you jumped up on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think now to say,</v>

1606
01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.730
<v Speaker 2>hey everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to say I'm going to propose to my</v>

1607
01:09:34.731 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 2>wife like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey everyone out before someone's going</v>

1608
01:09:37.821 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 2>to fucking mall like the temple you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking it out.</v>

1609
01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Somebody told me to look up</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many pictures there are people like</v>

1610
01:09:45.351 --> 01:09:47.930
<v Speaker 2>hog tied on planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of pictures of that because like</v>

1611
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.470
<v Speaker 2>they just freaked out on a plate and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>tied up because people get so nervous</v>

1612
01:09:51.471 --> 01:09:52.040
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1613
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And rightly so.</v>

1614
01:09:53.171 --> 01:09:56.900
<v Speaker 2>My I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am surprised at the amount of people I</v>

1615
01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:01.550
<v Speaker 2>will say who got hurt and killed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orlando because I'm surprised there</v>

1616
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:03.860
<v Speaker 2>wasn't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in tight quarters may</v>

1617
01:10:03.861 --> 01:10:06.140
<v Speaker 2>think he just got swarmed at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where he was.</v>

1619
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:11.390
<v Speaker 2>He might've had a vantage point where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could shoot.</v>

1620
01:10:11.391 --> 01:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could get behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might,</v>

1621
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might have scattered some people</v>

1622
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:19.270
<v Speaker 2>really quick and they might have done a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the damage themselves.</v>

1623
01:10:19.271 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 2>I've fallen on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to realize that a gun like that</v>

1624
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.770
<v Speaker 2>you could squeeze off 50 rounds in</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1625
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 2>So he killed 50 people and wounded 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>more or something along those lines.</v>

1626
01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go like that with your finger.</v>

1627
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:32.391
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

1628
01:10:32.391 --> 01:10:32.841
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1629
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:33.231
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1630
01:10:33.231 --> 01:10:33.620
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1631
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what that gun can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1632
01:10:34.761 --> 01:10:35.001
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1633
01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:35.331
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1634
01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:35.661
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1635
01:10:35.661 --> 01:10:35.871
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

1636
01:10:35.871 --> 01:10:36.231
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>

1637
01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.880
<v Speaker 2>12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've already shot 12 people.</v>

1638
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:38.361
<v Speaker 2>Thirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

1639
01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:38.930
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60.</v>

1640
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:39.763
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep going.</v>

1641
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Twenty one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 through to divert.</v>

1642
01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are the ones where it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's got,</v>

1643
01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:46.070
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be a trigger pull for every</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet,</v>

1644
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:49.400
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless he made it a automatic.</v>

1645
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some guns you can alter</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1646
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:54.980
<v Speaker 2>You can turn them into a automatics most</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely.</v>

1647
01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:56.320
<v Speaker 2>And Ar is one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1648
01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be speaking out of school,</v>

1649
01:10:57.831 --> 01:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>but I know for sure it has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>semiautomatic function and when you pull</v>

1650
01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just every time you pull your</v>

1651
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 2>finger treats a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Single Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo</v>

1652
01:11:05.181 --> 01:11:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doo.</v>

1653
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can literally shoot faster</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you can say the numbers.</v>

1654
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:10.611
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1655
01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:10.881
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1656
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:11.181
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1657
01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:11.421
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

1658
01:11:11.421 --> 01:11:11.900
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>

1659
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 2>You shooting way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just fire them off man.</v>

1660
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 2>And you would hear people that cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1661
01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.590
<v Speaker 2>you could hear it in the background and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quick.</v>

1662
01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>It's terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrific that someone would have that in</v>

1663
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:25.440
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like there's no like,</v>

1664
01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Orlando,</v>

1665
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1666
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Well you hear about the alligator that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a baby yesterday or no in Orlando at</v>

1667
01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>

1668
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alligator ate a fucking baby.</v>

1669
01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.490
<v Speaker 2>One year old baby snatched them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug them into the water and they,</v>

1670
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't say killed the baby.</v>

1671
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:47.400
<v Speaker 2>This is how weird the news is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to say it took the baby</v>

1672
01:11:47.401 --> 01:11:48.900
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1673
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>no immediate ate the baby today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel too.</v>

1674
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:58.290
<v Speaker 2>That's so rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1675
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.600
<v Speaker 2>You can't go near water and Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1676
01:12:00.601 --> 01:12:03.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't go near water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are infested.</v>

1677
01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I used to live there when I was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we used to feed them.</v>

1678
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I used to live in Gainesville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>

1679
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:12.390
<v Speaker 2>and we used to go to Lake Alice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this little pond and we'd throw</v>

1680
01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:15.930
<v Speaker 2>marshmallows in the water and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>alligators would come up and it was like</v>

1681
01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:18.480
<v Speaker 2>they were harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were always laying around like you</v>

1682
01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:22.380
<v Speaker 2>would walk around near alligators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really fucking so strange.</v>

1683
01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Now that I think about it like I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a crazy dude on many occasions.</v>

1684
01:12:26.761 --> 01:12:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I was within 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 yards of an alligator.</v>

1685
01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 2>They'd never fucked with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never did anything,</v>

1686
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:36.890
<v Speaker 2>but it was because they were endangered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed a fuck load of them.</v>

1687
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:41.400
<v Speaker 2>So when people first got to Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they just started slaughter and</v>

1688
01:12:41.401 --> 01:12:44.880
<v Speaker 2>alligators and they slaughtered them so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much that they became protected.</v>

1689
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:47.760
<v Speaker 2>So when I lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was the seventies,</v>

1690
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:49.080
<v Speaker 2>it was protected.</v>

1691
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.610
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't kill alligators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now there's guys who have like tags,</v>

1692
01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:57.780
<v Speaker 2>like professional alligator hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have 500 tags so they can go out</v>

1693
01:12:57.781 --> 01:13:02.310
<v Speaker 2>and shoot 500 alligators and really they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't put a dent in the population.</v>

1694
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:05.940
<v Speaker 2>They let these mother fuckers take root</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're everywhere.</v>

1695
01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that 15 foot one that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking across the golf course the other</v>

1696
01:13:08.611 --> 01:13:10.140
<v Speaker 2>day because they figured out that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1697
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:10.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

1698
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:12.910
<v Speaker 2>There's two different angles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the new angle into.</v>

1699
01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1700
01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dinosaur to new angle to really</v>

1701
01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.300
<v Speaker 2>close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1702
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like less than 30,</v>

1703
01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:26.620
<v Speaker 2>40 yards away from it looks depending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>how strong their zoom is on the like</v>

1704
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:29.640
<v Speaker 2>crazy tall two huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's enormous.</v>

1705
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It's walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not.</v>

1706
01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I thought that would kind of dragged on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

1707
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.920
<v Speaker 2>this things walking because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like,</v>

1708
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:35.783
<v Speaker 2>what do you do it?</v>

1709
01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:38.700
<v Speaker 2>You just kill that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that piece is off the earth.</v>

1710
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to kill things.</v>

1711
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it gets a chance to kill.</v>

1712
01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:45.060
<v Speaker 2>It's going to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

1713
01:13:45.061 --> 01:13:47.310
<v Speaker 2>There's not a whole lot that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away from that thing.</v>

1714
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run like about as fast as a person,</v>

1715
01:13:51.481 --> 01:13:53.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little faster than the average</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1716
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Have they tracked it or was it bar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

1717
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what if they stayed up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it at all?</v>

1718
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Those things scare the fuck out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are heartless lizards and they let</v>

1719
01:14:03.541 --> 01:14:07.320
<v Speaker 2>these goddamn things get to a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level of population.</v>

1720
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we should make them</v>
<v Speaker 2>extinct,</v>

1721
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>but they definitely need to chop them</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1722
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.580
<v Speaker 2>There's way too many of them and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of people that are interested</v>

1723
01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 2>in chopping them down like they used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like you'd have to send a lot of</v>

1724
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:20.404
<v Speaker 2>people out into the.</v>

1725
01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.050
<v Speaker 2>In the everglades they found Nile</v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles.</v>

1726
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:24.521

01:14:24.521 --> 01:14:27.640
<v Speaker 2>they have a kill on site order for Nile</v>
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles.</v>

1728
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:30.250
<v Speaker 2>They found them all because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>super aggressive and they found a bunch</v>

1729
01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:32.140
<v Speaker 2>of them so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're huge.</v>

1730
01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Those things get to be more than 20 feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

1731
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Just the ones that need water buffaloes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

1732
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Is there a video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a video of a world obese get me by.</v>

1736
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:53.530
<v Speaker 2>these things can go under water for</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours at a time,</v>

1737
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.580
<v Speaker 2>so what they do is they slide into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pond and they move closer to where the</v>

1738
01:14:57.581 --> 01:14:58.480
<v Speaker 2>hubs are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1739
01:14:58.481 --> 01:15:03.000
<v Speaker 2>they hear the sound of the hoods and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get in the water and then they're</v>

1740
01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:06.070
<v Speaker 2>underwater lying in the mud for fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

1741
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.000
<v Speaker 2>just waiting for something to come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take a drink and when these things</v>

1742

<v Speaker 2>come up and take a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just get snatched.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the crocodiles,</v>

1747
01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:27.470

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:28.663
<v Speaker 2>time to eat</v>

1749
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.060
<v Speaker 2>and they're all in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to make these treks across the</v>

1750
01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:34.680
<v Speaker 2>rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any crocodiles.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't watch a lot of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The nature shows when you see when it</v>

<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>

1765
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.110
<v Speaker 5>It's why I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a,</v>

1766
01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:27.340
<v Speaker 5>the Emerald Wasp zone Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1768
01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.990
<v Speaker 5>like grabs him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does a whole process that rips off</v>

1769
01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:39.340
<v Speaker 5>the antenna and then sticks it to kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of paralyze it and it doesn't paralyze</v>

1770
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:40.930
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just makes it woozy.</v>

1771
01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:42.280
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then genesis,</v>

1772
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 5>second thing into the brain and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>like liquefies the brain than just like,</v>

1773
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.360
<v Speaker 5>it's much smaller than the cockroach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then just lowers the cockroach back.</v>

1774
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take some back.</v>

1777
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it just brings it back and just</v>

1778
01:16:57.661 --> 01:17:00.570
<v Speaker 2>throws it on the ground for the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck.</v>

1779
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:05.130
<v Speaker 2>There's so many weird bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1780
01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>When you really pay attention to all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of species of bugs,</v>

1781
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.560
<v Speaker 2>it's very scary because we're just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>lucky.</v>

1782
01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.390
<v Speaker 2>They're little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give bugs.</v>

1783
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Were like a cow sized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be fucked.</v>

1784
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 2>We would be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1785
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:24.310
<v Speaker 2>If we ever fucking VF ESX server,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're lucky.</v>

1786
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:26.810
<v Speaker 2>We're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their little man,</v>

1787
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you know we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are no match for so much shit in</v>

1788
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:31.760
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like animals and stuff.</v>

1789
01:17:31.761 --> 01:17:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Like we couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't fight that and crocodile</v>

1790
01:17:34.821 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1791
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:39.710
<v Speaker 2>there's so many weird bugs to where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like weird things that they somehow</v>

1792
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 2>or another figure out how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say there's some parasite that takes</v>

1793
01:17:43.761 --> 01:17:48.650
<v Speaker 2>over a grasshopper's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It burrows into its body,</v>

1794
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:53.890
<v Speaker 2>takes over its brain and hijack set and</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks this grasshopper into committing</v>

1795
01:17:55.191 --> 01:18:00.191
<v Speaker 2>suicide by jumping into a lake so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can spawn out of its body and it</v>

1796
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:02.060
<v Speaker 2>bursts out of his body like an alien.</v>

1797
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:03.620
<v Speaker 2>What is this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

1798
01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1799
01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.080
<v Speaker 2>It's going to kill itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1800
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Well these grasshoppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they killed themselves and then this</v>

1801
01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 2>aquatic worm comes out of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1802
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:22.030
<v Speaker 2>It talks the grasshopper and the killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself so they can give birth to this</v>

1803
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:23.091
<v Speaker 2>warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1804
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It grew in this thing's fucking body and</v>

1805
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:28.640
<v Speaker 2>it's long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like many,</v>

1806
01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times longer than the than the</v>

1807
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.290
<v Speaker 2>grasshopper itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucking strangers that just.</v>

1808
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like it is pure evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's so many creatures that are</v>

1809
01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1810
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:43.250
<v Speaker 2>But it works somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably too many grasshoppers</v>

1811
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 2>and nature figured out some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to weed it out,</v>

1812
01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.080
<v Speaker 2>thin out the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1813
01:18:48.081 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 2>think about all those asshole</v>
<v Speaker 2>willdabeast crossing that stupid river.</v>

1814
01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Of course we need crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

1815
01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Like an unlimited number of willdabeast.</v>

1816
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:57.800
<v Speaker 2>You can't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to get on a highway,</v>

1817
01:18:57.801 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 2>there's willdabeast everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is that interestingly sort of like a</v>

1818
01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:05.231
<v Speaker 2>parallel between like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of a stretch I guess,</v>

1819
01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:07.490
<v Speaker 2>but like the order of the nightclub</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting thing,</v>

1820
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.330
<v Speaker 2>it really is an emotional creatures like</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack,</v>

1821
01:19:10.331 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>herd creatures like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1822
01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:17.010
<v Speaker 2>just like one of them is just getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed by a stone cold killer like that,</v>

1823
01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:18.550
<v Speaker 2>that crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said they're,</v>

1824
01:19:18.551 --> 01:19:22.760
<v Speaker 2>they're not emotional boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't teach a crocodile to love</v>

1825
01:19:22.761 --> 01:19:23.690
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1826
01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:27.500
<v Speaker 2>but that's not an aberration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like standard crocodile behavior.</v>

1827
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:30.200
<v Speaker 2>When a person is doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this crazy aberration.</v>

1828
01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Is He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least today,</v>

1829
01:19:31.341 --> 01:19:34.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a deviation for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying there is.</v>

1830
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:38.270
<v Speaker 2>He's coming out of a praying mantis now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going right into the water so this</v>

1831
01:19:38.271 --> 01:19:41.600
<v Speaker 2>aquatic worm can fuck with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1832
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:46.130
<v Speaker 2>He killed the praying mantis and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>escaping through its body into water.</v>

1833
01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.260
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1834
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.070
<v Speaker 2>What a strange animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look out.</v>

1835
01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Big Pine comes near them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he yells,</v>

1836
01:19:53.991 --> 01:19:56.000
<v Speaker 2>the mountain lion goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the mountain lion was like,</v>

1837
01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:57.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He makes them mad.</v>

1838
01:19:57.651 --> 01:20:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Run out of them and the guy sprays it</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the face with bear spray and</v>

1839
01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:04.040
<v Speaker 2>scares it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking terrifying.</v>

1840
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:07.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrifying video because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that a hundred and 50 monster</v>

1841
01:20:07.591 --> 01:20:10.800
<v Speaker 2>was trying to eat this dude and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't spray it in his face with some</v>

1842
01:20:10.801 --> 01:20:13.230
<v Speaker 2>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would've been donesville this guy.</v>

1843
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 2>We watched a murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We watched like a cat murder a guy.</v>

1844
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>

1845
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Like Gimme Gimme some volume on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

1846
01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:27.190
<v Speaker 7>I was expecting quite honestly for them</v>
<v Speaker 7>to just stay in the bush and watch me go</v>

1847
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:27.800
<v Speaker 7>by.</v>

1848
01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a quote here that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to watch the news version</v>

1849
01:20:31.581 --> 01:20:32.414
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1850
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:38.420
<v Speaker 2>that capital right out.</v>

1851
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:40.830
<v Speaker 7>I like being an ecstatic to seeing them</v>
<v Speaker 7>too,</v>

1852
01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:42.030
<v Speaker 7>being like really scared</v>

1853
01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 2>and those things will fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you up.</v>

1854
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:49.380
<v Speaker 2>No danger of like when they all go out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a bunch of the comments [inaudible]</v>

1855
01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:52.460
<v Speaker 2>of Joshua tree and shoot a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them.</v>

1856
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:54.840
<v Speaker 2>They're making a lot of noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll stay away.</v>

1857
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because cat doesn't know if you have</v>

1858
01:20:56.191 --> 01:20:59.160
<v Speaker 2>guns or something like that and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally wary about people.</v>

1859
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 2>They know that people occasionally have</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>

1860
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:03.960
<v Speaker 2>so they sort of program to be scared of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1861
01:21:03.961 --> 01:21:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Stay away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1862
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:09.300
<v Speaker 2>but if you're running that's a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>because running seems like you're trying</v>

1863
01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:11.040
<v Speaker 2>to get away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it excites them.</v>

1864
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Just like rolling a ball of yarn front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a cat and excites them.</v>

1865
01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were hiking and that same</v>
<v Speaker 2>person hiking probably wouldn't have as</v>

1866
01:21:17.251 --> 01:21:21.240
<v Speaker 2>much of a an attractant to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cat Bikes are bad too.</v>

1867
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:24.270
<v Speaker 2>They see try and take off on a bike and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realize that's pretty fast.</v>

1868
01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Motherfuckers going to get away if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to just start sprinting</v>

1869
01:21:27.571 --> 01:21:29.130
<v Speaker 2>towards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the video of the guy on the</v>

1870
01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:31.020
<v Speaker 2>bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets to get kicked by,</v>

1871
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 2>its gets kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the animal?</v>

1872
01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 2>He gets knocked off a bikeway gazelle</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

1873
01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have seen that as jumping on me.</v>

1874
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:43.670
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy goes flying so far off the</v>

1875
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 2>bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing just like hit him going 50</v>

1876
01:21:46.411 --> 01:21:48.210
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1877
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:49.044
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the guy,</v>

1878
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:51.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like a buck or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1879
01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:53.580
<v Speaker 2>What kind of animal is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy?</v>

1880
01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1881
01:21:57.211 --> 01:21:59.730
<v Speaker 2>He got fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like you should have went high</v>

1882
01:21:59.731 --> 01:22:01.020
<v Speaker 2>fived and other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1883
01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.340
<v Speaker 2>of what is it a gazelle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1884
01:22:02.341 --> 01:22:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1885
01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.390
<v Speaker 2>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes now,</v>

1886
01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:06.270
<v Speaker 2>like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

1887
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.580
<v Speaker 2>that was their jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three video.</v>

1888
01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.500
<v Speaker 2>The Gazelle community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their jackets.</v>

1889
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1890
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.940
<v Speaker 2>nailed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1891
01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Look out and look at the gazelle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sort of bounces off of them and</v>

1892
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:20.340
<v Speaker 2>runs away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy campaign.</v>

1893
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.230
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how powerful animals are over us.</v>

1894
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:27.780
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at that through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1895
01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably 250 300 pounds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's throwing itself into the air.</v>

1896
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:37.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big ass animal.</v>

1897
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:41.400
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty impressive that we dominate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth to considering that like we</v>

1898
01:22:41.401 --> 01:22:44.310
<v Speaker 2>are not even anywhere near the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1899
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Just the smartest technical are so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter than those dummies sit.</v>

1900
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.940
<v Speaker 2>We can shoot them from a distance that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make a,</v>

1901
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 2>an antelope.</v>

1902
01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 2>You could turn into a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it.</v>

1903
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is set up a bi-pod.</v>

1904
01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Get a nice clean rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax you breathing,</v>

1905
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.570
<v Speaker 2>squeeze your fingers and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bullet goes through its body.</v>

1906
01:23:03.571 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 2>You go pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you it,</v>

1907
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you open it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the organs that are edible,</v>

1908
01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.240
<v Speaker 2>chop it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it on the grill and you're eating</v>

1909
01:23:10.241 --> 01:23:14.350
<v Speaker 2>it in like less than an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're in like backed in a corner</v>

1910
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 2>against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked with any dude in the</v>

1911
01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:18.350
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a,</v>

1912
01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 2>you have a puncher's chance of getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that thing.</v>

1913
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as a gazelle is just going to murder</v>

1914
01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:26.260
<v Speaker 2>you quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

1915
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:30.580
<v Speaker 2>A fucking ran that aren't even that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just fucking pulverize you.</v>

1916
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I liked my chances with Ram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's take chess.</v>

1917
01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.220
<v Speaker 2>If I got a knife and a Iran wants to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1918
01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I know if I'm talking about straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1919
01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:40.650
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just choke him.</v>

1920
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I think I could joke around.</v>

1921
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1922
01:23:45.611 --> 01:23:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if I break one of his front</v>
<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>

1923
01:23:47.531 --> 01:23:49.030
<v Speaker 2>he's not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1924
01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:51.700
<v Speaker 2>So I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just dive on a Kamora.</v>

1925
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Are you using using Dalton's theory from</v>
<v Speaker 2>roadhouse man's leg?</v>

1926
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to slide under him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when he raises up,</v>

1927
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.030
<v Speaker 2>when he raises up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get that part.</v>

1928
01:24:01.031 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push it forward and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get that double wrist lock</v>

1929
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:05.740
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to crack that fucking leg.</v>

1930
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm going to roll into mountain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I get into mount,</v>

1931
01:24:08.651 --> 01:24:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I get ahold of his handlebars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1932
01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Probably hit me and knocked me 30 feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the air.</v>

1933
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the video of ghost</v>
<v Speaker 2>write a book for you?</v>

1934
01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan shows you how to defeat</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

1935
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:24.510
<v Speaker 2>feeding wildlife with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1936
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:26.350
<v Speaker 2>just go through each animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

1937
01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Don't try to fight a buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1938
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:32.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of a ram and a cow</v>
<v Speaker 2>headbutting.</v>

1939
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:35.410
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy because it's ram as</v>
<v Speaker 2>only like,</v>

1940
01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1941
01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>it can't be more than like 150 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that big an animal.</v>

1942
01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:43.840
<v Speaker 2>And the cows a fucking huge cow and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>collide heads.</v>

1943
01:24:43.841 --> 01:24:46.150

<v Speaker 5>Seven deaths per year.</v>

2025
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

2026
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:28.160
<v Speaker 5>There's only been 52 since 19.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Between 1990 and carnivals and</v>

2027
01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:32.260
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rollercoaster rollercoaster carnivals</v>

2028
01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.270
<v Speaker 5>and the amusement park desk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because some of them things aren't</v>

2029
01:28:35.271 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rollercoasters has all sorts of</v>

2030
01:28:37.581 --> 01:28:40.160
<v Speaker 5>different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like those like drops.</v>

2031
01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:42.200
<v Speaker 5>Let's create.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People have died in those things.</v>

2032
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.570

2033
01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:47.120
<v Speaker 5>fucking disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the willing to go into it,</v>

2034
01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:51.260
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know for some reason I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a much lower risk of amusement</v>

2035
01:28:51.261 --> 01:28:55.070
<v Speaker 5>park rides than like Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A guy called us in and went skydiving.</v>

2036
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.560
<v Speaker 5>He said they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they even let him cut corner.</v>

2037
01:28:57.570 --> 01:29:00.860
<v Speaker 5>He was like a bigger guy so they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>make him wear a certain kind of harness</v>

2038
01:29:00.861 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 5>and he went into</v>

2039
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 2>street clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really supposed to do that.</v>

2040
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 2>And he said he went out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says fucking shoot,</v>

2041
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 2>like got wound up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it got like he literally,</v>

2042
01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:10.590
<v Speaker 2>he hit the ground and they got fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2043
01:29:10.591 --> 01:29:11.040
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2044
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.970
<v Speaker 2>but it kind of opened like really late</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he still hit the ground like</v>

2045
01:29:14.971 --> 01:29:15.691
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

2046
01:29:15.691 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not hard enough to like kill them.</v>

2047
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:21.570
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's crazy is that Disney has probably</v>

2048
01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:24.210
<v Speaker 2>the safest rides and the safest ride</v>
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>

01:29:46.831 --> 01:29:51.150
<v Speaker 2>house and you were pretty sure dinosaurs</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in that lake and you had a kid,</v>

2058
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:54.840
<v Speaker 2>but he kinda came out of a lake so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't little upon there.</v>

2059
01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Like any body of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2060
01:29:56.401 --> 01:29:59.130
<v Speaker 2>they'll crawl across the highway and</v>
<v Speaker 2>jump into a swimming pool.</v>

2061
01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find them and people's pools.</v>

2062
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.221
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2063
01:30:02.221 --> 01:30:04.580
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them.</v>

2064
01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Then there's the everglades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The everglades are infested,</v>

2065
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:10.830
<v Speaker 2>infested with alligators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them.</v>

2066
01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:14.130
<v Speaker 2>People would go fan boat and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of crazy shit in there now</v>

2067
01:30:14.131 --> 01:30:16.320
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have pythons and alligators and</v>

2068
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:18.150
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nile crocodiles,</v>

2069
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of ways to place dump</v>
<v Speaker 2>a body.</v>

2070
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my last con.</v>

2071
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:26.430
<v Speaker 2>El gives you get it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of fucking.</v>

2072
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:29.610
<v Speaker 2>And then they have wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit going on in</v>

2073
01:30:29.611 --> 01:30:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible place.</v>

2074
01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just there last weekend in Miami.</v>

2075
01:30:36.211 --> 01:30:37.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

2076
01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I had a great time and fun people place.</v>

2077
01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:43.040
<v Speaker 2>The actual place itself is just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2078
01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Humidity is the grossest thing I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with.</v>

2079
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

2080
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:51.200
<v Speaker 2>there's an echo of the past in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and the entire city of Miami's</v>

2081
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:57.390
<v Speaker 2>like almost entirely funded by cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how that city became Miami.</v>

2082
01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:01.800
<v Speaker 2>That's why it has more banks per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly probably Google this because</v>

2083
01:31:01.801 --> 01:31:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I've said it too many times more banks</v>
<v Speaker 2>per capita.</v>

2084
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I think I found it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2085
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Billy Corbin's movie cocaine cowboys I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think was talking about that.</v>

2086
01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was all coke saw people running</v>

2087
01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:16.080
<v Speaker 2>coke and that fucking per se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a bunch of clubs and</v>

2088
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.680
<v Speaker 2>restaurants and doing blow shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and all the crime that was</v>

2089
01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.680
<v Speaker 2>wrapped around coke and all the murders</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the violence and all the police</v>

2090
01:31:25.681 --> 01:31:27.210
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had Michael Dowd in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.180
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll do it.</v>

2098
01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.830
<v Speaker 2>So you're not a terrible guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean saint.</v>

2100
01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy his company.</v>

2101
01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:52.710
<v Speaker 2>He did some crazy shit for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was doing blow and he was out</v>

2102
01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:56.160
<v Speaker 2>of his fucking mind and went to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did his time and now he's just trying</v>

2103
01:31:56.161 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's selling cigars and doing a bunch of</v>

2104
01:31:58.711 --> 01:32:00.760
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always loved the wives when they're</v>

2105
01:32:00.761 --> 01:32:02.870
<v Speaker 2>just kinda like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was weird when we were</v>

2106
01:32:02.871 --> 01:32:07.170
<v Speaker 2>going to Fiji on a beat cops salary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>

2107
01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 2>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to believe so bad.</v>

2108
01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's driving around a red corvette.</v>

2109
01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.360
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

2110
01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:15.340
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were maniacs.</v>

2111
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 2>They're maniacs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great movie.</v>

2112
01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:22.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a real a testament though to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same personality is extreme</v>

2113
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:26.350
<v Speaker 2>personalities that want to become like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2114
01:32:26.351 --> 01:32:29.590
<v Speaker 2>just go fucking full blown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outlaw is the same.</v>

2115
01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:31.300
<v Speaker 2>God said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to protect everyone.</v>

2116
01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2117
01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one companies be Lord to the other</v>

2118
01:32:35.111 --> 01:32:36.640
<v Speaker 2>side in a heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2119
01:32:36.641 --> 01:32:40.720
<v Speaker 2>he slowly but surely got chipped away at</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think also like he was talking</v>

2120
01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:45.250
<v Speaker 2>about how his very first days on the job</v>
<v Speaker 2>he experienced like intense corruption</v>

2121
01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:49.360
<v Speaker 2>where guys were talking about killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that snitched on cops and they</v>

2122
01:32:49.361 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 2>were like kind of openly admitted that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy fell off of a roof that snitched on</v>

2123
01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:55.420
<v Speaker 2>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2124
01:32:55.421 --> 01:32:56.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2125
01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.370
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2126
01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:58.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>

2127
01:32:58.660 --> 01:32:59.870
<v Speaker 2>We're good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2128
01:32:59.910 --> 01:33:04.240
<v Speaker 2>and became over time corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's pretty honest about it,</v>

2129
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:04.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2130
01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't hold anything back.</v>

2131
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2132
01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.730
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't good times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a good guy.</v>

2133
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:10.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no question about it.</v>

2134
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:13.900
<v Speaker 2>But it's a question of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2135
01:33:13.901 --> 01:33:15.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like looking the other way.</v>

2136
01:33:15.011 --> 01:33:17.500
<v Speaker 2>What people did get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear a story,</v>

2137
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2138
01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an important story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of cops that have gone</v>

2139
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:24.920
<v Speaker 2>bad that are approachable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Michael Dowd,</v>

2140
01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.180
<v Speaker 2>he's the most approachable and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and you know,</v>

2141
01:33:28.181 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't get along with the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that he was uh,</v>

2142
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:34.120
<v Speaker 2>involved with the time because I guess</v>
<v Speaker 2>they at each other out or one guy ratted</v>

2143
01:33:34.121 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 2>him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenny,</v>

2144
01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys on the show apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in the movie,</v>

2145
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:43.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great fucking movie that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy that he's a talking to in the</v>

2146
01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:45.460
<v Speaker 2>movie from where's he from?</v>

2147
01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Nicaragua or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>

2148
01:33:48.521 --> 01:33:51.700
<v Speaker 2>the Dominican Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that guy in him or making cigars</v>

2149
01:33:51.701 --> 01:33:53.080
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2150
01:33:53.081 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy who was in the movie talking</v>

2151
01:33:54.941 --> 01:33:58.000
<v Speaker 2>about killing people</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared.</v>

2152
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the main drug dealer guy.</v>

2153
01:33:59.591 --> 01:34:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was basically his partner.</v>

2154
01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:03.570
<v Speaker 2>It was his name again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2155
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.200
<v Speaker 2>But it's kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>

2156
01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 2>they get in with them with all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruptions stories where they get in,</v>

2157
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:10.050
<v Speaker 2>like with the drug deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

2158
01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:14.380
<v Speaker 2>they're almost like Newbie guys like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all kind of scary for us to.</v>

2159
01:34:14.381 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 2>So what are we know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we went in,</v>

2160
01:34:15.821 --> 01:34:19.000
<v Speaker 2>we'd love to get a part of this money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they start getting the money</v>

2161
01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 2>and then it says they start coming like</v>
<v Speaker 2>whacking people around and stuff.</v>

2162
01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Hey Pablo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this your new guy?</v>

2163
01:34:24.011 --> 01:34:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Just like drag him across the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll make me a big.</v>

2164
01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Well you jerk off will in this case it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually kind of like a,</v>

2165
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:34.680
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a happy ending drug dealer story because</v>

2166
01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:38.670
<v Speaker 2>the two guys are still friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're older now and the two cops</v>

2167
01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:39.543
<v Speaker 2>are still friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2168
01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 2>the car and the truck dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're buddies.</v>

2169
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Like Michael Dow visited the dude to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>save and put pictures of the two of them</v>

<v Speaker 5>get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're going to be on edge no</v>

<v Speaker 5>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever you're starting something that,</v>

2184
01:35:17.671 --> 01:35:18.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like bad,</v>

2187
01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:24.420
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're nervous.</v>

2188
01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:27.440
<v Speaker 5>Do you just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just life and then one day it</v>

2189
01:35:27.441 --> 01:35:31.160
<v Speaker 5>just all fucking gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you do eventually forget that day is</v>

2191
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:35.270
<v Speaker 5>coming.</v>

2192
01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.770
<v Speaker 5>I think when you do a lot of coke you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>just always.</v>

2193
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 5>And then you try and get some sleep and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you wake up in the morning.</v>

<v Speaker 5>really gone by the time I saw her.</v>

2242
01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:45.680
<v Speaker 5>She was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's one of the reasons my gals</v>

<v Speaker 5>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:50.390
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did adderall.</v>

2246
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:51.283
<v Speaker 5>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2247
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:55.070
<v Speaker 5>I did ecstasy once.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Pull that up.</v>

2249
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's the division?</v>

2250
01:37:58.110 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Adderall in math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a very minor difference means.</v>

2251
01:38:01.081 --> 01:38:02.570
<v Speaker 2>And it depends which one you take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>

2252
01:38:02.571 --> 01:38:04.530
<v Speaker 2>But look it up at there's more than one</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of adderall,</v>

2253
01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of outer or adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like things.</v>

2254
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because generic form is and it's very</v>

2255
01:38:08.911 --> 01:38:13.060
<v Speaker 2>similar things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking pill pill head kick in at</v>

2256
01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 2>once or twice and I got a different one</v>
<v Speaker 2>each time I took it,</v>

2257
01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 2>so that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd hate to say that I enjoy from time</v>

2258
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:22.260
<v Speaker 2>to time a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a like a Vicodin or percocet?</v>

2259
01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like vary from time to time.</v>

2260
01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I tried one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember which one it was.</v>

2261
01:38:28.501 --> 01:38:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Vicodin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but didn't agree with me.</v>

2262
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:31.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2263
01:38:31.591 --> 01:38:34.560

<v Speaker 2>I just was really out of it.</v>

2264
01:38:35.010 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chemically adderalls and mixture of</v>

2265
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:38.760
<v Speaker 2>several amphetamine salts specifically.</v>

2266
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's composed of equal parts of</v>

2267

<v Speaker 2>amphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspartate monohydrate,</v>

2268
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.530
<v Speaker 2>amphetamine sulfate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dextro,</v>

2271
01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference between adderall</v>

2272
01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:03.720
<v Speaker 2>and Meth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

<v Speaker 2>meth is methamphetamine.</v>

2284
01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:41.250
<v Speaker 2>The difference between the two is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules is one methyl group.</v>

2285
01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:46.140
<v Speaker 2>So they're both amphetamines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one is a different kind of</v>

2286
01:39:46.141 --> 01:39:47.730
<v Speaker 2>amphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're very close.</v>

2287
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2288
01:39:49.090 --> 01:39:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For taking it for those three days,</v>

2289
01:39:50.971 --> 01:39:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd never felt like a itch to go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2290
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Some people love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2291
01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:58.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people fucking love it.</v>

2292
01:39:58.570 --> 01:40:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely think you got a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

2293
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:01.770
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're uh,</v>

2294
01:40:01.771 --> 01:40:05.030
<v Speaker 2>you're always like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking upbeat sort of a dude.</v>

2295
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Some people I don't think have that kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of energy and maybe whether it's health</v>

2296
01:40:08.881 --> 01:40:12.000
<v Speaker 2>related or not a little pick me up like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an adderall gives you a little</v>

2297
01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:19.110
<v Speaker 2>feeling of getting shit done and</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently it's great for school.</v>

2298
01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Kids that are in school are cramming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2299
01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.220
<v Speaker 2>keep you up and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things that like,</v>

2300
01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the.</v>

2301
01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:31.170
<v Speaker 2>But I know it's the like it calms you</v>
<v Speaker 2>down or ramps you up.</v>

2302
01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Freaks you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get how that it is like how</v>

2304
01:40:35.281 --> 01:40:38.640
<v Speaker 2>different could it with chemical B and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2305
01:40:38.641 --> 01:40:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you have queer retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly not scientists.</v>

2306
01:40:45.130 --> 01:40:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I wasted one of these lab coats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not convinced it's even,</v>

2307
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know it has some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on people,</v>

2308
01:40:51.871 --> 01:40:53.770
<v Speaker 2>but the way it's been distributed</v>

2309
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.140
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they're giving it to kids,</v>

2310
01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:59.230
<v Speaker 5>like it's one of the most controversial</v>
<v Speaker 5>things of giving these psychoactive</v>

2311
01:40:59.231 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 5>compounds to kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Knowing the longterm effects of it.</v>

2312
01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:05.410
<v Speaker 5>And so many doctors are just so willing</v>
<v Speaker 5>to jump into it and give them,</v>

2313
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.650
<v Speaker 5>give these kids pills the as long as</v>
<v Speaker 5>their parents are into it,</v>

2314
01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:12.070
<v Speaker 5>they'll just fucking order it away to</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep asking about documentaries.</v>

2315
01:41:12.071 --> 01:41:14.080
<v Speaker 5>Did you watch the thalidomide one yet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2316
01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:17.650
<v Speaker 5>that's gotta be terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They gave it to the moms.</v>

2317
01:41:17.651 --> 01:41:20.440
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they say,</v>

2318
01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:24.550
<v Speaker 5>I'll see I see it on Netflix but I keep</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting nervous to watch it because I'm</v>

2319
01:41:24.551 --> 01:41:26.350
<v Speaker 5>like it's gonna that's gonna be a bum</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2320
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:31.630
<v Speaker 5>There's some crazy drugs that they gave</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that they had an idea of some</v>

2321
01:41:31.631 --> 01:41:34.630
<v Speaker 5>risks but they didn't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they really know until you</v>

2322
01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:38.050
<v Speaker 5>give it to like a million people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you find out like oh this can</v>

2323
01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 5>happen too and this can happen too.</v>

2324
01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:44.350
<v Speaker 5>And then by the time it's too late</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with these horrible birth</v>

2325
01:41:44.351 --> 01:41:49.351
<v Speaker 5>defects with thalidomide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also funny how much like the stuff</v>

2326
01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:50.800
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2327
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.700
<v Speaker 5>they just keep adding for legal reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff to those warnings on ship.</v>

2328
01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:58.900
<v Speaker 5>But they don't really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you ask like specific things to the</v>

2329
01:41:58.901 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 5>pharmacist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I remember like Lexapro the</v>

2330
01:42:02.441 --> 01:42:06.940
<v Speaker 5>first time I went on tour with like corn</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Rob Zombie so and like a bunch of</v>

2331
01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:07.870
<v Speaker 5>bands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I was like,</v>

2332
01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe drink a little bit.</v>

2333
01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:14.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big huge drinker but I'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>drink on this a little bit and smoke</v>

2334
01:42:14.531 --> 01:42:16.660
<v Speaker 5>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'd asked the pharmacist and I was</v>

2335
01:42:16.661 --> 01:42:18.790
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says here do not drink with us at</v>

2336
01:42:18.791 --> 01:42:19.624
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

2337
01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:21.730
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just because like that's just part</v>

2338
01:42:21.731 --> 01:42:22.481
<v Speaker 5>of the thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2339
01:42:22.481 --> 01:42:24.300
<v Speaker 5>so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're taking some of the</v>

2340
01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 5>antidepressant of sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like why would you take a depressant to</v>

2341
01:42:29.141 --> 01:42:30.280
<v Speaker 5>bring it back down?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2342
01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.350
<v Speaker 5>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not for like in my mind I was</v>

2343
01:42:32.351 --> 01:42:35.200
<v Speaker 5>going to be like take a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drink a beer,</v>

2344
01:42:35.201 --> 01:42:37.390
<v Speaker 5>like explode like a seagull with an</v>
<v Speaker 5>episode.</v>

2345
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 5>But my fear was is that work a seagull</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Alka Seltzer.</v>

2346
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:45.340
<v Speaker 5>I video ever video of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was the thing when I was</v>

2347
01:42:45.341 --> 01:42:47.020
<v Speaker 5>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you give Alka Seltzer with seagull,</v>

2348
01:42:47.021 --> 01:42:47.854
<v Speaker 5>they'll explode.</v>

2349
01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:53.050
<v Speaker 5>I remember vaguely hearing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's an actual thing.</v>

2350
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know either.</v>

2351
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:58.750
<v Speaker 5>Exploding seagulls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what we want to know the Lexapro.</v>

2352
01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:03.430
<v Speaker 5>Did we talk about this before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure I got super like a physical</v>

2353
01:43:03.431 --> 01:43:06.070
<v Speaker 5>reaction to anxiety that I've never had</v>
<v Speaker 5>before in my life.</v>

2354
01:43:06.071 --> 01:43:08.080
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never really thought I had anxiety.</v>

2355
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:11.050
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then right before I was going on</v>

2356
01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:15.190
<v Speaker 5>tour with those bands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got very nervous on top of like having</v>

2357
01:43:15.191 --> 01:43:20.191
<v Speaker 5>a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a landlord dispute out of nowhere.</v>

2358
01:43:20.441 --> 01:43:23.320
<v Speaker 5>I think they just read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get charged more for our place and</v>

2359
01:43:23.321 --> 01:43:24.430
<v Speaker 5>so they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2360
01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:25.780
<v Speaker 5>you've been great tenants for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2361
01:43:25.781 --> 01:43:26.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get out.</v>

2362
01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.830
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my daughter was in school still and we</v>

2363
01:43:29.831 --> 01:43:32.560
<v Speaker 5>just kinda like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we sent a letter just sort of asking</v>

2364
01:43:32.561 --> 01:43:33.394
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2365
01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:35.290
<v Speaker 5>can we hang in there for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2366
01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:36.580
<v Speaker 5>gives like three more months.</v>

2367
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Just like she finished the school year</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they just served us with court</v>

2368
01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:40.800
<v Speaker 5>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2369
01:43:41.110 --> 01:43:43.150
<v Speaker 5>So we ended up winning that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was fine,</v>

2370
01:43:43.151 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Speaker 5>but it was very tense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2371
01:43:44.611 --> 01:43:47.170
<v Speaker 5>like they called the cops on us a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>just making shit up.</v>

2372
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:50.170
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This old Asian lady bit.</v>

2373
01:43:50.171 --> 01:43:53.060

<v Speaker 5>This was one of the landlords.</v>

2374
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:54.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>

2375
01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:57.110

<v Speaker 5>It was because she was just like trying</v>

2376
01:43:57.111 --> 01:44:00.710
<v Speaker 5>to film us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like going into the house or something.</v>

2377
01:44:01.130 --> 01:44:04.940
<v Speaker 5>So my ex wife to women's getting shitty</v>
<v Speaker 5>with each other and one doesn't speak</v>

2379
01:44:06.231 --> 01:44:08.450
<v Speaker 5>they're filming each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the lady I bit her hand while</v>

01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:11.480
<v Speaker 5>she was telling it got like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>volatile in one day.</v>

2381

<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on the computer watching something</v>

2382

<v Speaker 5>and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it popped back on whatever it was,</v>

2383
01:44:18.951 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 5>like my hands went numb and I've never</v>
<v Speaker 5>had it in my life.</v>

2384
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:22.123
<v Speaker 5>And I just,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm sure I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Woke up in the morning,</v>

2388
01:44:28.881 --> 01:44:31.550
<v Speaker 5>didn't feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then after like a month or two I</v>

2389
01:44:31.551 --> 01:44:33.260
<v Speaker 5>ended up doing on what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lexapro.</v>

2390
01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:36.290
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was just a combined anxiety thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>All tests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh no shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like anxiety is like a major issue in my</v>

2395
01:44:44.181 --> 01:44:46.150
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't before then now.</v>

2396

<v Speaker 5>As a man.</v>

2462
01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Especially as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lose muscle tissue,</v>

2463
01:47:24.961 --> 01:47:27.780
<v Speaker 5>your bones going to get weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the best way to keep that.</v>

2464

<v Speaker 5>One of the only ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean your body's supposed to be doing</v>

2465

<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2466
01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.030

<v Speaker 5>you can just all day long have very</v>

2467
01:47:36.031 --> 01:47:38.430
<v Speaker 5>minimal movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not natural for a person.</v>

2468
01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:40.840
<v Speaker 5>I think we did talk this before by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>crossfit for a little while and that's</v>

2469
01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:44.070
<v Speaker 5>just like a lot of injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not an advocate.</v>

<v Speaker 5>some people love it.</v>

2471
01:47:45.781 --> 01:47:48.090

2475
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:58.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a good idea to jump</v>
<v Speaker 5>into like fat person who has not worked</v>

2476
01:47:58.801 --> 01:48:00.660

01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:30.210
<v Speaker 5>but I do similar exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand what they're doing.</v>

2511
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:32.250
<v Speaker 5>Kettlebell stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love Kettlebells,</v>

2512
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:37.080
<v Speaker 5>but I'm more of the proponent of um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially now I've been listening to</v>

2513
01:49:37.081 --> 01:49:38.870
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pavel tattooing,</v>

2514
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:39.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is,</v>

2515
01:49:40.230 --> 01:49:43.310
<v Speaker 5>he's the guy that brought kettle bells</v>
<v Speaker 5>to America and uh,</v>

2516
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:46.290
<v Speaker 5>between him and I learned a lot from</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>

2517
01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 5>Steve Maxwell's on my podcast</v>

2518
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:53.220
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of times and they are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>proponents of lifting heavy weights for</v>

2519
01:49:54.641 --> 01:49:57.580
<v Speaker 2>lower repetitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this other guy named</v>

2520
01:49:57.581 --> 01:50:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Keith Weber who's got a totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>different approach,</v>

2521
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's just an endurance workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got this thing called extreme</v>

2522
01:50:03.641 --> 01:50:06.730
<v Speaker 2>kettlebell cardio workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that with a 35 pound</v>

2523
01:50:06.731 --> 01:50:08.560
<v Speaker 2>kettlebell man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little light kettlebell.</v>

2524
01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's so much work and there's so</v>

2525
01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:13.630
<v Speaker 2>much body weight involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just fall and he does it with you.</v>

2526
01:50:13.631 --> 01:50:16.110
<v Speaker 2>And he's a stud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in incredible shape and handling</v>

2527
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.000
<v Speaker 2>other workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different ones.</v>

2528
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a bunch of different ones that</v>

2529
01:50:21.641 --> 01:50:24.550
<v Speaker 2>work your upper body lower body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

2530
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:26.740
<v Speaker 2>the ones I usually do is off the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

2531
01:50:26.741 --> 01:50:29.680
<v Speaker 2>He's got three videos now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ones I usually do off the first</v>

2532
01:50:29.681 --> 01:50:33.870
<v Speaker 2>video I think are about 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone like your dad by the time that</v>

2533
01:50:33.871 --> 01:50:36.130
<v Speaker 2>was 40 minutes is up 42 minutes maybe.</v>

2534
01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Or they can do those in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need one kettlebell you need.</v>

2536
01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:43.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like hot potatoes,</v>

2537
01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 2>being standing rose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch the hands and you just keep going</v>

2538
01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:47.560
<v Speaker 2>and going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you like little breaks.</v>

2539
01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 2>But then you just keep going and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2540
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:51.460
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that 35 pound weight just feels like an</v>

2541
01:50:51.461 --> 01:50:52.600
<v Speaker 2>eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like.</v>

2542
01:50:52.601 --> 01:50:55.960

<v Speaker 2>It feels like you lifted 75 pounds by</v>

2543
01:50:55.961 --> 01:50:57.010
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2544
01:50:57.060 --> 01:51:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I got into doing like as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll go on the road a lot too.</v>

2545
01:51:01.511 --> 01:51:04.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like trying to find out like hotel</v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

2546
01:51:04.151 --> 01:51:06.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't like going to the hotel gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely get a lot of work done in</v>

2562
01:51:39.311 --> 01:51:42.580
<v Speaker 2>a small space and like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole workout,</v>

2563
01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:45.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a 100 squats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 sit ups,</v>

2564
01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:48.190
<v Speaker 2>80 lunges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 burpees,</v>

2565
01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.860

<v Speaker 2>100 squats,</v>

2566
01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:53.000
<v Speaker 2>bodyweight squats is a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2567
01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's jacked.</v>

2568
01:51:55.690 --> 01:51:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure my calves are shredded from</v>
<v Speaker 2>kettering.</v>

2569
01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:59.830
<v Speaker 2>My body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole life has probably kick a hole</v>

2570
01:51:59.831 --> 01:52:03.460
<v Speaker 2>through a wall about how much weight he</v>
<v Speaker 2>carries all the time and he's still,</v>

2571
01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:04.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a big ass legs.</v>

2572
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:07.510
<v Speaker 2>You got to assume that your body has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry around that much when he gets a</v>

2573
01:52:07.511 --> 01:52:11.380
<v Speaker 2>certain kind of a fat person because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely people who get fat</v>

2574
01:52:11.381 --> 01:52:16.240
<v Speaker 2>where it's like their limbs or doe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't necessarily that kind of</v>

2575
01:52:16.241 --> 01:52:19.540
<v Speaker 2>fat and I'm not that kind of fat now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's always my legs for some reason.</v>

2576
01:52:19.541 --> 01:52:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I've always been like just jack from</v>
<v Speaker 2>just carrying around the body weight of</v>

2577
01:52:22.661 --> 01:52:24.210
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean there's obviously just get</v>

2578
01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:27.550
<v Speaker 2>those big crazy legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my legs have always been oddly</v>

2579
01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:31.840
<v Speaker 2>muscular can then my body's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human body's very strange in that</v>

2580
01:52:31.841 --> 01:52:34.000
<v Speaker 2>you could change it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can move it around,</v>

2581
01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 2>you see a rhino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's built like a fucking rhino,</v>

2582
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:40.990
<v Speaker 2>but a human being can through</v>
<v Speaker 2>weightlifting and diet and you know,</v>

2583
01:52:40.991 --> 01:52:45.991
<v Speaker 2>just concentrating on stuffing your face</v>
<v Speaker 2>with calories and constantly hitting</v>

2584
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:49.330
<v Speaker 5>like heavy cleans and snatches and dead</v>
<v Speaker 5>lifts.</v>

2585
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 5>You can get way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2586
01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:53.480
<v Speaker 5>You just gotTa keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just got to keep doing it.</v>

2587
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:55.790
<v Speaker 5>Going backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the hardest thing.</v>

2588
01:52:55.791 --> 01:52:59.750
<v Speaker 5>That's why that a gay pride parade was</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sunday,</v>

2589
01:52:59.751 --> 01:53:02.300
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the day I got here and I went</v>

2590
01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.990
<v Speaker 5>over to the comedy store and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>walking when I went to eat dinner at the</v>

2591
01:53:05.991 --> 01:53:10.220
<v Speaker 5>rainbow bar and grill and it's right</v>
<v Speaker 5>next to that one oak place which was</v>

2592
01:53:10.221 --> 01:53:15.221
<v Speaker 5>having I guess a big gay blow out and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were all outside and like cutoff</v>

2593

<v Speaker 5>shorts and shirtless and just fantastic</v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies.</v>

2594
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:22.580
<v Speaker 5>Every one of them and I was just like at</v>
<v Speaker 5>sucks.</v>

2595
01:53:22.581 --> 01:53:27.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm just passed an age and the damage</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done to my body just from being a</v>

2596
01:53:27.231 --> 01:53:29.510

2598
01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:33.650
<v Speaker 5>It's always a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How come you never looked like that?</v>

2599

<v Speaker 5>or being a thin kid or a kid in high</v>
<v Speaker 5>school that could,</v>

2623
01:54:42.651 --> 01:54:44.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2624
01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:47.330

<v Speaker 5>coolest clothes that just having to get</v>

2625
01:54:47.331 --> 01:54:50.470
<v Speaker 5>like big and tall ship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2626
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:52.550
<v Speaker 5>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They cut your skin,</v>

2627
01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.290
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one way they deal with that.</v>

2628
01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:55.820
<v Speaker 5>When they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're always going to be.</v>

2629
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:57.380
<v Speaker 5>I've seen all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2630
01:54:57.381 --> 01:54:58.880

<v Speaker 5>I would get it.</v>

2631
01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.180
<v Speaker 5>But you're always going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>frankensteinish [inaudible],</v>

2632
01:55:03.210 --> 01:55:05.910
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're always gonna have like,</v>

2633
01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen that car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me that's the decision of fake tits.</v>

2634
01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:10.191
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to be.</v>

2635
01:55:10.191 --> 01:55:15.191
<v Speaker 5>It's like you are like a part fake and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is marks to show how fake it is.</v>

2636
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:17.270
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always going to be like,</v>

2637
01:55:17.690 --> 01:55:20.270
<v Speaker 5>the nipples are always weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just stretching the body and you</v>

2638
01:55:20.271 --> 01:55:23.210
<v Speaker 5>put it into something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not supposed to be,</v>

2639
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:25.790
<v Speaker 5>but those don't seem to mind even a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit.</v>

2640
01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2641
01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.053
<v Speaker 5>not the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some.</v>

2642
01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:31.100
<v Speaker 5>Some guys hate fake tits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2643
01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big fan of those crazy like</v>

2644
01:55:33.921 --> 01:55:37.820
<v Speaker 5>softball ones where there's a big split</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the middle and that's all with that</v>

2645
01:55:37.821 --> 01:55:38.511
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2646
01:55:38.511 --> 01:55:40.240
<v Speaker 5>that's an awkward look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the,</v>

2647
01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.860
<v Speaker 5>the canyon between titties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2648
01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:45.300
<v Speaker 5>That's unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just rib cage in between it.</v>

2649
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:48.960
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a long stretch with one going like</v>

2650
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 5>northeast and one going northwest and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just like perfect circles.</v>

2651
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:54.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just odd.</v>

2652
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:56.010
<v Speaker 5>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they went too hard,</v>

2653
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you try to go to many cup sizes</v>

2654
01:55:58.441 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 5>over like some of these girls like</v>
<v Speaker 5>really lean and small girls and tits or</v>

2655
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:04.680
<v Speaker 5>just like fat bags golf at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2656
01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:07.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're beautiful fat bags.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This doesn't say you have to like,</v>

2657
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:10.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forget to put your foot in the middle of</v>

2658
01:56:10.081 --> 01:56:13.140
<v Speaker 5>their chest and like stretch their tits</v>
<v Speaker 5>skin health or wrap around this thing.</v>

2659
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:14.640
<v Speaker 5>It's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men,</v>

2660
01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:18.020
<v Speaker 5>have you ever see an operation when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>go in through the armpit and they got</v>

2661
01:56:18.021 --> 01:56:21.240
<v Speaker 5>like this hook and they're digging</v>
<v Speaker 5>underneath the armpit and they're</v>

2662
01:56:21.241 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 5>creating a cavity and then they have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff that cavity with his bag and then</v>

2663
01:56:25.831 --> 01:56:29.610
<v Speaker 5>fill it up with water and they just</v>
<v Speaker 5>squeeze her tit for half hour.</v>

2664
01:56:29.611 --> 01:56:31.350
<v Speaker 5>I guess they're hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Hard,</v>

2665
01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 5>but solid bags now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not like a bag that they fill up</v>

2666
01:56:35.311 --> 01:56:36.280
<v Speaker 5>with water now.</v>

2667
01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:41.300
<v Speaker 5>I guess the more popular one is like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>softer fully formed thing that sits in</v>

2668
01:56:42.091 --> 01:56:45.420
<v Speaker 5>your body and you have to always worry</v>
<v Speaker 5>about your body rejecting it to.</v>

2669
01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.340
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the real issue.</v>

2670
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:51.180
<v Speaker 5>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were looking at Dick Enhancement</v>

2671
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:56.040
<v Speaker 5>surgery's not too long ago and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually have where they put a fucking</v>

2672
01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.910
<v Speaker 5>piece of plastic in your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like make it like try to actually</v>

2673
01:56:59.911 --> 01:57:01.680
<v Speaker 5>lengthen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lengthen the hang,</v>

2674
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.380
<v Speaker 5>which advised to pick a Dick Surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the one I'd pick,</v>

2675
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:07.260
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just seems like the risk versus</v>

2676
01:57:07.261 --> 01:57:08.560
<v Speaker 5>reward on that one man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2677
01:57:08.561 --> 01:57:10.410
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to experiment on Dick's in</v>

2678
01:57:10.411 --> 01:57:14.730
<v Speaker 5>order to perfect that surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like there's a lot of donating</v>

2679
01:57:14.731 --> 01:57:18.570
<v Speaker 5>their dicks Dick lengthening science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've got a practice that shit on live</v>

2680
01:57:18.571 --> 01:57:20.310
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how they get approval.</v>

2681
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:22.680
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen that go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2682
01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:25.620
<v Speaker 5>the only videos to like any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>dicks surgery go well.</v>

2683
01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:27.990
<v Speaker 5>It's always fucking crazy looking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2684
01:57:27.991 --> 01:57:29.610
<v Speaker 5>because nobody wants to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to hear,</v>

2685
01:57:29.611 --> 01:57:30.690
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a four inch deck,</v>

2686
01:57:30.691 --> 01:57:32.760
<v Speaker 5>but now I got a six look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>check it out.</v>

2687
01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.400
<v Speaker 5>This is what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it never even ended up being like a</v>

2688
01:57:35.401 --> 01:57:37.740
<v Speaker 5>forced it to become six.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be great for people.</v>

2689
01:57:37.741 --> 01:57:42.741
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it's like you had like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>five inch or four inch like regular Dick</v>

2690
01:57:43.051 --> 01:57:45.120
<v Speaker 5>and now it looks like this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fucking,</v>

2691
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.360
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a wiggly worm or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used to grab it and it scored out of</v>

2692
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:49.920
<v Speaker 5>your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it looks like.</v>

2693
01:57:49.921 --> 01:57:52.620
<v Speaker 5>It's just like big fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doughy thing.</v>

2694
01:57:52.710 --> 01:57:56.970
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't get really hard because it</v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like it looks like it got stung by</v>

2695
01:57:56.971 --> 01:57:59.900
<v Speaker 5>a bee or like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like there's a problem with off</v>

2696
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:03.740
<v Speaker 5>with poison ivy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best surgery ever was at bucket</v>

2697
01:58:03.741 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 5>where they put out that Baba Guy's Dick</v>
<v Speaker 5>back together,</v>

<v Speaker 5>staples across it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2703
01:58:17.911 --> 01:58:20.670
<v Speaker 5>Like he got his dick to almost work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did porn.</v>

2704
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:22.970
<v Speaker 5>It's so weird looking those still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

<v Speaker 5>bone and everything.</v>

2710

<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one question.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you are going to hurt me if this goes</v>

2735
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:35.590
<v Speaker 5>haywire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like please settle down with him.</v>

2736
01:59:36.370 --> 01:59:40.610
<v Speaker 8>It's actually a his penises amputated</v>
<v Speaker 8>after he had penile cancer.</v>

2737
01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.800
<v Speaker 8>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You got.</v>

2738
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:44.780
<v Speaker 8>That's a pretty good reason to get.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2739
01:59:44.781 --> 01:59:48.710
<v Speaker 8>I think the first guy that ever got it</v>
<v Speaker 8>wasn't an American guy.</v>

2740
01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:51.800
<v Speaker 8>That guy may be the one that I was</v>
<v Speaker 8>thinking of that had the car accident.</v>

2741
01:59:52.190 --> 01:59:55.400
<v Speaker 8>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's one in South Africa to 21 year</v>

2742
01:59:55.401 --> 01:59:57.650
<v Speaker 8>old who had.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm seeing this lost it.</v>

2743
01:59:58.050 --> 02:00:02.400
<v Speaker 8>It said he had complications after he</v>
<v Speaker 8>had to have his penis for complicated.</v>

2744
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:07.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Circumcision complications that happens.</v>

2745
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:10.000
<v Speaker 5>People lose their dicks every year from</v>
<v Speaker 5>circumcision,</v>

2746
02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.340
<v Speaker 5>probably more than die rollercoaster</v>
<v Speaker 5>rides.</v>

2747
02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:14.120
<v Speaker 5>When I was in DC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2748
02:00:14.170 --> 02:00:17.770
<v Speaker 5>recently we went down by the White House</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was a big rally.</v>

2749
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 5>Anti circumcision rally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2750
02:00:20.050 --> 02:00:21.880
<v Speaker 5>Yelling out facts and I don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're facts.</v>

2751
02:00:21.881 --> 02:00:25.030
<v Speaker 5>It says circumcision confirmed makes the</v>
<v Speaker 5>penis smaller.</v>

2752
02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:27.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it makes smaller,</v>

2753
02:00:27.581 --> 02:00:30.610
<v Speaker 5>but definitely makes it less sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could probably make it smaller.</v>

2754
02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.030
<v Speaker 5>Who knows about all that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you circumcised and you wish you</v>

2755
02:00:34.031 --> 02:00:35.140
<v Speaker 5>weren't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2756
02:00:35.170 --> 02:00:35.741
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay.</v>

2757
02:00:35.741 --> 02:00:38.140
<v Speaker 5>And you don't give a shit either way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think we should keep doing</v>

2758
02:00:38.141 --> 02:00:39.700
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely barbaric.</v>

2759
02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.860
<v Speaker 5>It's pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't do anything good.</v>

2760
02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.050
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing healthy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

2761
02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 5>It's an ancient tribal ritual that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are trying to justify.</v>

2762
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.010
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that has done for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>aesthetic aesthetic.</v>

2763
02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:52.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's ridiculous.</v>

2764
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:55.440
<v Speaker 5>I've seen porn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're dudes of uncircumcised dicks.</v>

2765
02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.880
<v Speaker 5>Look Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like a dick with some extra skin.</v>

2766
02:00:58.240 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 5>It looks foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2767
02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:01.750
<v Speaker 5>Did he ever got bombed out of the girl's</v>
<v Speaker 5>pussy with extra skin?</v>

2768
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:03.450
<v Speaker 5>Does that bother you at even?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little bit?</v>

2769
02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.900
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've definitely talked about those</v>

2770
02:01:04.901 --> 02:01:05.870
<v Speaker 5>more than others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like them.</v>

2771
02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:08.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the Norton camp.</v>

2772
02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:10.090
<v Speaker 5>A real beef.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want like a meaty one?</v>

2773
02:01:10.190 --> 02:01:13.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind the meeting when I don't</v>

2774
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:14.110
<v Speaker 5>mind it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm always like.</v>

2775
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:16.840
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting how it looks like real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real flappy.</v>

2776
02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:20.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't bother me at all,</v>

2777
02:01:20.381 --> 02:01:22.930
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that they trim those is</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrendous.</v>

2778
02:01:22.931 --> 02:01:26.440
<v Speaker 5>Like that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Flips trimmed to get them cut off.</v>

2779
02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.210
<v Speaker 5>It's their lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Surgery lab,</v>

2780
02:01:28.211 --> 02:01:30.760
<v Speaker 5>a deck tummy or maybe plasty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2781
02:01:30.761 --> 02:01:32.560
<v Speaker 5>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>

2782
02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:37.580
<v Speaker 5>At one point started putting like frozen</v>
<v Speaker 5>in whatever plastic and Houston mafia</v>

2783
02:01:37.751 --> 02:01:39.610

<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile that was her pussy.</v>

2784
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:42.320
<v Speaker 5>Part of her appeal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what a lot of guys liked about</v>

2785
02:01:42.321 --> 02:01:44.930

<v Speaker 5>probably in the eighties through the</v>

<v Speaker 5>nineties.</v>

2995
02:10:48.570 --> 02:10:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Not totally aware of the history because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you always got to wonder what that thing</v>

2996
02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:54.000
<v Speaker 5>like that did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much did it affect is like getting</v>

2997
02:10:54.001 --> 02:10:57.440
<v Speaker 5>an ass as a performer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was famous.</v>

2998
02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:00.170
<v Speaker 5>You probably stuck that right up there</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well.</v>

2999
02:11:00.171 --> 02:11:03.950
<v Speaker 5>He's got a choice 69 and it's going in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ass in your ass.</v>

3000
02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:07.280
<v Speaker 5>He's the person who's really upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pussy is so close to the Esol,</v>

3001
02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:09.890
<v Speaker 5>my leg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be one of those guys that likes</v>

3002
02:11:09.891 --> 02:11:11.090
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you got to knows that big,</v>

3003
02:11:11.091 --> 02:11:13.370
<v Speaker 5>who knows what you're smelling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might be smelling things like a dog</v>

3004
02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:15.800
<v Speaker 5>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dog seemed to enjoy really fucking</v>

3005
02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:19.010
<v Speaker 5>stinky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smells might be because their sense of</v>

3006
02:11:19.011 --> 02:11:21.470
<v Speaker 5>smell is so much more potent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's just start that room.</v>

3007
02:11:21.471 --> 02:11:23.040
<v Speaker 5>Or Jimmy Duranti.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As Wolf powers,</v>

3008
02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:27.050
<v Speaker 5>wolf smell</v>
<v Speaker 5>senses.</v>

3009
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:31.490
<v Speaker 5>Smell was it explained to me in a real</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird way like the differences between a</v>

3010
02:11:31.491 --> 02:11:33.890
<v Speaker 5>person who dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this way is a good way.</v>

3011
02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:35.900
<v Speaker 5>If you ever want to like pictured in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your head.</v>

3012
02:11:36.710 --> 02:11:38.720
<v Speaker 5>You know how when a skunk sprays in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>air,</v>

3013
02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:42.050
<v Speaker 5>it's only a certain amount of parts per</v>
<v Speaker 5>million and you could smell it.</v>

3014
02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.090
<v Speaker 5>You can be nowhere near it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3015
02:11:44.091 --> 02:11:46.100
<v Speaker 5>for a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's like that.</v>

3016
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:51.050
<v Speaker 5>So like a skunk can spray something and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he could spray something in a block</v>

3017
02:11:51.051 --> 02:11:53.030
<v Speaker 5>somewhere and it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll be a block away like,</v>

3018
02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:54.350
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking skunk.</v>

3019
02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:57.410
<v Speaker 5>And you smell it for a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could smell person like that.</v>

3020
02:11:57.790 --> 02:11:59.840
<v Speaker 5>Just always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything could just smell things.</v>

3021
02:11:59.841 --> 02:12:01.580
<v Speaker 5>It's just a matter of picking these</v>
<v Speaker 5>things out.</v>

3022
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:02.940
<v Speaker 5>So just trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3023
02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:05.270
<v Speaker 5>like you hear a sound to your right and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3024
02:12:05.271 --> 02:12:07.580
<v Speaker 5>instinctively your ears telling you it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that direction.</v>

3025
02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:09.320
<v Speaker 5>What were the dog?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's similar to that.</v>

3026
02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:11.090
<v Speaker 5>Especially like a bloodhound or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3027
02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:14.630
<v Speaker 5>Do you know they have those long ass</v>
<v Speaker 5>ears to make the smell come to their</v>

3028
02:12:14.631 --> 02:12:15.464
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>

3029
02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.280
<v Speaker 5>Know when dogs are like bloodhounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have these crazy long ass ears that</v>

3030
02:12:20.281 --> 02:12:23.450
<v Speaker 5>so that the smells waft up into their</v>
<v Speaker 5>face when dogs,</v>

3031
02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:26.780
<v Speaker 5>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like intelligent dogs doing anything.</v>

3032
02:12:26.781 --> 02:12:30.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm impressed when they find drugs or</v>
<v Speaker 5>any of that shit or fucking in the cars</v>

3033
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:35.300
<v Speaker 5>as my favorite on cops when they brought</v>
<v Speaker 5>the canine unit and he's like,</v>

3034
02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.520
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to search your car.</v>

3035
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:39.570
<v Speaker 5>You went the dog smell around the car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dog starts like</v>

3036
02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.680
<v Speaker 5>they opened the gas thing and there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>always some crystal meth pipe or</v>

3037
02:12:48.681 --> 02:12:50.610
<v Speaker 5>something in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tried different ways of hiding it</v>

3038
02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:51.460
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That just never worked.</v>

3039
02:12:51.461 --> 02:12:53.120
<v Speaker 5>Like you gotta you gotta put it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee.</v>

3040
02:12:53.190 --> 02:12:55.340
<v Speaker 5>A good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try getting that passed for those</v>

3041
02:12:55.341 --> 02:12:57.290
<v Speaker 5>fucking dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could smell it.</v>

3042
02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:59.300
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>

3043
02:12:59.301 --> 02:13:02.540
<v Speaker 5>They were bringing weed on those cruise</v>
<v Speaker 5>ships.</v>

<v Speaker 5>anything on the streets.</v>

3062
02:13:44.581 --> 02:13:46.170
<v Speaker 5>It's going to affect anybody else's</v>
<v Speaker 5>health.</v>

<v Speaker 5>defied by the time he went up on stage,</v>

3084
02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 5>there's no air in the room.</v>

3085
02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:44.610
<v Speaker 5>It's all smoke and breathing and pot</v>
<v Speaker 5>smoke.</v>

3086
02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:47.220
<v Speaker 5>There was no ventilation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dave Smith who was just here A.</v>

<v Speaker 5>ago?</v>

3089
02:14:49.161 --> 02:14:50.640
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like the weekend before he came</v>

3090
02:14:50.641 --> 02:14:52.860
<v Speaker 5>out here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did it and uh,</v>

3091
02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 5>he was not smoking weed for about six</v>
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

3092
02:14:55.590 --> 02:14:58.920
<v Speaker 5>He stopped and then he's right back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't go.</v>

3093
02:14:58.921 --> 02:15:00.170
<v Speaker 5>They're not.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's a cool little spot,</v>

3098
02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:13.000
<v Speaker 5>but if you don't smoke weed you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 5>go because you can't stay in there for a</v>

3099
02:15:13.001 --> 02:15:16.770
<v Speaker 5>length of time because you realize it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a different temperature in that room</v>

3100
02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:20.220

<v Speaker 5>She was in the public eye for awhile and</v>

3160
02:18:20.051 --> 02:18:22.350
<v Speaker 5>then I realize how stupid it will still</v>
<v Speaker 5>be in the public eye.</v>

3161
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:23.470

3162
02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:28.480

3163
02:18:28.481 --> 02:18:30.380
<v Speaker 5>is to have people attack you and they're</v>

<v Speaker 5>the assault.</v>

3169
02:18:44.321 --> 02:18:44.831
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bailed.</v>

3172
02:18:47.791 --> 02:18:49.540

<v Speaker 5>eye.</v>

3173
02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:52.630
<v Speaker 5>Like entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I slipped away because she wasn't</v>

3174
02:18:52.631 --> 02:18:55.090
<v Speaker 5>desperate enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's what it is like when you,</v>

3175
02:18:55.091 --> 02:18:55.924
<v Speaker 5>when you need to.</v>

3176
02:18:56.010 --> 02:18:58.600
<v Speaker 5>That's when you have the desperation of</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanting fame.</v>

3177
02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:01.810
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want fame already have the money.</v>

3178
02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:05.110

<v Speaker 5>Like wanting fame and needing the money</v>

3179
02:19:05.111 --> 02:19:07.720
<v Speaker 5>is such a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why the bad girls club show is</v>

3180
02:19:07.721 --> 02:19:10.210
<v Speaker 5>the greatest thing on TV.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They get like we talked about this eight</v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces of garbage and then they just</v>

<v Speaker 5>thing like that's what people want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>

<v Speaker 5>let's do it.</v>

3283
02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Is this bad?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Makes a little larger from the episode.</v>

3284
02:24:46.441 --> 02:24:48.040
<v Speaker 5>The Ugly Duckling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a season.</v>

3285
02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:52.740
<v Speaker 5>Ward Tunisia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tunisia now hosts all the reunions.</v>

02:24:53.250 --> 02:24:56.310
<v Speaker 5>She's a big fat black lady.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>

3287
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:59.580
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to know if you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to give them and find the</v>

3288
02:24:59.581 --> 02:25:01.020
<v Speaker 5>arguments yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>

3289
02:25:01.021 --> 02:25:03.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're just doing them in</v>

3290
02:25:03.271 --> 02:25:05.140
<v Speaker 5>general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the whole episode would take anyway,</v>

3291
02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:07.920
<v Speaker 5>but just finding like a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when they start getting into it</v>

3292
02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:12.980
<v Speaker 5>like a torque level flight</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they try to have them be like</v>

3293
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:16.230
<v Speaker 5>emotional moments like with like a life</v>
<v Speaker 5>coach.</v>

3294
02:25:16.410 --> 02:25:18.480
<v Speaker 5>But that show will be so much better if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were narrating it.</v>

3295
02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:19.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you should reach out to them.</v>

3297
02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:22.783
<v Speaker 5>It really should.</v>

3298
02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a narrator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3299
02:25:25.690 --> 02:25:28.780
<v Speaker 2>What they do now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the Internet of Commercial</v>

02:25:28.781 --> 02:25:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad girls club.</v>

3301
02:25:29.950 --> 02:25:32.380

<v Speaker 2>narrator,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He'll do the whole season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a</v>

02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:51.603
<v Speaker 5>say a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3310
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:54.670
<v Speaker 5>every season.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always a new batch of people who</v>

3311
02:25:54.671 --> 02:25:56.980
<v Speaker 5>were idiots and want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great idea.</v>

3312
02:25:57.010 --> 02:25:59.200
<v Speaker 5>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I started to find out now that</v>

3313
02:25:59.201 --> 02:26:02.610
<v Speaker 5>behind the scenes that reality stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they'll pull from other shows,</v>

3314
02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:06.070
<v Speaker 5>like the cast offs of something else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like somebody tried to,</v>

3315
02:26:06.130 --> 02:26:09.820

02:26:09.821 --> 02:26:11.710
<v Speaker 5>she didn't get the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then she got a call from another</v>

3317
02:26:11.711 --> 02:26:12.890
<v Speaker 5>producer a few days later.</v>

3324
02:26:24.731 --> 02:26:26.380
<v Speaker 2>other shows too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would do it that way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>going to be on TV.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

3345
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:04.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're watching like this artifact.</v>

3346
02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:08.950
<v Speaker 2>And the reality of reality shows is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all just,</v>

3347
02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:11.080
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like a curb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your enthusiasm thing with like</v>

3348
02:27:11.081 --> 02:27:14.470
<v Speaker 2>untalented people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scenarios are painted out.</v>

3349
02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:17.740
<v Speaker 2>They kind of know what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they get there and they just play</v>

3350
02:27:17.741 --> 02:27:21.850
<v Speaker 2>it out with their awful personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these pieces of shit hate each</v>

3351
02:27:21.851 --> 02:27:23.860
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are dead people.</v>

3352
02:27:23.861 --> 02:27:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Every one of them stayed behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them.</v>

3353
02:27:27.310 --> 02:27:30.850
<v Speaker 5>But I think if the show is just a wildly</v>
<v Speaker 5>hilarious,</v>

3354
02:27:31.090 --> 02:27:32.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made any of that.</v>

3355
02:27:32.741 --> 02:27:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like reality stuff like that started</v>

3356
02:27:36.101 --> 02:27:40.360
<v Speaker 5>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that show they had years back about all</v>

3357
02:27:40.361 --> 02:27:43.630
<v Speaker 5>the talk shows like Maury Povich back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jenny Jones and all that shit.</v>

3358
02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:45.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like same thing,</v>

3359
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:49.240
<v Speaker 5>like they really do a prey on the weak</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of ways.</v>

3360
02:27:49.241 --> 02:27:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3361
02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:53.320
<v Speaker 5>like these chicks are kind of asking for</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3362
02:27:53.321 --> 02:27:53.980
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

3363
02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:58.360
<v Speaker 5>and as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I kind of liken that to springer</v>

3364
02:27:58.361 --> 02:28:00.280
<v Speaker 5>now where there's just like people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

3365
02:28:00.281 --> 02:28:01.600
<v Speaker 5>what do they make up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The stories are not.</v>

3366
02:28:01.601 --> 02:28:01.931
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3367
02:28:01.931 --> 02:28:04.240
<v Speaker 5>we're going to go fake fistfight on</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jerry Springer,</v>

3368
02:28:04.241 --> 02:28:05.770
<v Speaker 5>show over a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3369
02:28:05.890 --> 02:28:09.190
<v Speaker 5>scrawny Hispanic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they kind of worked that out and</v>

3370
02:28:09.191 --> 02:28:11.350
<v Speaker 5>they give them booze and they incite</v>
<v Speaker 5>them to do it.</v>

3371
02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:16.920
<v Speaker 5>But the way they laugh at like these are</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're telling like life falling apart</v>

3372
02:28:17.231 --> 02:28:19.870
<v Speaker 5>stories and the way that you could even</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the person who's like,</v>

3373
02:28:19.871 --> 02:28:22.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your boyfriend's fucking your sister or</v>

3374
02:28:22.851 --> 02:28:25.430
<v Speaker 5>you already have a kid with the Guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kinda Shit at some point of the show.</v>

3375
02:28:25.431 --> 02:28:27.680
<v Speaker 5>The fact that she smiles and giggles at</v>
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

3376
02:28:27.890 --> 02:28:30.230
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not that real to her.</v>

3377
02:28:30.231 --> 02:28:32.270
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're making this up to some</v>

3378
02:28:32.271 --> 02:28:34.160
<v Speaker 5>degree because why would she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would never laugh.</v>

3379
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Like you probably genuinely leave the</v>
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

3380
02:28:37.130 --> 02:28:40.100
<v Speaker 5>but they go to them with booze and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of liked that,</v>

3381
02:28:40.350 --> 02:28:44.420
<v Speaker 5>lead them in a direction and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when they did that years ago,</v>

3382
02:28:44.421 --> 02:28:45.650
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3383
02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:49.100
<v Speaker 5>cheating shitter who's the father those</v>
<v Speaker 5>shows would try to do like,</v>

3384
02:28:49.101 --> 02:28:52.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have tried to cut off their own,</v>

3385
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:54.350
<v Speaker 5>like Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3386
02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:56.300
<v Speaker 5>because they hate their own dick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3387

<v Speaker 5>he's gripping news type things.</v>

3388
02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:01.370
<v Speaker 5>And same thing with them is they would</v>
<v Speaker 5>get them all.</v>

3389
02:29:01.371 --> 02:29:03.560
<v Speaker 5>Like they'd get these nervous people</v>
<v Speaker 5>just boost them up like that.</v>

3390
02:29:03.561 --> 02:29:06.950
<v Speaker 5>Really is like preying on the weak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just getting them like,</v>

02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:09.680
<v Speaker 5>am I just go get hammered and give it a</v>
<v Speaker 5>shot I guess,</v>

3392
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:12.950
<v Speaker 5>but if somebody doesn't eat the wounded</v>
<v Speaker 5>lay antelopes than the wounds,</v>

3393
02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:16.070
<v Speaker 5>antelopes will continue to make their</v>
<v Speaker 5>way into the waterhole.</v>

3394
02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:17.870
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crocodile will starve.</v>

3395
02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:22.940
<v Speaker 5>Jerry Springer's a crocodile and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>those jumps on that show their wounds</v>

<v Speaker 5>Probably cheaper too.</v>

3418
02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:14.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's probably why espn is</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3422
02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:23.870
<v Speaker 5>headquarters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of people like rich folks</v>

02:30:24.170 --> 02:30:26.210
<v Speaker 5>live in Connecticut and make that trip</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Manhattan.</v>

3424
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:29.600
<v Speaker 5>I know that's what letterman used to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>to what Baba booey does.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3427
02:30:31.431 --> 02:30:32.810
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a long ass drive.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I could be an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3430
02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:40.580
<v Speaker 5>maybe really bad now if you leave at a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good time,</v>

3431
02:30:40.581 --> 02:30:42.650
<v Speaker 5>it can be an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go into the stern studio,</v>

3432
02:30:42.651 --> 02:30:44.660
<v Speaker 5>you're going to Sirius,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sirius Xm,</v>

3433
02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:48.080
<v Speaker 5>and then you've got to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connecticut and your whole day.</v>

3434

<v Speaker 5>I really like this may be the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the only things that does make</v>

3571
02:36:22.451 --> 02:36:26.800
<v Speaker 5>sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the gas digital thing is all of us</v>

3572
02:36:26.801 --> 02:36:29.770
<v Speaker 5>in all of our kinds of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I do the SDR show sex,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And music people,</v>

3577
02:36:37.811 --> 02:36:38.590
<v Speaker 5>in porn stars.</v>

3578
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:42.070
<v Speaker 5>So we interviewed them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a legion of skanks nails,</v>

3579
02:36:42.071 --> 02:36:46.150
<v Speaker 5>me Louis and Dave Lewis has the real</v>
<v Speaker 5>last podcast he does by herself.</v>

3580
02:36:46.151 --> 02:36:47.350
<v Speaker 5>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's part of the problem,</v>

3581
02:36:47.351 --> 02:36:49.840
<v Speaker 5>which is the political when he does and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all in the same,</v>

3582
02:36:50.010 --> 02:36:53.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like all kinds of friends kind of,</v>

3583
02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:55.150
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like if you like one of these,</v>

3584
02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:56.710
<v Speaker 5>you'll like all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3585
02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:58.390

<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3586
02:36:58.391 --> 02:37:01.180
<v Speaker 5>but if you like elements of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something kind of for everyone</v>

3587
02:37:01.181 --> 02:37:03.910
<v Speaker 5>in this grouping of like this click of</v>
<v Speaker 5>comics,</v>

3588
02:37:03.911 --> 02:37:06.130

3594
02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:17.960

<v Speaker 5>unless you're exposing yourself to an</v>

3595
02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:19.070
<v Speaker 5>audience,</v>

<v Speaker 5>because it's very discoverable.</v>

3598
02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:30.200
<v Speaker 5>You're not playing to like just this</v>
<v Speaker 5>core audience,</v>

<v Speaker 5>We filled it with all fans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just did it.</v>

3645
02:39:25.551 --> 02:39:29.120

<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't be what I should have</v>

3648
02:39:33.081 --> 02:39:37.160
<v Speaker 5>gotten to in that story was when I got</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the tour going through all this</v>

02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:53.580
<v Speaker 5>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Central's taken some fucking chances,</v>

<v Speaker 5>roast battle show very big.</v>

3681
02:41:02.410 --> 02:41:03.660
<v Speaker 5>They took a big chance on me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3682
02:41:03.661 --> 02:41:05.280
<v Speaker 5>it was a work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a real like,</v>

3683
02:41:05.281 --> 02:41:07.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I got it,</v>

3684
02:41:07.141 --> 02:41:10.140
<v Speaker 5>I was why I got so emotional about it</v>
<v Speaker 5>really was because,</v>

3685
02:41:10.141 --> 02:41:13.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it shows like it came kind of out of</v>

3686
02:41:13.381 --> 02:41:15.750
<v Speaker 5>nowhere because three years ago I</v>
<v Speaker 5>pitched him that idea.</v>

3687
02:41:15.751 --> 02:41:16.531
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>David Tell,</v>

3688
02:41:16.531 --> 02:41:19.470
<v Speaker 5>doing his comedy underground thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>broke down some walls over there for</v>

3689
02:41:19.471 --> 02:41:21.390
<v Speaker 5>like producing a show.</v>

3690
02:41:21.690 --> 02:41:24.270
<v Speaker 5>Their issue was never being showing</v>
<v Speaker 5>dirty stuff.</v>

3691
02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:27.330
<v Speaker 5>They would acquire someone special in</v>
<v Speaker 5>plate after midnight,</v>

3692
02:41:27.490 --> 02:41:30.480
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but putting the money out to produce a</v>

3693
02:41:30.481 --> 02:41:32.640
<v Speaker 5>special that I pitched them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3694
02:41:32.641 --> 02:41:36.810
<v Speaker 5>let's produce a special that's dirty</v>
<v Speaker 5>uncensored and just show it late night,</v>

3695
02:41:36.811 --> 02:41:39.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like we'll make that like a thing,</v>

3696
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:41.250
<v Speaker 5>make it that it's cool to watch it after</v>
<v Speaker 5>midnight.</v>

3697
02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:44.520
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just shut the idea down.</v>

3698
02:41:44.521 --> 02:41:46.050
<v Speaker 5>But they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they liked me,</v>

3699
02:41:46.051 --> 02:41:47.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they kind of like hung in there and</v>

3700
02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:52.010
<v Speaker 5>I give them tapes and they'd come back</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a bunch of red notes.</v>

3701
02:41:52.030 --> 02:41:53.210
<v Speaker 5>You can't say this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't say that.</v>

3702
02:41:53.290 --> 02:41:57.420
<v Speaker 5>I kind of just checked out of it even</v>
<v Speaker 5>being a possibility and then like one</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make no mistake you letting be,</v>

<v Speaker 5>exposed to your audience like this or</v>
<v Speaker 5>would Ari's done for me.</v>

3708

<v Speaker 5>So many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3709
02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:10.890
<v Speaker 5>It's countless list of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ron Bennington,</v>

3710
02:42:11.230 --> 02:42:12.063
<v Speaker 5>Bennington,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3711
02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:15.720
<v Speaker 5>Exposing his fans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like all these little pieces came</v>

3712
02:42:15.721 --> 02:42:18.300
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like he fought for me to be on</v>

3713
02:42:18.301 --> 02:42:20.550
<v Speaker 5>that storytelling show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was the only newer comic.</v>

3714
02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:23.600
<v Speaker 5>There was no other comics from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They brought out a.</v>

3715
02:42:23.850 --> 02:42:26.790
<v Speaker 5>Now they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the first two ones I did,</v>

3716
02:42:26.791 --> 02:42:29.550
<v Speaker 5>I was the only New York comic and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first one they didn't want me.</v>

3717
02:42:29.580 --> 02:42:33.480
<v Speaker 5>I think they're realizing that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet has kind of changed the the</v>

3718
02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:38.540
<v Speaker 5>level they changed the bar and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the television sensors are only getting</v>

3719
02:42:39.301 --> 02:42:42.990
<v Speaker 5>in the way of commerce like you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking it up because the people can do</v>

3720
02:42:42.991 --> 02:42:45.210
<v Speaker 5>uncensored shit in other places like</v>
<v Speaker 5>Netflix.</v>

3721
02:42:45.570 --> 02:42:47.310
<v Speaker 5>Netflix doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't care.</v>

3722
02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:50.270
<v Speaker 5>They gave me zero notes and now you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>say the.</v>

3723
02:42:50.530 --> 02:42:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Now you can say shit balls and pussy on</v>
<v Speaker 5>tbs know what I'm saying?</v>

3724
02:42:54.690 --> 02:42:57.150
<v Speaker 5>Like on channels like tbs now shift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all close.</v>

3725
02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:59.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cable is not governed by the FCC.</v>

3726
02:42:59.791 --> 02:43:02.710
<v Speaker 5>It's only governed by what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>advertisers are willing to tolerate it.</v>

3727
02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:04.780
<v Speaker 5>So they were always able to change the</v>
<v Speaker 5>own.</v>

3728
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:06.690
<v Speaker 5>That's why I said IFC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was their big thing.</v>

3729
02:43:06.691 --> 02:43:11.691
<v Speaker 5>Like how can I have you just have like</v>
<v Speaker 5>nudity and cursing on their channels.</v>

3730
02:43:11.861 --> 02:43:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Like they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>

3731
02:43:13.131 --> 02:43:18.100
<v Speaker 5>this lady told me they go any because my</v>
<v Speaker 5>show is Iraq was on ifc and we had</v>

3732
02:43:18.101 --> 02:43:19.900
<v Speaker 5>nudity and cursing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3733
02:43:19.901 --> 02:43:21.100
<v Speaker 5>how is this okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they go,</v>

3734
02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:24.760
<v Speaker 5>any like MTV could do that if they</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to.</v>

3735
02:43:24.761 --> 02:43:28.160
<v Speaker 5>It was just like they'll lose their core</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what they're trying to get you as an</v>

3736
02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.160
<v Speaker 5>advertising audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe not for them.</v>

3737
02:43:30.161 --> 02:43:30.630
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

3738
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:32.110
<v Speaker 2>That was the big thing with Dave</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle,</v>

3739
02:43:32.470 --> 02:43:34.680
<v Speaker 2>the Dave Chappelle when he was doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Chappelle show,</v>

3740
02:43:34.681 --> 02:43:36.900
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to get him to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language because they would get more</v>

3741
02:43:36.901 --> 02:43:38.350
<v Speaker 2>advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

3742
02:43:38.370 --> 02:43:40.710
<v Speaker 2>they were telling him he couldn't say</v>
<v Speaker 2>nigger anymore.</v>

3743
02:43:42.330 --> 02:43:45.390
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to like cut down on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of this and the amount of that.</v>

3744
02:43:45.391 --> 02:43:48.060
<v Speaker 2>They were just looking at dollar signs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were looking at taking this</v>

3745
02:43:48.061 --> 02:43:52.800
<v Speaker 2>cultural phenomenon and juicing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood out of it.</v>

3746
02:43:52.801 --> 02:43:54.330
<v Speaker 2>They could of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3747
02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what they do mean that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not creative.</v>

3748
02:43:56.701 --> 02:43:57.534
<v Speaker 2>They're not artists.</v>

3749
02:43:57.630 --> 02:44:00.240
<v Speaker 5>People in suits make all the decisions</v>
<v Speaker 5>though somehow until you get to that</v>

3750
02:44:00.241 --> 02:44:02.190
<v Speaker 5>point that Louis ck thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

3752
02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:05.980
<v Speaker 5>or like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you've done here is really like,</v>

3753
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

3754
02:44:06.751 --> 02:44:11.670
<v Speaker 5>Like you give this for free the show and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you give people like hours and hours of</v>

3755
02:44:11.671 --> 02:44:12.870
<v Speaker 5>content a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3756
02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:16.170
<v Speaker 5>But it's all on your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have an audience bigger than,</v>

3757
02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:20.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean a comedy central person said to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me yesterday,</v>

3758
02:44:20.641 --> 02:44:21.630
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I'm doing,</v>

3759
02:44:21.631 --> 02:44:23.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing the Joe Rogan experience</v>

3760
02:44:23.101 --> 02:44:25.830
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow and promoting the special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3761
02:44:26.130 --> 02:44:27.030
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be better than,</v>

3762
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:30.750
<v Speaker 5>than that midnight at midnight tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be a TV show.</v>

3763
02:44:30.751 --> 02:44:33.570
<v Speaker 5>Like this is hits way bigger audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3764
02:44:33.571 --> 02:44:34.920
<v Speaker 5>And you've done it on your own way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

3765
02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:35.820
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking great.</v>

3766
02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:38.650
<v Speaker 2>We just kept doing it to just keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3767
02:44:38.651 --> 02:44:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that is for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3768
02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:46.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's the easiest thing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to do in the sense that it's</v>

3769
02:44:46.241 --> 02:44:48.840
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just show up and you know,</v>

3770
02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:52.390
<v Speaker 2>take care of all the pieces that have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be put into place as far as like how it</v>

3771
02:44:52.391 --> 02:44:56.230
<v Speaker 2>gets uploaded and where it goes and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets distributed through itunes.</v>

3772
02:44:56.730 --> 02:45:00.760
<v Speaker 2>It becomes pretty fucking easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it reaches the numbers that</v>

3773
02:45:00.761 --> 02:45:03.430
<v Speaker 2>it's at now where it gets to be like TV</v>
<v Speaker 2>show numbers,</v>

3774
02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:06.760
<v Speaker 2>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no end to that.</v>

3775
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:09.790
<v Speaker 2>There's no like there's no cap to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't cost anything,</v>

3776
02:45:09.940 --> 02:45:12.070
<v Speaker 2>so for me it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all fun.</v>

3777
02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:16.890
<v Speaker 5>Your numbers drop for two months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit.</v>

3778
02:45:17.490 --> 02:45:19.480
<v Speaker 5>There's no one looming over you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm saying to go,</v>

3779
02:45:19.481 --> 02:45:20.610
<v Speaker 5>it's like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I noticed like,</v>

3780
02:45:21.190 --> 02:45:22.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this or not even when your numbers</v>

3781
02:45:22.951 --> 02:45:25.050
<v Speaker 5>drop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like you picking up some here</v>

3782
02:45:25.051 --> 02:45:28.280
<v Speaker 5>but you're losing the people in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wisconsin right now.</v>

3783
02:45:28.410 --> 02:45:30.180
<v Speaker 5>Who gives like why would you even give a</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit about that?</v>

3784
02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I would have never made it the way it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

3785
02:45:32.850 --> 02:45:37.850
<v Speaker 2>There's no way they would've advised me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pick more popular people as far as</v>

3786
02:45:38.341 --> 02:45:42.060
<v Speaker 2>like guests as far as like a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous people instead of like authors</v>

3787
02:45:42.061 --> 02:45:43.770
<v Speaker 2>are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists are interesting.</v>

3788
02:45:43.771 --> 02:45:47.070
<v Speaker 2>People that I think would be fun to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>to by doing it on my own.</v>

3789
02:45:47.730 --> 02:45:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to do the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like book it,</v>

3790
02:45:50.930 --> 02:45:52.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide when.</v>

3791
02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:53.690
<v Speaker 2>If we know today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3792
02:45:53.691 --> 02:45:56.250
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to do it at one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both ran late.</v>

3793
02:45:56.280 --> 02:45:59.000
<v Speaker 2>We just fucking 1:30 gives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have done it too.</v>

3794
02:45:59.070 --> 02:46:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like everything else.</v>

3795
02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're watching like pounding a thing</v>

3796
02:46:02.731 --> 02:46:06.480
<v Speaker 2>like come on guys and it's not a thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world that can reach millions of</v>

3797
02:46:06.481 --> 02:46:09.000
<v Speaker 2>people like this that has three people</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in it.</v>

3798
02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and Jamie</v>

3799
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:10.940
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

3800
02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:13.610
<v Speaker 5>How far away before they're coming in to</v>
<v Speaker 5>regulate it?</v>

3801
02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:15.710
<v Speaker 5>Just like the free airwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they can.</v>

3802
02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:18.140
<v Speaker 5>I think the genie's out of the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's too late.</v>

3803
02:46:18.141 --> 02:46:21.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people will tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's possible at this</v>

3804
02:46:21.771 --> 02:46:25.370
<v Speaker 5>point without any sort of a massive blow</v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

3805
02:46:25.430 --> 02:46:30.430
<v Speaker 5>The blowback culturally and politically</v>
<v Speaker 5>would be so significant that I think it</v>

3806
02:46:30.561 --> 02:46:33.170
<v Speaker 5>would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would devastate whatever political</v>

3807
02:46:33.171 --> 02:46:37.700
<v Speaker 5>party leaned towards that because the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ire of the Internet would be</v>

3808
02:46:37.701 --> 02:46:41.900
<v Speaker 5>completely focused on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody who tried to censor the Internet</v>

3809
02:46:41.901 --> 02:46:44.150
<v Speaker 5>at this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we really try to step in and say that</v>

3810
02:46:44.151 --> 02:46:45.620
<v Speaker 5>podcast like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3811
02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:48.010
<v Speaker 5>no more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no more saying nowhere.</v>

3812
02:46:48.430 --> 02:46:51.470
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to figure out when you can,</v>

3813
02:46:51.471 --> 02:46:55.160
<v Speaker 5>can say certain things and how nonprofit</v>
<v Speaker 5>said it's a genie gets out of the</v>

3814
02:46:55.161 --> 02:46:55.520
<v Speaker 5>bottle.</v>

3815
02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:56.920
<v Speaker 5>It's the sort of the thing with like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3816
02:46:57.870 --> 02:47:01.070
<v Speaker 5>like what was the time of the process of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like cell phone,</v>

3817
02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:03.470
<v Speaker 5>regulatory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever was remember cell phone bills</v>

3818
02:47:03.471 --> 02:47:06.320
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you use them genuinely during the day</v>

3819
02:47:06.321 --> 02:47:08.480
<v Speaker 5>with any regularity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your bill is going to be like 700,</v>

3820
02:47:08.481 --> 02:47:11.600
<v Speaker 5>$800 dollars or one point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The words got to the point where it's</v>

3821
02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:14.530
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no more after 7:00 PM that holy,</v>

3822
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:16.490
<v Speaker 5>she's like a sham.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing which is a shampoo keep</v>

3823
02:47:16.491 --> 02:47:18.680
<v Speaker 5>like gouging people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going to become the new</v>

3824
02:47:18.681 --> 02:47:21.480
<v Speaker 5>communication and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they'll figure it out around self,</v>

3825
02:47:21.550 --> 02:47:23.780
<v Speaker 5>what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Magic Jack Shit like that,</v>

3826
02:47:23.781 --> 02:47:26.690
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or a orange Internet calling,</v>

3827
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:28.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all that stuff comes around and it's</v>

3828
02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:33.371
<v Speaker 5>like you got to make cell phones just</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a regular bill payment that's like,</v>

3829
02:47:33.771 --> 02:47:35.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>affordable for everybody.</v>

3830
02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:37.730
<v Speaker 5>Well one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you already have Sirius satellite radio</v>

3831
02:47:37.731 --> 02:47:39.440
<v Speaker 5>which completely uncensored in your car.</v>

3832
02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:40.640
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3833
02:47:40.641 --> 02:47:43.340
<v Speaker 5>it's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many new cars come with that.</v>

3834
02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:45.980
<v Speaker 5>So what's the difference between data</v>
<v Speaker 5>and podcast?</v>

3835
02:47:45.981 --> 02:47:46.551
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3836
02:47:46.551 --> 02:47:48.350
<v Speaker 5>podcast is getting in your cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna,</v>

3837
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:51.920
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna run on four g like I</v>
<v Speaker 5>already have podcast.</v>

3838
02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:57.110
<v Speaker 5>Most people do have a podcast app on my</v>
<v Speaker 5>phone and when I download something or</v>

3839
02:47:57.111 --> 02:47:59.750
<v Speaker 5>when I subscribed to something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it automatically downloads to my phone.</v>

3840
02:47:59.870 --> 02:48:04.210
<v Speaker 5>So when I'm driving around I just press</v>
<v Speaker 5>play and it goes here and we're in.</v>

3841
02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:06.950
<v Speaker 5>The best thing about it is if a phone</v>
<v Speaker 5>call happens,</v>

3842
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:10.370
<v Speaker 5>the car pauses it and then you answered</v>
<v Speaker 5>the phone call,</v>

3843
02:48:10.371 --> 02:48:13.730
<v Speaker 5>you talked to somebody and then you hang</v>
<v Speaker 5>up and then the podcast plays where you</v>

3844
02:48:13.731 --> 02:48:15.950
<v Speaker 5>left it off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like radio,</v>

3845
02:48:15.951 --> 02:48:19.650
<v Speaker 5>it's not like satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's better than all those things with</v>

3846
02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:21.710
<v Speaker 5>the on demand now it's pretty good.</v>

3847
02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:22.840
<v Speaker 5>It helps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are,</v>

3848
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:25.310
<v Speaker 5>there should be on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why does it have to go up to the sky and</v>

3849
02:48:25.311 --> 02:48:27.470
<v Speaker 5>come back down the fuck you ain't go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3850
02:48:27.500 --> 02:48:28.490
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately.</v>

3851
02:48:28.491 --> 02:48:31.430
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is like they might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they might,</v>

3852
02:48:31.431 --> 02:48:34.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like serious may jump into that world of</v>

3853
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:37.970
<v Speaker 5>they are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the channels are bringing</v>

3854
02:48:37.971 --> 02:48:41.360
<v Speaker 5>podcasts too serious now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good thing,</v>

3855
02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:43.070
<v Speaker 5>which is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very good thing.</v>

3856
02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:44.690
<v Speaker 5>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all good in a way,</v>

3857
02:48:44.691 --> 02:48:47.020
<v Speaker 5>but you err on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on open channel.</v>

3858
02:48:47.021 --> 02:48:47.690
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's an,</v>

3859
02:48:47.690 --> 02:48:50.090
<v Speaker 5>it's an antiquated way of broadcasting</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

3860
02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:52.310
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense anymore.</v>

3861
02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:54.470
<v Speaker 5>It's just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The time is done.</v>

3862
02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:58.360
<v Speaker 5>Like that smoke signals you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the godfathers gone,</v>

3863
02:48:58.370 --> 02:49:01.670
<v Speaker 5>that's where I think when sterns done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3864
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:05.120
<v Speaker 5>all this stuff will really take on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's going anywhere five</v>

3865
02:49:05.121 --> 02:49:06.340
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was four and a half more years.</v>

3866
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:08.060
<v Speaker 5>He'll stay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're</v>

3867
02:49:08.060 --> 02:49:09.720
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to pay him so much fucking</v>

3868
02:49:09.721 --> 02:49:11.070
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The deal actually though,</v>

3869
02:49:11.071 --> 02:49:14.240
<v Speaker 2>it's 12 year deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's five.</v>

3870
02:49:14.250 --> 02:49:18.690
<v Speaker 2>It might be a little off on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure I followed it's five</v>

3871
02:49:18.691 --> 02:49:22.200
<v Speaker 2>years on air from about six months ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>or so.</v>

3872
02:49:22.890 --> 02:49:27.890
<v Speaker 2>And then they own where they get rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play his entire catalog for seven</v>

3873
02:49:29.131 --> 02:49:30.630
<v Speaker 2>more years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3874
02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.100
<v Speaker 2>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's dumb.</v>

3875
02:49:32.101 --> 02:49:34.890
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be 67 years old and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>done this one.</v>

3876
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:37.350
<v Speaker 2>It looks good though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

3877
02:49:37.470 --> 02:49:39.920
<v Speaker 2>But it means obviously still relevant</v>
<v Speaker 2>show business.</v>

3878
02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you wouldn't have done</v>
<v Speaker 2>America's got talent.</v>

3879
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:43.590
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to be relevant.</v>

3880
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild.</v>

3881
02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you fly back to California all</v>

3882
02:49:46.411 --> 02:49:48.870
<v Speaker 2>the time to do that stupid show where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually did it in New York?</v>

3883
02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Did they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They moved to New York for me.</v>

3884
02:49:51.330 --> 02:49:52.163
<v Speaker 2>Just shut the fuck up.</v>

3885
02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

3886
02:49:54.151 --> 02:49:55.520
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's a part of who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3887
02:49:55.550 --> 02:49:58.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe he take some time off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could see it would be fun if he</v>

3888
02:49:58.310 --> 02:50:01.730
<v Speaker 2>started fucking podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone said to me so much money.</v>

3889
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:04.970
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to stand behind that</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument he had with Ari so bad.</v>

3890
02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:07.290
<v Speaker 2>It was so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3891
02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:09.720
<v Speaker 2>it was the first chicken is armor I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw.</v>

3892
02:50:10.110 --> 02:50:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Well really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3893
02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:13.950
<v Speaker 2>just not even blindly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3894
02:50:14.130 --> 02:50:16.740
<v Speaker 2>just to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because always my friend is just like,</v>

3895
02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it was the first thing he was just kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of wrong about like,</v>

3896
02:50:19.290 --> 02:50:21.900
<v Speaker 2>you can make a living off this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's way wrong.</v>

3897
02:50:21.930 --> 02:50:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I make more money from this than a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other things I do.</v>

3898
02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can make more money doing podcasts</v>

3899
02:50:27.571 --> 02:50:30.720
<v Speaker 2>then you definitely can look at working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a local radio station,</v>

3900
02:50:30.721 --> 02:50:31.554
<v Speaker 2>which is what he was.</v>

3901
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:32.351
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3902
02:50:32.351 --> 02:50:34.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing overnight shifts and the thing</v>

3903
02:50:34.081 --> 02:50:37.860
<v Speaker 2>is that is still the shitty process in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways for some people,</v>

3904
02:50:37.861 --> 02:50:41.370
<v Speaker 2>but if they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a difference between being a</v>

3905
02:50:41.371 --> 02:50:44.310
<v Speaker 2>radio announcer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an entertaining podcast,</v>

3906
02:50:44.311 --> 02:50:46.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of Howard stern's,</v>

3907
02:50:46.381 --> 02:50:47.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the difference between,</v>

3908
02:50:47.551 --> 02:50:49.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be an mc at a strip club.</v>

3909
02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:49.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3910
02:50:49.951 --> 02:50:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be an MC to strip club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work as an MC district go because I</v>

3911
02:50:53.311 --> 02:50:55.480
<v Speaker 2>need some time on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3912
02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you become a standup,</v>

3913
02:50:56.911 --> 02:50:57.830
<v Speaker 2>like what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup,</v>

3914
02:50:57.831 --> 02:50:59.370
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to learn how to bring up those</v>

3915
02:50:59.371 --> 02:51:00.740
<v Speaker 2>strippers and get to really know how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3916
02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to learn how to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3917
02:51:03.661 --> 02:51:05.100
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to work out a muscle</v>

3918
02:51:05.101 --> 02:51:05.490
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

3919
02:51:05.490 --> 02:51:07.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His argument was weird.</v>

3920
02:51:07.321 --> 02:51:12.321
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to learn how to do a break</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a commercial stuff in music or any</v>

3921
02:51:13.051 --> 02:51:14.040
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

3922
02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3923
02:51:15.640 --> 02:51:20.640
<v Speaker 2>wow you to work your way up through</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcasting and some local job like</v>

3924
02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:23.250
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to work for somebody,</v>

3925
02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:26.190
<v Speaker 2>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this idea that like podcasts are for</v>

3926
02:51:26.191 --> 02:51:28.140
<v Speaker 2>losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get he like,</v>

3927
02:51:28.141 --> 02:51:31.770
<v Speaker 2>he's probably in a negotiation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious at the time we saying all this</v>

3928
02:51:31.771 --> 02:51:34.430
<v Speaker 2>stuff and it's probably part of him</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to like,</v>

3929
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:37.710
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy had ultimate power for so long.</v>

3930
02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:40.890
<v Speaker 2>He had the ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to make or break careers by</v>

3931
02:51:40.891 --> 02:51:44.580
<v Speaker 2>shitting on you with no recourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ari who was one of the first guys</v>

3932
02:51:44.581 --> 02:51:47.040
<v Speaker 2>that owned him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he owned them.</v>

3933
02:51:47.310 --> 02:51:49.230
<v Speaker 2>That video that he did and he did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>politely.</v>

3934
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Shit all over him on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Stern.</v>

3935
02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:53.570
<v Speaker 2>And then he owned him with that video</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

3936
02:51:53.610 --> 02:51:57.030
<v Speaker 2>because you know how it was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say he's a nobody and then he points to</v>

3937
02:51:57.031 --> 02:51:59.760
<v Speaker 2>always get a photo of him with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>billboard on sunset boulevard.</v>

3938
02:51:59.940 --> 02:52:03.570
<v Speaker 2>He's got to hit comedy central TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His second comedy central special was</v>

3939
02:52:03.571 --> 02:52:05.030
<v Speaker 2>airing that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3940
02:52:05.350 --> 02:52:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was bad timing.</v>

3941
02:52:07.481 --> 02:52:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I said he really picked the wrong mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

3942
02:52:09.641 --> 02:52:13.990
<v Speaker 2>because Howard is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things and he's he showed</v>

3943
02:52:13.991 --> 02:52:18.250
<v Speaker 2>that I think are in many ways in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America's got talent and he shows it</v>

3944
02:52:18.251 --> 02:52:22.420
<v Speaker 2>with like how he has with guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has come in and when he talks about</v>

3945
02:52:22.421 --> 02:52:25.900
<v Speaker 2>on the errors and he's got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't disagree with all of it,</v>

3946
02:52:25.901 --> 02:52:29.530
<v Speaker 2>but like he's got some pretty horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions on standup comedy.</v>

3947
02:52:29.530 --> 02:52:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would not be my gauge for who to</v>

3948
02:52:32.021 --> 02:52:35.410
<v Speaker 2>watch or who to know who to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His little disconnected.</v>

3949
02:52:35.411 --> 02:52:38.830
<v Speaker 2>So he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dumb that he doesn't know who he</v>

3950
02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:43.000
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girl that's comics in the world.</v>

3951
02:52:43.130 --> 02:52:46.930
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the top 100 standup comics</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

3952
02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:49.300
<v Speaker 2>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

3953
02:52:49.301 --> 02:52:50.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't agree with that,</v>

3954
02:52:50.321 --> 02:52:51.820
<v Speaker 2>it's because you're not talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>comics.</v>

3955
02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:53.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not like,</v>

3956
02:52:53.730 --> 02:52:56.200
<v Speaker 2>he knows like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not being logical.</v>

3957
02:52:56.201 --> 02:52:58.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just trying to crush him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to crush crush art because</v>

3958
02:52:58.781 --> 02:52:59.980
<v Speaker 2>already called him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An old man,</v>

3959
02:52:59.981 --> 02:53:02.290
<v Speaker 2>told him to suck clinics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eastwood's old man Dick,</v>

3960
02:53:02.410 --> 02:53:05.980
<v Speaker 2>because he hated the Chris Kyle movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking funny,</v>

3961
02:53:05.981 --> 02:53:06.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like art.</v>

3962
02:53:06.990 --> 02:53:08.860
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a gangster but,</v>

3963
02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but already set them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He set him up.</v>

3964
02:53:11.111 --> 02:53:13.780
<v Speaker 2>He knew stern was gonna attack him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stern attacked him and already had a</v>

3965
02:53:13.781 --> 02:53:16.420
<v Speaker 2>video response that which is measured</v>
<v Speaker 2>and polite.</v>

3966

<v Speaker 2>Showed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed it.</v>

3967
02:53:17.771 --> 02:53:19.990

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:48.100
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just let this one go because he's got</v>

3983
02:53:48.101 --> 02:53:51.820
<v Speaker 2>comics that work for them essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they know what it is and like you</v>

3984
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:53.020
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that thing he's the boss,</v>

3985
02:53:53.021 --> 02:53:54.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to let him do his thing and</v>

3986
02:53:56.770 --> 02:53:58.690
<v Speaker 2>he just didn't know the a thing anymore.</v>

3987
02:53:58.740 --> 02:54:02.020
<v Speaker 2>He's so used to crushing people too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so used to his whole career.</v>

3988
02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:05.530
<v Speaker 2>He's had this ultimate power where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could just shit all over you like you</v>

3989
02:54:05.531 --> 02:54:10.450
<v Speaker 2>did with mad cow with a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>other guys and he just crushed them all.</v>

3990
02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Crushed them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the playing field's different now,</v>

3991
02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:15.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildly.</v>

3992
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:16.150
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

3993
02:54:16.180 --> 02:54:18.340
<v Speaker 2>if he comes on my podcast and shits on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stern,</v>

3994
02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:20.470
<v Speaker 2>$2,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million people are gonna hear and see</v>

3995
02:54:20.471 --> 02:54:21.304
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3996
02:54:21.310 --> 02:54:25.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it then it gets a viral video on</v>

3997
02:54:25.211 --> 02:54:28.840
<v Speaker 2>youtube and then it gets on twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>

3998
02:54:28.841 --> 02:54:31.270
<v Speaker 2>People start spreading it around back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth.</v>

3999
02:54:31.450 --> 02:54:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Those things will hit hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of views like that and you,</v>

4000
02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:41.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the ultimate like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like field advantage anymore.</v>

4001
02:54:41.710 --> 02:54:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody can be a broadcaster now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4002
02:54:44.231 --> 02:54:45.064
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you doing?</v>

4003
02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:47.500
<v Speaker 2>You're showing something broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4004
02:54:47.501 --> 02:54:50.530
<v Speaker 2>In the loosest sense of the definition</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the word.</v>

4005
02:54:50.770 --> 02:54:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Well anybody can get on youtube and be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcaster in that sense.</v>

4006
02:54:54.671 --> 02:54:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can get on a podcast and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't use to be like that.</v>

4007
02:54:58.530 --> 02:54:59.920
<v Speaker 2>And he used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Howard did it,</v>

4008
02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:01.630
<v Speaker 2>he would do it for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4009
02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:04.400
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wielded his power correctly.</v>

4010
02:55:04.401 --> 02:55:07.520
<v Speaker 2>He knew how to handle it and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with a lot of competitive people</v>

4011
02:55:07.521 --> 02:55:09.410
<v Speaker 2>that we're trying to take his spot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4012
02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:11.040
<v Speaker 2>he would go after them and crush them</v>
<v Speaker 2>with is,</v>

4013
02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 plus million at one time.</v>

4014
02:55:13.551 --> 02:55:17.510

<v Speaker 2>So if you had some rinky dink as radio</v>

02:55:26.451 --> 02:55:31.400
<v Speaker 2>about it and no one heard you shit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and no one could exchange it back</v>

4019
02:55:31.401 --> 02:55:32.840
<v Speaker 2>and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no youtube.</v>

4020
02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:35.750
<v Speaker 2>There was no way for your voice to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>viral.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like local radio djs would be like huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>stars locally.</v>

<v Speaker 5>well they're doing well.</v>

4041
02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:19.330
<v Speaker 5>And then occasionally someone like Bob</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Tom,</v>

4042
02:56:19.710 --> 02:56:22.720
<v Speaker 5>they spread their empire out like all</v>
<v Speaker 5>throughout a bunch of states.</v>

4043
02:56:22.721 --> 02:56:25.520
<v Speaker 5>And I'm so happy that shows falling</v>
<v Speaker 5>apart.</v>

4044
02:56:25.570 --> 02:56:28.270
<v Speaker 5>Seems worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are they bad?</v>

<v Speaker 5>He wasn't there when I was there,</v>

4046
02:56:31.691 --> 02:56:33.640
<v Speaker 5>but Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just talking about a bunch of</v>

4047
02:56:33.641 --> 02:56:35.590
<v Speaker 5>people who are just disconnected and</v>
<v Speaker 5>hate each other.</v>

4048
02:56:35.591 --> 02:56:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Everybody in the studio hates each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

4049
02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:40.330
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They treated me like a fucking jerk off</v>

4050
02:56:40.331 --> 02:56:41.830
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They treated me bad too.</v>

4051
02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:44.620
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to say shit.</v>

4052

<v Speaker 5>I wanted to kind of come out to them and</v>
<v Speaker 5>say some stuff.</v>

4053
02:56:47.921 --> 02:56:51.730

<v Speaker 5>And I like her.</v>

4154
03:00:45.601 --> 03:00:47.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it used to be though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before the Internet,</v>

4155
03:00:47.911 --> 03:00:51.960
<v Speaker 2>people used to go on these radio shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they expected you to do standup bits</v>

4156
03:00:52.230 --> 03:00:55.170
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of guys would just</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically start plugging their bits.</v>

4157
03:00:55.171 --> 03:00:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I remember like one of the first times</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marin was on opiod anthony.</v>

03:01:00.190 --> 03:01:02.200
<v Speaker 5>bits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's what people used to do.</v>

4160
03:01:02.201 --> 03:01:03.640
<v Speaker 5>I remember listening to that going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4161
03:01:03.641 --> 03:01:06.430

<v Speaker 5>shows and they do bits.</v>

<v Speaker 5>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see the same exact thing I said to you</v>

4164
03:01:11.491 --> 03:01:13.750
<v Speaker 5>in that you said to them in that room</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I was like,</v>

4165
03:01:14.230 --> 03:01:16.410
<v Speaker 5>just whatever they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 5>every time they went or came back from a</v>

4176
03:01:44.831 --> 03:01:47.050
<v Speaker 5>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would just play someone like doing</v>

<v Speaker 5>a bit in studio.</v>

4178
03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:54.160
<v Speaker 5>It was like just road hack horseshit and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they would all,</v>

4179
03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:59.280
<v Speaker 5>you'd hear them in the audio laughing</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the time it was live and laughing</v>

4180
03:01:59.621 --> 03:02:01.810
<v Speaker 5>now who can edit in the studio with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same kind of like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that was to.</v>

4184
03:02:08.830 --> 03:02:11.880
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean like it's pretty awful when</v>

4185
03:02:11.950 --> 03:02:14.440
<v Speaker 5>they're just playing people's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean real like,</v>

4186

<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like the hook line and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Were they good or does everyone in the</v>

4191
03:02:28.511 --> 03:02:30.190
<v Speaker 5>room says it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4192
03:02:30.191 --> 03:02:33.820
<v Speaker 5>I think wrec radio is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like every,</v>

4193
03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:35.640
<v Speaker 5>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people that are really good at</v>

4194
03:02:35.641 --> 03:02:35.680
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

4195
03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:36.580
<v Speaker 5>Like Preston,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve,</v>

4196
03:02:36.581 --> 03:02:40.240
<v Speaker 5>they're actually fun to fund shell and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's people that just,</v>

4197
03:02:40.241 --> 03:02:42.970
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that combination they put together as</v>

4198
03:02:42.971 --> 03:02:45.310
<v Speaker 5>far as the team just was toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't work.</v>

4199
03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:49.640
<v Speaker 5>If you were at Stanford and sons in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kansas City that's not,</v>

4200
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:53.950
<v Speaker 5>no one wants you to do like seven radio</v>
<v Speaker 5>shows and it's always like they want you</v>

4201
03:02:53.951 --> 03:02:57.100
<v Speaker 5>to do bits and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have this argument every fucking time</v>

4202
03:02:57.101 --> 03:02:57.950
<v Speaker 5>I come here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4203
03:02:58.540 --> 03:03:00.670
<v Speaker 5>Go Talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4204
03:03:00.671 --> 03:03:03.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure to give to you.</v>

4205
03:03:03.100 --> 03:03:03.940
<v Speaker 5>To have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

4206
03:03:04.470 --> 03:03:06.340
<v Speaker 5>I think they realized they think it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna make you more comfortable.</v>

4207
03:03:06.341 --> 03:03:09.430
<v Speaker 5>It makes me so uncomfortable with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>concept of even trying to do that.</v>

4208
03:03:09.490 --> 03:03:11.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's what it is at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're lazy.</v>

4209
03:03:12.010 --> 03:03:14.560
<v Speaker 5>I think they don't want to have to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>something entertaining with you.</v>

4210
03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:16.850
<v Speaker 5>They'd just rather you plug in and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>start doing your bets.</v>

4211
03:03:16.930 --> 03:03:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Just give us content.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like you saying.</v>

4212
03:03:18.900 --> 03:03:19.820
<v Speaker 5>So you're from New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

4213
03:03:20.470 --> 03:03:22.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that kind of thing.</v>

4214
03:03:22.780 --> 03:03:25.810
<v Speaker 5>That's like someone that's lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not someone who's trying to do</v>

4215
03:03:25.811 --> 03:03:29.410
<v Speaker 5>the best possible show they can do and</v>
<v Speaker 5>too jaded to realize they're being like</v>

4216
03:03:29.411 --> 03:03:31.810
<v Speaker 5>mega rude to somebody just came in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

4217
03:03:31.811 --> 03:03:33.850
<v Speaker 5>hey fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's five in the morning for me too.</v>

4218
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:35.940
<v Speaker 5>Well they know that no one can see them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4219
03:03:35.950 --> 03:03:38.560
<v Speaker 5>So because no one could see them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can just totally disengage and let</v>

4220
03:03:38.561 --> 03:03:41.060
<v Speaker 5>you just go ahead and dance monkey</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's,</v>

4221
03:03:41.380 --> 03:03:44.350
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of interesting thing too</v>
<v Speaker 5>about a podcast that was so many of them</v>

4222
03:03:44.351 --> 03:03:48.190
<v Speaker 5>being video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're also held accountable for</v>

4223
03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:49.940
<v Speaker 5>paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck yeah,</v>

4224
03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:52.570
<v Speaker 5>and you could see like weird faces that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people make,</v>

4225
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:54.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if someone says something I was,</v>

4226
03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:58.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4227
03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:01.220
<v Speaker 5>you could get away with a lot more.</v>

4228
03:04:01.220 --> 03:04:02.960
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot more things where it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4229
03:04:02.961 --> 03:04:05.030
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that joke you guys made that black dude</v>

4230
03:04:05.031 --> 03:04:08.670
<v Speaker 5>in the back didn't seem too impressed by</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was I went home.</v>

4231
03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4232
03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:11.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big fan of podcasts.</v>

4233
03:04:12.010 --> 03:04:14.590
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's the best art form ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>for standup.</v>

4234
03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:17.540
<v Speaker 5>It's a great thing that that's happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>for staying in particularly in that.</v>

4235
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:20.670
<v Speaker 5>And those are the ones that rise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's obviously other ones too</v>

4236
03:04:20.671 --> 03:04:24.140
<v Speaker 5>that rise to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like to Howard's point,</v>

4237
03:04:24.141 --> 03:04:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Howard Stern's point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like of course like every shithead</v>

4238
03:04:27.940 --> 03:04:32.420
<v Speaker 5>15 year old can just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like the reality is it's gonna.</v>

4239
03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:33.470
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4240
03:04:34.310 --> 03:04:37.430
<v Speaker 5>professional well done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like entertaining but,</v>

4241
03:04:37.431 --> 03:04:39.680
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have to be famous and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>can be like,</v>

4242
03:04:39.770 --> 03:04:42.600
<v Speaker 5>look at those girls that make that</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast guys we fucked.</v>

4243
03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:44.270
<v Speaker 5>They are always in the top 10.</v>

4244
03:04:44.350 --> 03:04:46.040
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're always in the top 10 and no one</v>

4245
03:04:46.041 --> 03:04:47.750
<v Speaker 5>knew who they were before that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4246
03:04:47.751 --> 03:04:49.120
<v Speaker 5>or at least weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't white.</v>

4247
03:04:49.130 --> 03:04:50.680
<v Speaker 5>They were still like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4248
03:04:50.730 --> 03:04:53.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like in the business and like</v>

4249
03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:56.030
<v Speaker 5>lower level comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like their time in.</v>

4250
03:04:56.060 --> 03:04:57.630
<v Speaker 5>They sold out the main room at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy store.</v>

4251
03:04:57.631 --> 03:04:59.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's from their podcast.</v>

4252
03:04:59.810 --> 03:05:02.210
<v Speaker 5>So it's pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very impressive.</v>

4253
03:05:02.480 --> 03:05:04.520
<v Speaker 5>The I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that that would be for losers.</v>

4254
03:05:04.970 --> 03:05:07.040
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they've made it,</v>

4255
03:05:07.041 --> 03:05:09.890
<v Speaker 5>like I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it jumped their level on,</v>

4256
03:05:09.970 --> 03:05:12.590
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm saying on their standup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just the years and stand up</v>

4257
03:05:12.591 --> 03:05:14.870
<v Speaker 5>through the years and to sell out a</v>
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>

4258
03:05:15.380 --> 03:05:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think there was a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 5>Howard,</v>

4259
03:05:16.701 --> 03:05:19.160
<v Speaker 5>he's so famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so rich and so successful.</v>

4260
03:05:19.161 --> 03:05:24.161
<v Speaker 5>It's probably got to be like so hard to</v>
<v Speaker 5>just hang with people so hard to just go</v>

4261
03:05:24.501 --> 03:05:25.310
<v Speaker 5>somewhere and hang.</v>

4262
03:05:25.310 --> 03:05:27.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just accepted like old,</v>

4263
03:05:27.250 --> 03:05:29.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the quote unquote old Hollywood</v>

4264
03:05:29.301 --> 03:05:30.170
<v Speaker 5>to him is now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4265
03:05:30.390 --> 03:05:31.223
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

4266
03:05:31.490 --> 03:05:34.520
<v Speaker 5>it's like Hampton's hangouts with like</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy Kimmel and Seinfeld.</v>

4267
03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:35.780
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4268
03:05:35.810 --> 03:05:39.650
<v Speaker 5>it's like that's his world now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which if you're going to have a group of</v>

4269
03:05:39.651 --> 03:05:42.530
<v Speaker 5>buddies to fucking awesome group of</v>
<v Speaker 5>buddies.</v>

4270
03:05:42.590 --> 03:05:43.460
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4271
03:05:43.470 --> 03:05:44.081
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without a doubt.</v>

4272
03:05:44.081 --> 03:05:46.780
<v Speaker 5>I think as people he hangs out with his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he does like,</v>

4273
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.863
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4274
03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:49.880
<v Speaker 5>are a fun group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's gone that route.</v>

4275
03:05:50.180 --> 03:05:53.690
<v Speaker 5>It used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm with you people,</v>

4276
03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:55.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

4277
03:05:55.010 --> 03:05:59.060
<v Speaker 5>we're fucking raging against the Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 5>Carson's and the whatever else,</v>

4278
03:05:59.061 --> 03:06:00.240
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4279
03:06:00.280 --> 03:06:01.840
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or just like,</v>

4280
03:06:01.970 --> 03:06:03.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the upper echelons celebrities were.</v>

4281
03:06:03.801 --> 03:06:05.450
<v Speaker 5>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4282
03:06:05.451 --> 03:06:07.610
<v Speaker 5>he interviews like that drives already</v>
<v Speaker 5>lang,</v>

4283
03:06:07.611 --> 03:06:11.730
<v Speaker 5>that's I think is because stern</v>
<v Speaker 5>interviews people they actively worked</v>

4284
03:06:11.731 --> 03:06:13.100
<v Speaker 5>to like shit on years ago.</v>

4285
03:06:13.530 --> 03:06:14.300
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4286
03:06:14.300 --> 03:06:16.370
<v Speaker 5>The Rosie O'Donnell's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Kathy Lee Gifford,</v>

4287

<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4289
03:06:20.680 --> 03:06:25.680
<v Speaker 5>he's changed to way more liberal and way</v>
<v Speaker 5>more openminded and way more relaxed and</v>

4290
03:06:25.911 --> 03:06:27.620
<v Speaker 5>way more politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4291
03:06:27.660 --> 03:06:32.330
<v Speaker 5>You did mature and there's no need for</v>
<v Speaker 5>him to be extravagant to get attention</v>

4292
03:06:32.331 --> 03:06:33.760
<v Speaker 5>or to be outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4293
03:06:33.770 --> 03:06:34.660
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't really have like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

4294
03:06:34.730 --> 03:06:38.330
<v Speaker 5>there's rarely nudity on that show</v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore and it used to be a lot of times</v>

4295
03:06:38.331 --> 03:06:42.540
<v Speaker 5>like stripper involvement and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when that Howard TV first kind of</v>

4296
03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:43.910
<v Speaker 5>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uncensored one,</v>

4297
03:06:43.911 --> 03:06:46.730
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of like filthy shit on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the show and then it just kinda all went</v>

4298
03:06:46.731 --> 03:06:48.260
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bummer for me it was opie and</v>

4299
03:06:48.261 --> 03:06:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a bummer.</v>

4300
03:06:50.090 --> 03:06:53.180
<v Speaker 5>That was a real bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they split ways that really bothered</v>

4301
03:06:53.181 --> 03:06:55.380
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or did they find out physically didn't</v>

4302
03:06:55.381 --> 03:06:56.880

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4304
03:06:58.100 --> 03:07:01.900

<v Speaker 2>I thought they had like a little riff</v>

4305
03:07:01.930 --> 03:07:05.440
<v Speaker 2>but worked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when the show went on without him,</v>

4340
03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:47.020

<v Speaker 5>This</v>

4347
03:09:06.570 --> 03:09:11.570

<v Speaker 5>I've ever seen in my life.</v>

4348
03:09:13.810 --> 03:09:15.770

4352
03:09:26.660 --> 03:09:29.750
<v Speaker 5>It's like the sheer volume was almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>impossible.</v>

03:09:29.751 --> 03:09:33.830
<v Speaker 5>It seemed like it was photo shopped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we were there seeing that live.</v>

4354
03:09:33.831 --> 03:09:35.330

4360
03:09:45.801 --> 03:09:48.410
<v Speaker 5>but it's always kind of cool that it's</v>
