<v Speaker 1>So for my call is I would just have to wear white socks and white tee shirt</v>

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.011

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So when I walk into,</v>

10
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a ton of Santeria and La Really,</v>

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't deal with it at all because it's all the same thing.</v>

12
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Like everything else in that light.</v>

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It's all confused.</v>

20
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like those white chicks that suck that Hindu Dick when they go to hot yoga,</v>

21
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 1>he got big room.</v>

23
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.700

<v Speaker 1>It's not my Santeria.</v>

45
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a Cuban santare.</v>

59
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:00.401
<v Speaker 1>Don't do.</v>

60
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't pop the plate.</v>

61
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I came up hilarious.</v>

62
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I came up under the very strict,</v>

63
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>shut your mouth.</v>

64
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Nobody needs to know your fucking business.</v>

65
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

66
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.633
<v Speaker 2>are these two?</v>

67
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.753
<v Speaker 2>The only thing,</v>

68
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.353
<v Speaker 2>the role</v>

69
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.661
<v Speaker 2>and then I want to,</v>

70
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:15.471
<v Speaker 2>I do have a question.</v>

71
00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:15.651
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

72
00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 2>you might have an answer.</v>

73
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 2>What did you have a half of spray?</v>

74
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.933
<v Speaker 2>I had one spray.</v>

75
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Good enough.</v>

76
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

77
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

78
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.363
<v Speaker 2>we're in.</v>

79
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 2>What was the other question that you think,</v>

80
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 2>why am I asking you this?</v>

81
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think you might have an answer.</v>

82
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.393
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

83
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 2>but I'm being totally honest.</v>

84
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I exhausted from dealing with like a,</v>

85
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's a big deal,</v>

86
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's like the first time you,</v>

87
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 2>whether you can admit major things in your life.</v>

88
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

89
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 2>oh I have a drinking problem,</v>

90
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 2>but would be stupid little things.</v>

91
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

92
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 2>mine is eating.</v>

93
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

94
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm exhausted from doing it the wrong way and everything comes back to me for</v>

95
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.044
<v Speaker 2>self control.</v>

96
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 2>So when people want to tell me about a diet,</v>

97
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.331
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

98
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not portions.</v>

99
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 2>I know what portions are.</v>

100
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

101
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I want to eat more.</v>

102
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's all down to how do I fucking get self control?</v>

103
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I have zero.</v>

104
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

105
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not going to call it zero self control,</v>

106
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 2>then I don't know what the hell I'm going to call it.</v>

107
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 2>But as you are hard for me,</v>

108
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.790
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

109
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 2>you're hard on yourself.</v>

110
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I think you have self control.</v>

111
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Todd,</v>

112
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a wonderful man,</v>

113
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

114
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>you're hilarious.</v>

115
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why you're hilarious is because you're so,</v>

116
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.731
<v Speaker 2>you're free,</v>

117
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you're impulsive and that sort of debt,</v>

118
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for that to lend itself to dietary discipline.</v>

119
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:24.401
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

120
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 2>how can I eat it?</v>

121
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.164
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

122
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.593
<v Speaker 2>I'll just fucking eat it.</v>

123
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.001
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

124
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:28.451
<v Speaker 2>That's you.</v>

125
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 2>But it's also part of what makes you such a hilarious comic.</v>

126
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have these impulses.</v>

127
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.310
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel better.</v>

128
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>You don't want split the difference,</v>

129
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 2>at least with what you're saying.</v>

130
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't want this comfort and you want to have fun.</v>

131
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:41.111
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

132
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:41.741
<v Speaker 2>it's right there.</v>

133
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:42.170
<v Speaker 2>They want to,</v>

134
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 2>I want to eat that food.</v>

135
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.613
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

136
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I thought of me like picture me at the,</v>

137
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 2>at the uh,</v>

138
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 2>cancer shoving cheesecake Uma in my mouth and my friends are like looking at me</v>

139
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 2>like Todd and I go,</v>

140
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

141
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan said that because I'm creative.</v>

142
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.841
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

143
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 3>I see whatever I want.</v>

144
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:57.964
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

145
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 3>go listen to his podcast.</v>

146
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 3>He said that I should eat.</v>

147
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 3>He calls Joe Rogan and you can go listen.</v>

148
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.261
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

149
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 3>clear off the mini bar before you get in your hotel beds,</v>

150
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 3>even if you're not really hungry because I'm creative.</v>

151
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

152
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 3>So I don't have control over this.</v>

153
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.093
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to like meet in the middle of,</v>

155
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:18.181
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

156
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:18.391
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

157
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:18.901
<v Speaker 1>it's legal,</v>

158
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>but you can't name it.</v>

159
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

160
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 1>do you think that you could fuck a real doll?</v>

161
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:24.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

162
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you definitely could if you had to,</v>

163
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>but would that be something you'd be interested in?</v>

164
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I think I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous this situation where I would</v>

165
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>just jerk off and think about things.</v>

166
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I fucked a,</v>

167
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.400
<v Speaker 1>we had as a sponsor,</v>

168
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>a flush left side.</v>

169
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I've had a flashlight forever.</v>

170
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:38.671
<v Speaker 1>Flash light.</v>

171
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>It's very utilitarian.</v>

172
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>You're not confusing yourself.</v>

173
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever said that one before describing.</v>

174
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>She's the girl of my dreams.</v>

175
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I've never even,</v>

176
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I've never used it.</v>

177
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I've had it forever.</v>

178
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:49.920
<v Speaker 1>I've never even thought about it.</v>

179
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't guess why I would want to use it.</v>

180
00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:52.524
<v Speaker 1>Seems Weird.</v>

181
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.041
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

182
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:53.874
<v Speaker 1>It feels good though.</v>

183
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Does it way better than jerking off and engulfs your whole Dick.</v>

184
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>and you put it in warm water and you get it like to a temperature of a body</v>

186
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.613
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

187
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

188
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.591
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another.</v>

189
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:11.520
<v Speaker 1>This is like a portal,</v>

190
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>like this tube is a portal to another woman,</v>

191
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:14.821
<v Speaker 1>another dementia,</v>

192
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 1>but all you can get out of her vagina and just hold it.</v>

193
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:18.061
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

194
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Feels real.</v>

195
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>The name of this dimension is called awesome.</v>

196
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you jerk off with a fleshlight or do you hold it and fuck it?</v>

197
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

198
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>he jerked out.</v>

199
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.713
<v Speaker 1>You jerk off of this.</v>

200
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>You jerked me off of the flashlight.</v>

201
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

202
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but that was for sure.</v>

203
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>That was on camera behind the curt green.</v>

204
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:32.544
<v Speaker 1>This interview.</v>

205
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 1>We did this on the podcast.</v>

206
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:35.251
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

207
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>he jerking off with the flashlight producer.</v>

208
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

209
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get hard.</v>

210
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.070
<v Speaker 1>It was a female comic.</v>

211
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

212
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>What's that about?</v>

213
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fuck real?</v>

214
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a real doctor.</v>

215
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Real though.</v>

216
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 1>They're getting pretty good man.</v>

217
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.880
<v Speaker 1>They were redhead though,</v>

218
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.710
<v Speaker 1>was a documentary on Netflix about people fucking sex robots really have come</v>

219
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>far because there are people who fall in love with these sex robots and it looks</v>

220
00:05:56.431 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>like the fucking taxi driver Johnny on the spot from total recall.</v>

221
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is crazy.</v>

222
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Like animatronic Chuckie cheese,</v>

223
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:04.514
<v Speaker 1>bass player.</v>

224
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of get to a point where it can totally mimic you and he's going to get</v>

225
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>to a point where it really is like blade runner.</v>

226
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.513
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they are now?</v>

227
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

228
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.703
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

229
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I thought about buying a dude one to do Jujitsu with</v>

230
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.333
<v Speaker 4>that was going to order one.</v>

231
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Clearly no Jake and a sealed bottle.</v>

232
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.810
<v Speaker 4>That proportions are perfect because I have a dog.</v>

233
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Well it's this bubba dummy the practice submissions on,</v>

234
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's super stiff.</v>

235
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>

236
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.361
<v Speaker 1>but he beat you.</v>

237
00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>You basically can drill the moves,</v>

238
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same as drill in and on an anatomically correct body.</v>

239
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>If you had an AMA anatomically correct body to practice Jujitsu on,</v>

240
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you'd get some fucking tight moves.</v>

241
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>But that can wait till the day when you're announcing for robot fights.</v>

242
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

243
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I a zero interest.</v>

244
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:52.230
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing at stake if they live or die.</v>

245
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.203
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

246
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.490
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

247
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing about fighting is that there's some horrible gigantic thing at</v>

248
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.604
<v Speaker 1>stake.</v>

249
00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>You can fuck one though.</v>

250
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

251
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.230
<v Speaker 1>You fuck with him?</v>

252
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I watch him fight.</v>

253
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Would you watch two robots?</v>

254
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:04.034
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

255
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>That's how it goes.</v>

256
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.631
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

257
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

258
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for,</v>

259
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 1>do we need to say anything more about the Brennan shop thing?</v>

260
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Did we cover it up enough man,</v>

261
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>as far as it goes,</v>

262
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

263
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.603
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

264
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.170
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

265
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>we like,</v>

266
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.450
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk him and he you,</v>

267
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

268
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's a weird situation for me because I love the guy and he's one of my best</v>

270
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>friends and also I can't defend what he said cause it doesn't totally make</v>

271
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:28.311
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

272
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>And so like what I'm saying,</v>

274
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>when I said he talks too much,</v>

275
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.863
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

276
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I say stupid shit.</v>

277
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to say stupid shit.</v>

278
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't say that stupid.</v>

279
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

280
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that thing.</v>

281
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it like that.</v>

282
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you say things,</v>

284
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know why the fuck you're saying it.</v>

285
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.211
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

286
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it also was lost,</v>

287
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 1>like just ranting.</v>

288
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.641
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

289
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you're going to these rants and you say shit and then you like see if you can</v>

290
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 1>back it up once you set it.</v>

291
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Like just don't revisit dumb shit.</v>

293
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.403
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

294
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>it was insensitive.</v>

295
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make sense and it was insensitive and I bet he regrets it.</v>

296
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

297

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.063
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

299
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>That's an assumption we're making,</v>

300
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:08.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

301

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

302
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I know the guy.</v>

303
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm saying it.</v>

304
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.440

306
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:16.180
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>

307

<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

308
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a of the of the,</v>

309
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the guy saying like,</v>

310
00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 5>here are racist for saying this.</v>

311
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:21.120
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

312
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

313
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.071
<v Speaker 5>like my,</v>

314
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:24.630
<v Speaker 5>my thing is when you're talking about the,</v>

315
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:25.181
<v Speaker 5>the first,</v>

316
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:26.001
<v Speaker 5>the initial part of it,</v>

317
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 5>and I conveyed this to him,</v>

318
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

320
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.180
<v Speaker 5>So like that's,</v>

321
00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 5>that's disrespectful because I fully believe that we all are and that,</v>

322
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:36.981
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

323
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:37.221
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 5>so that part and he apologized for that and we're cool there,</v>

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 5>then why are you,</v>

329
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 5>why are you talking about like,</v>

332
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 5>that's not how it is.</v>

333
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

334
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:47.681
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

335
00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:47.750

336
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

337
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:48.891
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 5>you're not a psychologist,</v>

339
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 5>not a psychiatrist.</v>

340
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 5>You have no qualifications to,</v>

341

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

347
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes someone says something instead of just straight up saying they</v>

348
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:06.684
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

349
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>They say I fucked up.</v>

350

00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.444
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

355
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Speaker 1>his issue is because of this or you know,</v>

356
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>something else is going on with him.</v>

357
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It's making him react this way.</v>

358
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm more concerned with his pants.</v>

363
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>can't defend neither one.</v>

364
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how many holes,</v>

371
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.613
