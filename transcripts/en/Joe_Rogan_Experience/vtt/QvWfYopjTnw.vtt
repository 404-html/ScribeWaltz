<v Speaker 1>Just things very clunky.</v>

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>It's ustream thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for tuning in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>guest this week,</v>

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the lovely and talented Mr Doug Benson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benson,</v>

6
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we get started,</v>

7
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>we have to mention that the show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being sponsored by the fleshlight.</v>

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Doug Benson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever fucked one of these </v>

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>

10
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I heard you and Dane Cook talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it last week.</v>

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>There were awesome and it's really like </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes masturbation to a whole new level.</v>

12
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>It seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a very embarrassing thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>purchase.</v>

14
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has that one been used or is that just.</v>

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Would never do that to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that just the recent.</v>

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that you would necessarily mess it </v>

17
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.141
<v Speaker 1>up just by holding it or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have to touch </v>

18
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:45.141
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:48.711
<v Speaker 1>no one's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't give you one at someone's </v>

20
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:48.711
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

21
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:48.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:48.711
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

23
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever fucked a nine tastes </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight one?</v>

24
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just fucked one of the other day.</v>

25
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fucks it.</v>

26
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel anything like better or </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

27
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Way Worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way Worse.</v>

28
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else told me,</v>

29
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it was half ron so that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked a,</v>

30
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 2>a knockoff for a fake flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said it wasn't working,</v>

31
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but these are outstanding research and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be awesome.</v>

32
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:14.441
<v Speaker 1>But now I totally get what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying last week about how it just </v>

33
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:18.401
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't feel right in terms of </v>

34
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:18.401
<v Speaker 1>you feel bad about yourself or </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>

35
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's fun.</v>

36
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess he'd get a little bit of A.</v>

37
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I've had other light arm workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but take it back.</v>

38
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn my volume up.</v>

39
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I've had other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

40
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 2>talk to me about this thing and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an embarrassing thing.</v>

42
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.461
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to be represented by </v>

43
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 2>this rubber vagina?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he keeps coming up.</v>

44
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 2>It came up with like another person that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was thinking about sponsoring the show.</v>

45
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be connected with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>flashlight.</v>

46
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

47
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's childish.</v>

48
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It really childish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you just get that,</v>

49
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>that company and fleshlight to outbid </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other until</v>

50
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you would never know.</v>

51
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

52
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.891
<v Speaker 2>then you show no loyalty to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you actually believe if you don't </v>

53
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:07.401
<v Speaker 2>believe there's anything wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking this thing and you want to </v>

54
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:09.651
<v Speaker 2>protect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of those things where </v>

55
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:10.941
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to talk about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because somehow or another </v>

56
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 2>talking about sexual things and it makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>people uncomfortable.</v>

57
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>It's creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a natural part of life and like</v>

58
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 2>most rational people at a certain point </v>
<v Speaker 2>in time,</v>

59
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 2>just to kind of accept that and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can joke about it and go,</v>

60
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked this rubber pussy.</v>

61
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it good?</v>

62
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

63
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 1>You should try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everything's good.</v>

64
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>But for some people it never gets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that place.</v>

65
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on how comfortable </v>

66
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you are with like other men like who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of came up with and if you all talk</v>

67
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 1>to each other that way or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>like I had a lot of fairly prudish </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

69
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:44.461
<v Speaker 1>like we'd say dirty things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we wouldn't admit to any of our own </v>

70
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 1>personal activities the way that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen other groups of friends do it,</v>

71
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see these packs of people that </v>

72
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 1>all just have a different code about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.080
<v Speaker 1>whether they fucked a prostitute or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come up and one group,</v>

74
00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to come up and into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole.</v>

75
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so important.</v>

76
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>So important.</v>

77
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Hanging around with the dudes are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell you everything that's so huge.</v>

78
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>

79
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 2>retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

80
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

81
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.240
<v Speaker 2>give me a little.</v>

82
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must get some good stuff from </v>

83
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.280
<v Speaker 1>everyone I know from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

84
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>but also like there's like really kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of almost a code of standup these days </v>

85
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.810
<v Speaker 1>is to just be super honest and it ends </v>
<v Speaker 1>up just to be original.</v>

86
00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:25.811
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have to talk about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's pretty brutal and out </v>

87
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:25.811
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

88
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really do.</v>

89
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:31.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the Jerry Seinfeld </v>

90
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.660
<v Speaker 1>route has been said so many times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone down so many roads.</v>

91
00:03:32.661 --> 00:03:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't see anything there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

92
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.250
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do standup today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

93
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Seinfeld as Jerry Seinfeld,</v>

94
00:03:39.201 --> 00:03:41.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that style is hilarious at it,</v>

95
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to see a new one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those will also.</v>

96
00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:45.530
<v Speaker 1>He sort of teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of turned it into another thing.</v>

97
00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:50.531
<v Speaker 1>Like he made it popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more fun now to watch actors on a </v>

98
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:54.140
<v Speaker 1>show like the office recreating awkward </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations that happen every day than it</v>

99
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:54.410
<v Speaker 1>is here.</v>

100
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.960
<v Speaker 1>One guy just describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

101
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the Seinfeld show.</v>

102
00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:03.701
<v Speaker 1>Just sort of brought to life his comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that made him a funnier guy to me </v>

103
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:07.871
<v Speaker 1>because prior to that he was a pack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a pack of guys that all just did</v>

104
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.360
<v Speaker 1>clean cut observational humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

105
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>and I love them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were really funny.</v>

106
00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Like guys like him and Larry Miller and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

107
00:04:16.671 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I was a fan of the evening at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv.</v>

109
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:25.301
<v Speaker 1>And those guys were on those things all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time that I totally grew up on </v>

111
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>watching that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then immediately embraced stuff </v>

112
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>that's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.710
<v Speaker 1>like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to just observe things.</v>

114
00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 1>You can experience them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear it.</v>

116
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Like really tell me what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not what everybody does.</v>

117
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear a dangerous thought to </v>
<v Speaker 2>admit.</v>

118

120
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear something fucked up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear the regular shit.</v>

121
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll get bored with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of it.</v>

122
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:12.701

131
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:12.701

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.680
<v Speaker 1>that's unbeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a Louis Ck.</v>

133
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right about Seinfeld,</v>

134
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:18.600
<v Speaker 2>like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

135
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.780
<v Speaker 2>he was such a brilliant joke writer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver like in his style and then to </v>

136
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:27.390
<v Speaker 2>have that show and then you really see </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

137
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curby enthusiasm.</v>

138
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:33.561
<v Speaker 2>Really good to see where Larry David had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big hand in it too because once I </v>

139
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:33.561
<v Speaker 2>started started seeing that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

140
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

141
00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:39.861
<v Speaker 2>this guy is like the king of creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>like really awkward situations that </v>

142
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:44.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally you watch some of his shows </v>

143
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.390
<v Speaker 2>and you find yourself contorting because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

144
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.420
<v Speaker 2>what you fucking saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

145
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:46.770
<v Speaker 2>it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

146
00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:48.960
<v Speaker 2>he does such a good job of weaving that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Web.</v>

147
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.880
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my masters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Izzy.</v>

148
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It makes it up a notch to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like on Hbo so that the language in</v>

150
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>those situations can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's part of it.</v>

151
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.970
<v Speaker 1>As he often says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.990
<v Speaker 1>he often says some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he swears inappropriately in front of </v>

153
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.111
<v Speaker 1>people sometimes that in subject can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that shit on Seinfeld because it had </v>

154
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>to be all t view appropriate.</v>

155
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 2>You remember when there was the water </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle in his pants and there was a </v>

156
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.991
<v Speaker 2>little girl and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some implication like people </v>

157
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:18.210
<v Speaker 2>thought that he had a hard on because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the little girl was there.</v>

158
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 2>I forget how he set it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

159
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

160
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.860
<v Speaker 1>if you listed everything that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty of in the seven seasons of that </v>

161
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.580
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done some pretty horrible things,</v>

162
00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:32.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just the worst thing in every </v>

163
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:32.581
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

164
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:35.521
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what he did to some Holocaust </v>

165
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:35.521
<v Speaker 1>survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

166
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:35.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was awful.</v>

167
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Shows like that are so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show you that there's like another level</v>

168
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 2>like I think that's important for stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>ups though,</v>

170
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.900
<v Speaker 2>don't you think it's good sometimes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch somebody else you know,</v>

171
00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:50.200
<v Speaker 2>and somebody really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>watch like a bill cosby and his prime or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

173
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Just to really get inspired or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just really kick it up to another,</v>

174
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 2>another gear.</v>

175
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always good to.</v>

176
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a huge part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to give advice to people starting</v>

177
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I say to them,</v>

178
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:11.231
<v Speaker 1>if they insist on having some his watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much standup comedy as you can and </v>

179
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:16.391
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately we get kinda tired of </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it is after we've done it for </v>

180
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>years and years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still important to,</v>

181
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 1>to kind of check into it every once in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while because it just ups your game when</v>

182
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what everybody else is doing.</v>

183
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Buyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

185
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:28.181
<v Speaker 2>it does something to you makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about performing that I'm most </v>

186
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 2>excited about writing after I see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll see chappelle perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

188
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to go.</v>

189
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

190
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.520
<v Speaker 2>it just makes me want to create</v>

191
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.590
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

192
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the other great thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a standup is when you have that </v>

193
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.511
<v Speaker 1>impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just come up with one great </v>

194
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:44.431
<v Speaker 1>joe could be satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I hate it when I see a great movie </v>

195
00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:47.761
<v Speaker 1>and I'm driving home like I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write a goddamn screenplay and that </v>

196
00:07:47.761 --> 00:07:50.950
<v Speaker 1>that's just too big of a task to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>commit to in that moment of excitement.</v>

197
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.130
<v Speaker 1>But writing a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

198
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you're excited about writing jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you write a good ones.</v>

199
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

200
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I did that 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes work and then you're in and </v>

201
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:02.830
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they come in full form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>they'll just come to you out of the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little gift.</v>

203
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.230
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about that with Dane </v>

204
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Cook about say something on when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd is so great.</v>

205
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 1>The next sentence after the joke is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going to get a laugh anyway,</v>

206
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 1>but when it gets a huge laugh then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've suddenly got a new end of the </v>

207
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

208
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I right out of the ether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how most of my I,</v>

209
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:27.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do most of my writing on stage just in</v>

210
00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:29.140
<v Speaker 1>the sense that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I have a joke that's worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out perfectly beginning,</v>

212
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.300
<v Speaker 1>middle and end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part it's more like,</v>

213
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:39.301
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of something I want to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to address and then just see where it </v>

214
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:41.710
<v Speaker 1>goes and have have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good joke ready to go right after</v>

215
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:44.920
<v Speaker 1>it if it ends up not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not ending up getting anywhere.</v>

216
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

217
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do both.</v>

218
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.170
<v Speaker 1>How high you get before you go onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm well now people think I'm high </v>

219
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm high or I'm not like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just accused me of it regardless.</v>

220
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.180
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

221
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>it can be as high as I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>

222
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just all comes down to timing.</v>

223
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to race from the airport,</v>

224
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>if you have to raise it from the airport</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Gig,</v>

225
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you might not be very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

226
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're chilling that day and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to show at 8:00</v>

227
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 1>and not much to do in the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than,</v>

228
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on your computer and interviews and</v>

229
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:21.591
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I get really high for interviews </v>

230
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:21.591
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like foreigners.</v>

231
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:21.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

232
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love being super big because then when</v>

233
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:24.470
<v Speaker 1>they do throw to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

234
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:29.471
<v Speaker 1>you will talk until they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they stop you and sometimes </v>

235
00:09:29.471 --> 00:09:30.440
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they don't jump in so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>really get a lot of stuff in.</v>

236
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I know I find myself like almost like </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling bad for what I'm subjecting the </v>

237
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.861
<v Speaker 1>interviewer too sometimes because it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>start on some like really innocent </v>

238
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:40.040
<v Speaker 1>question and I'll just start going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

239
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:40.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

240
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>what is the cause of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we here for?</v>

241
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Like this totally nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything we're talking about,</v>

242
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 1>but in my mind what I'm thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

243
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:52.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole vision of the world and where </v>

244
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:55.011
<v Speaker 1>it's headed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been a really simple </v>

245
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:55.011
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 1>They need you to wrap it up so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could play some more Kesha.</v>

247
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just super bank going on about </v>

248
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.811
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's all coming to me and </v>

249
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:02.811
<v Speaker 1>these big waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need to get it out,</v>

250
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is fun to get high and then write,</v>

251
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:06.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

252
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done this?</v>

253
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever gotten high?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they went,</v>

254
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm starting to have ideas and I'm </v>

255
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.431
<v Speaker 1>not in the mood to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ready to write down ideas right </v>

256
00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to just get high and watch TV.</v>

257
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I've got it.</v>

258
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Now I've actually got to go to work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit because the ideas are too </v>

259
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.361
<v Speaker 1>good to ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got way too high the other day and </v>

260
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:26.361
<v Speaker 1>went on stage and went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

261
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I was at the John Lovitz comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think this dude was on a plane </v>

262
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 1>with Lovitz the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

263
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I got in his eye line a couple times to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he knew who I was and he had,</v>

264
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>he had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it was like,</v>

265
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

266
00:10:40.981 --> 00:10:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Doug Benson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that give you,</v>

267
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 1>am I,</v>

268
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

269
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:44.360
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want,</v>

270
00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

271
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he has been in a lot of great </v>

272
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 3>things and he and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought he was funny</v>

273
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.690
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

274
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:58.130
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so sad sack acting that it would </v>

275
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>be hard to be excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy,</v>

276
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.200
<v Speaker 1>he's a real nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was kind of like traveling by </v>

277
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.200
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

278
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.561
<v Speaker 1>how that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just like humping through the </v>

279
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:06.561
<v Speaker 1>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

280
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:06.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to get it over with.</v>

281
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Just don't want too many people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:13.371
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure like he must have gone through </v>
<v Speaker 1>a period of time where there's some </v>

283
00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:13.371
<v Speaker 1>catchphrases that people yell at them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

284
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.870
<v Speaker 1>they'd say you're a liar all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must,</v>

286
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>he must have used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got that a lot.</v>

287
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm sure he doesn't get it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

288
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

289
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 3>why don't you use technology to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your ideas though,</v>

290
00:11:24.921 --> 00:11:26.030
<v Speaker 3>because I know that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

291
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.150
<v Speaker 3>instead of writing it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like talk,</v>

292
00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:30.280
<v Speaker 3>make a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the audio because that's right there.</v>

293
00:11:30.281 --> 00:11:35.281
<v Speaker 3>And you're starting to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I finally got the most recent </v>

294
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:35.281
<v Speaker 3>iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

295
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 3>he did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made the first video that I ever like </v>

296
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.660
<v Speaker 3>a uploaded on the Internet where I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>filmed myself doing something and then,</v>

297
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.030
<v Speaker 3>and then send it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

298
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely going to do more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

299
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.030
<v Speaker 1>smart way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super fast.</v>

300
00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It's super smart and fast and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 1>people love content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to keep doing stuff.</v>

302
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>But what were you saying about being at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the love it's club comedy club.</v>

303
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got way too baked.</v>

304
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 1>This guy gave me a cookie in between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage Joey.</v>

305
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.570
<v Speaker 1>There were like these little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

306
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.880
<v Speaker 1>what are those little long banana shaped</v>
<v Speaker 1>things called know I'm talking about the</v>

307
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Scotty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty.</v>

308
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Not really banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the closest thing I could see.</v>

309
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:21.271
<v Speaker 1>The banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you describe that shape already </v>

310
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:21.271
<v Speaker 1>shaped cookie.</v>

311
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Cookie cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cookie canoe.</v>

312
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even eat a quarter of one man I</v>

313
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

314
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:30.630
<v Speaker 1>they're really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

315
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a bite.</v>

316
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.020
<v Speaker 1>One bite 45 minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was onstage and I was a board and </v>

317
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Speaker 1>alien space craft while I was talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

318
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're barely there enough to </v>

319
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so high.</v>

320
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I should have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking in public.</v>

321
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a surreal space when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage there too,</v>

322
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.300
<v Speaker 1>because of the way they have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

323
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.450
<v Speaker 1>those balconies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balconies or rather close to you,</v>

324
00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 1>but just up high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very shallow but high and it's uh,</v>

325
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of exciting,</v>

326
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>but also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different than what we're used to.</v>

327
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>

328
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:09.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a fun club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird about that club is how the bars </v>

329
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:12.840
<v Speaker 1>open and so halfway through the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just hearing clicking and </v>

330
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.810
<v Speaker 1>clunking and people that have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>put a curtain right?</v>

331
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

332
00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:20.761
<v Speaker 1>it ain't that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like San Francisco Punch line doesn't </v>

333
00:13:20.761 --> 00:13:20.761
<v Speaker 1>have a career yet and that works out </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

334
00:13:20.761 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's far.</v>

335
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it adds to the ambiance stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as people aren't Douchey,</v>

336
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are right.</v>

337
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It does give an opportunity for things </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get annoying.</v>

338
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you have a bar where people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand in order a drink,</v>

339
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked or divert attention from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd quietly because people,</v>

340
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 1>people start hitting on people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

341
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 1>The last show I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where it was a standing room show,</v>

342
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Speaker 1>me and Joey did this show in Memphis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like this last minute booking and it</v>

343
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:47.910
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

344
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>a rock club and so we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

345
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have bands there.</v>

346
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

347
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it will be set up fine.</v>

348
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.570
<v Speaker 1>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to do standing room.</v>

349
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I usually don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

350
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

351
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.070
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole half the room was standing,</v>

352
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 1>half the room was seated and was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

353
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It was like you're standing on stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your right,</v>

354
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 1>everyone seated and to your left is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>

355
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.390
<v Speaker 1>So literally like everything to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>left is like,</v>

356
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>there's like 200 people just standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and talking.</v>

357
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you're doing standup in a bar </v>

358
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:18.690
<v Speaker 1>and the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're barely paying attention.</v>

359
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.360
<v Speaker 1>They're acting like a band is onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that,</v>

360
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 1>the house of Blues too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now after we went to see stan hope </v>

361
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.810
<v Speaker 1>and we had a stand and it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like after an hour,</v>

362
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>like your fucking back hurts your neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to kink up,</v>

363
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to subject anybody this </v>

364
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:36.770
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

365
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad for people when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing during the show.</v>

366
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever say no that you won't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>those shows and just haven't.</v>

367
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really gotten to that position</v>

368
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.460
<v Speaker 1>where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 1>if that's an option and that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get more bodies in the venue,</v>

370
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 1>gets less bodies in the venue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose money.</v>

371
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it's better to let him sit.</v>

372
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:55.830
<v Speaker 1>You mean to let them sit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

373
00:14:55.831 --> 00:14:56.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

374
00:14:56.251 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so I am not as big a deal.</v>

375
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not such a draw that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to me begging me to let everybody</v>

376
00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:03.030
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

377
00:15:03.031 --> 00:15:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I've been on Comedians of comedy tours </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

378
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.550
<v Speaker 1>with patent oswell where everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing and it's,</v>

379
00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:13.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how much they'll put up </v>

380
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:15.711
<v Speaker 1>with David Cross standing shows all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and his shows go on forever and he </v>

381
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:19.500
<v Speaker 1>has bands come out and that crowd is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is okay with it,</v>

382
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:24.501
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think my crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think stoners would rather sit down </v>

383
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:25.360
<v Speaker 1>finding okay with it.</v>

384
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if there was an only an </v>

385
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:30.360
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to go see a great comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:30.360
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.280
<v Speaker 1>even if I wasn't even doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Chappelle or someone like that,</v>

388
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I would stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll stand for two hours.</v>

389
00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often is this guy come to town?</v>

390
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Once a year should I can stand for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours once a year,</v>

391
00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:42.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the best feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way is to sit down and chill.</v>

392
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.240
<v Speaker 1>He sit down and chill and then you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy the jokes when you're </v>

393
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.240
<v Speaker 1>sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxing,</v>

394
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.500
<v Speaker 1>everything's more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what's the worst is when they have </v>

395
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:52.530
<v Speaker 1>couches in a comedy club like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

396
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:57.570
<v Speaker 1>here's the VIP seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a couch in the back where </v>

397
00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.620
<v Speaker 1>they not only can get loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also just are lounging around.</v>

398
00:15:59.621 --> 00:16:04.621
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right posture to watch </v>

399
00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:05.170
<v Speaker 1>comedy unless you're like stoned or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

400
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're totally right.</v>

401
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I like it when the seats are fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed seats into the so they can't even </v>

402
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.550
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like at the comedy works in Denver.</v>

403
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to say that that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>is crazy.</v>

404
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:20.530
<v Speaker 1>They got those little tiny trays that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are smaller than a school desk or we're </v>

405
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.850
<v Speaker 1>an airline tray and you just put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just put their Nachos and their </v>

406
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.910
<v Speaker 1>drinks on it and the people are in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tight and it's underground.</v>

407
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That place is almost perfect.</v>

408
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I'd say that I don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it is just a,</v>

409
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets a little rowdy sometimes it gets</v>

410
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:37.900
<v Speaker 1>routed to the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noise is like,</v>

411
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it's so it's a win win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cheering for you and applauding </v>

412
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.671
<v Speaker 1>because it's so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when they're talking amongst </v>

413
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:45.671
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're like,</v>

414
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing focus,</v>

415
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 1>that's really loud to Denver's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild man.</v>

416
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Colorado people get wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:56.621
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of wild cowboy in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the alcohol and the weed both </v>

418
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Speaker 1>hit you harder because of the altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

419
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a mile up in the air man.</v>

420
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we try working out up there.</v>

421
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried,</v>

422
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>tried doing a lot of things there that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>regretted.</v>

423
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I went to an amusement park there one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

424
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

425
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like it,</v>

426
00:17:12.061 --> 00:17:17.061
<v Speaker 1>it was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much more exhausting than going to </v>

427
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:17.061
<v Speaker 1>an amusement park should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:23.651
<v Speaker 1>Walking up hills is tough up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went hiking once and it was like a </v>

430
00:17:23.651 --> 00:17:26.831
<v Speaker 1>full on workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was breathing heavy and sweating </v>

431
00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:26.831
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

432
00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:31.720
<v Speaker 1>This is not where you want them outline </v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch you while he's out of breath </v>

433
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.330
<v Speaker 1>and shit can even make it up the hill.</v>

434
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the way Joe Rogan thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be a mountain lion.</v>

435
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.490
<v Speaker 1>My dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

436
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I lived when I lived in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dog had eaten by crap.</v>

437
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw the mountain lion.</v>

438
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I've had weed in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've hidden it at a comedy club and </v>

439
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I've been waiting for the day to go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this comedy club to see if it's still</v>

440
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:52.330
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets kind of like.</v>

441
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean already we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day we started hiding.</v>

442
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:59.901
<v Speaker 1>We'd at comedy clubs throwing it away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff because we'd never go back to </v>

443
00:17:59.901 --> 00:17:59.901
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

444
00:17:59.901 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

445
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.270
<v Speaker 1>and it loses its potency a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about six months to a</v>

446
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

447
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be dry and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit you harder.</v>

448
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

449
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey likes drawing is weed out.</v>

450
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 1>He takes us like a radiator to shut up.</v>

451
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I used to keep it in the freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

452
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that to bay.</v>

453
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.200
<v Speaker 1>It gets moisture in it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it dry.</v>

454
00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I like it to burn and make it a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The freezer.</v>

455
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 1>It's supposedly you put anything in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezer at last longer be like </v>

456
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 1>batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you that,</v>

457
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 1>but we want to put my coffee in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezer.</v>

458
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

459
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird thing.</v>

460
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I just did it because people suggested </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or somebody said it somewhere and </v>

461
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>then after awhile I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I doing this?</v>

462
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Get into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd fast enough that I don't need those</v>

463
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:42.760
<v Speaker 1>for another generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

464
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>This edible thing taught me a lesson </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>

465
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I will not eat anybody else's shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then go on stage.</v>

466
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.060
<v Speaker 1>It was known and he's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>

467
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever know the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're buying it from somebody you don't</v>

468
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:57.360
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

469
00:18:57.361 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally true.</v>

470
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.280
<v Speaker 1>To me is always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat half of this and every time I </v>

471
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.521
<v Speaker 1>take them up on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either much stronger than that </v>

472
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 1>implied or weaker than that implied like</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are never really that.</v>

473
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like about smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people behind the counter and the </v>

474
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 1>dispensary can give you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more specific guidance than you can.</v>

475
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 1>With edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always just like,</v>

476
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll do it in about an hour.</v>

477
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Some of these assholes put too much in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to get Amazon reviews.</v>

478
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need Amazon reviews.</v>

479
00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Every time you take a purple rec from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this store,</v>

480
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how much,</v>

481
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a job in Colorado,</v>

482
00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:40.140
<v Speaker 1>one of the local newspapers to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana critic.</v>

483
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And I got the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I signed up for it and they were like,</v>

484
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 1>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

485
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

486
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was right before we had to move.</v>

487
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

488
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:51.660
<v Speaker 1>when I was there I was going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>different stores and great them.</v>

489
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else is doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they should think they gave that job</v>

490
00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:01.461
<v Speaker 1>to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading about it somewhere </v>

491
00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:01.461
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that yeah,</v>

492
00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:01.461
<v Speaker 1>that's something they wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

493
00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it on some slab stone or </v>

494
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:05.960
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some website was,</v>

495
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about it.</v>

496
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought of earlier when you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>Doug Stan Hope.</v>

497
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was funny a couple of days ago I </v>

498
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.250
<v Speaker 1>worked at a club and the guy wrote me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>check and I went home.</v>

499
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really look at it and I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and the next morning I looked at it</v>

500
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and he'd written a check out to doug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>

501
00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:23.070
<v Speaker 1>hope like it was late and he was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

502
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

503
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Doug plays that club too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was funny that he wrote down the </v>

504
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.910
<v Speaker 1>wrong name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like degenerate number two,</v>

505
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:31.840
<v Speaker 1>forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

506
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:36.850
<v Speaker 1>you've never gotten a check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says Joe Piscopo on Tony Danza Junior.</v>

507
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I signed credit card.</v>

508
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just a flag that like anytime I </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign a credit card,</v>

509
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.090
<v Speaker 1>any kind of credit card slip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always write something like,</v>

510
00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 1>tacos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

511
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.360
<v Speaker 3>Are you free to change the way you sign </v>
<v Speaker 3>your kids?</v>

512
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 3>You can't say that your t's not a dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying,</v>

513
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 3>like say if you have a signature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write your signature.</v>

514
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:59.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's supposed to represent how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>write it.</v>

515
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Write your own very unique way of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

516
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you just decide I don't like it that</v>

517
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:08.671
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to do this with a star in </v>

518
00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:08.671
<v Speaker 3>the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're just helping them out because</v>

519
00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:12.961
<v Speaker 3>then you could get every letter of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alphabet so they know exactly what your </v>

520
00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 3>handwriting style looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your signature.</v>

521
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 3>You still writing the same word every </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

522
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.500
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is could you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally change it up?</v>

523
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>

524
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Every time I changed my sign a credit </v>
<v Speaker 3>card,</v>

525
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 3>I do Brad Pitt or I hate tacos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the point?</v>

526
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 3>If you're totally changing it up and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool,</v>

527
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:30.241
<v Speaker 3>if you're allowed to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the point in having a signature </v>

528
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:30.241
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

529
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Because you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you sign this is it's your </v>

530
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 3>signature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

531
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 3>I did sign that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

532
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.680
<v Speaker 3>But then they say where it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're signing that screen thing.</v>

533
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 3>It isn't that kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least capturing the image and </v>

534
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 3>checking to see if it matches how you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

535
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

536
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

537
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 3>It's just printing it on printing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could just on those things,</v>

538
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 3>you could just type stars in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

539
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:54.151
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could imitate gene Simmons's </v>

540
00:21:54.151 --> 00:21:56.690
<v Speaker 3>signature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could imitate freely because I copied </v>

541
00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.181
<v Speaker 3>over their signatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like a huge kiss fan and you </v>

542
00:22:00.181 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone could do that with you easy,</v>

543
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.430
<v Speaker 3>especially in those little stupid things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the credit card while you're </v>

544
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.430
<v Speaker 3>signing your name doesn't look like how </v>
<v Speaker 3>you write your name.</v>

545
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

546
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 3>You know how I learned it because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

547
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:13.861
<v Speaker 3>I used to date type her name in cursive </v>
<v Speaker 3>letters and it took fucking like an </v>

548
00:22:13.861 --> 00:22:15.160
<v Speaker 3>extra minute and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

549
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing this anymore at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>drives me crazy.</v>

550
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:18.850
<v Speaker 3>It's the extra minute at the cash </v>
<v Speaker 3>register.</v>

551
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.480
<v Speaker 3>I just started signing up for her and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started saying like farts and face and </v>

552
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.681
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I usually just do tacos and stuff with </v>

553
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Brad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm interested in obsessions.</v>

554
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 1>They've got the new taco shaped a Brad </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pitt fleshlight if you'd like to try it.</v>

555
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

556
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 1>what that reminded me of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

557
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 1>what I do is I have a signature that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>signed for stuff with.</v>

558
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And then when people ask me to sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

559
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:52.351
<v Speaker 1>I just print my name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always try to say something nice </v>

560
00:22:52.351 --> 00:22:53.330
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's at least personalized,</v>

561
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really getting my </v>
<v Speaker 1>signature there.</v>

562
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Just getting my name written out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That church.</v>

563
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:04.230
<v Speaker 1>How do you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just paranoid about this whole </v>

564
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.271
<v Speaker 1>identity theft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you won't sign things because of </v>

565
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:06.271
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:06.271
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

567
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why let someone like a gene Simmons </v>

568
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.600
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't want somebody to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>a great job with his signature,</v>

569
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

570
00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:18.841
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely be paranoid about </v>

571
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:18.841
<v Speaker 1>identity theft when it comes to you</v>

572
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 3>credit cards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't really think you should </v>

573
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 3>worry about your signature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too easy to duplicate.</v>

574
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Just carry around a stamp.</v>

575
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

576
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has the kind of technology is there </v>

577
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.711
<v Speaker 1>today so you can't read my signature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're signing something </v>

578
00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>for somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they show it to people,</v>

579
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it has your name on it,</v>

580
00:23:33.521 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're just signing anything,</v>

581
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.530
<v Speaker 1>then when somebody looks at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's nice to go,</v>

582
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Doug Benson wrote that.</v>

583
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 1>My signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't read his handwriting.</v>

584
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that they're that </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at that,</v>

585
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 1>at recognizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.770
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's,</v>

587
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you could imitate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could figure out how to write so </v>

588
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:52.840
<v Speaker 1>many signature and you could probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull it off close enough.</v>

589
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to find it somewhere.</v>

590
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:57.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you film them,</v>

591
00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:00.350
<v Speaker 1>do it and you saw like how they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could just imitate it.</v>

592
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Well that's where my paranoia sets in is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm at the ATM,</v>

593
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.820
<v Speaker 1>the beeping noises that the numbers make</v>
<v Speaker 1>that takes the privacy out of the </v>

594
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone was just watching the site</v>

595
00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.390
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and recording it,</v>

596
00:24:13.391 --> 00:24:18.391
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could figure out the numbers easy </v>

597
00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:18.391
<v Speaker 3>and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:21.661
<v Speaker 3>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you up around the corner and then use </v>

599
00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:21.661
<v Speaker 3>your card and take out whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>maximum is.</v>

600
00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:21.661
<v Speaker 3>What did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new thing,</v>

601
00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:26.611
<v Speaker 3>there's a new app for chase bank that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can actually scan a check front and </v>

602
00:24:26.611 --> 00:24:31.081
<v Speaker 3>back and with your iphone and send it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it deposits the check and then you </v>

603
00:24:31.081 --> 00:24:31.081
<v Speaker 3>just rip up the check.</v>

604
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Well that's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too easy.</v>

605
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.160
<v Speaker 1>What about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

606
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.200
<v Speaker 1>using your iphone to check in on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>

607
00:24:37.201 --> 00:24:40.890
<v Speaker 1>like the Barcode ticket can be on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone and just run that.</v>

608
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fear is,</v>

609
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.090
<v Speaker 1>you know what your iphone is dead then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a ticket.</v>

610
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're actually,</v>

611
00:24:46.681 --> 00:24:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I phones die man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you fuck around and die so</v>

612
00:24:50.191 --> 00:24:51.070
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you make a video and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your power is half gone.</v>

614
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

615
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.580
<v Speaker 1>You got to think about that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the camera for sure.</v>

616
00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.970
<v Speaker 1>But it came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a great thing to have a good </v>

617
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.921
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other day we were in San Francisco </v>

618
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:03.921
<v Speaker 1>and we ate some Chinese food after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

619
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It was like 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning we were outside and I saw</v>

620
00:25:05.761 --> 00:25:06.960
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the whole truck.</v>

621
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.150
<v Speaker 1>You tweeted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it and I was like,</v>

622
00:25:09.151 --> 00:25:14.151
<v Speaker 1>he must be so high because you kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is the craziest shit you ever </v>

623
00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:17.451
<v Speaker 1>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know you're a UFC fights every </v>

624
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:21.021
<v Speaker 1>other week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know you've seen some crazier shit </v>

625
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:21.840
<v Speaker 1>than a bunch of strippers in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of weird plastic.</v>

626
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Probably have seen some crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely,</v>

627
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but it was crazy and I was so high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

628
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

629
00:25:28.561 --> 00:25:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe it and now to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to just share it with everybody.</v>

630
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.360
<v Speaker 1>You were like double rainbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with a van full of strippers.</v>

631
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so ridiculous to me.</v>

632
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:45.831
<v Speaker 1>It was such a sign of the times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it was like a scene in a movie </v>

633
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:49.281
<v Speaker 1>right before the meteor hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before the aliens landed on </v>

634
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:51.450
<v Speaker 1>today's show is video audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>timss video.</v>

635
00:25:51.451 --> 00:25:56.451
<v Speaker 1>There's this big idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big clear box that pulls up and </v>

636
00:25:56.451 --> 00:26:01.281
<v Speaker 1>there's girls dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fish tank of skanks and they're </v>

637
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:04.311
<v Speaker 1>dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was the most ridiculous thing </v>

638
00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:04.311
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for the Hustler Club.</v>

639
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>We had a rewind the video to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the comparable jump over because </v>

640
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.420
<v Speaker 1>they should be sitting while it's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion,</v>

641
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.290
<v Speaker 1>can be dancing while we're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to sit your little quick.</v>

642
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.610
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really like because that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was waiting for.</v>

643
00:26:17.611 --> 00:26:20.290
<v Speaker 1>His like them having to get out and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

644
00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.750
<v Speaker 1>We thought that might have happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be going to jail,</v>

645
00:26:22.751 --> 00:26:25.260
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it's illegal to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems so ridiculous,</v>

646
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:26.310
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's not.</v>

647
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>One of the things it was funny is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were filming the girl and I didn't </v>

648
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>film their faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

649
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I did specifically did it say it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic card.</v>

650
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.640
<v Speaker 1>If I'm going to put it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to see your face on it </v>

651
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.690
<v Speaker 1>for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that shit on the Internet forever.</v>

652
00:26:42.691 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 1>So I use their face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

653
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:46.410
<v Speaker 1>while I'm filming it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl goes,</v>

654
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:50.370
<v Speaker 1>no filming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're in the club like bitch,</v>

655
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 1>you're in front of a Chinese restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

656
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:57.591
<v Speaker 1>You're not at the club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're at the club and I'm filming </v>

657
00:26:57.591 --> 00:26:57.591
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

658
00:26:57.591 --> 00:27:00.531
<v Speaker 1>that's a dick move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just can't come out into the </v>

659
00:27:00.531 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 1>real world in your underwear and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a picture of that.</v>

660
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

661
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 1>that's like the a sexy top and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

662
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 1>keep your eyes up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

663
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

664
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.750
<v Speaker 1>come on Jesus Christ.</v>

665
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing right?</v>

666
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.700
<v Speaker 1>You know how the game works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only want you to look,</v>

667
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I want you to look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's there for everybody </v>

668
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:17.740
<v Speaker 1>because my eyes are here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God it.</v>

669
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>

670
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Popo beale for strippers and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want us to look at you.</v>

671
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.240
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

672
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Speaker 1>It was just like such a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such A.</v>

673
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Just A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

674
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Speaker 1>just a perfect representation of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutty San Francisco is.</v>

675
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that Cisco's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that.</v>

676
00:27:33.611 --> 00:27:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably no one will complain about</v>

677
00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:36.860
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

678
00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 1>No one going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some kids saw it.</v>

679
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot there.</v>

680
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just so liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so open minded.</v>

681
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:44.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

682
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that law with sitting down </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you turning the corner,</v>

683
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:52.581
<v Speaker 1>if it came from like back in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>days where it's like a pickup truck and </v>

684
00:27:52.581 --> 00:27:52.581
<v Speaker 1>girls would just fly off the site.</v>

685
00:27:52.581 --> 00:27:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to have your seatbelt </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

686
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to wear a seatbelt.</v>

687
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

688
00:27:57.601 --> 00:27:59.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get pulled over for something else I</v>

689
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:00.800
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

690
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

691
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:01.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

692
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 1>They can pull you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

693
00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:10.221
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a cab in San Francisco and the </v>

694
00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>crusty older lady cab driver told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

695
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:16.010
<v Speaker 1>if you ever want to drive around without</v>
<v Speaker 1>a seatbelt on,</v>

696
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.940
<v Speaker 1>because she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how seatbelts feel.</v>

697
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to have it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you've got big boobs,</v>

698
00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 1>it must be an annoying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

699
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:28.070
<v Speaker 1>she fastens it behind her back so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is because the cops look for is the </v>

700
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:33.780
<v Speaker 1>glint of the buckle because you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>got it pulled down.</v>

701
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the buckle.</v>

702
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.060
<v Speaker 1>So they see that and then they put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can pull you over for that and then</v>

703
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 1>get you on for other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for glint dude over for that.</v>

704
00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

705
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>we thought you had your seatbelt off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they can,</v>

706
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

707
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 1>we smell marijuana or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get pulled over for not wearing a</v>

708
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 1>seatbelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Douche.</v>

709
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Any cop just pulls you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to pull this person over.</v>

710
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like wearing it,</v>

711
00:28:55.291 --> 00:29:00.291
<v Speaker 1>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been pulled over for that guy told </v>

712
00:29:00.291 --> 00:29:00.291
<v Speaker 1>me to do it really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

713
00:29:00.291 --> 00:29:00.530
<v Speaker 1>he said you were driving.</v>
