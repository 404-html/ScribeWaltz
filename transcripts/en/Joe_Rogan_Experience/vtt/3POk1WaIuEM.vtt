1
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're live,</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>We're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

4
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>It's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>

5
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

6
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to have young man like your</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

7
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the few shows where you take</v>

8
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.181
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a real problem whenever you </v>

9
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>got a show that's iconic and top gear is</v>
<v Speaker 1>iconic as fuck.</v>

10
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the iconic car show and then</v>

11
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>they did an Australian version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done other.</v>

12
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>How many versions is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there now?</v>

13
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Australia was first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a German one really German </v>

14
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 2>when they did something with them once </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that kind of killed them.</v>

15
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's us,</v>

16
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 2>we're still a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a top gear Korea for like five</v>

17
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which may or may not be going on there.</v>

18
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 2>The ones that drop that Apache </v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter,</v>

19
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the desert,</v>

20
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 2>everybody was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the same?</v>

21
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 2>There was a new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a Zl one camaro chasing,</v>

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 2>getting chased by an Apache helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something we did in our first </v>

23
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.111
<v Speaker 2>season and the same helicopter pilot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>copilot got too close to the.</v>

24
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 2>The blades got too close and caught it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it dropped him.</v>

25
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 2>They walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the helicopters toast.</v>

26
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 2>But then when you hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>

27
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:13.161
<v Speaker 2>there are certain things that happen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to look back at your life and </v>

28
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:15.411
<v Speaker 2>go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that mean I could've also almost </v>

29
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:15.411
<v Speaker 2>died when we did that?</v>

30
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Like 20 minutes from my house season one</v>
<v Speaker 2>before?</v>

31
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

32
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 2>So luckily that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apache helicopters are fucking </v>

33
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

34
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 2>The government had all these helicopters</v>
<v Speaker 2>laying around that they couldn't do </v>

35
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 2>anything with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

36
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.311
<v Speaker 2>the guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that flute with us was a guy named skip </v>

37
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:32.311
<v Speaker 2>lamb and he and a bunch of other pilots </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

38
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do stuff with TV,</v>

39
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 2>with movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

40
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:39.141
<v Speaker 2>So they started this little group and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government gave them a bunch of </v>

41
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 2>these surplus helicopters that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't doing anything with.</v>

42
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 2>So they exist and they can do different </v>
<v Speaker 2>films and movies and it's cool for these</v>

43
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:48.951
<v Speaker 2>guys because they get to use the skills </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had and get to do something </v>

44
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 2>cool with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

45
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a real helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a bad bitch helicopter that</v>

46
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>millions to be to be one of those work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

47
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>find out what one of those fuckers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth.</v>

48
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not those,</v>

49
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>but we had a bunch of helicopters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we used on fear factor and a lot of </v>

50
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>times they were really close to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

51
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>It have to fly staggered where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blades of one,</v>

52
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>we're just above the blades of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're connected.</v>

53
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Both of them connected by ropes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they're picking up like a</v>

54
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>bus or some shit on fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$52 million.</v>

55
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

56
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

57
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I kind don't feel like there's any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those on Amazon is what my gut tells me.</v>

58
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 2>There might be Ebay for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>603% more expensive than the average for</v>

59
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:42.311
<v Speaker 2>its class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you ever close enough when they </v>

60
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:42.311
<v Speaker 2>were doing that and you can feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wash from them?</v>

61
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I assume you've been in a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my least favorite things in life.</v>

62
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I've only been in all honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never flew in a helicopter the entire </v>

63
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>time we did for your factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

64
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shot for six fucking years.</v>

65
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:59.761
<v Speaker 1>Helicopters every other week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got on one good for you because </v>

66
00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:02.581
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was part like I would have to be </v>

67
00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:02.581
<v Speaker 1>insured</v>

68
00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:02.581
<v Speaker 3>due to the helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

69
00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been on.</v>

70
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>

71
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm the Big Island in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

72
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 3>the volcanoes you've ever done that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>known,</v>

73
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.510
<v Speaker 3>I've been there once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was lovely to.</v>

74
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like literally take it,</v>

75
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.951
<v Speaker 3>takes my breath away just thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it because it's the earth bleeding out </v>

76
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:24.570
<v Speaker 3>into the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Middle of nowhere going into the water </v>

77
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.141
<v Speaker 3>and creating the island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watched the island be created like </v>

78
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.771
<v Speaker 3>it's every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a couple more inches gets </v>

79
00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:34.981
<v Speaker 3>added to the big island and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually literally watch it happen and </v>

80
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:34.981
<v Speaker 3>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

81
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Like next level stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

82
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 3>the whole time I'm in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking like this bitch is going to</v>

83
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:45.151
<v Speaker 3>go down and he takes off or when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>lands is the worst part for you because </v>

84
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 3>you can feel when you feel that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>push up against the blade and it's like,</v>

85
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 3>are we're going to go?</v>

86
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Are we thinking about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for me,</v>

87
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 3>the pants crapping factor that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 3>not fun.</v>

88
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.660
<v Speaker 3>I've owned a lot of shit boxes and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure you're aware of things breaking </v>

89
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.611
<v Speaker 3>like you're on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if a wheel falls off,</v>

90
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 3>you and I can pull over exactly if a or </v>
<v Speaker 3>drops off we make the news.</v>

91
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

92
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a way they can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

93
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Bill Burr just started flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters.</v>

94
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:23.281
<v Speaker 3>He has his fucking hilarious bit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it on his last Netflix special about </v>

95
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:28.111
<v Speaker 3>flying helicopters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said that they're not nearly as </v>

96
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:31.531
<v Speaker 3>bad to crash as people think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a way you learn how to bring </v>

97
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 3>them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pass on that man.</v>

98
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I will and I have for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would probably,</v>

99
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 3>if he ever invite you up then I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell him I'll just meet you there man.</v>

100
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just drive.</v>

101
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll go for the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in high school.</v>

102
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Buddy of mine was taking flight lessons </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in high school.</v>

103
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.050
<v Speaker 3>I had a buddy one and his parents were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a wild guys family was his dad </v>

104
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 3>was a poacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dead like a out here illegally.</v>

105
00:04:55.901 --> 00:05:00.901
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird shit in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>family and they were teaching him at a </v>

106
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 3>very young age how to fly planes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck they're going</v>

107
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 3>to do with the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he came from a very sketchy family.</v>

108
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna like fucking 15.</v>

109
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 3>We were in a plane and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

110
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 3>well you shouldn't be flying shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we were flying in a little single </v>

111
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 3>engine plane.</v>

112
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

113
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 3>one of those little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends flies for Delta </v>

114
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell him,</v>

115
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like if I hear his name broadcast </v>

117
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:29.261
<v Speaker 3>over the PA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably going to get off the plane </v>

118
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 3>because I've been drunk with them enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>times that it's just,</v>

119
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dig that he's in charge of so many </v>

120
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.240
<v Speaker 3>people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know for their.</v>

121
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the picture of the plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ran into a bird?</v>

122
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 3>A commercial jet plane slammed into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bird in a caved in the entire front of </v>

123
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 3>the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

124
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 3>you didn't say that's awesome though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assuming everyone's okay.</v>

125
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Everyone lived because it hit it </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

126
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.520
<v Speaker 3>But if you hit the wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you look at what it did to the </v>

127
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.520
<v Speaker 3>front of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like give it hit,</v>

128
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 3>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

129
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 3>six</v>

130
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 2>feet to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six feet to the right,</v>

131
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.841
<v Speaker 2>whatever you look like people might have</v>
<v Speaker 2>died or if it landed the through the </v>

132
00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:09.221
<v Speaker 2>windshield and it killed the pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've gotta if you're hitting </v>

133
00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>like a Canadian ghosts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those bright fucking giant </v>

134
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>geese vineyard trying to land in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hudson.</v>

135
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that story.</v>

136
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this place in Georgia near me</v>

137
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.970
<v Speaker 2>where we shot the same place with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter and they are the people that </v>

138
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.590
<v Speaker 2>go and recover airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

139
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>There's the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Cow,</v>

140
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just boom.</v>

141
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Soft spot right in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when the plane went down the Hudson,</v>

142
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.820
<v Speaker 2>these redneck dudes from Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgia were sent up there to get the </v>

143
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 2>plane that's floating in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

144
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:44.981
<v Speaker 2>Insurance companies pay them to go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recover these planes and they have to </v>

145
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 2>basically cut them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them on a,</v>

146
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 2>on a train or a flat bed or whatever.</v>

147
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.920
<v Speaker 2>And so for Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our executive producer for top </v>

148
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.920
<v Speaker 2>gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like showing me,</v>

149
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some stuff I got from Ronnie and </v>

150
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 2>my buddies back in Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a tiny bottle of Jack Daniels</v>

151
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 2>that looked like it had mold growing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the outside.</v>

152
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 2>And it was one of the bottles that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the plane that went down on the </v>

153
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.421
<v Speaker 2>Hudson and these guys were covered it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was his Christmas keepsake to </v>

154
00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>his friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

155
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably worth money things.</v>

156
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 2>So then on Ebay and there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this cool like [inaudible] </v>

157
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 2>looking and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

158
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 2>that looks neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

159
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I landed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was like,</v>

161
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:27.011
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that plane hit the water and the Panama </v>

162
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:27.011
<v Speaker 2>City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy died.</v>

163
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:31.900
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't have a more trite like </v>
<v Speaker 2>business unless maybe you're an </v>

164
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.900
<v Speaker 2>undertaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

165
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

166
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a funeral service director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

167
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:39.341
<v Speaker 2>But you have to basically go pick up </v>
<v Speaker 2>crap after bill burr and his friends </v>

168
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:40.910
<v Speaker 2>learn how to roll a helicopter that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going down safely.</v>

169
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Didn't Patrick swayze crashed drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't uh,</v>

170
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.850
<v Speaker 2>something that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe Patrick swayze before he died </v>

171
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 2>was boozing it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying around with his cancer.</v>

172
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>He's not so happy with just going for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

173
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Just getting hammered and flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

174
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>he had cancer for quite a while and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was flying planes.</v>

175
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 2>I think he crashed one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he crashed one of them </v>

176
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.401
<v Speaker 2>and walked away until it's hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was it a Harrison Ford that just </v>

177
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 2>landed one on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a golf course?</v>

178
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he crashed,</v>

179
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 2>landed somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harrison Ford.</v>

180
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 2>He apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got pretty banged up like that was a,</v>

181
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 2>that was a real crush swayze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suspected drunk flying was in 2000 </v>

<v Speaker 2>in connection with Patrick swayze </v>

185
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>emergency landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Earlier this month,</v>

186
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.481
<v Speaker 2>the men are accused of failing to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorities about how they allegedly </v>

187
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>held the act to remove alcoholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>beverages from his crashed plane.</v>

188
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 2>He was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like if our friends war,</v>

193
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 2>we'd kind of make fun of Patrick swayze </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy can dance.</v>

195
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Only because he didn't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got to know him after awhile,</v>

196
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>you start mocking them if hanging around</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

197
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 3>You met Patrick swayze and he was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>high school when I was in high school,</v>

233
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 3>my um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>auto shop teacher was a mustang fanatic.</v>

234
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

235
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.590
<v Speaker 3>The guy was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

236
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 3>And he had all these old shitty mustangs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'd like to put back together again</v>

237
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.920
<v Speaker 3>and they were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking heat that students do the Bondo </v>

238
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:39.920
<v Speaker 3>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>

239
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:39.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at them sideways.</v>

240
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 3>It was like looking at a fucking ski </v>
<v Speaker 3>slope.</v>

241
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just completely fucked up.</v>

242
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 3>But he was weird and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't look like any other cars.</v>

243
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like mustangs just hardcore,</v>

244
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 3>just all he wanted and he even like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even like the cool ones,</v>

245
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

246
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 3>shitty hubcaps and like he never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he never like did them up nice.</v>

247
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 3>And where they look like something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would want muscle cars,</v>

248
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 3>but in his mind they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were the jam.</v>

249
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a mustang or nothing.</v>

250
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 3>That was his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to quantify it a tiny bit,</v>

251
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:16.071
<v Speaker 3>you told me that you were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about building a car and it's </v>

252
00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:16.071
<v Speaker 3>maybe a Chevelle or maybe a mustang.</v>

253
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I think there's lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the car world,</v>

254
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:19.060
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

255
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.950
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different pockets of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and this stuff that they like and</v>

256
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never a big mustang guy.</v>

257
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I dig them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get why people love them,</v>

258
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 3>but like let's pick the Fox body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

259
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:36.531
<v Speaker 3>That's the 79 to 93 and they made a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes in their.</v>

260
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Like they had the tops and a few death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those cars were desk.</v>

261
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 3>They're just ship there in vanilla ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a number one song.</v>

262
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Write doom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doom,</v>

263
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 3>doom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doom with a rag top down below.</v>

264
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 3>And I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what that car was like.</v>

265
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:55.461
<v Speaker 3>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great representation of sort of </v>

266
00:11:55.461 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 3>like a redneck mullet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late eighties,</v>

267
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:58.530
<v Speaker 3>early nineties kind of style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

268
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 3>I on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost and transmission,</v>

269
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 3>we had to take one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've found it in my buddy's junkyard.</v>

270
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I needed an engine and transmission and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make this AMC Eagle.</v>

271
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

272
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:13.711
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't keep the car all wheel drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a jacked up ugly four by </v>

273
00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:17.191
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't keep it all wheel drive and </v>

274
00:12:17.191 --> 00:12:17.191
<v Speaker 3>have any amount of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

275
00:12:17.191 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make it rear wheel drive.</v>

276
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Let's make it something cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had to basically sacrifice this Fox</v>

277
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 3>body and do people came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woodwork.</v>

278
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how active you are on so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you are,</v>

279
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 3>but like sometimes when people try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get mad at you on facebook,</v>

280
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 3>it's so much funnier to read and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

281
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:38.971
<v Speaker 3>this goes so pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He forgot that English is a language </v>

282
00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 3>because it's just a hail of words and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like he tried to call this one fox body </v>

283
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 3>rare and I made fun of him and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people saw it.</v>

284
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Not like in a mean way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just poked back,</v>

285
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 3>but like there's no fox body that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>rare.</v>

286
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Those pictures back up again and let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all agree that these should all be put </v>

287
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.930
<v Speaker 3>in a pile and nuked awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting cars.</v>

288
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 3>The worst representation of American </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle cars that have ever been built.</v>

289
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 3>Look at that girl in the hood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even.</v>

290
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 3>She's not enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like this.</v>

291
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I hate my boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chaz Chaz.</v>

292
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.490
<v Speaker 3>He's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He makes them get on top of his car and </v>

293
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:14.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

294
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 3>That's like an Lx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five point on my might have been a four </v>

295
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 3>cylinder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

296
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll look at the girl with the pink one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

297
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You totally want to buy her some boone's</v>

298
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 3>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at you girl.</v>

299
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 3>I like how they redid the back lights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got crafted the fucking lights.</v>

300
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 3>All Teza style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It supposed to be a muscle car and they </v>

301
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 3>had four lug wheels.</v>

302
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.350
<v Speaker 3>It was a disgusting car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend,</v>

303
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:40.360
<v Speaker 3>my buddy Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jason had one when we were kids.</v>

304
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 3>He had A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you can't make on cool.</v>

305
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're kind of cool.</v>

306
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 3>They're kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cool,</v>

307
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.400
<v Speaker 3>but they're not cool compared to the 60s</v>
<v Speaker 3>mustangs and the not cool compared to </v>

308
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 3>the new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new ones are fucking bad.</v>

309
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 3>They're dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

310
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.500
<v Speaker 3>And really they got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got better than what was the next </v>

311
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.981
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in 95 or would it not to be a total </v>

312
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:04.981
<v Speaker 3>dork?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know codes and stuff,</v>

313
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:05.950
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but shouldn't they got cooler,</v>

314
00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

315
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:08.200
<v Speaker 3>They got better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got,</v>

316
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:11.490
<v Speaker 3>they were kind of decent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in the two thousands,</v>

317
00:14:11.491 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 3>like I had a 2010 shelby gt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>500.</v>

318
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 3>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad ass car.</v>

319
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 3>It was a vicious car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>

320
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:20.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live rear axle.</v>

321
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 3>The handling properties weren't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best,</v>

322
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:24.330
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That car was about.</v>

323
00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 3>It could go sideways anytime you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>her to know anybody around.</v>

324
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:33.541
<v Speaker 3>No hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just go sideways around corners.</v>

325
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was so easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

326
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:40.381
<v Speaker 3>Just anytime you wanted to just give it </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little juice and it would just kick </v>

327
00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:43.531
<v Speaker 3>out the back for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's only really only a handful </v>

328
00:14:43.531 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 3>of cars that you feel like when you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone on the road in,</v>

329
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people,</v>

330
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not that they're messing with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just not bright enough to know </v>

331
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.161
<v Speaker 3>how to be a good driver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those cars you would </v>

332
00:14:53.161 --> 00:14:53.161
<v Speaker 3>always see a dude in a mustang just be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

333
00:14:53.161 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 3>I've had enough of your crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out,</v>

334
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to drop the hammer and I go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I always liked that about him,</v>

335
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.460
<v Speaker 3>but there's just certain cars that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that love them are sometimes </v>

336
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

337
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 3>They turned me off of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I always wanted a he 46 m,</v>

338
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:08.480
<v Speaker 3>three BMW.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

339
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 3>That to me it's just such a great car </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the box,</v>

340
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 3>but then when I would meet a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that would own them,</v>

341
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I would decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I really went wrong.</v>

342
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.270
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that about Porsche's.</v>

343
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.710
<v Speaker 3>Do people have always said that about </v>
<v Speaker 3>porsches?</v>

344
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 3>Magnus Walker is changing that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

345
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 3>he is that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could you not love magnus?</v>

346
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:33.161
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just as bad ass dude that just </v>

347
00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:33.230
<v Speaker 3>likes what he likes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

348
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 3>he's also so enthusiastic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's contagious.</v>

349
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loves those like 60 to 73 and now </v>

350
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:41.640
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

351
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.600
<v Speaker 3>He's in some turbos now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some older turbo models.</v>

352
00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:48.601
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although he loves his [inaudible] 30 </v>

353
00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:48.601
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of those.</v>

354
00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think your buddies at shark works.</v>

355
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Took him a newer one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a 14,</v>

356
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:53.960
<v Speaker 3>that he got to go beat around on it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly he was like,</v>

357
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 3>maybe the new ones aren't so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he knows now.</v>

358
00:15:56.871 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Well he had never experienced anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the GT two.</v>

359
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.330
<v Speaker 3>So what Alex did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex,</v>

360
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:05.900
<v Speaker 3>my buddy from shark works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a gt two from,</v>

361
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's 2010 maybe somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>around there.</v>

362
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.720
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made it 800 horsepower and it is the </v>

363
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.170
<v Speaker 3>fucking scariest car I've ever driven in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

364
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking terrifying.</v>

365
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Like my gt three has 518 horsepower that</v>
<v Speaker 3>has almost 300 more horsepower.</v>

366
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:27.910
<v Speaker 3>It's somewhere in the eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mind bogglingly fast.</v>

367
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he lead magnets,</v>

368
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:36.161
<v Speaker 3>drive it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said to do with it whatever you </v>

369
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:36.710
<v Speaker 3>would do if it was your own car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Magnus had it fucking painted,</v>

370
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

371
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how cool Alex is.</v>

372
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:41.000
<v Speaker 3>And that's how cool magnets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

373
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.380
<v Speaker 3>they're both fanatics so they just have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this understanding with each other.</v>

374
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:47.660
<v Speaker 3>So this is what he did to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see it there.</v>

375
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 3>He painted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's ugly as fuck.</v>

376
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on with testing.</v>

377
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 3>I love the golden wheels on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First wheels not aren't bad,</v>

378
00:16:55.881 --> 00:17:00.881
<v Speaker 3>but the orange and the bumpers like why </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has that very like German dtm kind of</v>

379
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 3>look to it like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like dog shit.</v>

380
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a great card since it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful design though.</v>

381
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need fucking gray stripes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hood and Orange Burger.</v>

382
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 3>But whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something my car.</v>

383
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.710
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is driving it </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

384
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 3>What a goddamn experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

385
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.840
<v Speaker 3>it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We took it up.</v>

386
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angel's crest.</v>

387
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That area.</v>

388
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 3>And you can't drive it up.</v>

389
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 3>It's too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

390
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 3>every corner comes to quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of those cars.</v>

391
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the power comes on,</v>

392
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter how they've tuned at your</v>

393
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 3>foot is not a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're foot is like,</v>

394
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:39.710
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>

395
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.890
<v Speaker 3>All the sudden you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

396
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll shoot off this hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is this because you can't.</v>

397
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to drive that car in control </v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter who you are.</v>

398
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had never really thought.</v>

399
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 3>I never been in a car that had too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>power before where I drove it.</v>

400
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I've always been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

401
00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.140
<v Speaker 3>this is fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the shelby gt 500.</v>

402
00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 3>It was like 550 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty light car.</v>

403
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

404
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 3>this thing is fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously fast.</v>

405
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 3>The GT three super fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is in a different category.</v>

406
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.490
<v Speaker 3>So it's mind boggling how much power it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has and when it kicks in,</v>

407
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.890
<v Speaker 3>just pinned you to the child.</v>

408
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.100
<v Speaker 3>It Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>

409
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Your heart starts racing like I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>

410
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 3>This kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kid,</v>

411
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is physics.</v>

412
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a James Dean.</v>

413
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Sinking feeling brother on a highway </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently is even scarier.</v>

414
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 3>They were saying on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just don't feel compelled to let off</v>

415
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:38.961
<v Speaker 3>the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you look down and you go in 170 </v>

416
00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:38.961
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour on the [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

417
00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck am I doing last season?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Top gear we went to,</v>

418
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 3>we went to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we drove on the nurburgring.</v>

419
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been in that ring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is like being inside of a of a video </v>

420
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:54.831
<v Speaker 3>game for folks who aren't car geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Nuremberg ring is the track that </v>

421
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 3>everyone talks about when talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>lap times.</v>

422
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a car that can do seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and 30 seconds or below on the </v>

423
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 3>nurburgring you've got a mother fucker.</v>

424
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.050
<v Speaker 3>It's car motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

425
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 3>The record is just under seven minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

426
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for the 12 minute course,</v>

427
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 14 if you run the whole thing.</v>

428
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:20.061
<v Speaker 3>But the 12 minute courses is like just </v>
<v Speaker 3>under seven for some unbelievably fast </v>

429
00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:20.760
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

430
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 3>when we went there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tanner's got a friend over there,</v>

438
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.110
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that comedy.</v>

439
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:39.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like one gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fraternity and sorority that everyone </v>

440
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.260
<v Speaker 3>likes everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're that one.</v>

441
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:45.261
<v Speaker 3>A whole does a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could go into that for guys that </v>

442
00:19:45.261 --> 00:19:45.820
<v Speaker 3>needed to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

443
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 3>Climate in the body of those shitty old </v>
<v Speaker 3>mustangs and newcomb from orbit.</v>

444
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 3>But tanner tanner's got a friend who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with the owner,</v>

445
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 3>the people that just bought it.</v>

446
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.310
<v Speaker 3>So they closed the nurburgring for us </v>
<v Speaker 3>with God for three hours.</v>

447
00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:01.280
<v Speaker 3>We had to track all to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

448
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.360
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the most insane thing I've ever </v>

449
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.541
<v Speaker 3>done in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was in a 2014 carerra ass for us.</v>

450
00:20:08.991 --> 00:20:12.930
<v Speaker 3>So it's a non turbo all wheel drive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little over 300 horsepower,</v>

451
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about four.</v>

452
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it maybe you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about four horsepower.</v>

453
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.660
<v Speaker 3>You could kill yourself on that track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

454
00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:23.160
<v Speaker 3>you go maybe on a bicycle on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a good downhill.</v>

455
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Every turn is a blind turn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every hill is a blind hill.</v>

456
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:32.270
<v Speaker 3>I hit one 82 on the back stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like on the way there we were,</v>

457
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.560
<v Speaker 3>we were trying to hit the rev limiter on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Autobahn because people know how to </v>

458
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.250
<v Speaker 3>drive on the interstate there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most amazing thing.</v>

459
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:46.310
<v Speaker 3>They get on the right hand lane and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay there until they need to use the </v>

460
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.310
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they just like California.</v>

461
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Unless I'm like any work</v>

462
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 2>before you use the word everywhere I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived,</v>

463
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.530
<v Speaker 2>California's still worse when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to getting out of that left lane.</v>

464
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Nobody respects it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally was slow down.</v>

465
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

466
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to patrol this on my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>horn.</v>

467
00:21:01.101 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always lived in California.</v>

468
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds because they kind of designed the</v>

469
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:08.700
<v Speaker 2>roads out here for a bunch of cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

470
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I first came here,</v>

471
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:15.421
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove down to was a place called hard </v>

472
00:21:15.421 --> 00:21:15.421
<v Speaker 2>times billiards in bellflower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

473
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like a legendary pool hall and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove down there and I,</v>

474
00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 2>you have to take four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get down there.</v>

475
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this fucking road.</v>

476
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like seven lanes on each side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

477
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Massachusetts where I grew up,</v>

478
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like that.</v>

479
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't exist.</v>

480
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:34.230
<v Speaker 2>There were like horse and buggy roads </v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone can put hard pavement over </v>

481
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.230
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

482
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 2>potholes everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

483
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 2>The road down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

484
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.110
<v Speaker 2>This is like the best car culture in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and the worst driving conditions </v>

485
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 2>for car people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly for traffic.</v>

486
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 2>It's on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

487
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 2>3:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM.</v>

488
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:48.840
<v Speaker 2>You guys can have traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

489
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.880
<v Speaker 2>In the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That bumper to bumper for no real </v>

490
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:53.880
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real reason is people.</v>

491
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.711
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they made babies and then they move </v>

492
00:21:58.711 --> 00:21:58.820
<v Speaker 2>out here because they want to be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

493
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're wrong if you go nowhere,</v>

494
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.340
<v Speaker 2>if you go south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are some great roads to </v>

495
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:05.340
<v Speaker 2>drive here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

496
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.940
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll take you six hours to go five </v>

497
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:08.940
<v Speaker 2>miles to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

498
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so nervous going anywhere here.</v>

499
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I was five minutes away and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>crapping my pants about if I could get </v>

500
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.500
<v Speaker 2>here on time or not.</v>

501
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

502
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.360
<v Speaker 2>It's it's nerve wracking place if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be punctual,</v>

503
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.670
<v Speaker 2>but that dude run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's lose it.</v>

504
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to the nurburgring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was your time?</v>

505
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fast did you get around it?</v>

506
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Did whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was under 10 minutes from my </v>

507
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:31.670
<v Speaker 2>first slap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty God damn good.</v>

508
00:22:31.671 --> 00:22:34.180
<v Speaker 2>And they said that's first time seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the track.</v>

509
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.660
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should feel really good about that.</v>

510
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 2>You lose it at any point in time or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>get close to the edge.</v>

511
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 2>The carousel is the coolest feeling I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever had because you dip in and it's it.</v>

512
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.990
<v Speaker 2>There's graffiti everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

513
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:51.991
<v Speaker 2>Because they have these huge parties out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there around the races and so you're </v>

514
00:22:51.991 --> 00:22:55.171
<v Speaker 2>seeing all this stuff in the car just </v>
<v Speaker 2>dips in and you're hauling ass as hard </v>

515
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:59.491
<v Speaker 2>as you can and then it just shoots you </v>
<v Speaker 2>right out the other side and you keep </v>

516
00:22:59.491 --> 00:22:59.491
<v Speaker 2>going and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did it.</v>

517
00:22:59.491 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 2>So the carousel is like a site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're almost going sideways like a</v>

518
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 2>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

519
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just steep bank to just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pops in out of nowhere and you just get </v>

520
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 2>any kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ride it.</v>

521
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.910
<v Speaker 2>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

522
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>It's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole time I kept thinking,</v>

523
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how did this happen?</v>

524
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 2>How did this goofball kid from Atlanta </v>
<v Speaker 2>end up on this show?</v>

525
00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:26.700
<v Speaker 2>And they handed me a car and the keys to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nerve,</v>

526
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 2>greg to a German porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern German Porsche.</v>

527
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.930
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was insane.</v>

528
00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:36.931
<v Speaker 2>And they do the coolest part about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>road in that track on days when there </v>

529
00:23:36.931 --> 00:23:41.161
<v Speaker 2>aren't races,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a toll road so you can pay $30 and </v>

530
00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 2>go take a lap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

531
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:47.190
<v Speaker 2>So there are guys like you and I who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were there who either showed up with a </v>

532
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>rented one,</v>

533
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

534
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're going out and having fun.</v>

535
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 2>You still have to use your blinker and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only pass on the left,</v>

536
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.810
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also like grandmothers and </v>

537
00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 2>families in tourists on the track at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

538
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 2>So you're just going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people really going.</v>

539
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 2>And so we're standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had just wrapped up and I was like,</v>

540
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we got five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to watch some cars.</v>

541
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.900
<v Speaker 2>You see this mini cooper come hauling </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass around.</v>

542
00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this dude's just carving and there's</v>

543
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:16.360
<v Speaker 2>a guy in a f four 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

544
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I can keep up with this son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he punted that for 30 into the wall </v>

545
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:26.510
<v Speaker 2>on one side and then drug it down past </v>
<v Speaker 2>us now because it's a toll road,</v>

546
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.880
<v Speaker 2>they have to do an accident </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>

547
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 2>The money's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mini coopers checked out.</v>

548
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have anything to do with it,</v>

549
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he still felt bad.</v>

550
00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:39.851
<v Speaker 2>So everybody that was on the track at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point has to exit and this team </v>

551
00:24:39.851 --> 00:24:44.021
<v Speaker 2>shows up and they do like an accident </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation because that guy's </v>

552
00:24:44.021 --> 00:24:46.541
<v Speaker 2>insurance would still be good on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>track at that moment because it was a </v>

553
00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 2>toll road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

554
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:51.270
<v Speaker 2>So how fast can you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one 83 and there's no Schema.</v>

555
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just go.</v>

556
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.690
<v Speaker 2>And I was not the fastest car we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of fucking insurance that they</v>

557
00:24:56.691 --> 00:25:01.691
<v Speaker 2>have underneath crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because you've heard of friends </v>

558
00:25:01.691 --> 00:25:01.850
<v Speaker 2>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

559
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:06.851
<v Speaker 2>I took this new car to the track and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I had to pay the tow truck guy to </v>

560
00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:06.851
<v Speaker 2>drop it on the side of the four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

561
00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can call the insurance company.</v>

562
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Tell them I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting here,</v>

563
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.160
<v Speaker 2>so I guess it just works out better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can rent a racecar.</v>

564
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:20.170
<v Speaker 2>They're either like a Peugeot or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all these like little kind of </v>

565
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.670
<v Speaker 2>import smaller race cars you can rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says like rent a racecar.</v>

566
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Just go for it.</v>

567
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Well if you get a Nissan Gtr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a.</v>

568
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:32.891
<v Speaker 1>They have a speed limiter on it until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to race courses and the GPS </v>

569
00:25:32.891 --> 00:25:35.510
<v Speaker 1>recognizes that you're at a race course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

570
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>And it lets you just go fucking crazy.</v>

571
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Have you have you journal on such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great car for the money?</v>

572
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Did one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>

573
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rented one in Austin,</v>

574
00:25:43.331 --> 00:25:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to um,</v>

575
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.280
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts.</v>

576
00:25:48.281 --> 00:25:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hurting.</v>

577
00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Hertz has some pretty ridiculous cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could share and if you wanna if</v>

578
00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you wanna pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll let you run a GTR.</v>

579
00:25:54.461 --> 00:25:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whew.</v>

580
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So the whole weekend I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was riding a ride everywhere.</v>

581
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Just what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

582
00:26:00.211 --> 00:26:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the supercar world,</v>

583
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 2>it's such a bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That car.</v>

584
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting more expensive now.</v>

585
00:26:07.451 --> 00:26:09.220
<v Speaker 1>There is somewhere around a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand now.</v>

586
00:26:09.221 --> 00:26:12.330
<v Speaker 1>They were like seven and nine I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when they first came out.</v>

587
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like fully loaded.</v>

588
00:26:14.051 --> 00:26:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Now they keep adding a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more.</v>

589
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:21.120
<v Speaker 1>They're a little bit over a hundred now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way they handle is like it </v>

590
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.411
<v Speaker 1>defies physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like the gt three </v>

591
00:26:25.411 --> 00:26:28.861
<v Speaker 1>handles amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense that car does not </v>

592
00:26:28.861 --> 00:26:31.570
<v Speaker 1>make sense because there's all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronics going on.</v>

593
00:26:31.571 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It's four wheel drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's three.</v>

594
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:38.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like eight or 900 pounds </v>

595
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.040
<v Speaker 1>heavier than my gt three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 3,900</v>

596
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:40.150
<v Speaker 1>pounds or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

597
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fairly heavy car and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like part their strategy in</v>

598
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 3>some sort of strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it fucking works.</v>

599
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.400
<v Speaker 3>That is an ungodly fast ride and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just hop in and go kart.</v>

600
00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 3>Tanner doesn't like it because it takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>

601
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.230
<v Speaker 3>He feels like a way from a driver at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that skill level,</v>

602
00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 3>but you and I are in fact not tanner </v>
<v Speaker 3>foust.</v>

603
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel that same way,</v>

604
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.660
<v Speaker 3>but one of my favorite episodes of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>show was when he was racing with a </v>

605
00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.191
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle around all these industrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>box core zero six</v>

606
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.390
<v Speaker 5>down in Long Beach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

607
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:21.390
<v Speaker 3>was nuts is when you can watch someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>drift and entire cloverleaf onramp.</v>

608
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the city of Long Beach try </v>

609
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.891
<v Speaker 3>to get mad at US afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really saw all the stripes that we had </v>

610
00:27:28.891 --> 00:27:29.650
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

611
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

612
00:27:30.251 --> 00:27:32.140
<v Speaker 3>You gave us permission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

613
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.420
<v Speaker 3>They were mad because it was rubber on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the road.</v>

614
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.130
<v Speaker 3>That looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I say.</v>

615
00:27:36.131 --> 00:27:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what their deal is.</v>

616
00:27:37.721 --> 00:27:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

617
00:27:38.621 --> 00:27:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Fucking was a drift drift bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

618
00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:44.950
<v Speaker 3>And he only had like three degrees of of</v>
<v Speaker 3>slip on it.</v>

619
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Still bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is right here for the record.</v>

620
00:27:47.321 --> 00:27:50.650
<v Speaker 3>But you just see how good a driver </v>
<v Speaker 3>tanner is in this video,</v>

621
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.880
<v Speaker 3>especially with those shitty dog shits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is fighting core vets.</v>

622
00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck allowed that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was such a glaring error on their </v>

623
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.671
<v Speaker 3>part to make this incredible car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean ridiculously fast car.</v>

624
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.700
<v Speaker 3>And then give it these dog shit seats to</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

625
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I had a CEO sick for about five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>

626
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.120
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not.</v>

627
00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a corvette guy.</v>

628
00:28:15.581 --> 00:28:20.581
<v Speaker 3>Like you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't see me get out of the car </v>

629
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:23.341
<v Speaker 3>and think that guy has got a vet because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have like a gold chain not </v>

630
00:28:23.341 --> 00:28:24.490
<v Speaker 3>wearing jean shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nowhere she.</v>

631
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or George shorts,</v>

632
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.930
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their very popular thing.</v>

633
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Were they aware?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they do they do.</v>

634
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.160
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was atomic orange.</v>

635
00:28:33.161 --> 00:28:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I got it from my friend Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

636
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.460
<v Speaker 3>in Chicago.</v>

637
00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.800
<v Speaker 3>And it was one of those cars at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You drove.</v>

638
00:28:38.801 --> 00:28:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Once you got in that [inaudible] it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a [inaudible],</v>

639
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:46.010
<v Speaker 3>atomic orange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything about core vets change </v>

640
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.010
<v Speaker 3>because that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's the same as that car.</v>

641
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mean ass car so fast,</v>

642
00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:53.560
<v Speaker 3>so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fun and really well balanced to where</v>

643
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.480
<v Speaker 3>those cars are shockingly well balanced.</v>

644
00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just because it's plastic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>American sheets and the seats are dog </v>

645
00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:02.450

<v Speaker 3>but it's not if you.</v>

647
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:05.830

<v Speaker 3>If someone,</v>

648
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:10.831
<v Speaker 3>if you took it somewhere and just had </v>
<v Speaker 3>some really good bucket seats installed </v>

649
00:29:10.831 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 3>the ride experience and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>steering wheel's dog shit to the </v>

650
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 3>cavaliers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

651
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:19.040
<v Speaker 3>That was always my beef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could get the same radio in the </v>

652
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.160
<v Speaker 3>corvette that you could in the last 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's just not how that's supposed to</v>

653
00:29:21.161 --> 00:29:21.770
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

654
00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.040
<v Speaker 3>but they did fix that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they spit out.</v>

657
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.020
<v Speaker 3>He even made it better than anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>anticipated.</v>

658
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Like the new [inaudible] is a </v>

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.850
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to appreciate goodness.</v>

662
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.820
<v Speaker 3>They listened and they even engineered </v>
<v Speaker 3>it like way better than the other ones.</v>

663
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean the new corvette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c seven corvette is a marvelous car.</v>

664
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a marvel of engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

665
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

666
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.830
<v Speaker 3>There's not a car under a half a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars even compares to it,</v>

667
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when to get that zero six and they </v>

668
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:05.460
<v Speaker 3>finally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>

669
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

670
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.070
<v Speaker 3>They finally figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The seats are perfect.</v>

671
00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Like everything's great in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tanner's good drivers.</v>

672
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

673
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Every time we would go out and do stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people would say like,</v>

674
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:14.400
<v Speaker 3>why are you letting tanner beat you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just smiling,</v>

675
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.840
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you noticed I was trying</v>

676
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.690
<v Speaker 3>my ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've actually not trying to let him beat</v>

677
00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:24.691
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people don't truly understand </v>

678
00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:27.451
<v Speaker 3>the amount of skill and knowledge that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in driving a car like that or </v>

679
00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 3>when he took that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

680
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.120
<v Speaker 3>the GT two around downtown La at nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that they closed down some </v>

681
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:37.630
<v Speaker 3>sections of downtown La and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really recent model,</v>

682
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:42.631
<v Speaker 3>gt two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just a stupendously fast car </v>

683
00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:46.010
<v Speaker 3>and he was driving it during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was too hot because it's turbo </v>

684
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.010
<v Speaker 3>charged and it just didn't really help.</v>

685
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.620
<v Speaker 3>So she was getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

686
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 3>So he took it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mean it was pretty fast,</v>

687
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

688
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.870
<v Speaker 3>But not fast enough and that's like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

689
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.320
<v Speaker 3>that's his dream car right there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It had like seven and change hundred </v>

694
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 3>horsepower at the wheels and the guy put</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really stiff clutch in their thought.</v>

695
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 3>He had ruined the car.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Magnus Walker.</v>

704
00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:39.061
<v Speaker 3>the same car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that car looks bitching like some </v>

705
00:31:39.061 --> 00:31:40.150
<v Speaker 3>freak carbon makes everything better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The carbon fiber hoods.</v>

706
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Pretty wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

707
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazing car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a gt,</v>

708
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:47.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm a 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>96 rather turbo,</v>

709
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.720
<v Speaker 3>just like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those same ones,</v>

710
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.190
<v Speaker 3>the nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

711
00:31:49.191 --> 00:31:51.250
<v Speaker 3>six turbo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But mine was a hunk of Shit.</v>

712
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Mine broke down five times and almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>queered me off of A.</v>

713
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you say about that?</v>

714
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

715
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too weird.</v>

716
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.610
<v Speaker 3>They just break too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

717
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:07.510
<v Speaker 3>queer as an odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say queer it off.</v>

718
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that.</v>

719
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I think I've ever said that before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just butter coffees.</v>

720
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.510
<v Speaker 3>What it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in my blood.</v>

721
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.760
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

722
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 3>the car broke down five times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like catastrophic failures,</v>

723
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:21.400
<v Speaker 3>like twice the shift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>linkage blue where the clutch,</v>

724
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:22.590
<v Speaker 3>like I go to put in the clutch and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved,</v>

725
00:32:22.591 --> 00:32:27.591
<v Speaker 3>move the gear and there's just nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the gear shifter just spinning </v>

726
00:32:27.591 --> 00:32:27.591
<v Speaker 3>around in a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing connected to it.</v>

727
00:32:27.591 --> 00:32:31.420
<v Speaker 3>One time it blew at a red light and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stuck in second gear.</v>

728
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:34.660
<v Speaker 3>So I just rubbed it really high and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out in second gear.</v>

729
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:38.890
<v Speaker 3>I drove to the porsche dealership in </v>
<v Speaker 3>second gear and that was the second time</v>

730
00:32:38.891 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

731
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what</v>

732
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 2>the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>

733
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Then they replace the engine once the </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine.</v>

734
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:50.411
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what the fuck was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was making weird noises and like </v>

735
00:32:50.411 --> 00:32:50.411
<v Speaker 2>we're going to replace the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine.</v>

736
00:32:50.411 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

737
00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

738
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Fucking year old car replaced the </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine,</v>

739
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:57.160
<v Speaker 2>that's this whole thing to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they um,</v>

740
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 2>then the gas gauge broke on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had half a tank of gas,</v>

741
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:04.810
<v Speaker 2>but I did not have a half tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the left lane on the [inaudible],</v>

742
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>near the Hollywood bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motherfucker ran out of gas of man.</v>

743
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

744
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:15.941
<v Speaker 2>it was his year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you are on the side of the road </v>

745
00:33:15.941 --> 00:33:15.941
<v Speaker 2>and everyone knows you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

746
00:33:15.941 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you a little secret.</v>

747
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:21.821
<v Speaker 2>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a good looking food truck about </v>

748
00:33:21.821 --> 00:33:21.821
<v Speaker 2>two minutes from here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

749
00:33:21.821 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting a little lunch for him.</v>

750
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

751
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:28.121
<v Speaker 2>it's swinging there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I caught just enough of the curb </v>

752
00:33:28.121 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 2>with the tire that when the tire came </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of it,</v>

753
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 2>the noise was so loud that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

754
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.670
<v Speaker 2>get back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

755
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.960
<v Speaker 2>We can stop here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought a car from Toyota racing,</v>

756
00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:38.390
<v Speaker 2>loaned me Alexis RCF,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful car.</v>

757
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting out at that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then I'm that guy who I just </v>

758
00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.030
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't need more of that in your</v>

759
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out cars don't.</v>

760
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Especially if they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're that guy from top gear.</v>

761
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just fucked up that car,</v>

762
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:51.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw you hit that curb.</v>

763
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.630
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you can do about it.</v>

764
00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.230
<v Speaker 2>If you can hit a fucking curb every now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

765
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:02.380
<v Speaker 2>here he is in downtown La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going sideways around these regular </v>

766
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.120
<v Speaker 2>streets that gt two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so say in the tunnels,</v>

767
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 2>you people don't appreciate it.</v>

768
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Like what it takes to drive like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't really have to know when to </v>

769
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.280
<v Speaker 2>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to go out,</v>

770
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.180
<v Speaker 2>where the turn is when they hit the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like so much knowledge and </v>

771
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 2>experience that goes into driving a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and the consequences or death.</v>

772
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.360
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

773
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.510
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a real game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting good at.</v>

774
00:34:26.511 --> 00:34:29.300
<v Speaker 2>You're driving a fucking 600 horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

775
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 2>The waist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit over 3000 pounds.</v>

776
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever gone in and either watched</v>
<v Speaker 2>her done any drifting?</v>

777
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:36.070
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

778
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.080
<v Speaker 2>You love the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just vehicular shenanigans in one </v>

779
00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:42.200
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

780
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:45.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's why like I can trip but my </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition suck.</v>

781
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minefield.</v>

782
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I stole a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's tanner?</v>

783
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Like you could hold a cup of coffee and </v>
<v Speaker 2>never move it because he's just so good.</v>

784
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Smooth me in.</v>

785
00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like when they come down to long </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach or Irwindale Fan,</v>

786
00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's early and I was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a mall now or something.</v>

787
00:35:01.191 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally they,</v>

788
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:05.240
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fought that for years.</v>

789
00:35:05.241 --> 00:35:09.140
<v Speaker 2>But watching what those guys in formula </v>
<v Speaker 2>drift can do is.</v>

790
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the stuff we did in parking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots in high school.</v>

791
00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now it's a sport and they're so </v>

792
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.941
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of that in high school </v>

793
00:35:18.941 --> 00:35:18.941
<v Speaker 2>because we had snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

794
00:35:18.941 --> 00:35:20.840
<v Speaker 2>are drifting with snow creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I learned how to drive from driving</v>

795
00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:23.570
<v Speaker 2>in snow because that's when the asset </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks out.</v>

796
00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:26.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's the skills you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really the same skills.</v>

797
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:31.450
<v Speaker 2>It's why we pray for snow in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It snow like five times in my life and I</v>

798
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:33.720
<v Speaker 2>bought some of the cars from top gear so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

799
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.360
<v Speaker 2>We built a four by four school bus was </v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked up on 44 is with a snowplow.</v>

800
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had a flame thrower on the roof.</v>

801
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew they were going to crush it and </v>

802
00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:46.540
<v Speaker 2>cut it up because they couldn't sell it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the public.</v>

803
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Let me buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it home.</v>

804
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Shifted home to Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So got it tagged taking my daughters to </v>

805
00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We drive it around for Halloween.</v>

806
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you really still has a snow plow on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the front and as you can imagine like it</v>

807
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 2>snowed once and like the last 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Georgia.</v>

808
00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:11.301
<v Speaker 2>And we made the news because everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>got on the interstate at the exact same </v>

809
00:36:11.301 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it melts the snow.</v>

810
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.730
<v Speaker 2>The fire blaster turns out there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Celica under their toys.</v>

811
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we left a note.</v>

812
00:36:18.501 --> 00:36:19.140
<v Speaker 2>It will be fine.</v>

813
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.540
<v Speaker 2>It was in Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in Caribou,</v>

814
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Maine at the old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

815
00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 2>the air force base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right there.</v>

816
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.540
<v Speaker 2>So there's Canada is just on the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of that shot and this is one of </v>

817
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.180
<v Speaker 2>those places where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

818
00:36:32.181 --> 00:36:37.181
<v Speaker 2>I think they call it a minute men where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to be able to get from like </v>

819
00:36:37.181 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 2>where you were sleeping to an airplane </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 60 seconds in case like Cold War.</v>

820
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's all these tunnels underneath </v>

821
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 2>where we were shooting and we had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all sorts of clearance would be out</v>

822
00:36:48.091 --> 00:36:49.230
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

823
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I bought the bus much as they </v>

824
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 2>sold that to for a I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

825
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I got a very good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it costs more to ship at home.</v>

826
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.590
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot to ship it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lie because you have to</v>

827
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:05.880
<v Speaker 2>put on a low boy cause no truck that </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivers cars can get through,</v>

828
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like 13 or 14 clearance getting </v>

829
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:11.330
<v Speaker 2>across the country.</v>

830
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.740
<v Speaker 2>So when it's already at like 12 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

831
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.900
<v Speaker 2>You have kind of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you think about driving it for about</v>

832
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:20.160
<v Speaker 2>five seconds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 44 super show offers.</v>

833
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine what the mileage would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like.</v>

834
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

835
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:28.110
<v Speaker 2>two months ago and there's 197,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles on it.</v>

836
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:33.230
<v Speaker 2>And Tanner drove and didn't kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It now says the magic school bus on the </v>

837
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.110
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a stereo in there.</v>

838
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we gassed it up,</v>

839
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:41.130
<v Speaker 2>got it ready for it to snow in January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't even get rain at my house.</v>

840
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so defeating year,</v>

841
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.350
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snow driving is.</v>

842
00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just some of the best out there.</v>

843
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Parking lots and snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what dreams are made up.</v>

844
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I learned how to drive in </v>

845
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.910
<v Speaker 2>snow in the parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

846
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the best.</v>

847
00:37:55.910 --> 00:38:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's so gentle the way you're </v>

848
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:00.350
<v Speaker 2>going sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

849
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel like when you go in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sideways on concrete,</v>

850
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:04.840
<v Speaker 2>it feels very violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

851
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.550
<v Speaker 2>On paved surfaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go in the snow,</v>

852
00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:13.551
<v Speaker 2>it's like woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wish I could remember a this girlfriend </v>

853
00:38:13.551 --> 00:38:13.760
<v Speaker 2>that I had back in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

854
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I took the car that I had to a parking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot once and for like an hour,</v>

855
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 2>all we did was like gun it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd slam on the e brake.</v>

856
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I turned the wheel and slam on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

857
00:38:24.601 --> 00:38:28.000
<v Speaker 2>We'd spin around in circles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just laughing and laughing.</v>

858
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.510
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>

859
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:31.770
<v Speaker 2>that's the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car's fine.</v>

860
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 2>That's basically drifting is because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the beauty of your car takes</v>

861
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 2>on concrete when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other friction and everything that's</v>

862
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:44.701
<v Speaker 2>rubbing but on snow and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just glad there are ice driving </v>

863
00:38:44.701 --> 00:38:44.701
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>

864
00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Tamar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>todd [inaudible] in Colorado for years.</v>

865
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons he's so good at what </v>

866
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.841
<v Speaker 2>he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically like a little road </v>

867
00:38:54.841 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 2>course they have and they wait for it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>snow and then they put a little water on</v>

868
00:38:56.411 --> 00:39:01.411
<v Speaker 2>it and ice it over and you take BMW's </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and learn how to handle a car </v>

869
00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:03.430
<v Speaker 2>in the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what a great idea is a great idea.</v>

870
00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:05.760
<v Speaker 2>And apparently it really translates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

871
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I w I almost got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle a long time ago,</v>

872
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.460
<v Speaker 2>but I saw a bunch of people crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw two crashes and a friend of mine </v>

873
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.481
<v Speaker 2>saw somebody get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy who was at a red light and </v>

874
00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 2>somebody was texting him this dude and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he went flying through the air and I was</v>

875
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:21.970
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

876
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my two friends that got hurt,</v>

877
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 2>they got hurt pretty bad.</v>

878
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking about getting one.</v>

879
00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:30.760
<v Speaker 2>And my friend said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wrote all his life?</v>

880
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:32.020
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a dirt bike,</v>

881
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.160
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a dirt bike and learn how to drive </v>

882
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.660
<v Speaker 2>in the dirt because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have that loose surface,</v>

883
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.900
<v Speaker 2>you get used to the ass kicking out on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and it becomes normal because it's </v>

884
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:42.900
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't panic.</v>

885
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.570
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's the same thing with snow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ice and totally probably directly </v>

886
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:50.280
<v Speaker 2>translates driving on the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so because it's,</v>

887
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all of that,</v>

888
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:53.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the overseer,</v>

889
00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 2>the uninsured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things that you would feel </v>

890
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.390
<v Speaker 2>in a smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe environment you would feel you </v>

891
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.390
<v Speaker 2>would feel they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's drifting.</v>

892
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

893
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.020
<v Speaker 2>that's a closely to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Turk up front from the back.</v>

894
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Know who these people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

895
00:40:07.251 --> 00:40:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this.</v>

896
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.110
<v Speaker 2>This is my mama right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my son.</v>

897
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 2>So he's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives up in New Hampshire.</v>

898
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Freddy's from Sweden I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but both of those cars.</v>

899
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:20.450
<v Speaker 2>So those start out Frederick Houseboat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a front wheel drive sign,</v>

900
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:25.510
<v Speaker 2>TC converted to rear wheel drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a turbo four cylinder and </v>

901
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.010
<v Speaker 2>they're Turks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Car Is A.</v>

902
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:29.470
<v Speaker 2>has a turbo super swapping it gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>turbo.</v>

903
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a a really seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love it.</v>

904
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just the most fun you can have in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

905
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's just going sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically these guys,</v>

906
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:40.090
<v Speaker 2>what they do is they have these clipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

907
00:40:40.091 --> 00:40:45.091
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they try to get as close to the </v>

908
00:40:45.091 --> 00:40:45.400
<v Speaker 2>clipping point is they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to do with their speed of entry,</v>

909
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 2>the angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car right,</v>

910
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:51.790
<v Speaker 2>and they've got this huge e-brake that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got the breaks or is big for the</v>

911
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 2>rear wheels as they are for the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've got a clutch,</v>

912
00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:59.551
<v Speaker 2>kick it pulling on a lever right block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that can block Mustang video,</v>

913
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing.</v>

914
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.810
<v Speaker 2>That four wheel drive Mustang call that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

915
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.750
<v Speaker 2>the Hunington guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a funny name for that.</v>

916
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:12.810
<v Speaker 2>The Unicorn a yes that that Mustang is </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a bad memory jammer,</v>

917
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:16.570
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What those guys do in that precision.</v>

918
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so calm and so the e brake is a big</v>

919
00:41:21.071 --> 00:41:24.550
<v Speaker 2>part of being able to do that and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they bring the car around.</v>

920
00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:29.551
<v Speaker 2>So especially in drifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys have to get as close to each </v>

921
00:41:29.551 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>others they can write while still </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping the line,</v>

922
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.400
<v Speaker 2>trying to get as close to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different like clipping points as they </v>

923
00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:35.400
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's slamming on the e brake,</v>

924
00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.701
<v Speaker 2>right to make these turns and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys have to to use the clutch at </v>

925
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:45.821
<v Speaker 2>the same time they're using the e brake </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get it to slide without killing </v>

926
00:41:45.821 --> 00:41:45.821
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

927
00:41:45.821 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 2>And then they get back on a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaughn gitten jr who drifts a Mustang.</v>

928
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.440
<v Speaker 2>He is full throttle the whole time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>module eight just with the clutch.</v>

929
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's like next level stuff that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

930
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I can only do seven things at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't have a 12th.</v>

931
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:03.410
<v Speaker 2>So one watching him go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanner has A.</v>

932
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Tamar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a VW Passat,</v>

933
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:09.750
<v Speaker 2>convert it's rear wheel drive and use </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ls seven from zero six.</v>

934
00:42:09.751 --> 00:42:11.330
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically like the Chevy,</v>

935
00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:12.690
<v Speaker 2>a cookbook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American Jewry,</v>

936
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.190
<v Speaker 2>and then they tune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gotten nine nine to the wheels that</v>

937
00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:19.700
<v Speaker 2>the chambers newpark wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine the wheels.</v>

938
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of car is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a Volkswagen Passat,</v>

939
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:28.490
<v Speaker 2>so on the outside it's a fucking shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>Volkswagen community car in the inside </v>

940
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:33.761
<v Speaker 2>it has 900 horsepower to the wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad ass.</v>

941
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 2>The most ridiculous thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard in my life.</v>

942
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I just wish Volkswagen would build </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like a little bit like that.</v>

943
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.220
<v Speaker 2>It would make them much cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let me ask you this.</v>

944
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are so weird that that can block </v>

945
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they think about that car?</v>

946
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Because he took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it 65 or 65 or 66 and they basically</v>

947
00:42:52.761 --> 00:42:57.761
<v Speaker 2>had to stretch it and make it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fit and they turn into a four wheel </v>

948
00:42:57.761 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did everybody freak out?</v>

949
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:04.100
<v Speaker 2>They lose the fucking power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That car made the cover a hot rod </v>

950
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:08.291
<v Speaker 2>magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it transcended like people like me </v>

951
00:43:08.291 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 2>that love import cars and in horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

952
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:10.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

953
00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to trump everyone with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ridiculous car.</v>

954
00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's one of those ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can also can kind of get away with stuff</v>

955
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Speaker 2>like that because he's Ken can block and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kinda just like,</v>

956
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 2>you have to dig that.</v>

957
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.400
<v Speaker 2>He can do what he wants to do because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>made it work.</v>

958
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:26.090
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

959
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.120
<v Speaker 2>that's tanner sought what a ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being 900 Horsepower v eight </v>

960

<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

961
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.060
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

962
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:43.010

<v Speaker 2>He does that global rally cross series,</v>

963
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:48.011
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot of funds basically him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ken Block and about 10 other people </v>

964
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.710
<v Speaker 2>wrecking the crap out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a single person out there </v>

965
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.950
<v Speaker 2>that knows how to pass besides tanner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets them.</v>

966
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.470
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

967
00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:03.120
<v Speaker 2>it's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These cars are so I just don't </v>

968
00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.461
<v Speaker 2>understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you do that to an ugly </v>

<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

974
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 2>But the coolest part is that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced them to let him do it.</v>

975
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like complete sub frame,</v>

981

<v Speaker 2>on the brakes and hold the button and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>holds the front brakes.</v>

991
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you rev it up,</v>

992
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 2>drop the clutch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a smoke show.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's really fun stuff out there.</v>

995
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.560
<v Speaker 2>If you make it to Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to come drive it.</v>

00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

997
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 2>But the cars are ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't understand.</v>

998
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Taking these ugly cars and turn them </v>
<v Speaker 2>into these amazing driving vehicles like</v>

999
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.610
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you want to invest that same </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of energy and is something that </v>

1000
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 2>looks great now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a fair point.</v>

1001
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't really thought about it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1002
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I saw this car I in and I was like,</v>

1003
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 2>oh well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1004
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Because for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got three daughters,</v>

1005
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can't,</v>

1006
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.700
<v Speaker 2>like I can't have [inaudible] because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a date night card.</v>

1007
00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beyond that I can't afford one.</v>

1008
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 2>But let's pretend for a second I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>afford it.</v>

1009
00:45:57.691 --> 00:46:02.691
<v Speaker 2>And I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still can't have one because I just </v>

1010
00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:02.691
<v Speaker 2>don't need just a car for me and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>

1011
00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I want my girls to be able to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

1012
00:46:04.021 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's Cya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can ride with me.</v>

1013
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I can have three car seats in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God go thousand miles there.</v>

1014
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.310
<v Speaker 2>They're tiny bit embarrassed by it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's really.</v>

1015
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:19.370
<v Speaker 2>It sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had magnaflow do nice custom exhaust </v>

1016
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.370
<v Speaker 2>when I was here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1017
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:21.090
<v Speaker 2>It's got a great growl to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the boost starts to build,</v>

1018
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:23.400
<v Speaker 2>it's got this huge single turbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>

1019
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:28.430
<v Speaker 2>It'll pay you back in your sheets for I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's like four 25 to the rear </v>

1020
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 2>wheels and a car's very light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 3000 pounds.</v>

1021
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.980
<v Speaker 2>They cut a lot of stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things safety wise,</v>

1022
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:40.710
<v Speaker 2>the best fucking bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lunchbox drove around a </v>

1023
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.521
<v Speaker 2>lunchbox with wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got air conditioning because I </v>

1024
00:46:43.521 --> 00:46:44.940
<v Speaker 2>wanted my wife to ride in it with me.</v>

1025
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 2>So when a bought it out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took it to my friends at tr,</v>

1026
00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Dionne Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Guy Chuck.</v>

1030
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a control panel for vintage</v>

1031
00:46:57.721 --> 00:46:58.830
<v Speaker 2>air thing in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1032
00:46:58.831 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 2>can you check and see like if we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

1033
00:47:01.111 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 2>And have air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked,</v>

1034
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1035
00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.630
<v Speaker 2>just going to bolt up a supra ac </v>
<v Speaker 2>compressor and charge it.</v>

1036
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.690
<v Speaker 2>You'll be fine for 20 horse at four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 horsepower.</v>

1037
00:47:09.691 --> 00:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>The thing that looks like insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like vintage air.</v>

1038
00:47:13.441 --> 00:47:17.400
<v Speaker 2>So important because they made those old</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot rods livable because if you drove in</v>

1039
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 2>one of those old hot rods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them didn't have any AC.</v>

1040
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.450
<v Speaker 2>And if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a joke.</v>

1041
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not.</v>

1042
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.860
<v Speaker 2>It was like the swamp cooler of what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put underneath.</v>

1043
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:28.050
<v Speaker 2>But my wife will actually ride in stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

1044
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.610
<v Speaker 2>That makes a big difference as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1045
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I do understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes.</v>

1046
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:37.140
<v Speaker 2>That definitely makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were you doing before you were </v>

1047
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.460
<v Speaker 2>hosting top gear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they found me and found you.</v>

1048
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I would say so I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1049
00:47:42.281 --> 00:47:44.950
<v Speaker 2>when a man and a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they find each other,</v>

1050
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 2>they found me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

1051
00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:47.770
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Youtube,</v>

1052
00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:52.771
<v Speaker 2>from a clip that somebody had loaded up </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was traveling with a the speed </v>

1053
00:47:52.771 --> 00:47:53.830
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started with them in,</v>

1054
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five from a craigslist ad.</v>

1055
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Love craigslist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1056
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm the number one craigslist fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1057
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I found this add on there that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>national motorsports company was looking</v>

1058
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 2>for a marketing guy that could be an MC.</v>

1059
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 2>And so I sent all my stuff in and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those terrible interviews.</v>

1060
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:12.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then two weeks later like,</v>

1061
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go down to Daytona.</v>

1062
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.290
<v Speaker 2>So you got the Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go down to Daytona and I,</v>

1063
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I like kind of knew a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nascar,</v>

1064
00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:25.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew Petey and Wallace Earnhardt I know </v>

1065
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 2>much else besides that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went to school for marketing.</v>

1066
00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:27.910
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden I want to be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

1067
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:32.410
<v Speaker 2>That was always my plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it started as a Dj for this big speed</v>

1068
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would go to all the races.</v>

1069
00:48:33.731 --> 00:48:35.800
<v Speaker 2>So I was out here at Fontana twice a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1070
00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:40.801
<v Speaker 2>I said all the other races and that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept begging him to let me do something </v>

1071
00:48:40.801 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 2>on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they finally let me a year later.</v>

1072
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:44.500
<v Speaker 2>And then I think a year after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1073
00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:45.790
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1074
00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:50.560
<v Speaker 2>John Schneider from the Dukes of hazzard</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to Atlanta Motor speedway to be the</v>

1075
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Grand Marshall.</v>

1076
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1077
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:54.100
<v Speaker 2>would you do this little piece with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>

1078
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does kind of lighter side of racing.</v>

1080
00:48:57.581 --> 00:49:02.581
<v Speaker 2>We found a general lead to borrow and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot this whole piece riding around in </v>

1081
00:49:02.581 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the generally in the whole time I refuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>to call him John.</v>

1082
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I would only refer to him as Bo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kept being like,</v>

1083
00:49:08.021 --> 00:49:11.470
<v Speaker 2>so Bo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm daisy is not your real cousin.</v>

1084
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.790

<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1085
00:49:13.791 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1086
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.170
<v Speaker 2>that's an actress Katherine Bach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1087
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.750
<v Speaker 2>but so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she was not your real cousin,</v>

1088
00:49:17.751 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Speaker 2>like you guys ever,</v>

1089
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:24.481

<v Speaker 2>And so he starts out,</v>

1090
00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really enjoyed it.</v>

1092
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:32.971
<v Speaker 2>And so some a race fan who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who loaded that clip onto </v>

<v Speaker 2>youtube illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Guy John Heseltine,</v>

1094
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:38.410

<v Speaker 2>saw it in A.</v>

1095
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was here still in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UK at that point.</v>

1096
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:42.460
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid might be funny.</v>

1097
00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:47.610
<v Speaker 2>He was looking at everybody who had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>on TV for cars and like the last 10 </v>

1098
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:47.610

<v Speaker 2>got kicked off because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>copywritten.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Craigslist is like a little bit filthy </v>

1115
00:50:28.281 --> 00:50:28.281
<v Speaker 2>dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but human beings</v>

<v Speaker 1>all about where everything's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's got a little bit turns on.</v>

1117
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It brings us a little bit of poop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a little bit.</v>

1118
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Speaker 1>That is this section of craigslist where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1125

1127
00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.370
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that is joy.</v>

1130
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like people who've seen too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>tom hanks movies and believe that they </v>

1131
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.380
<v Speaker 1>just missed out on the one they saw her </v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the courage,</v>

1134
00:51:15.021 --> 00:51:17.040
<v Speaker 1>but now I do and I need a finer.</v>

1135
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:22.790

<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to look at these </v>

1136
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.881
<v Speaker 1>because some of them are so we forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you probably don't spend </v>

1137
00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:26.180
<v Speaker 1>time with like my friends are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty normal people.</v>

1138
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:31.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't spend time with people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely just out of their mind crazy </v>

1139
00:51:31.181 --> 00:51:33.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's an entire section for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1140
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:38.230
<v Speaker 1>We had a guy like that on fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>once and he met a girl at a cod,</v>

1141
00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:43.651
<v Speaker 1>believe it was at a concert and spoke to</v>
<v Speaker 1>her briefly and wanted to win fear </v>

1142
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:49.030
<v Speaker 1>factor because he knew that she was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and he needed to find her again and </v>

1143
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:55.151
<v Speaker 1>he'd spent some insane amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and money going around the city and </v>

1144
00:51:55.581 --> 00:52:00.581
<v Speaker 1>where he met her putting up flyers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say put up all these flyers and you </v>

1145
00:52:00.581 --> 00:52:01.160
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those people that contacted him that</v>

1146
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:02.150
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl,</v>

1147
00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:03.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were fucking with him.</v>

1148
00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:08.951
<v Speaker 1>And he was like super determined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he had done it for like a couple of </v>

1149
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 1>years and they thought it was funny when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we first talked about having this guy on</v>

1150
00:52:12.831 --> 00:52:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got a great story.</v>

1151
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I heard the story I go to imagine </v>

1152
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 1>that was your fucking sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that was your daughter.</v>

1153
00:52:19.551 --> 00:52:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that was your girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a great story.</v>

1154
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:29.500
<v Speaker 1>He's nuts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows like where he's going to take </v>

1155
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:29.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1156
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows if he's murder,</v>

1157
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:31.190
<v Speaker 1>suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1158
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if she just.</v>

1159
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.710
<v Speaker 1>What if he said to her like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1160
00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:35.090
<v Speaker 1>can I get a Napkin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1161
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 1>What if that was the entire conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very brief conversation.</v>

1162
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I forget the nature of the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was extremely brief,</v>

1163
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but I remember being really creeped out </v>
<v Speaker 1>by him really creeped out.</v>

1164
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Like when we had him on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a lot,</v>

1165
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:53.910
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of decision making that </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into getting on those shows that I </v>

1166
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:57.401
<v Speaker 1>didn't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people made it onto the show </v>

1167
00:52:57.401 --> 00:52:57.401
<v Speaker 1>that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking really,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you out of your mind?</v>

1169
00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:03.910
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a guy that I almost got </v>

1170
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:07.661
<v Speaker 1>into a fist fight with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had to restrain him and it was </v>

1171
00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:07.661
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

1172
00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy he beat his girlfriend up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on one one TV show.</v>

1173
00:53:10.311 --> 00:53:15.311
<v Speaker 1>He threw her to the ground on a TV show </v>
<v Speaker 1>and attack some fucking guy on vh one </v>

1174
00:53:15.311 --> 00:53:17.600
<v Speaker 1>and then got in my face and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1175
00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And I said to them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you putting these crazy fucks </v>

1176
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:22.830

<v Speaker 1>you're responsible,</v>

1179
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 1>this is not a smart thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did the producers say to that?</v>

1180
00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't give a fuck,</v>

1181
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>

1182
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to make money and the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make money is to have crazy people on</v>

1183
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:36.200
<v Speaker 1>tv and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1184
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:39.470
<v Speaker 1>in my point of view was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had hosted,</v>

1185
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:44.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these people were kind of dangerous </v>

1186
00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.001
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on rooftops with him and shit in </v>

1187
00:53:47.001 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 1>downtown La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a 30 fucking stories,</v>

1188
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:47.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1189
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird shit that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen on those rooftops,</v>

1190
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could push somebody,</v>

1191
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:57.380
<v Speaker 1>somebody could jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had some like really nutty fucks </v>

1192
00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.370
<v Speaker 1>that made it on that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that guy that got the guy almost got</v>

1193
00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:04.371
<v Speaker 1>in a fight with that guy that was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find that girl they stood out like </v>

1194
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:09.411
<v Speaker 1>cheese is Christ because I looked in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes while I was talking to them and </v>

1195
00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 1>there was nobody there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just this missed of consciousness</v>

1196
00:54:13.621 --> 00:54:18.621
<v Speaker 1>who's like a child in a man's body who </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought he was in a movie and thought,</v>

1197
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's just gonna keep going until he</v>

1198
00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:23.670
<v Speaker 1>finds the ratio and as the show went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1199
00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days in and hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

1200
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:28.950
<v Speaker 1>you got deeper and deeper into who he </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is and he's creepier and creepier</v>

1201
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 1>and weirder and weirder.</v>

1202
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 1>And then even the producers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the third day it was like,</v>

1203
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 1>we made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't have this guy on the show.</v>

1204
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:40.270
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only hope that it doesn't ever right </v>

1205
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.270
<v Speaker 1>by bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only hope we never find that girl,</v>

1206
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:41.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>

1207
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 1>can I ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was such a big fan.</v>

1208
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.700
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was Newsradio lack?</v>

1209
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Because when I watched that show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw,</v>

1210
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an amazing group of people you got </v>

1211
00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 1>to work with like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look back on that time,</v>

1212
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:59.980
<v Speaker 1>like how does that rank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you've done some really cool </v>

1213
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.000
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out for sure.</v>

1214
00:55:00.001 --> 00:55:05.001
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fucked me up at queered me off of </v>

1215
00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:05.120
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1216
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I never do another [inaudible] because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it will never be that good because it </v>

1217
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.390
<v Speaker 1>was so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so lucky and I had gotten to</v>

1218
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 1>do a show before that for Fox.</v>

1219
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:20.480
<v Speaker 1>That was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was called hardballs a baseball set </v>

1220
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:20.480
<v Speaker 1>comp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1221
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.360
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't horrible because of the </v>

1222
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.121
<v Speaker 1>creators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those situations were </v>

1223
00:55:26.121 --> 00:55:28.161
<v Speaker 1>really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys who wrote with married with </v>

1224
00:55:28.161 --> 00:55:28.161
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrote off for the simpsons.</v>

1225
00:55:28.161 --> 00:55:30.720
<v Speaker 1>They created a show and then the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>became,</v>

1226
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.320
<v Speaker 1>once it went on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took it away from them and then </v>

1227
00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:36.320
<v Speaker 1>they brought in some hacks and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>became.</v>

1228
00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It was grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that got canceled really quick </v>

1229
00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:41.220
<v Speaker 1>because I went from that to news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the total opposite.</v>

1230
00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy running the show at genius,</v>

1231
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:48.201
<v Speaker 1>the writers were fantastic that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scripts were insanely funny and the </v>

1232
00:55:48.201 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 1>people were so talented and I had no </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting experience.</v>

1233
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I had taken a few acting lessons because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they forced me into taking it.</v>

1234
00:55:54.001 --> 00:55:55.530
<v Speaker 1>When the game me this big development </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>

1235
00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

1236
00:55:55.910 --> 00:56:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It was all based on stand up and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden the mountain Hollywood and I'm </v>

1237
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:04.641
<v Speaker 1>totally feel like a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally feel like I don't belong and </v>

1238
00:56:04.641 --> 00:56:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the greatest outcome of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1239
00:56:05.521 --> 00:56:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It was madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was.</v>

1240
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:11.810
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the greatest things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that it never got any </v>

1241
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 1>recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no one ever got a big head because it</v>

1242
00:56:12.151 --> 00:56:13.560
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever got famous from it.</v>

1243
00:56:13.561 --> 00:56:18.561
<v Speaker 1>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We barely survived every year and the </v>

1244
00:56:18.561 --> 00:56:22.041
<v Speaker 1>one year that I thought that we weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get canceled was the year we </v>

1245
00:56:22.041 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 1>got canceled because it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1246
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't cancel us after Phil Hartman</v>

1247
00:56:24.941 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 1>got murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1248
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.300
<v Speaker 1>We're probably not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>canceled.</v>

1249
00:56:27.301 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it just didn't work.</v>

1250
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't work with Jon Lovitz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it does love,</v>

1251
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.540
<v Speaker 1>it isn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1252
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fucked.</v>

1253
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dead.</v>

1254
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 1>It was the whole thing was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:44.970
<v Speaker 1>even though there was andy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick was still on the show and Vicky </v>

1256
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Maura tierney was still </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing and Dave Foley is still.</v>

1257
00:56:46.431 --> 00:56:51.431
<v Speaker 1>It was like having filled dead was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always going to be a part of what was </v>

1258
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:53.950
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't work.</v>

1259
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.010
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was</v>

1260
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.880
<v Speaker 2>time was such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1261
00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:58.530
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1262
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:04.270
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really interesting landscape for tv </v>

1263
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.270
<v Speaker 2>because there weren't a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also like,</v>

1264
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.261
<v Speaker 2>if we look back at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember a lot of other shows </v>

1265
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:10.941
<v Speaker 2>that I really liked and could sit there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was such a good ensemble of </v>

1266
00:57:10.941 --> 00:57:12.120
<v Speaker 2>so many people that brought different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1267
00:57:12.121 --> 00:57:17.121
<v Speaker 2>Whereas normally there's like there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alpha male and then there's two other </v>

1268
00:57:17.121 --> 00:57:20.451
<v Speaker 2>sort of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like that was a fantastic mix of </v>

1269
00:57:20.451 --> 00:57:20.820
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a group.</v>

1270
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.080
<v Speaker 2>It was a very weird.</v>

1271
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:26.490
<v Speaker 1>None of us were all outliers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all Weirdos.</v>

1272
00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Like even phil was a Weirdo de </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

1273
00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:34.540
<v Speaker 1>as weird as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick's the weirdest human that's ever </v>

1274
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:34.540
<v Speaker 1>walked the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was weird.</v>

1275
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't belong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one belonged.</v>

1276
00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all had some weird bond because of </v>

1277
00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:43.140
<v Speaker 1>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all felt like we didn't fit in.</v>

1278
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And so like when we would do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we'd have guests stars,</v>

1279
00:57:46.021 --> 00:57:47.790
<v Speaker 1>it would be like real actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>

1280
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:52.910
<v Speaker 1>what's this methodology that he's doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have guest stars and they would</v>

1281
00:57:52.911 --> 00:57:57.240
<v Speaker 1>like talk after talk like industry talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a way that actors talk.</v>

1282
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.890
<v Speaker 1>They pick up this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1283
00:57:58.891 --> 00:58:03.891
<v Speaker 1>this sort of acquired vernacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I say when </v>

1284
00:58:03.891 --> 00:58:03.891
<v Speaker 1>they meet someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

1285
00:58:03.891 --> 00:58:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to meet Ya.</v>

1286
00:58:04.411 --> 00:58:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Like you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do normal stuff.</v>

1287
00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:11.690
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to see you because they're hoping </v>

1288
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:14.960
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't meet you and forget you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't give a fuck about </v>

1289
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:14.960
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1290
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.750
<v Speaker 1>There are so constantly they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on themselves wholly and </v>

1291
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:19.620
<v Speaker 1>exclusively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to mitigate that,</v>

1292
00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:21.570
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to see you,</v>

1293
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and so it becomes this thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>all say.</v>

1294
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:26.850
<v Speaker 1>So when you meet someone they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to see you and they're an actor,</v>

1295
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:31.970
<v Speaker 1>fucking run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've adopted this actor think shirts </v>

1296
00:58:32.221 --> 00:58:35.310
<v Speaker 1>and they would read like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would call the devil's rag,</v>

1297
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 1>like the Hollywood reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would read that shit and get angry.</v>

1298
00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:40.140
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does he have a show?</v>

1299
00:58:40.141 --> 00:58:41.130
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does she have a show?</v>

1300
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And they like that shit would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we have guest stars that we </v>

1301
00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:49.500
<v Speaker 1>would like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a weird combination of a bunch</v>

1302
00:58:49.501 --> 00:58:52.110
<v Speaker 1>of people that were just Weirdos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just,</v>

1303
00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:55.630
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't fit the mold of standard sit</v>

1304
00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:59.970
<v Speaker 1>calm and no one went on to do a sitcom </v>
<v Speaker 1>since none of them.</v>

1305
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one did.</v>

1306
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm Vicky did one for a little bit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work out.</v>

1307
00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm Stephen Root,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went on to do amazing work and office </v>

1308
00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:13.971
<v Speaker 1>space and he was in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was fantastic in that fucking hbo.</v>

1309
00:59:14.071 --> 00:59:14.910
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1310
00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:20.330
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hbo Documentary of the HBO show.</v>

1311
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.410
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is his show with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1312
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 1>about liquor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about bootleg liquor sales.</v>

1313
00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Boardwalk Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1314
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:28.940
<v Speaker 1>boardwalk empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was amazing in that.</v>

1315
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a fucking brilliant actor.</v>

1316
00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>He was the one guy that wasn't himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the show to like,</v>

1317
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:39.430
<v Speaker 1>like what they would do is they take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wackiest shit about like Andy and </v>

1318
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:40.920
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated wackiest shit about me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated.</v>

1319
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:43.790
<v Speaker 1>But Stephen Root,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you met him,</v>

1320
00:59:43.791 --> 00:59:48.791
<v Speaker 1>he's nothing like Jimmy James.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy James says this wacky character </v>

1321
00:59:48.791 --> 00:59:50.720
<v Speaker 1>that he developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just a brilliant,</v>

1322
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:52.760
<v Speaker 1>brilliant actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1323
00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:54.260
<v Speaker 1>just to the bone.</v>

1324
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to you one day and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about the difference and I </v>

1325
00:59:59.320 --> 00:59:59.320
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1326
00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if it was stand up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching you or or the podcast,</v>

1327
01:00:01.251 --> 01:00:06.251
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a comedians and actors and how </v>

1328
01:00:06.251 --> 01:00:10.961
<v Speaker 1>essentially the actors have to get up </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day and pretend to be someone </v>

1329
01:00:10.961 --> 01:00:10.961
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really like.</v>

1330
01:00:10.961 --> 01:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas comedians like know who they are</v>

1331
01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they talk about,</v>

1332
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.420
<v Speaker 1>but even in my limited experience in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that town I don't like.</v>

1333
01:00:19.421 --> 01:00:24.421
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever have to wake up and wonder </v>

1334
01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:26.261
<v Speaker 1>who to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what that's truly liked </v>

1335
01:00:26.261 --> 01:00:29.191
<v Speaker 1>to to dive into someone so much that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially get paid to lose yourself </v>

1336
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>each time and then you have to move on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do it again.</v>

1337
01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a lot harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will think that Steven Brute,</v>

1338
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>who's the one guy who did that on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show is he doesn't have any problems </v>

1339
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>knowing who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really nice guy.</v>

1340
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Super easy to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to know him.</v>

1341
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>He's like very warm and friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy going guy and he just loves the </v>

1342
01:00:49.551 --> 01:00:54.551
<v Speaker 1>craft of creating a character like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has the most pure intention other </v>

1343
01:00:55.571 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>than any actor person I've ever met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his,</v>

1344
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>his love is really of creating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that Steve Buscemi character </v>

1345
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>that you remember from that movie that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1346
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>that Russell Crowe character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like fucking nailed it,</v>

1347
01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1348
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>He just loves nailing a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a master actor.</v>

1349
01:01:14.151 --> 01:01:19.151
<v Speaker 1>He's just a master at that and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between those people and the </v>

1350
01:01:19.151 --> 01:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>people that just want to be famous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to be famous as an actor.</v>

1351
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of weirdness in that </v>

1352
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>craft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1353
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant percentage of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that want to do it are massively damaged</v>

1354
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:36.191
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they feel like they should </v>

1355
01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they got fucked over when they</v>

1356
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>were children or when they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>adolescents or whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to them.</v>

1358
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>That led them to have this insatiable </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to be thought of as special.</v>

1359
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And once they get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when they become maniacs.</v>

1360
01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody's heard the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's got their own [inaudible].</v>

1361
01:01:51.991 --> 01:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Then they become maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>

1362
01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I've met them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them,</v>

1363
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to them.</v>

1364
01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I had Roseanne on and she was telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how fucking crazy she went.</v>

1365
01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>When she got sick on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

1366
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely crazy.</v>

1367
01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Like she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll tell you.</v>

1368
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>And she was a great standup comic in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

1369
01:02:09.941 --> 01:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the top 10 greatest of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1370
01:02:12.831 --> 01:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>like Roseanne's in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like revolutionary influential</v>

1371
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>stand ups I think for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for time,</v>

1372
01:02:19.711 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>like she's</v>

1373
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.980
<v Speaker 3>a top 10 and she was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went crazy.</v>

1374
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all go crazy.</v>

1375
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:26.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like she seems totally chill now </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1376
01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just perspective over time or </v>

1377
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.100
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's that she got rid of Tom</v>

1378
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Arnold that helped mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Is,</v>

1379
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 3>he is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every cycle.</v>

1380
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.330
<v Speaker 3>You know why he married her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

1381
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just me,</v>

1382
01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's one of those guys,</v>

1383
01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 3>if you watched like 12 hours of just his</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1384
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

1385
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1386
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.880

<v Speaker 3>I did the best damn sport show when he </v>

1387
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:55.880
<v Speaker 3>was on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy.</v>

1388
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1389
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 3>he took his shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to do what he had to do,</v>

1390
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.080
<v Speaker 3>married Roseanne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did what he had to do and then it didn't</v>

1391
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.540
<v Speaker 3>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>

1392
01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:05.010
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some days my wife will be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>early.</v>

1397
01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a different negotiation I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think when you're married.</v>

1398
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.860
<v Speaker 3>But like his was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>have a career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>

1400
01:03:22.471 --> 01:03:27.471
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying she's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a different kind of </v>

1401
01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:27.471
<v Speaker 3>negotiation for the record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1402
01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1405
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Speaker 3>like I want to say that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1406
01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.900
<v Speaker 3>you will trade sex for hanging up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>painting.</v>

1407
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll make this house and I get it.</v>

1408
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.970

<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

1409
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.720
<v Speaker 3>But that's like everybody wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like nobody got hurt there and you </v>

1410
01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:47.720
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was happy.</v>

1411
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:49.290
<v Speaker 3>He sold us all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1412
01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.060
<v Speaker 3>but he got out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's alive.</v>

1413
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:56.480
<v Speaker 3>You get a refund on your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do you think happens at that </v>

1414
01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:56.480
<v Speaker 3>point?</v>

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.660
<v Speaker 3>How do you channel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm finishing my coffee.</v>

1437
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.290
<v Speaker 3>There was a conviction of that being </v>
<v Speaker 3>that crazy.</v>

1438
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 3>He just created a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1439
01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:17.901
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coen brothers movies are my ultimate </v>

1440
01:05:17.901 --> 01:05:18.400
<v Speaker 3>favorite movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I saw Donald Trump was running</v>

1441
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 3>for president the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say we live in a Coen brothers movie.</v>

1442
01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:22.170
<v Speaker 3>It's official.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>

1443
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:27.180
<v Speaker 3>because like his fucking Slob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is goofy Slob is going to run his </v>

1444
01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 3>ego just pouring out of his ears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ever met him.</v>

1445
01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.520
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird dude.</v>

1446
01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:35.521
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure we met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did something on top care where </v>

1447
01:05:35.521 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to convince him to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick one of these cars that,</v>

1448
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:38.640
<v Speaker 3>that we had each pick for a celebrity.</v>

1449
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.690
<v Speaker 3>We found out like halfway through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for Donald Trump.</v>

1450
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.540
<v Speaker 3>And he basically was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1451
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 3>this guy looks gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's looking at tanner was like,</v>

1452
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I think this car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look gay.</v>

1453
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.170
<v Speaker 3>So the car's probably for gay person at </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever tailored to.</v>

1454
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:54.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what kind of car he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>picked the teams.</v>

1455
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Like what did you tell Donald Trump to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make fun of me that I look like I'm in.</v>

1456
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:04.080
<v Speaker 3>That's just what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just went for it and then he was </v>

1457
01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:04.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam,</v>

1458
01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I'll take your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it trying to be funny?</v>

1459
01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I think he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's one of those people that I </v>

1460
01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:14.011
<v Speaker 3>don't think he can hear other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe he can read lips a tiny </v>

1461
01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:17.581
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like he walks into the room and all </v>

1462
01:06:17.581 --> 01:06:17.581
<v Speaker 3>you do is you look at his hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1463
01:06:17.581 --> 01:06:21.601
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is nothing an asteroid hit the </v>

1464
01:06:21.601 --> 01:06:23.260
<v Speaker 3>earth next door and you'd still be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1465
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 3>what's going on up there to that?</v>

1466
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you get up every day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you say,</v>

1467
01:06:28.601 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the look weirds me out.</v>

1468
01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Here's you and him weirds me out is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like he's going bald,</v>

1469
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:38.800
<v Speaker 3>is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1470
01:06:38.801 --> 01:06:43.801
<v Speaker 3>I think he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just moves it around in some weird </v>

1471
01:06:43.801 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 3>way or doesn't want to cut it or it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>signature look,</v>

1472
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.660
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like there's too much hair </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there for him to be going bald.</v>

1473
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just I ain't been there in real </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1474
01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:57.211
<v Speaker 3>So what do you remember the hair spray </v>
<v Speaker 3>that had looked like hair follicles?</v>

1475
01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's like that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1476
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a rug.</v>

1477
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 3>It's in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1478
01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.140
<v Speaker 3>you can't take your eyes off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand.</v>

1479
01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't think it looks good dudes.</v>

1480
01:07:11.621 --> 01:07:16.621
<v Speaker 3>So in a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because New York doesn't actually like </v>

1481
01:07:16.621 --> 01:07:16.621
<v Speaker 3>him that much,</v>

01:12:13.681 --> 01:12:16.380
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it got down to like a million.</v>

1597
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:20.040
<v Speaker 3>But he might have had a lot of debt to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the entire story was,</v>

1598
01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:25.041
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a store that I've read in one </v>

1599
01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:27.351
<v Speaker 3>of those magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>esquire in New York or something like </v>

1600
01:12:27.351 --> 01:12:29.781
<v Speaker 3>that and they were essentially saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that what he's doing right now is </v>

1601
01:12:29.781 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 3>pretending that he's rich and then if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at like the amount of debt that</v>

1602
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:34.980
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he knew how to get rich.</v>

1603
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I like that knows what the fuck he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1604
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:40.200
<v Speaker 3>You just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always wonder like,</v>

1605
01:12:40.201 --> 01:12:44.010
<v Speaker 3>do you like to be a Michael Jordan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you have to be kind of crazy,</v>

1606
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:49.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly that Goddamn damn good at </v>

1607

<v Speaker 3>basketball and to be that fucking deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>making son of a bitch,</v>

1608
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 3>don't you have to be a real asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>

1609
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to trade in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1610
01:12:57.531 --> 01:12:59.910
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he claimed his network was 9 billion.</v>

1611
01:12:59.911 --> 01:13:02.580
<v Speaker 3>We figure is close to 4 billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] billion to be exact,</v>

1612
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.920
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is recently now,</v>

1613
01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:06.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is yesterday.</v>

1614
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is like,</v>

1615
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:10.770
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if he's worth 4 billion or knight,</v>

1616
01:13:10.771 --> 01:13:12.990
<v Speaker 3>who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a goddamn billionaire.</v>

1617
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a while ago at one point in </v>

1618
01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.650
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say like maybe 15 years ago,</v>

1619
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:21.630
<v Speaker 3>maybe 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1620
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:26.690
<v Speaker 3>He had hit a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a really a really bad spot and </v>

1621
01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:28.120
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue with him,</v>

1622
01:13:28.121 --> 01:13:33.121
<v Speaker 3>like opening up golf courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look some golf course in Scotland and </v>

1623
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:34.680
<v Speaker 3>this one guy was fighting it and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>one guy,</v>

1624
01:13:34.681 --> 01:13:39.681
<v Speaker 3>like he had land that was outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>golf course and they wanted to buy him </v>

1625
01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:40.740
<v Speaker 3>out and he wouldn't sell and it became </v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge issue.</v>

1626
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1627
01:13:41.731 --> 01:13:43.350
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a loser.</v>

1628
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:45.020
<v Speaker 3>He wants to show me his property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy's like,</v>

1629
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my house man fucking stone.</v>

1630
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a fascinating thing.</v>

1631
01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:56.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this insane pursuit of just ungodly </v>

1632
01:13:56.941 --> 01:14:01.941
<v Speaker 3>wealth and that's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his thing and now he's going to </v>

1633
01:14:01.941 --> 01:14:02.910
<v Speaker 3>run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird man.</v>

1634
01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:07.911
<v Speaker 3>I'm all about keeping the lights on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes you watch those people </v>

1635
01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:07.911
<v Speaker 3>that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what you know.</v>

1636
01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:10.980
<v Speaker 3>There has to be this good balance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1637
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Hustle and drive in enjoyment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're just doing stuff all the </v>

1638
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:18.370
<v Speaker 3>time and you can't find anything good </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of life,</v>

1639
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 3>you should probably just check up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

1640
01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:27.190
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he does find good out of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked me to be on that celebrity </v>

1641
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:27.190
<v Speaker 3>apprentice thing.</v>

1642
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:29.140
<v Speaker 3>I thought about it for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would have been great man.</v>

1643
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1644
01:14:30.951 --> 01:14:32.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't like those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1645
01:14:32.741 --> 01:14:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like those fake scenarios work,</v>

1646
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.160
<v Speaker 3>any of that just didn't seem appealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and it wasn't a fuck load of </v>

1647
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:41.160
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't enough money where I was like,</v>

1648
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.870
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also,</v>

1649
01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy those kinds of.</v>

1650
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Would dance with the stars or you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>no fucking chance.</v>

1651
01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Not a chance in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard.</v>

1652
01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.650
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a part in that movie.</v>

1653
01:14:53.651 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Zookeeper and I had to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dance.</v>

1654
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Me and Leslie Bibb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1655
01:14:57.911 --> 01:14:58.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did this,</v>

1656
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.040
<v Speaker 3>this dance scene where we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to learn how to dance for fucking </v>

1657
01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:04.040
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to take dance lessons.</v>

1658
01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome.</v>

1659
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were like,</v>

1660
01:15:07.421 --> 01:15:08.880
<v Speaker 3>you should totally do dancing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>

1661
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck you dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No chance.</v>

1662
01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:14.650
<v Speaker 3>And now it's not even dancing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>

1663
01:15:14.651 --> 01:15:17.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like dancing with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be stars like a long time ago.</v>

1664
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:20.620
<v Speaker 3>The Internet sensations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing with the people.</v>

1665
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 3>You kind of know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like dancing with the people who someone</v>

1666
01:15:24.281 --> 01:15:28.240
<v Speaker 3>out there knows that the bachelor guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just all there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>those are the people that are.</v>

1670
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:40.051
<v Speaker 3>I'm proud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I go to the supermarket and I </v>

1671
01:15:40.051 --> 01:15:42.901
<v Speaker 3>see us weekly and I look at the cover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I love is want to look at the </v>

1672

<v Speaker 3>cover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Talking about good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad.</v>

1678
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I'm out of that cultural loop.</v>

1679
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.520
<v Speaker 3>It's strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1680
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're thinking about this all </v>

1681
01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.131
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not sure why people care about </v>

1682
01:16:02.131 --> 01:16:04.690
<v Speaker 3>some of the people that we do that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really that we care.</v>

1683
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:09.750
<v Speaker 3>It's that they broadcast people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I've thought about this </v>

1684
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:12.991
<v Speaker 3>long and hard for a long time when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have something like television and it's </v>

1685
01:16:13.661 --> 01:16:18.661
<v Speaker 3>something that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a natural thing that people come </v>

1686
01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:21.331
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they turn it on and they sit there and </v>

1687
01:16:21.331 --> 01:16:21.331
<v Speaker 3>they badge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have children too and uh,</v>

1688
01:16:21.331 --> 01:16:25.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I want my kids to chill for a </v>

1689
01:16:25.531 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 3>second and just like sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I need to do something,</v>

1690
01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:27.460
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>daddy has to make a business call.</v>

1691
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:29.470
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to put on one episode of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1692
01:16:29.471 --> 01:16:31.390
<v Speaker 3>What show do you want to watch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll sit down.</v>

1693
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:35.710
<v Speaker 3>They fucking Zombie out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right for that 20 minutes or 20 minutes,</v>

1694
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:38.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shows on their jaws open up and they</v>

1695
01:16:38.171 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 3>sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a drink.</v>

1696
01:16:39.371 --> 01:16:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want some chips?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I know they're not going anywhere,</v>

1701
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:51.390
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something that happens when </v>

1702
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.390
<v Speaker 3>people watch tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just lock in.</v>

1703
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Well if you get used to that thing being</v>
<v Speaker 3>on while you'll watch almost anything.</v>

1704
01:16:55.691 --> 01:16:57.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's how keeping up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kardashians,</v>

1705
01:16:57.461 --> 01:17:00.730
<v Speaker 3>it's still on the air because people sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>down there and they watch.</v>

1706
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.140
<v Speaker 3>They just sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting to buy this for us,</v>

1707
01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.130
<v Speaker 3>but then I couldn't find it and I was </v>

<v Speaker 1>bastard before it became a woman,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's none of that.</v>

1725
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:47.990
<v Speaker 1>There's none of that like because the </v>

<v Speaker 1>This one woman that we had on the show </v>

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.970
<v Speaker 1>named Sue Akins and she lives 200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking miles plus above the arctic </v>

1731
01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:07.220
<v Speaker 1>circle in this place where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to have permanent structure.</v>

1732
01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So she has tents that she built up there</v>

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 1>She went back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot the bear and ate it.</v>

1739
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:29.860

<v Speaker 3>up in her console.</v>

1829
01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:30.840

<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1865
01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:57.250
<v Speaker 3>No Kid,</v>

1869
01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:08.090
<v Speaker 2>do we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the beauty is when kids say things </v>

1870
01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:09.880
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know aren't wrong,</v>

1871
01:24:09.881 --> 01:24:12.430

<v Speaker 2>understand that publicly.</v>

1872
01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're incorrect.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might have been Indiana.</v>

1875
01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:27.601
<v Speaker 2>It's something with an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the home of the guy that created a </v>

1876
01:24:27.601 --> 01:24:31.171
<v Speaker 2>raggedy ann and Andy Doll and it just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens there was a parade in Andy </v>

<v Speaker 2>Parade and kids here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a parade and it's.</v>

1878
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like catnip to children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just go,</v>

1879
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:43.501
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to see this parade and we're </v>

1880
01:24:43.501 --> 01:24:43.501
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get them out of the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stretch it looks.</v>

1881
01:24:43.501 --> 01:24:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We'll see the parade.</v>

1883
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Big woman comes up on a golf cart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she tells this high school girl,</v>

1884
01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plugging the speakers and this girl gets</v>

1885
01:24:50.411 --> 01:24:54.360
<v Speaker 2>out with a boombox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a disk man and two,</v>

1886
01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:58.150
<v Speaker 2>three inch speakers and she plugs it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an orange extension cord.</v>

1887
01:24:58.150 --> 01:25:00.780
<v Speaker 2>And my wife turned to me and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1888
01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.200
<v Speaker 2>do you think that's the music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1889

<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just got this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let's look this up.</v>

1891
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.880
<v Speaker 2>And then suddenly realize the parade has</v>
<v Speaker 2>begun.</v>

1892
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:12.140
<v Speaker 2>My uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our four year old male,</v>

<v Speaker 2>LCR,</v>

1894
01:25:13.511 --> 01:25:18.511
<v Speaker 2>seven year old standing at my wife's </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding the baby and so they start in </v>

1895
01:25:18.511 --> 01:25:20.740
<v Speaker 2>the first group is about six women </v>
<v Speaker 2>dresses,</v>

1896
01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:25.741
<v Speaker 2>Ragaini in and then one weird dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing striped socks and I don't know </v>

1897
01:25:25.781 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 2>how to tell you this man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just felt like saying,</v>

1898
01:25:27.461 --> 01:25:32.461
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to dress up like it </v>

1899
01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.100
<v Speaker 2>just stand over here with the other 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>of us watching this parade,</v>

1900
01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.710
<v Speaker 2>which is all of a hundred yards long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually,</v>

1901
01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.960
<v Speaker 2>that that's way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 30 yards long.</v>

1902
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.500
<v Speaker 2>So the six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the six women go buy it.</v>

1903
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Then there's about five high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls dresses,</v>

1904
01:25:42.581 --> 01:25:47.581
<v Speaker 2>raggedy Ann.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They walk by and then there's the eight </v>

1905
01:25:47.581 --> 01:25:48.400
<v Speaker 2>girls from the local high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat core.</v>

1906
01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the entire parade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes maybe a minute and a half.</v>

1907
01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.110
<v Speaker 2>And then lc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seven year old said,</v>

1908
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:59.710
<v Speaker 2>is that a real loud chemo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of town is there.</v>

1909
01:25:59.711 --> 01:26:04.711
<v Speaker 2>And then millie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the four year old says that's the worst </v>

1910
01:26:04.711 --> 01:26:04.711
<v Speaker 2>parade ever seen.</v>

1911
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 3>She's not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to tell her like,</v>

1912
01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit there and you're like,</v>

1913
01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1914
01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 3>how do you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1915
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:16.460
<v Speaker 3>millie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>debt wasn't very sweet.</v>

1916
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Very honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just go get some food.</v>

1917
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Let's get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know they tried.</v>

1918
01:26:22.941 --> 01:26:27.941
<v Speaker 3>But like sometimes when kids say stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know how else to be like </v>

1919
01:26:27.941 --> 01:26:30.761
<v Speaker 3>you're not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But socially we shouldn't say that out </v>

1920
01:26:30.761 --> 01:26:33.941
<v Speaker 3>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they need to experience that </v>

1921
01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:33.941
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to know that not everything is</v>

1922
01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:35.240
<v Speaker 3>the Disneyland parade.</v>

<v Speaker 3>country it's dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a terrible fucking parade.</v>

1926
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:51.430

<v Speaker 3>terrible raggedy and prey drive from La </v>

1930
01:26:58.871 --> 01:27:03.460
<v Speaker 3>still and just a great town in </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to some of the really odd </v>

1931

<v Speaker 3>k one event that was in Vegas.</v>

1935
01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:20.650
<v Speaker 3>And so we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let's just stop over here and go </v>

1936

<v Speaker 3>gun fight in the whole thing and like </v>

<v Speaker 3>behind it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like Saloon Bank,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and all we could talk about for like the</v>

<v Speaker 3>whole weekend was that fucking Shitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild west show that we stopped off just </v>

1947
01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:56.060
<v Speaker 3>randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely randomly pull off the road,</v>

1948
01:27:56.061 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 3>drove a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled in,</v>

<v Speaker 3>got in and went to see this ridiculous </v>

1951
01:28:04.541 --> 01:28:04.541
<v Speaker 3>wild west show.</v>

1952
01:28:04.541 --> 01:28:07.280
<v Speaker 3>That was the highlight of our weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at the time,</v>

1953
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.740
<v Speaker 3>but became the highlight of our week and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all weekend.</v>

1954
01:28:09.741 --> 01:28:14.741
<v Speaker 3>We're just making fun of this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild west show that we saw and their </v>

1955
01:28:14.741 --> 01:28:15.770
<v Speaker 3>total commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1956
01:28:15.771 --> 01:28:19.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the part like when you see it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like Wyatt earp walks out.</v>

1957
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not a guy who's kind of wider </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitch.</v>

1958
01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:24.620
<v Speaker 3>This son of a bitch believes he is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wider.</v>

1959
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:28.910
<v Speaker 3>He grew that mustache curly at the poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>bastards.</v>

1960
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:34.120
<v Speaker 3>They just made it kind of like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that believe in doing the </v>

1961
01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:34.280
<v Speaker 3>reenactments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1962
01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:40.620
<v Speaker 3>I know how this could end the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>reenactments or reenactments where you </v>

1963
01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:44.441
<v Speaker 3>know it's a lie in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a reenactment of like the time you </v>

1964
01:28:44.441 --> 01:28:48.071
<v Speaker 3>saw big foot this fucking show on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sci fi network.</v>

1965
01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:52.970
<v Speaker 3>When I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when my show was on Joe Rogan questions,</v>

1966
01:28:52.971 --> 01:28:53.870
<v Speaker 3>everything was on the network.</v>

1967
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:58.130
<v Speaker 3>They had this supernatural show that </v>
<v Speaker 3>should've just been called the liars our</v>

1968
01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:03.460
<v Speaker 3>because it was all just a bunch of liars</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of them was these people that </v>

1969
01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:06.921
<v Speaker 3>said that they were trapped in a house </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Maine while werewolves were outside </v>

1970
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 3>and they just going over this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and they're like talking about.</v>

1971
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:13.320
<v Speaker 3>And then they had like the reenactments </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>

1972
01:29:13.321 --> 01:29:17.430
<v Speaker 3>like looking out the window and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're trapped.</v>

1973
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.940
<v Speaker 3>The werewolves not know that glass is </v>
<v Speaker 3>super fucking easy to break your know.</v>

1974
01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.850
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking out windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The werewolves,</v>

1975
01:29:23.851 --> 01:29:28.851
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're protected inside this fucking </v>

1976
01:29:28.851 --> 01:29:28.851
<v Speaker 3>house when he's killing machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:29:28.851 --> 01:29:32.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they can't figure out how to </v>

1978
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:32.100
<v Speaker 3>break the glass and get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The meeting.</v>

1979
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Delicious portions inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1980
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how that works for the </v>

1981
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.310
<v Speaker 3>center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The werewolves,</v>

1982
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:38.010
<v Speaker 3>they're little like there's one in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>lobby,</v>

1983
01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Speaker 3>but genuinely frightened me.</v>

1984
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 3>You think it's going to stop and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the doorbell?</v>

1985
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:45.120
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a rubber one.</v>

1986
01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 3>It's really easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't weigh that much.</v>

1987
01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Smack it wiggles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that was a werewolf,</v>

1988
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 3>it's going through your window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna tear apart.</v>

1989
01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Everybody in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just those reenactments,</v>

1990
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:56.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1991
01:29:56.331 --> 01:29:58.320
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're cheesy in the first place,</v>

1992
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.920
<v Speaker 3>but when it's a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you know it's a long time and those</v>

1993
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.880
<v Speaker 3>are the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like those guys?</v>

1994
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:10.370
<v Speaker 3>They watching that show cracks me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are nice and some of them </v>

1995
01:30:10.741 --> 01:30:15.741
<v Speaker 3>really believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why did you to just look at each </v>

1996
01:30:15.741 --> 01:30:18.891
<v Speaker 3>other with that funny look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we've had a bunch of those guys </v>

1997
01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:18.891
<v Speaker 3>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing goes hundred guys,</v>

1998
01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:20.400
<v Speaker 3>but bigfoot hunter guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had a few of those on the show.</v>

1999
01:30:20.401 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Ones that make the sasquatch call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2000
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:27.351
<v Speaker 3>we had that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's a bad shouting nonsense.</v>

2001
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one has ever recorded a sasquatch </v>

2002
01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.280
<v Speaker 3>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you do a coyote sound,</v>

2003
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:37.100
<v Speaker 3>you know what a coyote sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2004
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:39.180
<v Speaker 3>He can hear coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have recordings.</v>

2005
01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.190
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what a fucking pig foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds like.</v>

2006
01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.610
<v Speaker 3>No guessing because it's made up because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a real thing.</v>

2007
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.290
<v Speaker 3>They just yell out into the Holler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yell out in the Canyon.</v>

2008
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:55.310
<v Speaker 3>How about those dudes and back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guys in Alabama a couple years ago </v>

2009
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:56.410
<v Speaker 3>that they said they had one in the deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>freezer.</v>

2010
01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:59.410
<v Speaker 3>That guy had already hooked something </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a few years before that.</v>

2011
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.400
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2012
01:31:00.401 --> 01:31:02.500
<v Speaker 3>He had hosted a few years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2013
01:31:02.501 --> 01:31:03.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one was fake,</v>

2014
01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:04.660
<v Speaker 3>but this one's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one's real.</v>

2015
01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:06.060
<v Speaker 3>This time through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2016
01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:09.310
<v Speaker 3>we've got them for normal witness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Season three is just the Werewolf one.</v>

2017
01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please play some of this fucking stupid </v>

2018
01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:14.780
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2019
01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:14.780

<v Speaker 3>Everything in the corner.</v>

2020
01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.880
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people were reenacting is this.</v>

2021
01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.370
<v Speaker 3>This is what the inside of the house </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have looked like this.</v>

2022
01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.520
<v Speaker 3>This is the reenactment account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Froze.</v>

2023
01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:30.570
<v Speaker 3>I had this weird recurrent dreams plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>

2024
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.480
<v Speaker 3>had a weird dream as a kid that I saw a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lumberjack outside my house.</v>

2025
01:31:34.481 --> 01:31:36.640
<v Speaker 3>He was in a red and black flannel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2026
01:31:36.641 --> 01:31:41.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one big he used to wear and he had </v>

2027
01:31:41.641 --> 01:31:44.191
<v Speaker 3>red eyes and I up to Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would see him outside the house and I </v>

2028
01:31:44.191 --> 01:31:44.800
<v Speaker 3>thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dude could get in.</v>

2029
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was just a dream.</v>

2030
01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:49.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe he was actually outside</v>

2031
01:31:49.211 --> 01:31:54.211
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scroll back to that guy talking about </v>

2032
01:31:54.211 --> 01:31:54.211
<v Speaker 3>how the thing was outside while Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurted,</v>

2033
01:31:54.211 --> 01:31:57.340
<v Speaker 3>not just froze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was he drunk,</v>

2034
01:31:57.341 --> 01:31:58.750
<v Speaker 3>dropped his keys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like,</v>

2035
01:31:59.380 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and I and</v>

2036
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I felt very vulnerable.</v>

2037
01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to have a mustache to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really crazy story or is that sometimes </v>

2038
01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.850
<v Speaker 2>just an added bonus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this.</v>

2039
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:09.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2040
01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Paranormal witness season three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means they had two other seasons of</v>

2041
01:32:17.831 --> 01:32:20.670
<v Speaker 2>the shitty show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

2042
01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:21.360
<v Speaker 2>He sees it.</v>

2043
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.790
<v Speaker 6>Rachel,</v>

2044
01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.680
<v Speaker 2>he was right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on my dodge Ram and that's when I </v>

2045
01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.350
<v Speaker 2>realized I had soiled and pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing was breathing.</v>

2046
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:35.700
<v Speaker 6>I thought he was going to come in.</v>

2047
01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:41.430
<v Speaker 2>This is the worst recreation of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2048
01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Honest question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible this guy had glaucoma and</v>

2049
01:32:45.641 --> 01:32:48.240
<v Speaker 2>it just the neighbor had a black lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

2050
01:32:48.241 --> 01:32:49.710
<v Speaker 2>This guy's been sniffing paint.</v>

2051
01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Three years old and he's got three brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells inside his head.</v>

2052
01:32:53.731 --> 01:32:57.300
<v Speaker 1>They're bouncing around off the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an idiot.</v>

2053
01:32:57.301 --> 01:33:00.900
<v Speaker 1>He can't even pronounce sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just amazing.</v>

2054
01:33:00.901 --> 01:33:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Now he's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they recreated this?</v>

2055
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:07.590
<v Speaker 1>They actually made a show around an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious lie and recreated.</v>

2056
01:33:07.591 --> 01:33:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It makes feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left his keys out there.</v>

2057
01:33:10.861 --> 01:33:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they're still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2058
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:14.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the things when I first started </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the sci fi show,</v>

2059
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:18.540
<v Speaker 1>they were worried that the show is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be just totally debunking things,</v>

2060
01:33:18.690 --> 01:33:19.170
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2061
01:33:19.171 --> 01:33:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to approach everything with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete open mind.</v>

2062
01:33:21.571 --> 01:33:26.571
<v Speaker 1>I just want to find out what what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are these alien implants that </v>

2063
01:33:26.571 --> 01:33:27.450
<v Speaker 1>people keep saying that they find in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies?</v>

2064
01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.980
<v Speaker 1>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2065
01:33:28.981 --> 01:33:30.810
<v Speaker 1>what our crop circles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are all these things?</v>

2066
01:33:31.230 --> 01:33:33.360
<v Speaker 1>The problem is once you start looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2067
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you realize you're dealing with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of human being over and over and </v>

2068
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.430
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>

2069
01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:41.580
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially awkward,</v>

2070
01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.220
<v Speaker 1>delusional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad liars,</v>

2071
01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:46.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole industry.</v>

2072
01:33:46.261 --> 01:33:51.261
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole industry of making shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the stories of these socially </v>

2073
01:33:51.261 --> 01:33:52.620
<v Speaker 1>awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad liars.</v>

2074
01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Like I met one guy within three minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meeting them,</v>

2075
01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:58.320
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me that he saw big foot,</v>

2076
01:33:58.650 --> 01:34:03.650
<v Speaker 1>that he saw a bulletproof wolf that </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared out of mist and that he knew a </v>

2077
01:34:03.691 --> 01:34:06.630
<v Speaker 1>spot where he could regularly some in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ufos.</v>

2078
01:34:06.631 --> 01:34:11.631
<v Speaker 1>They would come and these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these orbs would show up and they would </v>

2079
01:34:11.631 --> 01:34:12.970
<v Speaker 1>start moving around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were looking at each other.</v>

2080
01:34:12.971 --> 01:34:17.971
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe we drove out to talk to </v>

2081
01:34:17.971 --> 01:34:19.380
<v Speaker 1>this fucking a long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he by any chance unemployed?</v>

2082
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:25.310
<v Speaker 1>This guy actually ran his own bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his own place job though,</v>

2083
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.180
<v Speaker 1>like all his time would be taken up by </v>
<v Speaker 1>believing nonsense.</v>

2084
01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.100
<v Speaker 1>He might've lived in Florida or </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere like,</v>

2085
01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.410
<v Speaker 1>just get away with shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

2086

<v Speaker 1>Florida is your go to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the craziest place that this </v>

2087
01:34:39.411 --> 01:34:39.411
<v Speaker 1>country has?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

2088
01:34:39.411 --> 01:34:41.790
<v Speaker 1>That's everybody's craziest places in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the south.</v>

2089
01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>

2090
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.130
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

2091
01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:45.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever happened to him.</v>

2092
01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Moved to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2093
01:34:46.831 --> 01:34:51.831
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Jim Florentine on the podcast </v>

2094
01:34:51.831 --> 01:34:51.831
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stand up comic.</v>

2095
01:34:51.831 --> 01:34:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Love Him and he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he moved to Florida when he was a kid,</v>

2096
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:56.250
<v Speaker 1>he said because when he went there on </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation,</v>

2097
01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.560
<v Speaker 1>everybody got off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2098

<v Speaker 1>Shit will just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2099
01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:04.151
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just move down here because you </v>

2100
01:35:04.151 --> 01:35:04.151
<v Speaker 1>realize like in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like girls would just fuck.</v>

2101
01:35:04.151 --> 01:35:08.471
<v Speaker 1>Like things were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This totally different kind of human </v>

2102
01:35:08.471 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 1>being that you're interacting with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2103
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:14.200
<v Speaker 1>That was his reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what is brilliant.</v>

2104
01:35:14.201 --> 01:35:14.830
<v Speaker 1>It appear.</v>

2105
01:35:14.970 --> 01:35:16.820
<v Speaker 1>But if you live in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get laid,</v>

2106
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:22.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a young guy coming up in New </v>

2107
01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking to grind.</v>

2108
01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:25.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a grind because all the big hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like it's just a lot of work.</v>

2110
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:31.090
<v Speaker 1>So they're not that fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever watched real housewives of New </v>

<v Speaker 1>Those are real human beings.</v>

2113
01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:39.110
<v Speaker 1>This is the one lady who literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her fucking hair starts an inch above </v>

2117
01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:49.110
<v Speaker 1>and they let this lady live with people </v>

<v Speaker 1>Her husband's in eight.</v>

2121
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:57.020
<v Speaker 1>He looked at her husband and he looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a gorilla,</v>

2122

<v Speaker 1>Like there wasn't no like worry that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to hit him.</v>

2163
01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:38.800
<v Speaker 1>She didn't have a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't threatening him.</v>

2164
01:37:38.801 --> 01:37:43.801
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like he decided he didn't </v>

2165
01:37:43.801 --> 01:37:43.900
<v Speaker 1>want her talking to anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he just knock it right in the face.</v>

2166
01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Your hat flew off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't don't play that back.</v>

2167
01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Please go from the beginning though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

2168
01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.980
<v Speaker 1>This guy was a school teacher to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2169
01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:54.870
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:37:55.410 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he lose his job?</v>

2171
01:37:57.150 --> 01:38:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he actually had some MMA fights.</v>

2172
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:00.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

2173
01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just punched her right in.</v>

2174
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:05.960
<v Speaker 1>The face isn't by the way that the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>body scraper.</v>

2175
01:38:05.961 --> 01:38:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2176
01:38:06.691 --> 01:38:09.480
<v Speaker 1>but like what is it that made you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

2177
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Where did that come into your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did see 1997 when I first started </v>

2178
01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:18.840
<v Speaker 1>working for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the post fight interviews in 1997.</v>

2179
01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Was it something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had you seen it and kind of dug it and </v>

2180
01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:23.880
<v Speaker 1>told him and those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2181
01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.460
<v Speaker 1>was the for Dana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2182
01:38:24.461 --> 01:38:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at the UFC before Dana.</v>

2183
01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize that I quit and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana hired me.</v>

2184
01:38:29.490 --> 01:38:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it back during the dark ages when </v>

2185
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I was banned from cable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2186
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the video store,</v>

2187
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:39.750
<v Speaker 1>in the faces of death aisle where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

2188
01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Remember those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch them.</v>

2189
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I just remember seeing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2190
01:38:43.771 --> 01:38:45.740
<v Speaker 1>that's where you would find the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

2191
01:38:45.741 --> 01:38:47.370
<v Speaker 1>So it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a freak show.</v>

2192
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2193
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:53.870
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my life I'd been involved in </v>

2194
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.870
<v Speaker 1>martial arts from Tom was a little kid.</v>

2195
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me it was like that show a or </v>

2196
01:38:57.670 --> 01:39:01.431
<v Speaker 1>that event was like the first time they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had figured out a way to get different </v>

2197
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:05.550
<v Speaker 1>styles to compete against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a martial artist,</v>

2198
01:39:05.551 --> 01:39:09.230
<v Speaker 1>it was entirely fascinating because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had always wondered like,</v>

2199
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:13.520
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if a karate guy fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>a judo guy or what have you?</v>

2200
01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So the UFC was the first time someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever done it and put it together.</v>

2201
01:39:16.831 --> 01:39:18.210
<v Speaker 1>So it was a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge fan of it.</v>

2202
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed someone to do their </v>

2203
01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.701
<v Speaker 1>interviews just the after the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews and they literally didn't </v>

2204
01:39:25.701 --> 01:39:27.780
<v Speaker 1>give me any instruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no advice,</v>

2205
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:32.810
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put a microphone in my hand and </v>

2206
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.810
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2207
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:34.430
<v Speaker 1>we're going to come to you in three </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

2208
01:39:34.450 --> 01:39:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Talk about the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a live on pay per view.</v>

2209
01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one had briefed me when I say no one </v>

2210
01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:42.320
<v Speaker 1>to give me any advice.</v>

2211
01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hadn't said a fucking thing to me,</v>

2212
01:39:43.611 --> 01:39:48.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They turn the camera on me and they </v>

2213
01:39:48.611 --> 01:39:48.611
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2214
01:39:48.611 --> 01:39:48.611
<v Speaker 1>you're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I then I was like,</v>

2215
01:39:48.611 --> 01:39:50.280
<v Speaker 1>this is an amazing event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ba Ba ba Ba ba.</v>

2216
01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:55.290
<v Speaker 1>We got this guy who's going to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy and the implications are blah </v>

2217
01:39:55.290 --> 01:39:56.850
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just got to train in Jujitsu.</v>

2218
01:39:56.851 --> 01:39:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fantastic event.</v>

2219
01:39:59.251 --> 01:40:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait back to you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

2220
01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:02.190
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

2221
01:40:02.191 --> 01:40:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me do this,</v>

2222
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:04.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is ridiculous.</v>

2223
01:40:04.561 --> 01:40:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Like the post fight interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2224
01:40:06.451 --> 01:40:08.180
<v Speaker 1>no advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one told me how to do it,</v>

2225
01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.740
<v Speaker 1>not just set me in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their fight was over.</v>

2226
01:40:10.741 --> 01:40:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I had to come up with the questions I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would ask him.</v>

2227
01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It was very bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre,</v>

2228
01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.110
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2229
01:40:16.111 --> 01:40:17.250
<v Speaker 1>very strange gig.</v>

2230
01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And I did it for about two years and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like all little puddle up hopper </v>

2231
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:24.810
<v Speaker 1>planes flying into weird casinos in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>

2232
01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:27.300
<v Speaker 1>That was the only places where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed them to have it.</v>

2233
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:28.890
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit.</v>

2234
01:40:28.891 --> 01:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just too weird.</v>

2235
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I stopped for a couple years in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>

2236
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:38.451
<v Speaker 1>got purchased by [inaudible] when Dana </v>
<v Speaker 1>came into it for the brothers and uh,</v>

2237
01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I just became a fan and I was hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with Dana and Dana and I became </v>

2238
01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.570
<v Speaker 1>friends and we would go to dinner and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just start saying,</v>

2239
01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:50.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you have this kind of fight </v>

2240
01:40:50.571 --> 01:40:50.571
<v Speaker 1>that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2241
01:40:50.571 --> 01:40:50.571
<v Speaker 1>what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see this guy find Japan?</v>

2242
01:40:50.571 --> 01:40:50.571
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know about this guy?</v>

2243
01:40:50.571 --> 01:40:55.281
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just started talking to him about </v>

2244
01:40:55.281 --> 01:40:55.281
<v Speaker 1>all this different cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2245
01:40:55.281 --> 01:40:55.281
<v Speaker 1>do you want to do commentary?</v>

2246
01:40:55.281 --> 01:40:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow man,</v>

2247
01:40:55.361 --> 01:40:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to come and drink fights and</v>

2248
01:40:58.810 --> 01:41:03.810
<v Speaker 1>have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And back then no one was watching it </v>

2249
01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:03.810
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2250
01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like someone was asking me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the UFC today.</v>

2251
01:41:05.490 --> 01:41:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the UFC then was doing porn.</v>

2252
01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:11.110
<v Speaker 1>That's literally what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to fuck on film.</v>

2253
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Like oh I don't know that much money is </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

2254
01:41:13.991 --> 01:41:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be alcohol.</v>

2255
01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.270
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2256
01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:22.320
<v Speaker 1>to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like detrimental for your </v>

2257
01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:22.320
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she was on news radio.</v>

2258
01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2259
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:28.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were flying me these weird places </v>

2260
01:41:28.501 --> 01:41:28.501
<v Speaker 1>like I started in 97.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2261
01:41:28.501 --> 01:41:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the news radio started in [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>94,</v>

2262
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:33.730
<v Speaker 1>so Nandini 94 95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like two,</v>

2263
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:36.370
<v Speaker 1>three years in that I was doing that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

2264
01:41:36.371 --> 01:41:41.371
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were thinking about your </v>

2265
01:41:41.371 --> 01:41:44.071
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were thinking it was bad for my </v>

2266
01:41:44.071 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Speaker 1>career because like w filming would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>over on Friday,</v>

2267
01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be done filming.</v>

2268
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd get on a fucking plane and I'd fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Alabama and watched dudes get punched</v>

2269
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:50.650
<v Speaker 1>in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2270
01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:58.800
<v Speaker 1>What else do you work with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in Santa Barbara for the weekend </v>

2271
01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.110
<v Speaker 1>they were doing at fucking plays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in Montgomery at the civic </v>

2272
01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:05.671
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd go to some musical that nobody </v>

2273
01:42:05.671 --> 01:42:07.981
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you had to pretend that everybody </v>

2274
01:42:07.981 --> 01:42:08.500
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed and I would come back and talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2275
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy event.</v>

2276
01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's got to teeth kicked into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third row.</v>

2277
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very strange.</v>

2278
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do the Toyota pro celebrity </v>

2279
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.550
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But cain Velasquez,</v>

2280
01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:24.850
<v Speaker 2>cain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain is like a gentle giant right guy.</v>

2281
01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Total sweetheart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Total teddy bear.</v>

2282
01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 2>But he could rip your house down like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2283
01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.390
<v Speaker 2>He's visually to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2284
01:42:31.391 --> 01:42:36.391
<v Speaker 2>wreck it Ralph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could just come in and take out an </v>

2285
01:42:36.391 --> 01:42:37.540
<v Speaker 2>interstate and I don't know what it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like being around them,</v>

2286
01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:39.650
<v Speaker 2>but the first couple of days I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

2287
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:44.790
<v Speaker 2>nice to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't kill me by like the end of the </v>

2288
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.790
<v Speaker 2>second week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2289
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.790
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to just go,</v>

2290
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:46.150
<v Speaker 1>just take care of this circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

2291
01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I started talking crap to constantly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one time,</v>

2292
01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he actually touched me </v>
<v Speaker 1>or he just got real close and I did.</v>

2293
01:42:57.221 --> 01:42:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2294
01:42:58.601 --> 01:43:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want sort of limp,</v>

2295
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:03.530
<v Speaker 1>like he's going to grab your neck or </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement.</v>

2296
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

2297
01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Every time I see him now I'll still </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2298
01:43:06.641 --> 01:43:07.450
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man.</v>

2299
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the fight this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2300
01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Was it just nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rough.</v>

2301
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got beat up.</v>

2302
01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I got beat up and then he got strangled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So watching a guy like Cain,</v>

2303
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:17.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has been,</v>

2304
01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:22.890
<v Speaker 1>except from one fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got knocked out by junior dos Santos </v>

2305
01:43:22.890 --> 01:43:22.890
<v Speaker 1>in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one fight.</v>

2306
01:43:22.890 --> 01:43:24.760
<v Speaker 1>But he went into that fight with a torn </v>
<v Speaker 1>knee ligament,</v>

2307
01:43:24.761 --> 01:43:28.420
<v Speaker 1>like he was pretty busted up going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight and um,</v>

2308
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:32.820
<v Speaker 1>he got caught with a huge punch from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real devastating knockout puncher.</v>

2309
01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Go Santos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that fight,</v>

2310
01:43:34.781 --> 01:43:39.180
<v Speaker 1>that loss was a tough loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a lot of reasons behind it</v>

2311
01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:44.250
<v Speaker 1>kind of made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he came back and dominated junior </v>

2312
01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:44.250
<v Speaker 1>and the rematch and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2313
01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like one of the all time,</v>

2314
01:43:45.941 --> 01:43:48.100
<v Speaker 1>all time greats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to see him fight,</v>

2315
01:43:48.110 --> 01:43:50.790
<v Speaker 1>fabrizio over doing for preschool for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dylan was fucking him up.</v>

2316
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 1>And fabricio is like one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu artist ever to compete in MMA.</v>

2317
01:43:56.330 --> 01:44:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Multiple time world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a cane was actually forced into </v>

2318
01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:05.891
<v Speaker 1>taking fabrizio down and he took for </v>
<v Speaker 1>heel into the ground and for resale </v>

2319
01:44:05.891 --> 01:44:07.160
<v Speaker 1>economy a team and tap them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

2320
01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2321
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:12.560
<v Speaker 1>they fought in Mexico City down there </v>
<v Speaker 1>training for,</v>

2322
01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:14.000
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

2323
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:19.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like it was in the middle of </v>

2324
01:44:19.001 --> 01:44:19.001
<v Speaker 1>nowhere in Mexico training.</v>

2325
01:44:19.001 --> 01:44:19.001
<v Speaker 1>He was only there for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2326
01:44:19.001 --> 01:44:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

2327
01:44:19.521 --> 01:44:22.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it was,</v>

2328
01:44:22.011 --> 01:44:27.011
<v Speaker 1>but somebody put it up on my message </v>
<v Speaker 1>board that there's some sort of a </v>

2329
01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>formula of like altitude like that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you competed altitude,</v>

2330
01:44:30.201 --> 01:44:35.201
<v Speaker 1>you have to be there for x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days depending upon how high the </v>

2331
01:44:35.201 --> 01:44:38.831
<v Speaker 1>altitude is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's x amount of days you have to be </v>

2332
01:44:38.831 --> 01:44:39.140
<v Speaker 1>there in order to acclimate for Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 1>City.</v>

2333
01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:41.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like 26 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2334
01:44:41.031 --> 01:44:46.031
<v Speaker 1>And can only got there two weeks before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had not acclimated at all and he </v>

2335
01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:49.810
<v Speaker 1>just wasn't ready yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the altitude is ruthless.</v>

2336
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:52.790
<v Speaker 1>75 to 7,800</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet above sea level.</v>

2337
01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.090
<v Speaker 1>And people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

2338
01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten altitude sickness on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>gear before.</v>

2339
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:58.470
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous,</v>

2340
01:44:58.471 --> 01:44:59.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't.</v>

2341
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Your body just doesn't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

2342
01:45:01.971 --> 01:45:05.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like wearing the tightest belt on </v>
<v Speaker 1>every part of your body.</v>

2343
01:45:05.770 --> 01:45:08.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real bad to just see.</v>

2344
01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I put a picture on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw it,</v>

2345
01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.280
<v Speaker 1>but there's an instagram picture that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>put up that I took while we were </v>

2346
01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:15.280
<v Speaker 1>landing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>

2347
01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.100
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad the pollution is all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that same Mexico City,</v>

2348
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Mexico City that's landing in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you see it on the big screen and I </v>

2349
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.970
<v Speaker 1>mean I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fucking shit.</v>

2350
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:28.550
<v Speaker 1>That is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as I got down there,</v>

2351
01:45:28.551 --> 01:45:33.551
<v Speaker 1>I could smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You smell it in the air and you get a </v>

2352
01:45:33.551 --> 01:45:35.630
<v Speaker 1>headache right away because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking air because you're at 7,500</v>

2353
01:45:35.631 --> 01:45:40.631
<v Speaker 1>feet above sea level and whatever air </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have is filled with car </v>

2354
01:45:40.631 --> 01:45:43.850
<v Speaker 1>exhausts and no traffic lights are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

2355
01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.330
<v Speaker 1>No one stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a suggestion.</v>

2356
01:45:47.331 --> 01:45:47.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just like they.</v>

2357
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:52.840
<v Speaker 1>They fought a government gig street </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and read right through.</v>

2358
01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's gridlock.</v>

2359
01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.720
<v Speaker 1>When you hit rush hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's gridlock.</v>

2360
01:45:58.910 --> 01:46:00.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no non gridlock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2361
01:46:00.651 --> 01:46:05.651
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get la gridlock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some selfish asshole decides that even </v>

2362
01:46:05.651 --> 01:46:09.281
<v Speaker 1>though the light is turned red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still going to make that left turn </v>

2363
01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:09.281
<v Speaker 1>right and he gets blocked and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>honk and he's like,</v>

2364
01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:11.810
<v Speaker 1>just looking ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky doesn't notice you in Mexico.</v>

2365
01:46:11.811 --> 01:46:16.811
<v Speaker 1>That's just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just too many people and it's </v>

2366
01:46:16.811 --> 01:46:17.390
<v Speaker 1>not even their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it's just out of control.</v>

2367
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Just too many people I saw people pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into intersections and it's like a </v>

2368
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:25.130
<v Speaker 1>kamikaze maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The traffic's going and they just go.</v>

2369
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:28.700
<v Speaker 1>They just pull out and you have to slam </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the breaks.</v>

2370
01:46:28.701 --> 01:46:30.710
<v Speaker 1>They just decide no one's going to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in.</v>

2371
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to make.</v>

2372
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:33.590
<v Speaker 1>You just have to make your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go for it.</v>

2373
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:38.800
<v Speaker 1>And so like traffic was going and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's like creeping in front of car and </v>

2374
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:43.031
<v Speaker 1>you see people hitting the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he would recognize that a little </v>

2375
01:46:43.031 --> 01:46:45.970
<v Speaker 1>bit of an opening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to be gone it a car </v>

2376
01:46:45.970 --> 01:46:49.181
<v Speaker 1>length ahead and like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And watching it was giving me a </v>

2377
01:46:49.181 --> 01:46:49.181
<v Speaker 1>headache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2378
01:46:49.181 --> 01:46:53.111
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A crazy way to live and there's like 40 </v>

2379
01:46:53.111 --> 01:46:54.720
<v Speaker 1>million people or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much larger than La,</v>

2380
01:46:55.050 --> 01:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>much larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much larger.</v>

2381
01:46:57.390 --> 01:47:00.630
<v Speaker 1>2000 feet above Denver and polluted as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2382
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:03.000
<v Speaker 1>It's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's the food?</v>

2383
01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people are great too.</v>

2384
01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>

2385
01:47:07.171 --> 01:47:08.580
<v Speaker 1>very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're super,</v>

2386
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>super friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it to just easy going,</v>

2387
01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:15.030
<v Speaker 1>even though they're in a giant ass city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a New York thing,</v>

2388
01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:16.860
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes in New York.</v>

2389
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I love New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the vibe of it.</v>

2390
01:47:19.261 --> 01:47:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact there's so many great </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>

2391
01:47:21.181 --> 01:47:24.380
<v Speaker 1>It's so much stuff to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is a crazy pack,</v>

2392
01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:29.620
<v Speaker 1>a packet of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the abrasive nature of some of the </v>

2393
01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:33.711
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really gets to me like totally like </v>

2394
01:47:33.711 --> 01:47:35.670
<v Speaker 1>the Tsa in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to Kennedy airport.</v>

2395
01:47:35.671 --> 01:47:39.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like some of the rudest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people I've ever met at a,</v>

2396
01:47:39.610 --> 01:47:42.120
<v Speaker 1>at an airport there or just in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2397
01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.670
<v Speaker 1>They just happened to be at the airport </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that.</v>

2398
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:45.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that attitude.</v>

2399
01:47:45.841 --> 01:47:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings jammed into this place that</v>

2400
01:47:48.931 --> 01:47:53.931
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose an appreciation for each </v>

2401
01:47:53.931 --> 01:47:53.931
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2402
01:47:53.931 --> 01:47:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you grew up in a small town or if you</v>

2403
01:47:55.170 --> 01:48:00.170
<v Speaker 1>have ever been to a small town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that people love that </v>

2404
01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:00.840
<v Speaker 1>people look at you and they say hi when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you walked on the street and wave,</v>

2405
01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.830
<v Speaker 1>kind of appreciate.</v>

2406
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not.</v>

2407
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:06.720
<v Speaker 1>We're not overwhelming each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in cities like New York,</v>

2408
01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:12.080
<v Speaker 1>there's just too many God damn people </v>
<v Speaker 1>smushed in next to each other and in la </v>

2409
01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.860
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody gets so angry on </v>

2410
01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:15.860
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure world,</v>

2411
01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:16.590
<v Speaker 1>we're overwhelming each other and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not valuable.</v>

2412
01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:21.800
<v Speaker 1>There's too many of us just New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>with with more cars that people can </v>

2413
01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.050
<v Speaker 1>drive versus taxis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in New York,</v>

2414
01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm always astounded that it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is simultaneously upset that </v>

2415
01:48:30.181 --> 01:48:35.181
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will tell you it is the </v>

2416
01:48:35.181 --> 01:48:35.181
<v Speaker 1>greatest city in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2417
01:48:35.181 --> 01:48:35.460
<v Speaker 1>but they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place sucks.</v>

2418
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:48:36.121 --> 01:48:37.500
<v Speaker 1>But I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God never leave.</v>

2420
01:48:37.530 --> 01:48:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dumbest fucking people in the world </v>

2421
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:44.271
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that are they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They act like there's something special </v>

2422
01:48:44.271 --> 01:48:44.400
<v Speaker 1>because they're from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2423
01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2424
01:48:44.881 --> 01:48:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could handle myself,</v>

2425
01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:47.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like of like,</v>

2426
01:48:47.671 --> 01:48:52.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to fight because you were </v>

2427
01:48:52.671 --> 01:48:52.671
<v Speaker 1>from a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2428
01:48:52.671 --> 01:48:52.671
<v Speaker 1>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're telling me?</v>

2429
01:48:52.671 --> 01:48:54.570
<v Speaker 1>You wrote a small bus hooked to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>buses.</v>

2430
01:48:54.571 --> 01:48:59.571
<v Speaker 1>They called a subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so suddenly I'm from New York so I can </v>

2431
01:48:59.571 --> 01:48:59.571
<v Speaker 1>handle myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how it is,</v>

2432
01:48:59.571 --> 01:48:59.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from New York.</v>

2433
01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:01.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2434
01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were trying to run a rental</v>

2435
01:49:03.481 --> 01:49:04.080
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>

2436
01:49:04.081 --> 01:49:05.550
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't apply here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2437
01:49:05.551 --> 01:49:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Your toughness and grown up in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're from nom nom.</v>

2438
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I did my time overseas within the Bronx </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>

2439
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I live in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big city in a box.</v>

2440
01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:17.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2441
01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:20.650
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at real estate the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day just as a goof and there was a,</v>

2442
01:49:20.651 --> 01:49:23.970
<v Speaker 1>a tiny ass shitty little apartment on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the west side.</v>

2443
01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was $500,000.</v>

2444
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is offensive,</v>

2445
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:31.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one bedroom,</v>

2446
01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:36.710
<v Speaker 1>shitty little apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even say how many square feet it </v>

2447
01:49:36.710 --> 01:49:39.561
<v Speaker 1>was because it looked like it was less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a thousand square feet and it's </v>

2448
01:49:39.561 --> 01:49:42.150
<v Speaker 1>half of a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like think about how many years it would</v>

2449
01:49:42.151 --> 01:49:46.080
<v Speaker 1>take the average person working every </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking day,</v>

2450
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours</v>

2451
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.100
<v Speaker 2>a day plus commuting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2452
01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:55.110
<v Speaker 2>And then tax is taken out of it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>scrape up enough money to buy this shit </v>

2453
01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:56.810
<v Speaker 2>back house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically impossible.</v>

2454
01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:00.230
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the weird thing is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

2455
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:03.040
<v Speaker 2>When we were shooting lost in </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmission,</v>

2456
01:50:03.041 --> 01:50:08.041
<v Speaker 2>there was two different producers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought houses in Atlanta where we live </v>

2457
01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:13.680
<v Speaker 2>not to live there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to buy them and then rent them out </v>

2458
01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.591
<v Speaker 2>because they can at least make a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and grow some equity in something </v>

2459
01:50:16.591 --> 01:50:16.780
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because out here,</v>

2460
01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:20.350
<v Speaker 2>like if people don't know to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumpiest house,</v>

2461
01:50:20.351 --> 01:50:25.351
<v Speaker 2>you can find out here is still like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million plus unless you want to live in </v>

2462
01:50:25.351 --> 01:50:29.221
<v Speaker 2>Palmdale and smoke crack every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which if you're watching from Palmdale </v>

2463
01:50:29.221 --> 01:50:30.280
<v Speaker 2>and you smoke crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not singling you out.</v>

2464
01:50:30.281 --> 01:50:35.281
<v Speaker 2>I'm just making a suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who just moved to </v>

2465
01:50:35.281 --> 01:50:35.281
<v Speaker 2>Palmdale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

2466
01:50:35.281 --> 01:50:35.610
<v Speaker 2>is it for dogs?</v>

2467
01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Just for pit bulls and she needed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave some space.</v>

2468
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:43.260
<v Speaker 2>She needed a place that accepted her </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs and that wasn't very much money.</v>

2469
01:50:43.261 --> 01:50:46.070
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't make a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She moved to Palmdale is awful.</v>

2470
01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:49.130
<v Speaker 2>It's so far out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

2471
01:50:49.170 --> 01:50:51.940
<v Speaker 2>If you could move to the surface of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>

2472
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:57.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what living in Palm Dale is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the hottest place on earth and Afro</v>

2473
01:50:57.010 --> 01:51:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Man is from there because I feel like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>should know that side is not to go beat </v>

2474
01:51:03.641 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 2>up some woman on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She came up behind him and he punched </v>

2479
01:51:15.721 --> 01:51:16.110
<v Speaker 2>her in the face and dropped her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that?</v>

2480

<v Speaker 2>fan of Afro Man.</v>

2482

2483
01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:25.210

<v Speaker 2>fear factor in Palmdale.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Have a great night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden I turned and there </v>

2502
01:52:19.050 --> 01:52:20.770
<v Speaker 2>was a woman right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying like I've never had a</v>

2503
01:52:20.771 --> 01:52:22.330
<v Speaker 2>stock or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank goodness.</v>

2504
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:27.570
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know if you've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 2>people precariously I was standing on </v>

2505
01:52:27.570 --> 01:52:30.721
<v Speaker 2>like an eight foot tall platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where she came from and no </v>

2506
01:52:30.721 --> 01:52:35.081
<v Speaker 2>one saw her and then she was just there </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my face and a little bit drunk and </v>

2507
01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:39.031
<v Speaker 2>definitely from New Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've had those </v>

2508
01:52:39.031 --> 01:52:39.031
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real fight or flight moment where</v>

2509
01:52:39.031 --> 01:52:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you,</v>

2510
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:44.910
<v Speaker 2>why are you right here in my face and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk and she knew my name and </v>

2511
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:44.910
<v Speaker 2>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to go.</v>

2512
01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 2>This feels</v>

2513
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.980
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that someone would not think </v>

2514
01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:53.321
<v Speaker 3>that you would freak out by sneaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind your glasses in real limited </v>

2515
01:52:53.321 --> 01:52:57.941
<v Speaker 3>peripheral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like you can sneak up on me </v>

2516
01:52:57.941 --> 01:53:00.611
<v Speaker 3>in the room that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife will sometimes stare at me in </v>

2517
01:53:00.611 --> 01:53:04.241
<v Speaker 3>the car to see how long it takes me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice and then she'll give up because </v>

2518
01:53:04.241 --> 01:53:05.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to see you over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2519
01:53:05.151 --> 01:53:08.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little tough game with me.</v>

2520
01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of Weirdos out there.</v>

2521
01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:16.001
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is you never know when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear about that guy that shot </v>

2522
01:53:16.001 --> 01:53:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Darrell dimebag on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like you never know.</v>

2523
01:53:17.691 --> 01:53:19.310
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be in the wrong place,</v>

2524
01:53:19.311 --> 01:53:22.070
<v Speaker 3>wrong time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can understand that.</v>

2525
01:53:22.071 --> 01:53:23.670
<v Speaker 3>He'd be freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This woman was onstage,</v>

2526
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:28.250
<v Speaker 3>but a cursory glance at her would let </v>
<v Speaker 3>you understand,</v>

2527
01:53:28.251 --> 01:53:33.251
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason to give this woman a </v>

2528
01:53:33.251 --> 01:53:33.251
<v Speaker 3>concussion.</v>

2529
01:53:33.251 --> 01:53:35.240
<v Speaker 3>She's just a crazy drunk lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to fucking molly whopper </v>

2530
01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:38.330
<v Speaker 3>in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ certainly am.</v>

2531
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I bet they had security there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could've,</v>

2532
01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 3>could've probably had another plan of </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

2533
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:50.120
<v Speaker 3>They did have security shoot a never </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten onstage a fair point.</v>

2534
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:55.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean the security got high because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were listening to a song because I </v>

2535
01:53:55.330 --> 01:53:58.901
<v Speaker 3>got high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that song is basically like I was </v>

2536
01:53:58.901 --> 01:53:58.901
<v Speaker 3>going to do all the things I need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pay the rent,</v>

2537
01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.180
<v Speaker 3>pay the bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to do some stuff and then it</v>

2538
01:54:01.181 --> 01:54:03.310
<v Speaker 3>got high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he got hot,</v>

2539
01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:04.790
<v Speaker 3>maybe security got high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2540
01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Anything could have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just saturation,</v>

2541
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:13.390
<v Speaker 3>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like a Monday morning </v>

2542
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.390
<v Speaker 3>quarterback here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Riff raff happens.</v>

2543
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Insecurity is onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Fan gets tackled.</v>

2544
01:54:17.571 --> 01:54:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Double that.</v>

2552
01:54:40.690 --> 01:54:42.710
<v Speaker 3>This dude lens is quite impressive to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>

2553
01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:45.280
<v Speaker 3>The guy taps some.</v>

2564
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:22.750
<v Speaker 3>The tide has turned and they're starting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that race is just a social </v>

2565
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:26.630
<v Speaker 3>construct and I've been reading all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these articles about how she ran circles</v>

2566

<v Speaker 3>She is running with it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2571
01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:44.400
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that she said is I</v>
<v Speaker 3>as black,</v>

2572
01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:46.420

<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2573

<v Speaker 1>she calls him her dad,</v>

2574
01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.980

<v Speaker 1>Her parents are from Montana or white as</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but she has.</v>

<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she's in the lawsuit.</v>

2581
01:56:10.141 --> 01:56:12.240
<v Speaker 1>She's saying that she's white.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They commit to that and then they start </v>

2614
01:57:38.541 --> 01:57:42.381
<v Speaker 1>thinking that that's their lucky look </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you kind of have to have your hair </v>

2615
01:57:42.381 --> 01:57:43.470
<v Speaker 1>sticking straight up in the air or </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to know it's don king.</v>

2616

2619
01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:54.810
<v Speaker 1>troll doll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him.</v>

2620
01:57:55.090 --> 01:57:56.270
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2621
01:57:56.271 --> 01:57:58.260
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it for the UFC.</v>

2622
01:57:58.261 --> 01:58:00.870
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do some stuff.</v>

2623
01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:03.390
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't let you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2624
01:58:03.391 --> 01:58:04.840
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't answer any questions.</v>

2625
01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:08.940
<v Speaker 1>You asked him a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the pontification upon the universal</v>

2626
01:58:08.941 --> 01:58:13.941
<v Speaker 1>connection that we all share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most of like I would ask him a </v>

2627
01:58:13.941 --> 01:58:14.550
<v Speaker 1>question and he would bring in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's rights.</v>

2628
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Who would go to well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's like,</v>

2629
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:16.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to,</v>

2630
01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:17.640
<v Speaker 1>let's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2631
01:58:17.641 --> 01:58:20.250
<v Speaker 1>it was like a women's rights and gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and,</v>

2632
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:22.500
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really strange.</v>

2633
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:27.530
<v Speaker 1>It was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like he just talks and they </v>

2634
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:28.590
<v Speaker 1>change his subjects in mid sentence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps going and going and going.</v>

2635
01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:31.200
<v Speaker 1>So like you'll ask him a question and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit there for 10 minutes.</v>

2636
01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine being a fucking </v>

2637
01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:39.051
<v Speaker 1>fighter who has some issues with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract to come into your office and </v>

2638
01:58:39.051 --> 01:58:42.421
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably have a hard time talking </v>

2639
01:58:42.421 --> 01:58:42.421
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2640
01:58:42.421 --> 01:58:42.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2641
01:58:42.421 --> 01:58:43.540
<v Speaker 1>not everybody's as eloquent as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy.</v>

2642
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:45.250
<v Speaker 1>You sit in his office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2643
01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:50.251
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're a regular dude who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know how to phrase shit that </v>

2644
01:58:50.251 --> 01:58:50.251
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2645
01:58:50.251 --> 01:58:54.430
<v Speaker 1>He sit in his office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked them a question and he goes on </v>

2646
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:54.430
<v Speaker 1>his fucking 10 minute diatribe about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2647
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Rosa Parks and women's rights and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2648
01:58:56.471 --> 01:59:00.190
<v Speaker 1>minorities and the white man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just keeps going.</v>

2649
01:59:00.191 --> 01:59:02.680
<v Speaker 1>He just keeps going on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2650
01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would confuse the fuck into people.</v>

2651
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And I brought it up to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of called them on it.</v>

2652
01:59:07.810 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're baffling.</v>

2653
01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Baffling speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird though,</v>

2654
01:59:12.161 --> 01:59:15.400
<v Speaker 1>just knowing that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the guy from the guy who killed a</v>

2655
01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:16.870
<v Speaker 1>couple people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2656
01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:19.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst stomped the guy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death for a gambling debt.</v>

2657
01:59:20.170 --> 01:59:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them I think he got off on the </v>

2658
01:59:25.170 --> 01:59:27.901
<v Speaker 1>other one he did some time for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was like manslaughter and </v>

2659
01:59:27.901 --> 01:59:31.561
<v Speaker 1>the other one was like justifiable </v>
<v Speaker 1>homicide or some point that she.</v>

2660
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2661
01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:35.080
<v Speaker 1>that's a real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CLEVELAND,</v>

2662
01:59:35.081 --> 01:59:36.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he from Cleveland,</v>

2663
01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Ohio in the fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:59:39.221 --> 01:59:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Don King is a but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an interesting guy nonetheless.</v>

2665
01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Covered in diamonds by the way.</v>

2666
01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2667
01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Diamond Star of David and cross covering</v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides just in case.</v>

2668
01:59:50.201 --> 01:59:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Just in case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2669
01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:54.010
<v Speaker 1>he told me that late diamonds are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl's best friend.</v>

2670
01:59:54.011 --> 01:59:55.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas diamonds,</v>

2671
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:58.660
<v Speaker 1>diamonds and rings diamonds on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>chains,</v>

2672
01:59:58.661 --> 02:00:01.600
<v Speaker 1>like you find yourself when you're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>

2673
02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times when you make it back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hotel room late on Saturday night,</v>

2674
02:00:04.791 --> 02:00:08.890
<v Speaker 1>that lock up is the only show on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television that just great</v>

2675
02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:11.420
<v Speaker 2>it block out some of those shows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I travel,</v>

2676
02:00:11.421 --> 02:00:16.421
<v Speaker 2>especially going to nascar races,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they're always on </v>

2677
02:00:16.421 --> 02:00:18.941
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night and I feel like what if </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what if these dudes were like one </v>

2678
02:00:18.941 --> 02:00:21.680
<v Speaker 2>wrong car on the interstate away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>just being like a normal person.</v>

2679
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Then just snapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm watching them in a federal pen,</v>

2680
02:00:26.210 --> 02:00:27.140
<v Speaker 2>like those two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2681
02:00:27.141 --> 02:00:29.480
<v Speaker 2>So the two dudes that got out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing about that.</v>

2682
02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:34.160
<v Speaker 2>The do's escaped from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned late yesterday that the reason</v>

2683
02:00:34.161 --> 02:00:39.161
<v Speaker 2>that chick helped them was because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>told her they were gonna kill her </v>

2684
02:00:39.161 --> 02:00:39.161
<v Speaker 2>husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wanted her husband,</v>

2685
02:00:39.161 --> 02:00:44.111
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why she was helping them get </v>

2686
02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:44.111
<v Speaker 2>out because they said they would go kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>her husband.</v>

2687
02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:44.111
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2688
02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:49.430
<v Speaker 2>And then my next thought is or where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they hooking up with her because I </v>

2689
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:50.400
<v Speaker 2>assume they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be some sort of weird love</v>

2690
02:00:50.401 --> 02:00:51.090
<v Speaker 2>triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2691
02:00:51.150 --> 02:00:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently the younger guy,</v>

2692
02:00:52.650 --> 02:00:56.400
<v Speaker 2>the word is he had a giant hog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that come out?</v>

2693
02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to want to know,</v>

2694
02:00:58.171 --> 02:01:02.340
<v Speaker 2>do you look at the girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's quite the ugly duckling and uh,</v>

2695
02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure well,</v>

2696
02:01:03.511 --> 02:01:06.690
<v Speaker 2>she's inside the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably gets to talk to these guys.</v>

2697
02:01:06.691 --> 02:01:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Probably lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2698
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:12.900
<v Speaker 2>they make friends slowly but surely the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy works his way in shows is giant hog.</v>

2699
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly she wants her husband dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you question.</v>

2700
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

2701
02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:18.310
<v Speaker 2>just two guys talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2702
02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:18.960
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2703
02:01:18.961 --> 02:01:20.790
<v Speaker 2>there's a prison break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your first thought is,</v>

2704
02:01:20.791 --> 02:01:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how big this guy is downstairs.</v>

2705
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>There's never been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a woman's involved though,</v>

2706
02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>if the woman helped him get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2707
02:01:28.671 --> 02:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he have to offer?</v>

2708
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Can fucking giant snake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was a great dancer.</v>

2709
02:01:33.710 --> 02:01:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we knew a lot about poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you look at her and she's just sad </v>

2710
02:01:38.710 --> 02:01:40.250
<v Speaker 2>and unkempt</v>

2711
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:43.490
<v Speaker 3>and neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of the above.</v>

2712
02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Just her whole body's just a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2713
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:49.610
<v Speaker 3>John Mayer flaring bodies in Wonderland </v>
<v Speaker 3>about her.</v>

2714
02:01:49.611 --> 02:01:52.820
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of a wonderland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonder how the heart keeps beating.</v>

2715
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:56.730
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't climb to the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking tower where they shoot prisoners</v>

2716
02:01:56.731 --> 02:01:59.270
<v Speaker 3>and jump off face first into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball court.</v>

2717
02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What keeps you going,</v>

2718
02:02:00.861 --> 02:02:01.770
<v Speaker 3>honey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2719
02:02:01.771 --> 02:02:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping this guy shoot my husband </v>
<v Speaker 3>and give me some giant Dick.</v>

2720
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 3>What's amazing that they haven't caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>them yet.</v>

2721
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that they're still out there.</v>

2722
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:17.950
<v Speaker 3>What are those guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably they're learning French and </v>

2723
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:19.900
<v Speaker 3>walking into Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2724
02:02:19.930 --> 02:02:22.100
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would do if I was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>upstate New York.</v>

2725
02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:26.060
<v Speaker 3>I would think the best way like Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to Lubbock,</v>

2726
02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:27.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2727
02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.440
<v Speaker 3>they're very divorced from American </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and a lot of ways in a very </v>

2728
02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.370
<v Speaker 3>strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Toronto's not like Toronto,</v>

2729
02:02:34.371 --> 02:02:36.480
<v Speaker 3>like we understand that their mayors a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crackhead,</v>

2730
02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.060
<v Speaker 3>they know all about our presidents.</v>

2731
02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:39.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>

2732
02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:44.590
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go to Toronto it seems like I'm </v>

2733
02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:44.590
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people are nicer,</v>

2734
02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:46.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar to America,</v>

2735
02:02:46.311 --> 02:02:51.311
<v Speaker 3>but Montreal is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montreal is a very international </v>

2736
02:02:51.311 --> 02:02:53.130
<v Speaker 3>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>City and the outside of Montreal,</v>

2737
02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that whole area,</v>

2738
02:02:54.831 --> 02:02:59.390
<v Speaker 3>the French speaking area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have completely different stars.</v>

2739
02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.240
<v Speaker 3>They have singers that you've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard of that are huge,</v>

2740
02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:07.241
<v Speaker 3>that play stadiums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have comedians that a lot of them </v>

2741
02:03:07.241 --> 02:03:08.720
<v Speaker 3>would steal like English jokes and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would translate them into,</v>

2742
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:13.900
<v Speaker 3>into French and they would go on tour </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the French speaking areas and</v>

2743
02:03:14.781 --> 02:03:19.781
<v Speaker 3>do their comedy routines and they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a whole different world.</v>

2744
02:03:19.821 --> 02:03:24.821
<v Speaker 3>They speak French,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like a lot of them exclusively </v>

2745
02:03:24.821 --> 02:03:27.910
<v Speaker 3>speak French and a lot of the areas like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have French on the signs of </v>

2746
02:03:27.921 --> 02:03:29.910
<v Speaker 3>the buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know when you go to Montreal,</v>

2747
02:03:29.911 --> 02:03:30.980
<v Speaker 3>like everything's in French.</v>

2748
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Like even Kentucky Fried Chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have KFC.</v>

2749
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:37.820
<v Speaker 3>It's Pfc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pooled a fried chicken,</v>

2750
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:41.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not do well.</v>

2751
02:03:41.010 --> 02:03:43.880
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you'd learn French,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2752
02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:49.120
<v Speaker 3>they're lovely people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess if I had broken out of </v>

2753
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:49.120
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2754
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:49.120
<v Speaker 3>I would think that that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>move though.</v>

2755
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.561
<v Speaker 3>You go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn French and a French on tape,</v>

2756
02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:57.920
<v Speaker 3>but you think they have Rosetta stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've escaped from prison.</v>

2757
02:03:58.190 --> 02:04:01.730
<v Speaker 3>I bet you could learn in prison and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>bet if the guy was learning French,</v>

2758
02:04:01.731 --> 02:04:04.560
<v Speaker 3>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker is probably learning,</v>

2759
02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:09.640
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to escape to Quebec.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's talking to his new girlfriend who </v>

2760
02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:09.640
<v Speaker 3>hates her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2761
02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.561
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you Rosetta stone me some </v>

2762
02:04:14.561 --> 02:04:16.190
<v Speaker 3>fringe me and Tommy will get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take care of your husband.</v>

2763
02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Little Walkman or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll meet in in French speaking Canada.</v>

2764
02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:23.800
<v Speaker 3>How much could you really learn from one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those Rosetta stone thing?</v>

2765
02:04:23.801 --> 02:04:27.740
<v Speaker 3>So I mean to really learn a language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's a long process.</v>

2766
02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:29.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem that way.</v>

2767
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you know anything you want to speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know a tiny bit of Spanish took </v>

2768
02:04:34.330 --> 02:04:36.500
<v Speaker 3>two years dose on Ios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took two years of Italian.</v>

2769
02:04:36.501 --> 02:04:38.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a word of it anymore.</v>

2770
02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Not sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice language though.</v>

2771
02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pay attention.</v>

2772
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I've had trouble with this language that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're speaking clearly enough,</v>

2773
02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>enough hurdles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're speaking to English.</v>

2774
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm the tra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2775
02:04:54.381 --> 02:04:59.381

<v Speaker 1>and didn't talk about the Jeremy </v>

2776
02:04:59.381 --> 02:04:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Clarkson tragedy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hammond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hammond,</v>

2783
02:05:13.771 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Hammond,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nice work together.</v>

2786
02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tough act to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2787
02:05:21.721 --> 02:05:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a long running show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>went on for decades,</v>

2788
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:27.750
<v Speaker 1>the most popular international show I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2789
02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:28.470
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2790
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said it was the most viewed </v>

2791
02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:33.500
<v Speaker 2>show in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2792
02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:38.010
<v Speaker 2>when you looked at CBS Sunday morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did an awesome kind of a no 60 minutes.</v>

2793
02:05:38.011 --> 02:05:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 minutes was talking about it based on</v>

2794
02:05:40.831 --> 02:05:43.260
<v Speaker 2>downloads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both legal and illegal.</v>

2795

<v Speaker 2>And then how many shows how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries does show airs in like our top</v>

2796

<v Speaker 2>gear USA or something like a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

2797
02:05:49.081 --> 02:05:52.800
<v Speaker 2>There isn't like 170.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2798
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:54.950
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big huge.</v>

2799
02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Can you kind of hinted to it before </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>

2800
02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big act to follow.</v>

2801
02:05:58.801 --> 02:06:03.801
<v Speaker 2>We knew when we got ours that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't pretend to be the three of </v>

2802
02:06:03.801 --> 02:06:04.650
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were never gonna do that.</v>

2803
02:06:04.651 --> 02:06:06.090
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to be our three </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

2804
02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we knew that there's like,</v>

2805
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:13.550
<v Speaker 2>there's this like kind of core group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call them UK fan boys and they got </v>

2806
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:18.051
<v Speaker 2>really upset that we were doing an </v>
<v Speaker 2>American version because they felt like </v>

2807
02:06:18.051 --> 02:06:19.740
<v Speaker 2>they were the only ones that knew about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK show,</v>

2808
02:06:20.190 --> 02:06:22.560
<v Speaker 2>not realizing how many people around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world saw it.</v>

2809
02:06:22.590 --> 02:06:24.930
<v Speaker 2>They felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got this special like Unicorn.</v>

2810
02:06:24.931 --> 02:06:26.610
<v Speaker 2>No one knows about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm super awesome.</v>

2811
02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out we were just taking the </v>

2812
02:06:31.970 --> 02:06:33.330
<v Speaker 2>kind of foundation of it and it's three </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in cars,</v>

2813
02:06:33.331 --> 02:06:35.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to go do our own thing.</v>

2814
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:40.310
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started with some of the same </v>

2815
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.310
<v Speaker 2>fundamental ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did everything different.</v>

2816
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:42.900
<v Speaker 2>We didn't like our producers would come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with crazy things for us to do,</v>

2817
02:06:42.901 --> 02:06:47.901
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't know about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we just went and they wanted to </v>

2818
02:06:47.901 --> 02:06:50.691
<v Speaker 2>watch us squirm and go have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's happening now is a announced </v>

2819
02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:52.890
<v Speaker 2>a today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Chris,</v>

2820
02:06:52.891 --> 02:06:54.600
<v Speaker 2>is it Chris Evans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's name,</v>

2821
02:06:54.601 --> 02:06:58.590
<v Speaker 2>who I guess is like a morning host or </v>
<v Speaker 2>their show or dj or something,</v>

2822
02:06:59.170 --> 02:07:03.930
<v Speaker 2>a popular guy is going to be the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>host of top gear UK,</v>

2823
02:07:03.931 --> 02:07:06.360
<v Speaker 2>which would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will relaunch and kind of re.</v>

2824
02:07:06.361 --> 02:07:11.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they'll reformat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume he's going to have two people </v>

2825
02:07:11.361 --> 02:07:11.361
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a rebirth.</v>

2826
02:07:11.361 --> 02:07:13.450
<v Speaker 1>So James May is not going to be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2827
02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2828
02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2829
02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:21.640
<v Speaker 2>the two of them said we will stand with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clarkson and this is our group.</v>

2830
02:07:21.641 --> 02:07:26.641
<v Speaker 2>This is what top gear is to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when everything went down,</v>

2831
02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:29.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've never met Clarkson,</v>

2832
02:07:29.981 --> 02:07:33.040
<v Speaker 2>I've only met Hammon and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and I are pals.</v>

2833
02:07:33.041 --> 02:07:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Really great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2834
02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had gotten in so much trouble before </v>

2835
02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 2>over the things he had said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also like,</v>

2836
02:07:40.301 --> 02:07:42.550
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because that's the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason people watch him.</v>

2837
02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2838
02:07:43.451 --> 02:07:46.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like when comedians get in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>for being funny.</v>

2839
02:07:46.061 --> 02:07:47.710
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what you wanted.</v>

2840
02:07:48.070 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not making any kind of excuse for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2841
02:07:51.011 --> 02:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a real bummer what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2842
02:07:53.931 --> 02:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody has bad days,</v>

2843
02:07:55.361 --> 02:07:57.520
<v Speaker 2>but when he flipped out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flipped out on this producer,</v>

2844
02:07:57.521 --> 02:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>who's a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met him before.</v>

2845
02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently they'd had like a long day </v>

2846
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:05.800
<v Speaker 2>and there were some sort of dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

2847
02:08:05.801 --> 02:08:09.070
<v Speaker 2>about dinner or whether something should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be cold.</v>

2848
02:08:09.130 --> 02:08:12.370
<v Speaker 2>There was cold cuts instead of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot steak or something.</v>

2849
02:08:12.371 --> 02:08:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there and no one talks about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our lab group.</v>

2850
02:08:17.021 --> 02:08:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's very sensitive because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know whether overnight that would</v>

2851
02:08:20.201 --> 02:08:22.860
<v Speaker 2>screw up our show because it worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 2>brand is,</v>

2852
02:08:22.890 --> 02:08:25.210
<v Speaker 2>it's very important to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everybody.</v>

2853
02:08:25.211 --> 02:08:29.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>

2854
02:08:30.130 --> 02:08:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I think he just had a real bad evening </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he took it out on somebody and that </v>

2855
02:08:35.130 --> 02:08:37.570
<v Speaker 2>cost him his job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so did he beat the guy up?</v>

2856
02:08:37.571 --> 02:08:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2857
02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I think he punched him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he beat him up and seem </v>

2858
02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:45.790
<v Speaker 2>like when you watch that show and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch that guy,</v>

2859
02:08:45.791 --> 02:08:47.740
<v Speaker 2>he's like this fun loving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2860
02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:52.741
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have a hard time seeing him </v>

2861
02:08:52.741 --> 02:08:52.830
<v Speaker 2>beating somebody up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2862
02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2863
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read the same stuff everybody </v>

2864
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.870
<v Speaker 2>else did that.</v>

2865
02:08:58.870 --> 02:09:01.110
<v Speaker 2>There were some sort of verbal </v>
<v Speaker 2>altercation and then a physical </v>

2866
02:09:01.110 --> 02:09:02.170
<v Speaker 2>altercation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>

2867
02:09:02.171 --> 02:09:07.171
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a bummer for everybody that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was involved because it's certainly not </v>

2868
02:09:07.171 --> 02:09:11.071
<v Speaker 2>something that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he obviously was very upset in </v>

2869
02:09:11.071 --> 02:09:12.550
<v Speaker 2>the shame that happen as well as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>producer.</v>

2870
02:09:12.551 --> 02:09:17.551
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't one of those things that </v>

2871
02:09:17.551 --> 02:09:19.231
<v Speaker 2>happens sometimes and you realize it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks for every single person involved I</v>

2872
02:09:20.171 --> 02:09:24.160
<v Speaker 2>think because all the things he had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in trouble for four before that.</v>

2873
02:09:24.330 --> 02:09:28.360
<v Speaker 2>What are the retarded or they not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what's going on and there's a</v>

2874
02:09:28.361 --> 02:09:33.361
<v Speaker 2>reason why the show is popular and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that guy is a very unique and </v>

2875
02:09:33.361 --> 02:09:37.291
<v Speaker 2>bizarre character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the main reason that shows </v>

2876
02:09:37.291 --> 02:09:38.920
<v Speaker 2>popular is Jeremy Clarkson in Richard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hammond is grade and James May is great,</v>

2877
02:09:38.921 --> 02:09:40.750
<v Speaker 2>but on their own they're starving to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

2878
02:09:40.751 --> 02:09:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

2879
02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:43.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an Altima.</v>

2880
02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2881
02:09:44.630 --> 02:09:45.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a group.</v>

2882
02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:48.550
<v Speaker 2>It is an ensemble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Jeremy Clarkson is the funny one.</v>

2883
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Just like the heart and so like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a ton of the different,</v>

2884
02:09:52.481 --> 02:09:55.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he from the journalist side,</v>

2885
02:09:55.151 --> 02:09:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2886
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:59.470
<v Speaker 2>So much about the stuff that they do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a porsche people hate him.</v>

2887
02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:04.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturers that don't like and which </v>

2888
02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:09.331
<v Speaker 2>is funny because sometimes people </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't want to loan us cars because </v>

2889
02:10:09.331 --> 02:10:10.270
<v Speaker 2>things that they had done will the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chrysler,</v>

2890
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:12.550
<v Speaker 2>remember they had those three cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drove costs in America.</v>

2891
02:10:12.551 --> 02:10:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Chrysler didn't want to give them raw </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenger so they bought one.</v>

2892
02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:18.350
<v Speaker 2>So the black friend was a producer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to pay for it,</v>

2893
02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:19.750
<v Speaker 2>pay them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

2894
02:10:19.751 --> 02:10:21.440
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's hilarious.</v>

2895
02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Things like that that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Hanna was actually very funny.</v>

2896
02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking around saying that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would both starve to death.</v>

2897
02:10:28.301 --> 02:10:33.301
<v Speaker 2>They're good together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're better with him like as a </v>

2898
02:10:33.301 --> 02:10:34.400
<v Speaker 2>threesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are they going to try to launch a new</v>

2899
02:10:34.401 --> 02:10:35.680
<v Speaker 2>show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three of them together?</v>

2900
02:10:35.690 --> 02:10:37.970
<v Speaker 2>So what I heard they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2901
02:10:37.971 --> 02:10:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I know the name is not important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2902
02:10:40.130 --> 02:10:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And so right now they're doing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would go and do these kinds of live</v>

2903
02:10:43.431 --> 02:10:45.140
<v Speaker 2>show events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done one here.</v>

2904
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:47.900
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to do on with us and them </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a combo thing.</v>

2905
02:10:47.901 --> 02:10:49.940
<v Speaker 2>And then we never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody really moved on it.</v>

2906
02:10:49.941 --> 02:10:54.941
<v Speaker 2>But they were in [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken Block was helping them out in South </v>

2907
02:10:54.941 --> 02:10:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Africa this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did like six shows and they're </v>

2908
02:10:59.170 --> 02:10:59.810
<v Speaker 2>calling it like a Clarkson Hammond may </v>
<v Speaker 2>live or something because they can't use</v>

2909
02:10:59.811 --> 02:11:00.770
<v Speaker 2>the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2910
02:11:00.771 --> 02:11:02.050
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gear live.</v>

2911
02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hope they'll keep doing something </v>

2912
02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:07.260
<v Speaker 2>fun together.</v>

2913
02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:07.490
<v Speaker 2>They're funny guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2914
02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>they're great together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hammons got a sweet Mustang.</v>

2915
02:11:10.810 --> 02:11:13.370
<v Speaker 2>We've seen some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got some killer toys.</v>

2916
02:11:13.371 --> 02:11:15.920
<v Speaker 2>He's a helicopter guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives in a castle.</v>

2917
02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money they make off that show.</v>

2918
02:11:18.650 --> 02:11:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I think they did pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they got just a hair more than we </v>

2919
02:11:23.650 --> 02:11:24.800
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says the guy with two other jobs.</v>

2920
02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2922
02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:31.900
<v Speaker 2>he lives way out far somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is also why he has a </v>

2923
02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:32.240
<v Speaker 2>helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Hayman's got a bunch of kids.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Shows that he produces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2926
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:42.000

<v Speaker 2>I don't know what may does the rest of </v>

2927

2931
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:52.730

<v Speaker 2>But those guys,</v>

2932
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:55.310
<v Speaker 2>it's we got to do when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>launching our show over there,</v>

2933
02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>we got to go to this like a British,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of television thing where they </v>

2934
02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.571
<v Speaker 2>put us up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had this party like top gear </v>

02:12:04.571 --> 02:12:04.571
<v Speaker 2>USA.</v>

2936
02:12:04.571 --> 02:12:06.260
<v Speaker 2>So they tried to make the most American </v>
<v Speaker 2>themed evening they could.</v>

2937
02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's glass coke bottles on every </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Daniels and shot glasses.</v>

2942
02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:24.390
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a fun time.</v>

2943
02:12:25.250 --> 02:12:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Fun Time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanner I think was single at the time </v>

<v Speaker 2>and I'm a pretty good wing man because </v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife loves me so I can just be an </v>

2945
02:12:33.071 --> 02:12:34.250
<v Speaker 2>idiot publicly and not worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole time I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>show that was a big love show because I </v>

2953
02:12:57.820 --> 02:12:58.280
<v Speaker 2>took over the man show for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2954
02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I hope we got tortured like right out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>

2955
02:13:02.050 --> 02:13:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a lot of ways it was kind of a </v>

2956
02:13:07.050 --> 02:13:07.050
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show wasn't what we wanted it to be.</v>

2957
02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>

2958
02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:12.290
<v Speaker 2>We got fucked over because we came in </v>
<v Speaker 2>under false pretenses.</v>

2959
02:13:12.291 --> 02:13:14.680
<v Speaker 2>They Kinda told us that they were going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make this wild show,</v>

2960
02:13:14.681 --> 02:13:15.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have nudity,</v>

2961
02:13:15.651 --> 02:13:17.480
<v Speaker 2>will blurt out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swear will beep it out.</v>

2962
02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.070
<v Speaker 2>We want to get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're crazy.</v>

2963
02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>And then right when we started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Janet Jackson pulled her nipple out.</v>

2964
02:13:23.451 --> 02:13:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this the superbowl.</v>

2965
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Jt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2966
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Slipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The plan says not amazing that that </v>

2967
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.750
<v Speaker 2>generated this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still to this day</v>

2968
02:13:32.850 --> 02:13:37.850
<v Speaker 3>just hurts my brain that everybody got </v>
<v Speaker 3>so upset that they saw nipple on </v>

2969
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.850
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2970
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I quite enjoyed the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just doesn't make any sense.</v>

2971
02:13:41.041 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a man's nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one would care.</v>

2972
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:46.320
<v Speaker 3>But it's Janet Jackson's nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's how man.</v>

2973
02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still just the nipple live in tyler</v>

2974
02:13:48.961 --> 02:13:53.961
<v Speaker 3>showed his nipple on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably every time they did a halftime </v>

2975
02:13:53.961 --> 02:13:53.961
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the big deal?</v>

2976
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:55.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's because it's a female.</v>

2977
02:13:55.771 --> 02:13:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a sexual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poor Justin timberlake.</v>

2978
02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Heck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that was gonna happen</v>

2979
02:14:00.610 --> 02:14:01.590
<v Speaker 3>y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2980
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:06.830
<v Speaker 3>he pulled it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled the nipple a pulled her </v>

2981
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.830
<v Speaker 3>closer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew what the fuck is going on here.</v>

2982
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:09.600
<v Speaker 3>But how weird is it that a nipple is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like for a woman?</v>

2983
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:13.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like super taboo for a dude is </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

2984
02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:16.310
<v Speaker 3>No problem in that strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2985
02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:21.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Ari Shaffir lives in New York </v>

2986
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.840
<v Speaker 3>City during the summertime and he takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>his shirt off every day of the week,</v>

2987
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:26.870
<v Speaker 3>just walks down the street with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>shirt off because they have laws in New </v>

2988
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.870
<v Speaker 3>York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're allowed to do that.</v>

2989
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:28.890
<v Speaker 3>But because they have laws like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>

2990
02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:33.920
<v Speaker 3>they can't sexually discriminated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so women are allowed to take their </v>

2991
02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:37.041
<v Speaker 3>shirts off too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so women could walk down the street </v>

2992
02:14:37.041 --> 02:14:38.720
<v Speaker 3>topless and occasionally they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's like this naked cowgirl,</v>

2993
02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:40.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have that naked cowboy.</v>

2994
02:14:40.450 --> 02:14:41.850
<v Speaker 3>I was him for Halloween one year.</v>

2995
02:14:44.650 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was tough.</v>

2996
02:14:45.601 --> 02:14:50.601
<v Speaker 3>It was tough costume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was cold that year were built </v>

2997
02:14:50.601 --> 02:14:53.931
<v Speaker 3>slightly differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a hands on me and the naked cowboy </v>

2998
02:14:53.931 --> 02:14:54.180
<v Speaker 3>built fella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a strong businessman to.</v>

2999
02:14:54.190 --> 02:14:56.650
<v Speaker 3>It makes a lot of money off the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do him.</v>

3000
02:14:56.830 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 3>He's suing this woman because she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the exact same act.</v>

3001
02:14:59.430 --> 02:15:01.700
<v Speaker 3>She was the naked cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's topless.</v>

3002
02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:04.620
<v Speaker 3>There is the naked cow girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for her.</v>

3003
02:15:04.621 --> 02:15:09.621
<v Speaker 3>This is a different one I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's more than one naked </v>

3004
02:15:09.621 --> 02:15:12.171
<v Speaker 3>cowboy for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she has to have [inaudible] that </v>

3005
02:15:12.171 --> 02:15:12.880
<v Speaker 3>they deal because in Manhattan like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

3006
02:15:12.881 --> 02:15:17.881
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure the law is that a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>can walk down the street naked or </v>

3007
02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:21.000
<v Speaker 3>whether top out rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have your vagina out,</v>

3008
02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:25.160
<v Speaker 3>but you could have your nipples out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because man can just want to.</v>

3009
02:15:25.161 --> 02:15:25.430
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3010
02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:26.730
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fucking so strange.</v>

3011
02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Great law though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for them.</v>

3012
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:30.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be quality.</v>

3015
02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:34.830

<v Speaker 3>It's just nipples.</v>

3016
02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was something that the whole idea of </v>

3017
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:40.200
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just preposterous.</v>

3018
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:41.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to wear them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck as long as you don't</v>

3019
02:15:41.491 --> 02:15:44.370
<v Speaker 3>rub your Dick on anybody or get weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Your kid freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta explain to them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They like weird shit and they want you </v>

3026
02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:57.410
<v Speaker 3>to look at their Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3027
02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:58.650
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to force you it.</v>

3028
02:15:58.651 --> 02:16:03.651
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes your parents are going to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to the worst raggedy Ann and Andy </v>

3029
02:16:03.651 --> 02:16:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Parade you'll ever see and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>not shout that afterwards.</v>

3030
02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some checks and balances.</v>

3031
02:16:07.171 --> 02:16:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes shit gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

3032
02:16:10.230 --> 02:16:13.110
<v Speaker 3>big foot's not real and that is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>black.</v>

3033
02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.690
<v Speaker 3>She's white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she identifies as black,</v>

3034
02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:20.720
<v Speaker 3>so he's just wearing a lot man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to be a man he wanted to Cathal </v>

3035
02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:23.130
<v Speaker 3>on in the Olympics and he had children </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then decided to use a woman.</v>

3036
02:16:23.370 --> 02:16:25.260
<v Speaker 3>So now we have to call Caitlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3037
02:16:25.650 --> 02:16:26.830
<v Speaker 3>smoke them if you've got them.</v>

3038
02:16:28.890 --> 02:16:31.190
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting thing when you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to win,</v>

3039
02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:32.590
<v Speaker 3>when you have to make sure everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows,</v>

3040
02:16:32.591 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got a right to be happy,</v>

3041
02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:38.500
<v Speaker 3>but everybody does not have a right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be completely out of their mind.</v>

3042
02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere we will find that line.</v>

3043
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do have a right to be completely out</v>

3044
02:16:45.581 --> 02:16:50.581
<v Speaker 3>of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy as long as it doesn't interfere </v>

3045
02:16:50.581 --> 02:16:53.611
<v Speaker 3>with someone else's happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if your neighbor and you're </v>

3046
02:16:53.611 --> 02:16:57.481
<v Speaker 3>completely out of your mind crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like sticking fireworks up your </v>

3047
02:16:57.481 --> 02:16:58.690
<v Speaker 3>ass and doing cartwheels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you live in a dry area and you could</v>

3048
02:16:58.691 --> 02:17:01.540
<v Speaker 3>potentially start fires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3049
02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all logical,</v>

3050
02:17:04.470 --> 02:17:06.790
<v Speaker 3>fantastic analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>

3051
02:17:06.890 --> 02:17:09.730
<v Speaker 3>your craziness is interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's health and safety.</v>

3052
02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:10.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3054
02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:15.690
<v Speaker 3>he can't be that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's too crazy like that.</v>

3055
02:17:15.691 --> 02:17:18.130
<v Speaker 3>The guy with fireworks up was totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Not Cool Pal.</v>

3058
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:25.120
<v Speaker 3>This is California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a drought going on right now.</v>

3059
02:17:25.121 --> 02:17:30.121
<v Speaker 3>Man is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're paying people in California to </v>

3060
02:17:30.371 --> 02:17:33.850
<v Speaker 3>take out their lawns and putting what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they call hardscape.</v>

3061
02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:39.060
<v Speaker 3>They give you money and you put like </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocks and Cactus in grass.</v>

3062
02:17:39.281 --> 02:17:41.010
<v Speaker 3>You can vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The plastic turf.</v>

3064
02:17:42.610 --> 02:17:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I've drove down the street the other day</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a sign up from work for a </v>

3065
02:17:47.610 --> 02:17:51.121
<v Speaker 3>company that does again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they calling it hardscape as though </v>

3066
02:17:51.121 --> 02:17:51.250
<v Speaker 3>they're calling it like tax rebates and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatnot for it too?</v>

3067
02:17:51.310 --> 02:17:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I think they actually give you money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they find out about that </v>

3068
02:17:56.310 --> 02:17:57.060
<v Speaker 3>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and you're interested,</v>

3069
02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:58.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about.</v>

3070
02:17:58.310 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had enough of grass and bushes.</v>

3071
02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

3072
02:18:00.941 --> 02:18:03.340
<v Speaker 3>I fucking passed by A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it pepperdine?</v>

3073
02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones in Malibu is nice.</v>

3074
02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:09.970
<v Speaker 3>That is a God damn enormous lawn </v>
<v Speaker 3>watering for Jesus.</v>

3075
02:18:10.330 --> 02:18:15.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a big religious college roll down </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hill before it's fun for top gear.</v>

3076
02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:20.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just for fun with my </v>

3077
02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:22.740
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was shooting a commercial for a lot</v>

3078
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:25.420
<v Speaker 3>of fucking water to use on that gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice grass.</v>

3079
02:18:25.421 --> 02:18:28.640
<v Speaker 3>If they're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Kudos will not be taxed.</v>

3080
02:18:29.050 --> 02:18:31.720
<v Speaker 3>You cannot be taxed a not being taxed on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that rebate,</v>

3081
02:18:31.721 --> 02:18:36.721
<v Speaker 3>which can range as much as $3,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get a free three grand.</v>

3082
02:18:37.510 --> 02:18:40.660
<v Speaker 3>No saying they just won't tax you on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>three grand.</v>

3083
02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like no,</v>

3084
02:18:44.231 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 3>because you get a rebate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a rebate,</v>

3085
02:18:46.571 --> 02:18:48.790
<v Speaker 3>you get money and then you can't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxed on the money.</v>

3086
02:18:48.791 --> 02:18:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I think was when he started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3087
02:18:50.470 --> 02:18:55.470
<v Speaker 3>Rebates received by homeowners replacing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lungs with drought tolerant </v>

3088
02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:55.470
<v Speaker 3>landscaping would not be counted as </v>
<v Speaker 3>income,</v>

3089
02:18:55.510 --> 02:18:56.920
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't say exactly how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>should probably,</v>

3090
02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:59.050
<v Speaker 3>depending on how much land have </v>
<v Speaker 3>insights.</v>

3091
02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:04.170
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that's fucked his golf </v>

3092
02:19:04.170 --> 02:19:04.320
<v Speaker 3>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that that is.</v>

3093
02:19:04.930 --> 02:19:06.520
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like to play golf.</v>

3094
02:19:06.521 --> 02:19:09.430
<v Speaker 3>I like to play pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand I get get addictions,</v>

3095
02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:14.880
<v Speaker 3>but your addiction is using up a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking water and apparently in some </v>

3096
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Middle Eastern countries they play a </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of Golf on oiled sand sand and </v>

3097
02:19:23.381 --> 02:19:28.381
<v Speaker 3>they put some sort of oil on the sand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way the ball reacts is very </v>

3098
02:19:28.381 --> 02:19:30.890
<v Speaker 3>similar to the way a ball would react on</v>
<v Speaker 3>grass.</v>

3099
02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:33.230
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was just.</v>

3100
02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Explain that to me the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never bothered looking it up.</v>

3101
02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I just said it sounds like a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3102
02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:43.370
<v Speaker 3>except allow those assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those divots,</v>

3103
02:19:43.670 --> 02:19:47.870
<v Speaker 3>those big chunks of grass that go flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air and then what?</v>

3104
02:19:47.871 --> 02:19:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want this.</v>

3105
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3106
02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Just disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be a tough place to where a lot of white</v>

3107
02:19:56.121 --> 02:19:57.070
<v Speaker 3>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

3108
02:19:57.390 --> 02:20:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do golf bluestones what does that </v>

3109
02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:05.111
<v Speaker 3>say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grassland Greens used motor oil to make </v>

3110
02:20:05.111 --> 02:20:05.930
<v Speaker 3>putting possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3111
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>

3112
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:12.750
<v Speaker 3>I've been to a lot of tracks that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>use a motor oil from all the tractors </v>

3113
02:20:13.611 --> 02:20:17.780
<v Speaker 3>and stuff to put it on top of gravel to </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically like keep dust down.</v>

3114
02:20:18.170 --> 02:20:21.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's like that idea magnified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

3115
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:25.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that just they're putting right.</v>

3116
02:20:25.221 --> 02:20:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tough gig.</v>

3117
02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Tough gig right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not that good at golf.</v>

3118
02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm never played it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3119
02:20:32.430 --> 02:20:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

3120
02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Best part golf carts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3121
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:38.270
<v Speaker 3>That's really like my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he would go play golf,</v>

3122
02:20:38.271 --> 02:20:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I would always go with him as a kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

3123
02:20:40.341 --> 02:20:41.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I drive the golf cart?</v>

3124
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:44.250
<v Speaker 3>And then when there's no water like </v>
<v Speaker 3>waterhole,</v>

3125
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:49.270
<v Speaker 3>then I would take his own ball finder </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just swim with a little stick and </v>

3126
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.270
<v Speaker 3>try to get as many balls as I could.</v>

3127
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine who has a ranch </v>
<v Speaker 3>in California and uh,</v>

3128
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:55.160
<v Speaker 3>he has golf course and just drive golf </v>
<v Speaker 3>carts around and when she lets us little</v>

3129
02:20:55.161 --> 02:20:56.510
<v Speaker 3>kids take the golf cart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3130
02:20:56.710 --> 02:20:58.190
<v Speaker 3>And one of his daughters like </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

3131
02:20:58.191 --> 02:21:03.191
<v Speaker 3>she was driving us around his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>golf cart ranch where the town I live </v>

3132
02:21:03.191 --> 02:21:03.191
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have golf carts.</v>

3133
02:21:03.191 --> 02:21:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3134
02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:05.270
<v Speaker 3>You must have lived in a little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3135
02:21:05.271 --> 02:21:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

3136
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:09.080
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in this town called peach tree</v>
<v Speaker 3>city in Georgia.</v>

3137
02:21:09.081 --> 02:21:14.081
<v Speaker 3>It's south of Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's built on five golf courses and the </v>

3138
02:21:14.081 --> 02:21:17.141
<v Speaker 3>idea was that you could get to any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these little miniature neighborhoods on </v>

3139
02:21:17.141 --> 02:21:20.771
<v Speaker 3>a golf cart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a hundred miles a golf cart </v>

3140
02:21:20.771 --> 02:21:23.111
<v Speaker 3>path there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we're at my house and you want to </v>

3141
02:21:23.111 --> 02:21:23.111
<v Speaker 3>go to dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we can just get on the golf cart,</v>

3142
02:21:23.111 --> 02:21:24.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit like the movie the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Truman show,</v>

3143
02:21:24.721 --> 02:21:26.540
<v Speaker 3>like he definitely feel like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bubble over it,</v>

3144
02:21:26.541 --> 02:21:27.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a golf cart.</v>

3145
02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:30.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was kind of cool.</v>

3146
02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can soup them up.</v>

3147
02:21:31.970 --> 02:21:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I built a golf cart on my new show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a 69 Subaru three 60 van,</v>

3148
02:21:36.691 --> 02:21:39.500
<v Speaker 3>a microcar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I built it on a golf cart chassis.</v>

3149
02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:42.150
<v Speaker 3>This just got 20 horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>single cylinder engine.</v>

3150
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:46.070
<v Speaker 3>The thing about golf golf courses is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pesticides.</v>

3151
02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:51.220
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew a dude who got bone cancer and a </v>

3152
02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:53.741
<v Speaker 3>lot of people in his neighborhood got </v>
<v Speaker 3>bone cancer because the water from the </v>

3153
02:21:53.741 --> 02:21:57.551
<v Speaker 3>pesticides are in the wells and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people in his </v>

3154
02:21:57.591 --> 02:21:58.940
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All cancer.</v>

3155
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pesticides or there's just the term </v>

3156
02:22:06.010 --> 02:22:09.520
<v Speaker 3>pesticide past like it's just poison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just call it what the fuck it is.</v>

3157
02:22:10.131 --> 02:22:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Why are you calling it pesticides?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're poisoning bugs.</v>

3158
02:22:13.311 --> 02:22:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Bugs are tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean roaches are going to be half to the</v>

3159
02:22:16.011 --> 02:22:19.980
<v Speaker 3>fucking nuclear bombs go off and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing them with some chemicals and you</v>

3160
02:22:19.981 --> 02:22:22.730
<v Speaker 3>leave that shit in the grass and it gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the ground,</v>

3161
02:22:22.731 --> 02:22:27.731
<v Speaker 3>seeps into the water and then people </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink the water and they get sick as </v>

3162
02:22:27.731 --> 02:22:27.731
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

3163
02:22:27.731 --> 02:22:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>

3164
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:33.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a creepy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems pretty obvious to us then </v>

3165
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.590
<v Speaker 1>that pretty God damn obvious and yet we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go.</v>

3166
02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:36.360
<v Speaker 1>But the people that live in the golf </v>
<v Speaker 1>course or near the golf course,</v>

3167
02:22:36.361 --> 02:22:41.361
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just let it seep into the well </v>

3168
02:22:41.361 --> 02:22:41.840
<v Speaker 1>water because it looks real pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3169
02:22:42.310 --> 02:22:45.930
<v Speaker 1>The only way to keep it pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta keep killing bugs.</v>

3170
02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Keep slit after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3171
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.620
<v Speaker 1>It's key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Policing them.</v>

3172
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Spraying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal.</v>

3173
02:22:51.730 --> 02:22:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the pesticides.</v>

3174
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to his radio lab podcast.</v>

3175
02:22:57.400 --> 02:22:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm the way they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3176
02:22:59.610 --> 02:23:04.610
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to use poison gas in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps.</v>

3177
02:23:05.610 --> 02:23:10.610
<v Speaker 1>They used Zyklon B and zipline a was </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally developed as a pesticide and </v>

3178
02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:13.360
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use this gas zipline,</v>

3179
02:23:13.410 --> 02:23:17.450
<v Speaker 1>a had a particular aroma to it to alert </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone that was near it or handling it.</v>

3180
02:23:17.470 --> 02:23:19.020
<v Speaker 1>It was very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

3181
02:23:19.021 --> 02:23:24.021
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis re engineered Zyklon a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn it into a Ziploc bag and took out </v>

3182
02:23:24.021 --> 02:23:28.341
<v Speaker 1>the smell and you started using it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas and the concentration camps designed</v>

3183
02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:31.740
<v Speaker 1>a by a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3184
02:23:31.741 --> 02:23:36.741
<v Speaker 1>a Jew who was one of the first guys to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure or the guy figured out how to </v>

3185
02:23:36.741 --> 02:23:38.200
<v Speaker 1>pull the nitrogen out of the air like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3186
02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:43.220
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a big majority of the particles</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the air apparently or nitrogen and </v>

3187
02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:45.920
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen is very difficult to get w for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer and stuff.</v>

3188
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:49.260
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to acquire but </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary in order to grow plants.</v>

3189
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:54.710
<v Speaker 1>And so this guy hopper Fritz hopper </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to pull it out of the </v>

3190
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:57.210
<v Speaker 1>air and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it for fertilizer.</v>

3191
02:23:57.211 --> 02:23:59.910
<v Speaker 1>And apparently that method that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed in 19,</v>

3192
02:23:59.911 --> 02:24:03.060
<v Speaker 1>19 fucking [inaudible] or some shit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that during World War One.</v>

3193
02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>That method is still being used today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like half of the food that people </v>

3194
02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:12.810
<v Speaker 1>eat in the world is fertilized from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>method.</v>

3195
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Same Guy Develop Zyklon b or cycle on a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I feel like if they ever need </v>

3196
02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:22.260
<v Speaker 1>to go in front of Congress and talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the legalization of marijuana,</v>

3197
02:24:22.261 --> 02:24:27.261
<v Speaker 1>I think we could take a video clip of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that last 45 seconds of you telling me </v>

3198
02:24:27.261 --> 02:24:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that story and then like people would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3199
02:24:28.621 --> 02:24:33.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can remember all that and he smokes </v>

3200
02:24:33.621 --> 02:24:33.621
<v Speaker 1>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should probably just let it go.</v>

3201
02:24:33.621 --> 02:24:38.450
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of podcasts that you </v>

3202
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:38.450
<v Speaker 1>relax and listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit that I listen to.</v>

3203
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why love stuff.</v>

3204
02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That history.</v>

3205
02:24:40.381 --> 02:24:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love those.</v>

3206
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I'd love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinating information.</v>

3207
02:24:45.481 --> 02:24:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any information that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>me go.</v>

3208
02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:48.450
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3209
02:24:48.451 --> 02:24:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3210
02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:52.050
<v Speaker 1>pot does not fuck with your memory.</v>

3211
02:24:52.050 --> 02:24:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It fucks with your memory about shit you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were just talking about.</v>

3212
02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that's what you just laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>down was brilliant.</v>

3213
02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:04.350
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy also was one of the first people</v>

3214
02:25:04.351 --> 02:25:07.650
<v Speaker 1>that use gas and warfare and he uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3215
02:25:07.710 --> 02:25:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a chlorine gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used it on the,</v>

3216
02:25:10.821 --> 02:25:13.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and the Canadians,</v>

3217
02:25:13.501 --> 02:25:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it was English and the Canadians</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they used it on,</v>

3218
02:25:16.380 --> 02:25:18.600
<v Speaker 1>but he was being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

3219
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:24.230
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought the United States was </v>

3220
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.230
<v Speaker 1>addressing him as a war criminal the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time they</v>

3221
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:27.120
<v Speaker 3>were using his fertilization methods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Kid,</v>

3222
02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:30.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was a very,</v>

3223
02:25:30.161 --> 02:25:32.740
<v Speaker 3>very complex guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a very complex guy.</v>

3224
02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Like he wasn't a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't,</v>

3225
02:25:34.541 --> 02:25:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

3226
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:40.710
<v Speaker 3>he was brilliant in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The radiolab podcast when anyone's </v>

3227
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:41.920
<v Speaker 3>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the bad show.</v>

3228
02:25:42.310 --> 02:25:44.130
<v Speaker 3>And it is about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3229
02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:47.650
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that did a lot of really</v>
<v Speaker 3>awful things.</v>

3230
02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:50.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just one of the many stories.</v>

3231
02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been on this world war one kick</v>

3232
02:25:53.710 --> 02:25:54.540
<v Speaker 3>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3233
02:25:54.650 --> 02:25:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Because of Dan Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got this podcast called hardcore </v>

3234
02:25:59.650 --> 02:26:02.761
<v Speaker 3>history and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has his whole world war one series </v>

3235
02:26:02.761 --> 02:26:03.970
<v Speaker 3>that's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just put the final,</v>

3236
02:26:03.971 --> 02:26:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the final episode out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking amazing.</v>

3237
02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:11.530
<v Speaker 3>It's just so crazy that world war one </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just for me,</v>

3238
02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:16.780
<v Speaker 3>a war that I never really thought about </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if really looked into it and I've </v>

3239
02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:18.220
<v Speaker 3>just been really getting into it lately </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of these podcasts.</v>

3240
02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:19.420
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3241
02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:24.940
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really fuck with your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just meant that was what you lay down </v>

3242
02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:24.940
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3243
02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:29.760
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of layers to them and I </v>

3244
02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:32.110
<v Speaker 3>just thought that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just sitting here thinking,</v>

3245
02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:37.260
<v Speaker 3>that's really impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inhibited you asked me about something </v>

3246
02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:37.260
<v Speaker 3>about 10 minutes ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what the fuck we're talking,</v>

3247
02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:41.600
<v Speaker 3>but what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or just 10 seconds ago we were just </v>

3248
02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:41.600
<v Speaker 3>talking about whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3249
02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I got to turn into my dad and I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't remember things.</v>

3250
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3251
02:26:44.650 --> 02:26:46.030
<v Speaker 3>My Dad will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

3252
02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:47.740
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend that's a pilot.</v>

3253
02:26:47.741 --> 02:26:49.870
<v Speaker 3>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad has met Martin.</v>

3254
02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:53.410
<v Speaker 3>I met because he's introducing himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>each time is a new time,</v>

3255
02:26:53.530 --> 02:26:56.010
<v Speaker 3>30 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like that.</v>

3256
02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:58.130
<v Speaker 3>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's nice to meet you.</v>

3257
02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The teacher right now,</v>

3258
02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:02.050
<v Speaker 3>he's a pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always been a pilot.</v>

3259
02:27:02.051 --> 02:27:04.270
<v Speaker 3>If your dad ever meets Martin and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good to see you,</v>

3260
02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:06.670
<v Speaker 3>then I'll know my dad's an actor.</v>

3261
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need some fucking Alpha brain song.</v>

3262
02:27:08.981 --> 02:27:13.981
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this cognitive enhancing </v>

3263
02:27:13.981 --> 02:27:14.290
<v Speaker 3>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good for memory.</v>

3264
02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:17.460
<v Speaker 3>I was in double blind placebo testing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't kidding when I said I really.</v>

3265
02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:22.600
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed like watching you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram and the stuff that you're </v>

3266
02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:22.870
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I dig because you don't.</v>

3267
02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.960
<v Speaker 3>You're very honest about who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She don't like you don't split hairs </v>

3268
02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:27.960
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3269
02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:29.200
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn more about it.</v>

3270
02:27:29.470 --> 02:27:34.470
<v Speaker 3>And you'll ask people like you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>genuine interest in feedback and stuff </v>

3271
02:27:34.470 --> 02:27:37.651
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I did because there's so </v>

3272
02:27:37.651 --> 02:27:37.651
<v Speaker 3>many people that are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't want to say like,</v>

3273
02:27:37.651 --> 02:27:42.331
<v Speaker 3>I had a coca cola classic at lunch today</v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone's going to tell him </v>

3274
02:27:42.331 --> 02:27:42.331
<v Speaker 3>there's corn syrup in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3275
02:27:42.331 --> 02:27:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Where you live in that kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird thing,</v>

3276
02:27:43.931 --> 02:27:44.170
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

3277
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Well if you really feel that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you shouldn't have classic.</v>

3278
02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3279
02:27:48.430 --> 02:27:51.490
<v Speaker 3>just do what you want to do and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

3280
02:27:51.491 --> 02:27:54.490
<v Speaker 3>if there's any repercussions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is probably something you shouldn't</v>

3281
02:27:54.491 --> 02:27:56.500
<v Speaker 3>have done in the first place and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should learn from them.</v>

3282
02:27:56.860 --> 02:28:01.860
<v Speaker 3>I think so many people go through life </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to project something instead</v>

3283
02:28:02.201 --> 02:28:07.201
<v Speaker 3>of just being who they are and working </v>
<v Speaker 3>on what the negative aspects of whoever </v>

3284
02:28:07.201 --> 02:28:09.340
<v Speaker 3>they have designed themselves to be said</v>
<v Speaker 3>of working on that.</v>

3285
02:28:09.341 --> 02:28:14.341
<v Speaker 3>They just put up this fucking fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>facade that's too labor intensive.</v>

3286
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I have no desire to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't pretend you're someone who </v>

3287
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:21.160
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems to me like a Glock goddamn effort.</v>

3288
02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3289
02:28:22.050 --> 02:28:24.890
<v Speaker 1>for what would you get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look at Charlie Sheen.</v>

3290
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:26.600

3293
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:35.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's because he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hashtag tiger blood sugar blood.</v>

3304
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I saw that all over the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3305
02:29:10.451 --> 02:29:12.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet when that all went down.</v>

3306
02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3307
02:29:14.001 --> 02:29:17.960
<v Speaker 1>look did the reality of who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not pretty.</v>

3308
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks like he's a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

3309
02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:24.140
<v Speaker 1>His fucking face has fallen off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks really bad.</v>

3310
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

3311
02:29:25.310 --> 02:29:30.310
<v Speaker 1>some of the videos that he did like </v>
<v Speaker 1>right after he got kicked off that show </v>

3312
02:29:30.310 --> 02:29:33.790
<v Speaker 1>and he did like these weird podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>style videos where he's like staring </v>

3313
02:29:33.790 --> 02:29:33.790
<v Speaker 1>into the camera and the people behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

3314
02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:36.680
<v Speaker 1>he looks like he's just sweaty death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3315
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:39.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking mine.</v>

3316
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love the fact that he was being </v>

3317
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:47.540
<v Speaker 1>who he really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so much of what you see,</v>

3318
02:29:47.541 --> 02:29:52.541
<v Speaker 1>like when you see Tom Cruise jumping on </v>
<v Speaker 1>oprah winfrey's couch saying how much </v>

3319
02:29:52.541 --> 02:29:52.760
<v Speaker 1>she's in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love,</v>

3320
02:29:52.761 --> 02:29:57.761
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love and all the women in the </v>

3321
02:29:57.761 --> 02:29:59.000
<v Speaker 1>audience and everybody else</v>

3322
02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:01.300
<v Speaker 3>like bullshitting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're bullshitting me,</v>

3323
02:30:01.301 --> 02:30:03.580
<v Speaker 3>but I'm used to being bullshitted so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just deal with it.</v>

3324
02:30:03.581 --> 02:30:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the bachelor,</v>

3325
02:30:04.671 --> 02:30:06.520
<v Speaker 3>you're peeing on my back and telling me </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's raining.</v>

3326
02:30:06.521 --> 02:30:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to it.</v>

3327
02:30:07.781 --> 02:30:12.781
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to put up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only because top gun was a great </v>

3328
02:30:12.781 --> 02:30:12.781
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly like we're shocked at.</v>

3329
02:30:12.781 --> 02:30:15.880
<v Speaker 3>That girl fucked a bunch of handsome </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that she got drunk with.</v>

3330
02:30:16.450 --> 02:30:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That girl is good for you,</v>

3331
02:30:18.191 --> 02:30:20.680
<v Speaker 3>young lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you got your rocks off.</v>

3332
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:26.190
<v Speaker 3>I hope you sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of delicious dicks and how gail </v>

3333
02:30:26.190 --> 02:30:26.530
<v Speaker 3>time like flinstone style</v>

3334
02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:29.390
<v Speaker 1>flinstone style.</v>

3335
02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Just different world back then you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>say again,</v>

3336
02:30:35.061 --> 02:30:36.590
<v Speaker 3>it had nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally different.</v>

3337
02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that I'm still puzzled by </v>

3338
02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:43.811
<v Speaker 3>right now is that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put up a picture on instagram about </v>

3339
02:30:43.811 --> 02:30:47.680
<v Speaker 3>like a picture with some friends or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever and the amount of people that </v>

3340
02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:49.930
<v Speaker 3>will go out of their way to say nasty </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff to strangers.</v>

3341
02:30:50.110 --> 02:30:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put a picture up of of friends that</v>

3342
02:30:52.221 --> 02:30:57.221
<v Speaker 3>I'm hanging with and someone will go </v>
<v Speaker 3>after someone in the picture and I'm </v>

3343
02:30:57.221 --> 02:30:57.221
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

3344
02:30:57.221 --> 02:30:59.600
<v Speaker 3>how much is your life suck that you need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go attack a stranger?</v>

3345
02:31:00.590 --> 02:31:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Virtually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not.</v>

3346
02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:06.250
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they.</v>

3347
02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:11.280
<v Speaker 3>They fall into several categories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the most egregious or youtube and </v>

3348
02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:12.250
<v Speaker 3>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3349
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:14.060
<v Speaker 3>like twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least.</v>

3350
02:31:14.061 --> 02:31:19.061
<v Speaker 3>My twitter feed is surprisingly polite </v>
<v Speaker 3>and nice and genuine and kind friendly </v>

3351
02:31:19.850 --> 02:31:20.250
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3352
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean people was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative people that deal with the </v>

3353
02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I deal with Nice people.</v>

3354
02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:27.210
<v Speaker 2>99.9%</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time.</v>

3355
02:31:27.211 --> 02:31:32.211
<v Speaker 2>It's almost all nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally a Twat will sneak through </v>

3356
02:31:32.211 --> 02:31:35.050
<v Speaker 2>the to the net and find their way into </v>
<v Speaker 2>my twitter feed,</v>

3357
02:31:35.051 --> 02:31:36.830
<v Speaker 2>but then you just block them and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done with it.</v>

3358
02:31:36.831 --> 02:31:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instagram,</v>

3359
02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:41.820
<v Speaker 2>good luck trying to block those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters and they all have.</v>

3360
02:31:41.850 --> 02:31:44.670
<v Speaker 2>If you go to their accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all locked right there.</v>

3361
02:31:44.671 --> 02:31:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like if you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical,</v>

3362
02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:50.520
<v Speaker 2>my pictures let me be critical of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of times I always think</v>

3363
02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:55.880
<v Speaker 2>because for me it's not that different </v>
<v Speaker 2>from like being in middle school and </v>

3364
02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:57.120
<v Speaker 2>people like this cannot go shockey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little weird middle school too,</v>

3365
02:31:57.121 --> 02:32:00.360
<v Speaker 2>like that not much has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world was in middle school as well.</v>

3366
02:32:00.430 --> 02:32:05.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just more accepting of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come from the exact same person but </v>

3367
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:05.880
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like lunch room bullying,</v>

3368
02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but on this virtual level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess what I would stand up for </v>

3369
02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:12.990
<v Speaker 2>myself then so sometimes I watch people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't get a lot anymore,</v>

3370
02:32:12.991 --> 02:32:17.991
<v Speaker 2>but like when when they said I was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>top gear or when I started being on tv </v>

3371
02:32:17.991 --> 02:32:20.360
<v Speaker 2>for Nascar than you would see those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people come out of the woodwork and even</v>

3372
02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:25.370
<v Speaker 2>still like I did these funny videos for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nascar on NBC with like Danica Patrick </v>

3373
02:32:25.370 --> 02:32:29.830
<v Speaker 2>and Kevin Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people and someone will be </v>

3374
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you suck,</v>

3375
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.830
<v Speaker 2>you're fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stupid.</v>

3376
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:30.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

3377
02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will.</v>

3378
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I would say 95% of the time I at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to know if it's something funny </v>

3379
02:32:37.861 --> 02:32:41.430
<v Speaker 2>then I'll laugh and just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's something to where like they</v>

3380
02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:43.380
<v Speaker 2>they really want to go after you a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

3381
02:32:43.381 --> 02:32:48.381
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just at least look at your </v>

3382
02:32:48.381 --> 02:32:48.381
<v Speaker 2>profile and if I can tell they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know any better,</v>

3383
02:32:48.381 --> 02:32:48.381
<v Speaker 2>you just block them.</v>

3384
02:32:48.381 --> 02:32:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Unum wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I feel like they know better,</v>

3385
02:32:50.430 --> 02:32:55.430
<v Speaker 2>every once in awhile I'll just lean back</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tiny bit and this guy one day when </v>

3386
02:32:55.430 --> 02:32:59.271
<v Speaker 2>after me about something stupid and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>told me how stupid I was and fat and </v>

3387
02:32:59.271 --> 02:33:00.360
<v Speaker 2>ugly and I shouldn't have a job in </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3388
02:33:00.660 --> 02:33:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I looked at his picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his profile on twitter and it was a </v>

3389
02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:07.050
<v Speaker 2>picture with him and his daughter like </v>
<v Speaker 2>going canoeing and so all I said was,</v>

3390
02:33:07.051 --> 02:33:09.480
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope no one ever says to your daughter</v>

3391
02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:14.780
<v Speaker 2>at school what you just said to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know that'll feel bad for you </v>

3392
02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:15.130
<v Speaker 2>to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

02:33:43.191 --> 02:33:43.191
<v Speaker 2>shit to me and I retweet them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3404
02:33:43.191 --> 02:33:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Just retained them and like you pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends.</v>

3405
02:33:46.231 --> 02:33:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3406
02:33:46.591 --> 02:33:46.870
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3407
02:33:46.871 --> 02:33:47.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3408
02:33:47.131 --> 02:33:52.131
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I did was retweet what you put out </v>

3409
02:33:52.131 --> 02:33:55.440
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is you and I let everyone know this</v>

3410
02:33:55.441 --> 02:33:56.680
<v Speaker 2>is you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is you.</v>

3411
02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:58.230
<v Speaker 2>This is shared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3412
02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:01.140
<v Speaker 2>shared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that's not being a bully.</v>

3413
02:34:01.141 --> 02:34:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Do I have a bigger platform?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You?</v>

3414
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Of course I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck face.</v>

3415
02:34:03.631 --> 02:34:05.580
<v Speaker 2>That's how you know who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who you are.</v>

3416
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:07.640
<v Speaker 2>That's simple logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3417
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:12.790
<v Speaker 2>don't stick your hand the cage if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get bit because that's </v>

3418
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:15.711
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to retweet you and then </v>

3419
02:34:15.711 --> 02:34:17.991
<v Speaker 2>everyone is going to all these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are bored looking for some </v>

3420
02:34:17.991 --> 02:34:18.190
<v Speaker 2>asshole to shit</v>

3421
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:18.670
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3422
02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:20.860
<v Speaker 1>They get home at Tartar taking shit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their boss.</v>

3423
02:34:20.861 --> 02:34:25.861
<v Speaker 1>Their fucking wife is an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kids suck and they're happy to </v>

3424
02:34:25.861 --> 02:34:28.240
<v Speaker 1>climb up your ass and plant bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're happy.</v>

3425
02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an earful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

3426
02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.640
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's because of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why people were bullying people </v>

3427
02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:38.740
<v Speaker 1>in middle school where you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly as much when you become an adult.</v>

3428
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because it's a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon.</v>

3429
02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that the cyber communication is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's untested.</v>

3430
02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:48.460
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the fuck we're doing.</v>

3431
02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:51.250
<v Speaker 1>All the normal shit involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>

3432
02:34:51.251 --> 02:34:55.150
<v Speaker 1>like social cues and knowing first of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

3433
02:34:55.450 --> 02:34:59.320
<v Speaker 1>someone accepting you as a person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have a conversation with.</v>

3434
02:34:59.321 --> 02:35:04.321
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're communicating with online that </v>

3435
02:35:04.321 --> 02:35:05.950
<v Speaker 1>you would never accept as communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners in real life.</v>

3436
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would meet them.</v>

3437
02:35:07.301 --> 02:35:12.301
<v Speaker 1>They'd be gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like Mike a dick and he just </v>

3438
02:35:12.301 --> 02:35:14.750
<v Speaker 1>like stopped talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He right or stop visiting his place of </v>

3439
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:18.001
<v Speaker 1>business or or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they can just get to you </v>

3440
02:35:18.001 --> 02:35:19.540
<v Speaker 1>without any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to accept them.</v>

3441
02:35:19.541 --> 02:35:23.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to choose them to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because you pick your friends.</v>

3442
02:35:23.141 --> 02:35:26.380
<v Speaker 1>If you're a wise person and you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a better life if you do that.</v>

3443
02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:29.410
<v Speaker 1>If you don't pick your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just let let anybody in your life.</v>

3444
02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:34.500
<v Speaker 1>You develop a series of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>incurable disasters over and over and </v>

3445
02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:36.940
<v Speaker 1>over again that you never really recover</v>
<v Speaker 1>from and you live your life based on the</v>

3446
02:35:36.941 --> 02:35:41.941
<v Speaker 1>momentum of a bunch of assholes who </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't thinking straight then that's a </v>

3447
02:35:41.941 --> 02:35:42.850
<v Speaker 1>lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends like that,</v>

3448
02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:47.880
<v Speaker 1>but live their life like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one disaster after another </v>

3449
02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:51.430
<v Speaker 1>fucking disaster and if you get caught </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the hurricane that is their life,</v>

3450
02:35:51.431 --> 02:35:53.020
<v Speaker 1>they'll drag you into the cyclone.</v>

3451
02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:57.100
<v Speaker 1>You'll get fucking tossed out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean somewhere or you.</v>

3452
02:35:57.120 --> 02:35:59.350
<v Speaker 1>You choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the online world,</v>

3453
02:35:59.351 --> 02:36:04.351
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're out there and what they're </v>

3454
02:36:04.351 --> 02:36:07.231
<v Speaker 1>doing by blocking you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think my wildest get him and he </v>

3455
02:36:07.231 --> 02:36:10.531
<v Speaker 1>can't even me back and so they put their</v>
<v Speaker 1>little fucking locked profile on </v>

3456
02:36:11.741 --> 02:36:14.470
<v Speaker 1>instagram and it's just guaranteed </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a coward.</v>

3457
02:36:14.471 --> 02:36:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody who has a locked profile to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk shit.</v>

3458
02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just block them immediately.</v>

3459
02:36:19.390 --> 02:36:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't speak to them if they think like</v>

3460
02:36:23.171 --> 02:36:26.540
<v Speaker 1>they like there's a rider in Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blocked me and I was laughing,</v>

3461
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:27.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3462
02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

3463
02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:32.020
<v Speaker 1>it was just one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason this guy decided the day</v>

3464
02:36:32.021 --> 02:36:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hated me,</v>

3465
02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but I laughed because I thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you thought I wanted to know what </v>

3466
02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:42.421
<v Speaker 1>you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never wanted to know what you </v>

3467
02:36:42.421 --> 02:36:42.460
<v Speaker 1>thought because I didn't care then and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't care now.</v>

3468
02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:43.960
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that he went to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>

3469
02:36:44.350 --> 02:36:49.350
<v Speaker 1>it made me giggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like same thing with if some stranger </v>

3470
02:36:49.350 --> 02:36:49.930
<v Speaker 1>says you're stupid and then blocked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

3471
02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:55.440
<v Speaker 1>You must have thought I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to learn more about you after you </v>

3472
02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:59.041
<v Speaker 1>insulted me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What provider could seriously get to </v>

3473
02:36:59.041 --> 02:37:00.850
<v Speaker 1>know you and not take care of Greg Carr?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's choosing to me.</v>

3474
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:03.230
<v Speaker 1>They're very friendly guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

3475
02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Why did he decide that you're a dick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great question.</v>

3476
02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:07.360
<v Speaker 1>What was his criticism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he say?</v>

3477
02:37:07.361 --> 02:37:08.200
<v Speaker 1>What's his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way?</v>

3478
02:37:08.270 --> 02:37:10.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please find out.</v>

3479
02:37:10.270 --> 02:37:14.020
<v Speaker 1>There's this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one guy who was a nascar rider.</v>

3480
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Too many of the other way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3484
02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:20.930

<v Speaker 1>Napkins?</v>

3485
02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

3486
02:37:22.311 --> 02:37:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I think most of them have a brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>typewriter.</v>

3487
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I think his brother is that right?</v>

3488
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:31.280
<v Speaker 1>This one dude would go on like serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say terrible things about me.</v>

3489
02:37:31.281 --> 02:37:33.830
<v Speaker 1>How much he disliked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it was really nice to me at the</v>

3490
02:37:33.831 --> 02:37:36.710
<v Speaker 1>track and he did a bunch of shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Boy,</v>

3491
02:37:36.711 --> 02:37:38.270
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My boy,</v>

3492
02:37:38.271 --> 02:37:42.170
<v Speaker 1>like a fat guy was sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was big size load.</v>

3493
02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Every motherfucker he's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dead.</v>

3494
02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:47.570
<v Speaker 1>He died of a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's poor fat.</v>

3495
02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a windbreaker that he would take </v>

3496
02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:52.640
<v Speaker 1>when he went to eat chili dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3497
02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:53.660
<v Speaker 1>And that was kind of when I found that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3498
02:37:53.661 --> 02:37:54.800
<v Speaker 1>So when I worked with is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3499
02:37:54.801 --> 02:37:56.870
<v Speaker 1>he puts on like a tarp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chili dogs.</v>

3500
02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

3501
02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I got to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy knows his stuff is a lot worse </v>

3502
02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.370
<v Speaker 1>than anything I got going on in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need a tarp for Chile though,</v>

3503
02:38:04.371 --> 02:38:07.700
<v Speaker 1>either he really loves clothes or knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a slob.</v>

3504
02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And just gave in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the second,</v>

3505
02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:15.140
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of self loathing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in people being mean to people </v>

3506
02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:17.270
<v Speaker 1>because they want you to feel the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel a little bit.</v>

3507
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:18.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to reach out.</v>

3508
02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had communication with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>online like really mean to people.</v>

3509
02:38:22.731 --> 02:38:27.731
<v Speaker 1>And then you go and look at their </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter feed and like you'll find some </v>

3510
02:38:27.731 --> 02:38:29.620
<v Speaker 1>like suicidal shit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find you some miserable.</v>

3511
02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that.</v>

3512
02:38:31.191 --> 02:38:32.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are hurting.</v>

3513
02:38:32.781 --> 02:38:37.781
<v Speaker 1>I think the model of life that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of people are living in civil </v>

3514
02:38:38.301 --> 02:38:42.200
<v Speaker 1>as well as in civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The civil civilized world,</v>

3515

<v Speaker 1>that you don't really want and places </v>

3516
02:38:47.201 --> 02:38:51.371
<v Speaker 1>that you don't really want to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to like what you're doing </v>

3517
02:38:51.371 --> 02:38:51.371

<v Speaker 1>That's the ideal life for everybody.</v>

3520
02:38:56.370 --> 02:39:01.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody really wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a lot of people get to </v>

<v Speaker 1>Small amount of people that get to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just it's.</v>

3523
02:39:04.170 --> 02:39:05.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a one.</v>

3524
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talk about the one percenters </v>

3525
02:39:10.590 --> 02:39:10.590
<v Speaker 1>isn't even the 1% that are doing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to do.</v>

3526
02:39:10.590 --> 02:39:14.291
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Donald Trump is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to do that for fucking goofy </v>

<v Speaker 1>Prek wants to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to.</v>

3528
02:39:14.291 --> 02:39:19.090
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was paying people to cheer at his </v>

3529
02:39:19.090 --> 02:39:20.240
<v Speaker 1>presidential announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just an ego.</v>

3530
02:39:20.241 --> 02:39:22.990
<v Speaker 1>He's just a big ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that's not.</v>

3531
02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:28.180
<v Speaker 1>He just got on that path and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>path that he's using to try to validate </v>

3532
02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:33.041
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are not living a life that </v>

<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

3544
02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It's hard and most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the victims of Shitty childhoods </v>

3545
02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:17.711
<v Speaker 1>and people who had kids that didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck they were doing and they </v>

3546
02:40:17.711 --> 02:40:17.711
<v Speaker 1>pray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3547
02:40:17.711 --> 02:40:19.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like imagine getting programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you had a program,</v>

3548
02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:21.030
<v Speaker 1>a computer program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3549
02:40:21.031 --> 02:40:26.031
<v Speaker 1>And your computer was programmed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like me who doesn't know Jack </v>

3550
02:40:26.031 --> 02:40:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Shit about computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to type my name in the </v>

3551
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.230
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3552
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:33.700
<v Speaker 1>my password and how to get my gmail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what's going on </v>

3553
02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:33.880
<v Speaker 1>underneath the surface as well.</v>

3554
02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm an idiot.</v>

3555
02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:37.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had to program my own computer,</v>

3556
02:40:37.921 --> 02:40:40.320
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be crashing every five.</v>

3557
02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:45.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially like a gigantic </v>

3558
02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:46.560
<v Speaker 1>biological computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your most complex?</v>

3559
02:40:46.561 --> 02:40:51.561
<v Speaker 1>When we know and they're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineered and program by morons,</v>

3560
02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:57.020
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of morons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're raising kids and fucking them up</v>

3561
02:40:57.630 --> 02:41:02.630
<v Speaker 1>and then it's our job as the kids who </v>
<v Speaker 1>got fucked up to sort of decipher what </v>

3562
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:07.101
<v Speaker 1>the fuck are parents did wrong to us are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to make it through life with as </v>

3563
02:41:07.101 --> 02:41:11.121
<v Speaker 1>much happiness as we possibly can to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart stops beating and that's a complex</v>

3564
02:41:11.341 --> 02:41:14.580
<v Speaker 1>puzzle and everybody makes it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>and figures that fucking thing out.</v>

3565
02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:19.640
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people on instagram with </v>

3566
02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:21.501
<v Speaker 1>locked accounts and those are the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eat chili dogs with wind breakers </v>

3567
02:41:21.501 --> 02:41:25.881
<v Speaker 1>on and smile to your face and Shit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your fucking computer or on </v>

3568
02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Sirius satellite radio or whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3569
02:41:28.501 --> 02:41:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

3570
02:41:29.461 --> 02:41:30.600
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3571
02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:35.660
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to let yourself forget about </v>

3572
02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:37.731
<v Speaker 1>liking other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially liking other people that are </v>

3573
02:41:37.731 --> 02:41:37.731
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Host in top gear.</v>

3574
02:41:37.731 --> 02:41:40.830
<v Speaker 1>That handsome tanner foust and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful Adam Ferrara.</v>

3575
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say this.</v>

3576
02:41:43.921 --> 02:41:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>

3577
02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:48.030
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your life sucks,</v>

3578
02:41:48.090 --> 02:41:50.050
<v Speaker 2>if it's now or you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3579
02:41:50.051 --> 02:41:51.180
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all been there,</v>

3580
02:41:51.181 --> 02:41:54.340
<v Speaker 2>but like I think a lot of people forget </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that you can change that.</v>

3581
02:41:54.341 --> 02:41:59.341
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality that we're flying through </v>

3582
02:41:59.341 --> 02:41:59.550
<v Speaker 2>this gigantic marble in space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will kind of blow your mind,</v>

3583
02:41:59.850 --> 02:42:03.240
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you can wake up every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and do what you want to do or not do</v>

3584
02:42:03.241 --> 02:42:05.310
<v Speaker 2>what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's pretty awesome.</v>

3585
02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Like I these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're sitting here,</v>

3586
02:42:07.711 --> 02:42:10.110
<v Speaker 2>this didn't happen by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3587
02:42:10.111 --> 02:42:14.010
<v Speaker 2>and I think sometimes people forget that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if there's something out there that</v>

3588
02:42:14.011 --> 02:42:19.011
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to physically do </v>

3589
02:42:19.011 --> 02:42:19.011
<v Speaker 2>something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3590
02:42:19.011 --> 02:42:19.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's the one thing that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people come after me that I,</v>

3591
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love having fun.</v>

3592
02:42:21.810 --> 02:42:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to make people's day better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That for me it was like I was either </v>

3593
02:42:26.810 --> 02:42:28.380
<v Speaker 2>going to try to go back to school and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of teacher,</v>

3594
02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:33.710
<v Speaker 2>like a high school counselor because </v>
<v Speaker 2>columbine and stuff like that breaks my </v>

3595
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:34.550
<v Speaker 2>heart like I can't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

3596
02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's because those kids didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the parents that I did when they got </v>

3597
02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:40.710
<v Speaker 2>made fun of the parents weren't there to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3598
02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:42.780
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with you.</v>

3599
02:42:42.781 --> 02:42:47.781
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they don't have enough </v>

3600
02:42:47.781 --> 02:42:51.021
<v Speaker 2>confidence in who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to take it out on </v>

3601
02:42:51.021 --> 02:42:51.021
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

3602
02:42:51.021 --> 02:42:52.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm either going to do that or I'm going</v>

3603
02:42:52.341 --> 02:42:55.050
<v Speaker 2>to try and get on TV and make as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people smile as I can,</v>

3604
02:42:55.410 --> 02:42:57.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's because I wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about it like that.</v>

3605
02:42:57.930 --> 02:43:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I just sometimes it breaks my heart that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that aren't willing to </v>

3606
02:43:02.930 --> 02:43:03.690
<v Speaker 2>push and say I want something better.</v>

3607
02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people feel trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their existence because they sort of </v>

3608
02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:13.300
<v Speaker 1>live their life on momentum and they got</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuck in this trap.</v>

3609
02:43:13.330 --> 02:43:18.330
<v Speaker 1>They're in high school and then they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to college and they get student loans </v>

3610
02:43:18.330 --> 02:43:18.780
<v Speaker 1>and they somehow get out and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a job.</v>

3611
02:43:18.810 --> 02:43:23.810
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to find a job and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they take whatever job they can get and </v>

3612
02:43:23.810 --> 02:43:26.881
<v Speaker 1>they still have debt and then they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a family and then they have mouths to </v>

3613
02:43:26.881 --> 02:43:30.031
<v Speaker 1>feed and they feel fucking trapped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was super frustrated so they see a guy </v>

3614
02:43:30.031 --> 02:43:33.781
<v Speaker 1>like you who's putting a 900 horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 1>engine Osi on and running around like a </v>

3615
02:43:33.781 --> 02:43:38.071
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy person on television and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get mad because you look at your </v>

3616
02:43:38.071 --> 02:43:38.260
<v Speaker 1>sweet guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a big smile on your face.</v>

3617
02:43:38.261 --> 02:43:39.490
<v Speaker 1>You look like you're having a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3618
02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:41.890
<v Speaker 1>And for people who are not having a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3619
02:43:41.891 --> 02:43:46.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the most punishing things is </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching someone live their life better.</v>

3620
02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:48.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about drifting,</v>

3621
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:52.150
<v Speaker 1>like how good tanner is a driving a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking car when he drifts.</v>

3622
02:43:52.151 --> 02:43:53.200
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an artist,</v>

3623
02:43:53.201 --> 02:43:58.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's moving like a ballet </v>

3624
02:43:58.201 --> 02:43:58.201
<v Speaker 1>dancer total if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was drifting.</v>

3625
02:43:58.201 --> 02:44:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I do it way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to drift.</v>

3626
02:44:00.251 --> 02:44:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

3627
02:44:00.701 --> 02:44:03.670
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took some drifting lessons today.</v>

3628
02:44:03.730 --> 02:44:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to drive,</v>

3629
02:44:04.931 --> 02:44:07.420
<v Speaker 1>but I guarantee uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked like a clunk.</v>

3630
02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Clunky fuck fuckhead in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3631
02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing as good a job and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drifting or driving or doing anything or</v>

3632
02:44:14.890 --> 02:44:17.920
<v Speaker 1>bowling or fucking playing darts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like life.</v>

3633
02:44:18.090 --> 02:44:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at it than you.</v>

3634
02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could either learn what are they</v>

3635
02:44:22.331 --> 02:44:26.410
<v Speaker 1>doing differently and try to apply that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your own life or you can just shit on</v>

3636
02:44:26.411 --> 02:44:26.560
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3637
02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:29.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you easier to shit.</v>

3638
02:44:29.801 --> 02:44:31.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't have tried to learn.</v>

3639
02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:34.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot easier to shit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you shitting on people and</v>

3640
02:44:34.391 --> 02:44:35.680
<v Speaker 1>you're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3641
02:44:35.681 --> 02:44:37.390
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you shitting on people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3642
02:44:37.391 --> 02:44:42.391
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize you are watching some </v>

3643
02:44:42.391 --> 02:44:44.610
<v Speaker 1>bloated ego or some ridiculous version </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a pop singer that record companies </v>

3644
02:44:46.391 --> 02:44:48.840
<v Speaker 1>are trying to stuff down your face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's Horseshit,</v>

3645
02:44:48.890 --> 02:44:51.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're correct.</v>

3646
02:44:51.161 --> 02:44:52.550
<v Speaker 1>And comparing them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3647
02:44:52.551 --> 02:44:53.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>

3648
02:44:53.621 --> 02:44:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Lou Reed or Mick Jagger or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it is that you really appreciate.</v>

3649
02:44:57.190 --> 02:45:01.420
<v Speaker 1>You're correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times it's just pitching.</v>

3650
02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:05.530
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you're just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why you're not happy.</v>

3651
02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:10.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing someone on television or </v>

3652
02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:10.800
<v Speaker 1>in movies or just on the cover of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine and you're,</v>

3653
02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:14.440
<v Speaker 1>you're angry because it's not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because for whatever reason,</v>

3654
02:45:14.441 --> 02:45:19.441
<v Speaker 1>you got down a bad path and you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in this fucking shitty existence </v>

3655
02:45:19.871 --> 02:45:22.960
<v Speaker 1>that seems to have no exit door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do.</v>

3656
02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So you lock up that instagram account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Start Shit graphing on strangers.</v>

3657
02:45:30.990 --> 02:45:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Shitty fucking dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just farting in your fucking office </v>

3658
02:45:37.331 --> 02:45:42.331
<v Speaker 1>chair and sniffing your own farts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping typing and horrible people out </v>

3659
02:45:42.331 --> 02:45:47.191
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to make you think that I </v>

3660
02:45:47.191 --> 02:45:47.380
<v Speaker 1>have a ton of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just have them look.</v>

3661
02:45:47.381 --> 02:45:49.770
<v Speaker 1>The better you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're going to have snow.</v>

3662
02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:52.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a temporary stop.</v>

3663
02:45:53.350 --> 02:45:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're about maybe a decade or </v>

3664
02:45:58.350 --> 02:46:02.341
<v Speaker 1>two away from no one ever having secrets</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever from everyone understanding </v>

3665
02:46:03.161 --> 02:46:05.800
<v Speaker 1>everyone's motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to read people's minds.</v>

3666
02:46:06.390 --> 02:46:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I think we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting closer and closer to each </v>

3667
02:46:11.390 --> 02:46:14.711
<v Speaker 1>other in some ridiculous way through </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and that's what's going on </v>

3668
02:46:14.711 --> 02:46:16.310
<v Speaker 1>with these people that you would've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never chosen to communicate with.</v>

3669
02:46:16.311 --> 02:46:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Reach out and fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3670
02:46:18.531 --> 02:46:20.480
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through twitter or facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what have you.</v>

3671
02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're going to come to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time where,</v>

3672
02:46:24.020 --> 02:46:28.340
<v Speaker 1>and not too far away from now what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to share thoughts and some sort of</v>

3673
02:46:28.341 --> 02:46:33.341
<v Speaker 1>a weird way that's not going to be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple as like reading something on </v>

3674
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Reddit or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook or instagram.</v>

3675
02:46:37.850 --> 02:46:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be way more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be.</v>

3676
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:45.670
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have you seen that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they did where they did an </v>

3677
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.670
<v Speaker 1>experiment where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3678
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:49.820
<v Speaker 1>they hooked these people up to some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a brain detecting device,</v>

3679
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:52.190
<v Speaker 1>implanted electrodes on their head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3680
02:46:52.270 --> 02:46:56.660
<v Speaker 1>they sent words through the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the world.</v>

3681
02:46:57.010 --> 02:47:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Like instantaneously these people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side of the world receive these </v>

3682
02:47:02.010 --> 02:47:03.110
<v Speaker 1>words and knew what the person was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3683
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:07.310
<v Speaker 1>like brain to brain communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't seen that?</v>

3684
02:47:07.311 --> 02:47:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's crazy.</v>

3685
02:47:08.991 --> 02:47:09.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3686
02:47:09.970 --> 02:47:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

3687
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't totally understand how they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3688
02:47:13.820 --> 02:47:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I think they can only do it with crude </v>
<v Speaker 1>words right now.</v>

3689
02:47:16.821 --> 02:47:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3690
02:47:17.511 --> 02:47:18.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3691
02:47:18.951 --> 02:47:23.951
<v Speaker 1>you suck like those kinds of thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think they,</v>

3692
02:47:24.590 --> 02:47:29.590
<v Speaker 1>you identify in your head what that word</v>
<v Speaker 1>means and you commit to that thought and</v>

3693
02:47:31.731 --> 02:47:33.830
<v Speaker 1>then they can transmit that thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull,</v>

3694
02:47:33.831 --> 02:47:35.900
<v Speaker 1>pull up that study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't understand it</v>

3695
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:40.990
<v Speaker 2>binary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it turn that word into a binary </v>

3696
02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:41.960
<v Speaker 2>code of some kind of transmitted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one zero on offs to you.</v>

3697
02:47:41.961 --> 02:47:46.961
<v Speaker 2>And then you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was only a couple of things they </v>

3698
02:47:46.961 --> 02:47:46.961
<v Speaker 2>had in it,</v>

3699
02:47:46.961 --> 02:47:49.440
<v Speaker 1>so they knew what it was because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>binary.</v>

3700
02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:51.930
<v Speaker 2>It's our hello or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shower.</v>

3701
02:47:51.940 --> 02:47:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Hello or goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do.</v>

3702
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Did they just play the flight of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conchords song about the Binary Solo?</v>

3703
02:47:58.161 --> 02:47:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's what it is?</v>

3704
02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love those guys.</v>

3705
02:48:02.190 --> 02:48:06.120
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand's are my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand is a nice gentle people.</v>

3706
02:48:06.210 --> 02:48:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a sweet spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to getting fucked </v>

3707
02:48:11.210 --> 02:48:14.031
<v Speaker 1>over over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stole all his money and they're trying </v>

3708
02:48:14.031 --> 02:48:14.220
<v Speaker 1>to import or export them to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

3709
02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:17.010
<v Speaker 1>deport them rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird situation.</v>

3710
02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Honda Mega upload situation because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

3711
02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:26.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's never even been to America and </v>

3712
02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:28.671
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to bring them to America </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some alleged crimes against these </v>

3713
02:48:28.671 --> 02:48:31.410
<v Speaker 1>alleged movie companies where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were uploading videos.</v>

3714
02:48:31.710 --> 02:48:33.240
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex,</v>

3715
02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:38.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like I would like to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what percentage of that site was </v>

3716
02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:43.191
<v Speaker 1>being used for that and what percentage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it was being used for people just </v>

3717
02:48:43.191 --> 02:48:43.830
<v Speaker 1>uploading things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't totally understand how he was.</v>

3718
02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Were people paying like a subscription </v>
<v Speaker 1>fee?</v>

3719
02:48:46.780 --> 02:48:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

3720
02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when people make a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

3721
02:48:50.251 --> 02:48:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3722
02:48:50.581 --> 02:48:51.680
<v Speaker 1>how did that just happen?</v>

3723
02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A company in Barcelona called star lab </v>

3724
02:48:56.700 --> 02:48:59.541
<v Speaker 1>described transmitting short words like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chow and coded as binary digits between </v>

3725
02:49:00.361 --> 02:49:02.520
<v Speaker 1>the brains of individuals on different </v>
<v Speaker 1>continents,</v>

3726
02:49:02.521 --> 02:49:05.550
<v Speaker 1>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both studies use a similar setup.</v>

3727
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:10.690
<v Speaker 1>This the sender of the war in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electro and cephalgia graphic cap that </v>

3728
02:49:12.031 --> 02:49:17.031
<v Speaker 1>captured electrical signal generated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>his cortext while he thought about </v>

3729
02:49:17.031 --> 02:49:21.230
<v Speaker 1>moving his hands or feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These signals were then sent over the </v>

3730
02:49:21.230 --> 02:49:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Internet to a computer that translated </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into jolts delivered to a recipient</v>

3731
02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:28.260
<v Speaker 1>recipients brain using a magnetic coil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Star labs case,</v>

3732
02:49:28.261 --> 02:49:32.430
<v Speaker 1>the recipient perceived a flash of light</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the University of Washington case.</v>

3733
02:49:32.431 --> 02:49:37.431
<v Speaker 1>The magnetic poles caused an involuntary</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitch of the wrist over a touchpad to </v>

3734
02:49:37.651 --> 02:49:41.430
<v Speaker 1>shoot a rocket into a computer game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3735
02:49:41.970 --> 02:49:46.970
<v Speaker 1>See where we're getting to this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in technology and the the.</v>

3736
02:49:47.511 --> 02:49:50.640
<v Speaker 1>The ability that we have to manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

3737
02:49:50.641 --> 02:49:55.641
<v Speaker 1>but the ability to manipulate matter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that's going to make haters </v>

3738
02:49:56.551 --> 02:49:57.090
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

3739
02:49:57.090 --> 02:49:58.800
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be ridiculous.</v>

3740
02:49:58.801 --> 02:50:03.801
<v Speaker 1>This is a temporary pitstop like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent stage and the communication </v>

3741
02:50:03.801 --> 02:50:08.781
<v Speaker 1>that we're enjoying and it's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if you look back at watch game of </v>

3742
02:50:08.781 --> 02:50:13.401
<v Speaker 1>thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send a raven the only typical fucking </v>

3743
02:50:13.401 --> 02:50:13.401
<v Speaker 1>rave and tie a message through his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3744
02:50:13.401 --> 02:50:17.990
<v Speaker 1>that was like the only way you get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>message to somebody that is ridiculous </v>

3745
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:21.390
<v Speaker 1>now and I think these ideas of texts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweets and all that stuff,</v>

3746
02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it will be ridiculous in the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we'll just have something that's</v>

3747
02:50:25.051 --> 02:50:27.990
<v Speaker 1>far more satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Far more direct.</v>

3748
02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:29.880
<v Speaker 1>You'll understand sarcasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

3749
02:50:29.881 --> 02:50:34.881
<v Speaker 1>Understand when someone's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever get a text from someone you </v>

3750
02:50:34.881 --> 02:50:34.881
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3751
02:50:34.881 --> 02:50:34.881
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking with me as this of </v>
<v Speaker 1>really mad at me?</v>

3752
02:50:34.881 --> 02:50:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3753
02:50:35.570 --> 02:50:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking with me?</v>

3754
02:50:37.351 --> 02:50:38.150
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally,</v>

3755
02:50:38.210 --> 02:50:43.210
<v Speaker 1>totally no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not serious or just joking around and </v>

3756
02:50:43.210 --> 02:50:45.531
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they are serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretending they're not </v>

3757
02:50:45.531 --> 02:50:45.531
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to feel that</v>

3758
02:50:45.531 --> 02:50:47.970
<v Speaker 3>right now you're saying that we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up one day and I'll be like,</v>

3759
02:50:47.971 --> 02:50:50.430
<v Speaker 3>I'll be thinking we should get coffee </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll be thinking that.</v>

3760
02:50:50.431 --> 02:50:55.431
<v Speaker 3>That sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You show up at your house with coffee </v>

3761
02:50:55.431 --> 02:50:59.490
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about butter conversation </v>

3762
02:50:59.490 --> 02:50:59.490
<v Speaker 3>nootropics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nootropics,</v>

3763
02:50:59.490 --> 02:51:02.250
<v Speaker 3>nootropics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was close with his memory.</v>

3764
02:51:02.340 --> 02:51:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3765
02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:04.290

3767
02:51:09.291 --> 02:51:09.291
<v Speaker 3>different nootropics that'll help with </v>
<v Speaker 3>memory.</v>

3768
02:51:09.291 --> 02:51:09.291
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3769
02:51:09.291 --> 02:51:14.090
<v Speaker 3>we've done two double blind placebo </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled tests on it with the Boston </v>

3770
02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Institute of Memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston Center for memory.</v>

3771
02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:18.060
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they showed.</v>

3772
02:51:18.061 --> 02:51:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Can you not remember the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>center?</v>

3773
02:51:20.470 --> 02:51:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've got work left to do.</v>

3774
02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:26.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not important to me.</v>

3775
02:51:28.350 --> 02:51:30.570
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use like names.</v>

3776
02:51:30.571 --> 02:51:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember people's names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Baab.</v>

3777
02:51:32.850 --> 02:51:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not important.</v>

3778
02:51:34.380 --> 02:51:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude,</v>

3779
02:51:35.490 --> 02:51:36.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3780
02:51:36.130 --> 02:51:38.850
<v Speaker 1>love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when something's important to me,</v>

3781
02:51:38.970 --> 02:51:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I've never fucking forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3782
02:51:40.730 --> 02:51:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what I do like UFC commentary and I</v>

3783
02:51:43.441 --> 02:51:45.840
<v Speaker 1>started talking about past fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have notes.</v>

3784
02:51:46.470 --> 02:51:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't just from my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember fights.</v>

3785
02:51:49.980 --> 02:51:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>

3786
02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I've probably called like 1500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional fights at least and I just </v>

3787
02:51:56.881 --> 02:51:58.790
<v Speaker 1>remember it was just Rolodex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in there.</v>

3788
02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I have to research or go back,</v>

3789
02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:04.890
<v Speaker 1>but I remember most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the big ones,</v>

3790
02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:08.380
<v Speaker 1>most the ones by the memories of weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

3791
02:52:08.381 --> 02:52:08.830
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3792
02:52:08.831 --> 02:52:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I went to this thing the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My daughter had this,</v>

3793
02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:14.620
<v Speaker 1>a dance recital and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had been to the same place two years</v>

3794
02:52:14.621 --> 02:52:18.010
<v Speaker 1>before and I'd only been there once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was walking there I was like,</v>

3795
02:52:18.011 --> 02:52:18.610
<v Speaker 1>where do I go?</v>

3796
02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over here.</v>

3797
02:52:19.931 --> 02:52:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden my brain went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>

3798
02:52:21.881 --> 02:52:23.250
<v Speaker 1>let me pull those files up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3799
02:52:23.330 --> 02:52:24.650
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3800
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:29.670
<v Speaker 1>thinking as I was walking I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how weird is this that my brain is just </v>

3801
02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:33.301
<v Speaker 1>pulling these files up now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it wasn't for this recital </v>

3802
02:52:33.301 --> 02:52:35.890
<v Speaker 1>that I had to go do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never remember shit.</v>

3803
02:52:36.220 --> 02:52:40.570
<v Speaker 1>But for whatever reason your brain can </v>
<v Speaker 1>like reach back and find those files and</v>

3804
02:52:40.571 --> 02:52:44.830
<v Speaker 1>pull them out when necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For now it'll keep them for like,</v>

3805
02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:49.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like sort of like tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone sends you a direct message in </v>

3806
02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:53.341
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter cleans those out after six </v>

3807
02:52:53.341 --> 02:52:53.341
<v Speaker 1>months or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't need this anymore.</v>

3808
02:52:53.341 --> 02:52:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Trying to save.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was an important.</v>

3809
02:52:54.970 --> 02:52:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Kicked this out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3810
02:52:56.740 --> 02:53:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also going to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that gets resolved with a </v>

3811
02:53:01.740 --> 02:53:03.790
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the way we memorize things now,</v>

3812
02:53:03.791 --> 02:53:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like really crude and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work that good.</v>

3813
02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be able to record things </v>

3814
02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:14.140
<v Speaker 1>that you see directly to some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium,</v>

3815
02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:16.780
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's a SD card or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck it is.</v>

3816
02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to be able to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences with someone else.</v>

3817
02:53:20.050 --> 02:53:21.520
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your wife was like,</v>

3818
02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:22.780
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was work today?</v>

3819
02:53:22.781 --> 02:53:27.781

<v Speaker 1>well why don't you fucking live it </v>

3820
02:53:27.781 --> 02:53:27.781
<v Speaker 1>bitch?</v>

3821
02:53:27.781 --> 02:53:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You put the card in her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3822
02:53:29.621 --> 02:53:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3823
02:53:30.791 --> 02:53:35.791
<v Speaker 1>I just jumped a fucking school bus over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of a bridge and flames were </v>

3824
02:53:35.791 --> 02:53:35.791
<v Speaker 1>shooting out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3825
02:53:35.791 --> 02:53:36.930
<v Speaker 1>that's what I did at work today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roots really bumming me out.</v>

3830
02:53:45.570 --> 02:53:50.570
<v Speaker 1>And what's going to bum me out as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>automotive enthusiast as you are as </v>

3831
02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:51.550
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is He self driving cars?</v>

3832

<v Speaker 1>So strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3833
02:53:53.290 --> 02:53:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

3834
02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:57.580

<v Speaker 1>of assholes drive like shit.</v>

3835

3839
02:54:11.350 --> 02:54:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Or is it possible it will make driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people like us even better because.</v>

3840
02:54:17.230 --> 02:54:19.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in three minutes.</v>

3841
02:54:19.151 --> 02:54:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else.</v>

3842
02:54:20.171 --> 02:54:25.171
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all the people that suck at driving </v>

3843
02:54:25.171 --> 02:54:27.200
<v Speaker 1>in autonomous cars in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just in the left lane in fast </v>

3845
02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you have to like,</v>

3846
02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every tanner foust guy is allowed </v>

3847
02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:35.320
<v Speaker 1>to drive whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3848
02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Because he has such tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because like my 53 plymouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

3850
02:54:40.871 --> 02:54:44.170
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you could make a computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>big enough to drive that thing yourself.</v>

3851
02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we'll ever get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're not allowed to drive those </v>

3852
02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:49.200
<v Speaker 1>cars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get some weird laws in California,</v>

3853
02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:54.300
<v Speaker 1>like one of the reasons why people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>older cars because you don't have to </v>

3854
02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:54.300
<v Speaker 1>smog them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell yes.</v>

3855
02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:59.190
<v Speaker 1>But look at Mexico City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking picture that I showed you </v>

3856
02:54:59.190 --> 02:55:01.831
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when you let people </v>

3857
02:55:01.831 --> 02:55:03.350
<v Speaker 1>not small their cars or you have too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many cars and we don't want that.</v>

3858
02:55:03.730 --> 02:55:03.960
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3859
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:08.980
<v Speaker 3>like where do you draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's only a certain amount of </v>

3860
02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:11.201
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>69 Chevelle that are available in the </v>

3861
02:55:11.201 --> 02:55:11.201
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3862
02:55:11.201 --> 02:55:11.900
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to find one of those in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to have a 19,</v>

3863
02:55:11.901 --> 02:55:13.160
<v Speaker 3>69 Chevelle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3864
02:55:13.161 --> 02:55:14.330
<v Speaker 3>They don't make them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

3865
02:55:14.450 --> 02:55:16.850
<v Speaker 3>And if you want to build a new 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>69 Chevelle,</v>

3866
02:55:16.851 --> 02:55:17.670
<v Speaker 3>well guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

3867
02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:19.730
<v Speaker 3>that's gotta get smog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not going to be the same.</v>

3868
02:55:20.310 --> 02:55:22.280
<v Speaker 3>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3869
02:55:22.490 --> 02:55:25.050
<v Speaker 3>there's good and there's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3870
02:55:26.010 --> 02:55:28.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like if you've been drinking,</v>

3871
02:55:28.581 --> 02:55:31.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a genius idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3872
02:55:31.310 --> 02:55:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Just drop me off at home parking garage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds awesome.</v>

3873
02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:39.520
<v Speaker 3>But imagine if you were in that self </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving car and you're safe and sound </v>

3874
02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:43.400
<v Speaker 3>and some Dick Wad in a fucking Mustang </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going who?</v>

3875
02:55:43.401 --> 02:55:48.401
<v Speaker 3>And again in right on the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just doing a standard burned out at the </v>

3876
02:55:48.401 --> 02:55:48.401
<v Speaker 3>stoplight.</v>

3877
02:55:48.401 --> 02:55:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He smashes into you.</v>

3878
02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:51.110
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're like,</v>

3879
02:55:51.111 --> 02:55:56.111
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody should be in these fucking </v>

3880
02:55:56.111 --> 02:55:56.111
<v Speaker 3>driverless cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

3881
02:55:56.111 --> 02:55:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Didn't crash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those Google cars though.</v>

3882
02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:58.960
<v Speaker 3>There's been some confirmation that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google cars,</v>

3883
02:55:58.990 --> 02:56:00.990
<v Speaker 3>they've actually crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're not.</v>

3884
02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.240
<v Speaker 3>They're not perfect yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>

3885
02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:06.650
<v Speaker 3>But they've probably crashed a lot less </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the people that work for Google.</v>

3886
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To Shay.</v>

3887

<v Speaker 3>That's a stat.</v>

3888
02:56:11.931 --> 02:56:13.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3890
02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:18.560
