5
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:12.531
<v Speaker 1>People are flipping those little baby electric small cars and it's called smart</v>

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.560
<v Speaker 1>smart card tipping or something.</v>

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>you're a girl and you weigh a hundred pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dick move.</v>

14
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I also think I,</v>

15
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>so I grew up in the suburbs.</v>

16
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I did not see a lot of cows,</v>

17
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess from time to time,</v>

18
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>but like can you actually tip a cow a no.</v>

19
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

20
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.671
<v Speaker 1>Yes you can.</v>

21
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge no,</v>

00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:33.661
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

24
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.561
<v Speaker 1>we've done it.</v>

25
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:35.394
<v Speaker 1>Just wants you to save it.</v>

26
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

27
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

28
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

29
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

30
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.943
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>

31
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.401
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

32
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:38.671
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>

33
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Me and my friends did it twice.</v>

34
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.371
<v Speaker 1>You've done it right?</v>

35
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Was it like a calf?</v>

36
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Was it like one of those calves to just so what happens isn't that when the cows</v>

37
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>and the cows are in the fields,</v>

38
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much locked their legs and sleep,</v>

39
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>standing up a lot.</v>

40
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.253
<v Speaker 1>That's how I sleep.</v>

41
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>And so you just go next to him and push them and they usually just fall to</v>

42
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>heavy.</v>

43
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

44
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.251
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

45
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:56.561
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

46
00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>they just tip right over hyping cow tipping site.</v>

47
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>This was stuff that suburban kids know,</v>

48
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.061
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

49
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.541
<v Speaker 1>or that like,</v>

50
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>it's an urban lore because none of us ever hung out with cows.</v>

51
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>If you ever want to go cow tipping,</v>

52
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

53
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>They would really like that,</v>

54
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:12.564
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

55
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.403
<v Speaker 1>they don't like it.</v>

56
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't like it.</v>

57
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you really go cow tipping Brian twice?</v>

58
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Twice.</v>

60
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Can you find a new one using video</v>

61
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.353
<v Speaker 1>or believe it?</v>

62
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

63
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>me and two of my friends.</v>

64
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.021
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And I want it to be one of those,</v>

66
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>remember those night vision like the Paris Hilton videos.</v>

67
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be one of those night vision videos of the cow tipping over.</v>

68
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.113
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

69
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.841
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a,</v>

70

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

77
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that's annoying about these things is that they insist on</v>

78
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>trying to change what you wrote there.</v>

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 2>let's get this out of the way.</v>

130
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.433
<v Speaker 2>Cow,</v>

131
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 2>at least as popularly imagined,</v>

132
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>does not exist.</v>

133
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Drunk men do not on any regular basis sneaking in cow pastures and put a hard</v>

134
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 2>shoulder to a cow taking a standing snooze,</v>

138
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>the Chicago cubs winning the world series and that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>

151
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>the largest clearinghouse of human stupidity the world has ever known,</v>

152
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:48.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

153
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 2>You can watch hours of kids taking the cinnamon challenge.</v>

154
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Teens jumping off route two rooftops on the trampolines and the explosive</v>

155
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:02.431
<v Speaker 2>results of fireworks set off indoors fails to deliver one single actual cow</v>

156
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 2>tipping video.</v>

157
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.743
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

158
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

159
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:07.160
<v Speaker 1>we did it as a kid.</v>

160
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 2>The one exception is a Russian dash cam video,</v>

161
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>which shows a semi truck full of cattle overturning.</v>

162
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 2>That's really good.</v>

163
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>You need to watch it shaking themselves off and walking away.</v>

164
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>How's not giving a fuck?</v>

165
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

167
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 2>This is a spectacular dash.</v>

168
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>So this uh,</v>

169
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 2>this article is calling bullshit on your prime.</v>

170
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>When I was younger,</v>

171
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>we would go to these farms in planes,</v>

172
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.981
<v Speaker 1>plain city,</v>

173
00:04:28.981 --> 00:04:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Ohio and they would have tons of cows and we would break into the cows,</v>

174
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>smoked weed and there'd be cows that will be end into the cows.</v>

175
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>No break into the fence.</v>

176
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>And there would be cows that would sit there like on there like perched up like</v>

177
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:43.530
<v Speaker 1>on there like legs.</v>

178
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just sitting there sleeping would come over and just push him right</v>

179
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

180
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the cow tipping that you've heard everybody doing like</v>

181
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:51.060
<v Speaker 1>people saying that the cows tip over.</v>

182
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>But that's what we used to do cause that's what we thought you were supposed to</v>

183
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:54.270
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

184
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what you just said.</v>

185
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.360
<v Speaker 1>This cows are standing up right?</v>

186
00:04:57.361 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause they stand up when they sleep,</v>

187
00:04:58.681 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

188
00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

189
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>not all the time there.</v>

190
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 1>There's cows like Nathan here.</v>

191
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you.</v>

192
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

193
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I thought cal was always stood out.</v>

194
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Horses always stand up.</v>

195
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

196
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

197
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

198
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to my guts telling me horses are the ones.</v>

199
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Horses I think always stand up,</v>

201
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

202
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

203
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.741
<v Speaker 2>And if they're down,</v>

204
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:16.280
<v Speaker 2>they're hurt.</v>

205
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.113
<v Speaker 2>We have the Google.</v>

206
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

207
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

208
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.190
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

209
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.791
<v Speaker 2>I'm really Shantel.</v>

210
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:20.624
<v Speaker 2>This cow tipping.</v>

211
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

212
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Speaker 2>We get the Internet disagrees with you.</v>

213
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.781
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

214
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:24.300
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

215
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.133
<v Speaker 2>That's a</v>

216
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.030
<v Speaker 2>brown cow.</v>

217
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 2>How rolling the cat would be like that.</v>

218
00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:29.880
<v Speaker 2>And he would just push it.</v>

219
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 1>But there'd be tons of cows and it'll be night at timing would be drunk.</v>

221
00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:34.494
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we used to do it.</v>

222
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

223
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be cow tipping.</v>

224
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

225
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Technically that's cow tipping.</v>

226
00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>They're just lying down cows.</v>

227
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:42.470
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to send the email to Snopes saying,</v>

228
00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:44.540
<v Speaker 2>well actually you're wrong.</v>

229
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.493
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

230
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling the problem with calling bullshit.</v>

231
00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.880
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't grow up in that environment,</v>

232
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 2>you might truly believe that it is bullshit.</v>

233
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.690
<v Speaker 2>But then at the guy like Brian actually grew up there and actually pushed over</v>

234
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

235
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>can we take this to</v>

236
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.930
<v Speaker 1>your fan base?</v>

237
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>They would sit like this and then you're just like [inaudible] go over there and</v>

238
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>just push them over and they would roll over and wake up and freak out and it</v>

239
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:06.891
<v Speaker 1>would be scary.</v>

240
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>And you'd would run away that now cow tipping.</v>

241
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>What I think they're saying is not true is actually tipping over a cal.</v>

242
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like completely standing up.</v>

243
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

244
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe that's what people have in their head,</v>

245
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.450
<v Speaker 2>but what it really is is what you're talking</v>

246
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.313
<v Speaker 1>the cal rolling.</v>

247
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.550
<v Speaker 1>That's when we did it.</v>

248
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:22.001
<v Speaker 1>We just did,</v>

249
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:23.800
<v Speaker 1>cause we heard people did it and then we were like,</v>

250
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.431
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

251
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:25.630
<v Speaker 1>There's tons of cows here.</v>

252
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Brian redband move.</v>

253
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 2>People are doing it.</v>

254
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.271
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

255
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:32.380
<v Speaker 2>well this show alive.</v>

256
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.843
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

257
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

258
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.610
<v Speaker 2>So then cow tipping is real.</v>

259
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess if I would say</v>

260
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.350
<v Speaker 1>it depends it well yeah it coul rolling.</v>

261
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna call it cal rolling.</v>

262
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.513
<v Speaker 1>Roll</v>

263
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 2>cow tipping as an account standing up and you pushing it over.</v>

264
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't exist.</v>

265
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>But that's probably not what cow tipping ever was unless they do sleep.</v>

266
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Standing up the couch,</v>

267
00:06:53.431 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 2>sleep standing up.</v>

268
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

269
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 2>we need to call me tons of pictures of cows doing exactly how.</v>

270
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:57.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

271
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>but did they also sleep standing up,</v>

272
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

273
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Let me just say how much I appreciate you guys get into the bottom of this.</v>

274
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 2>We need to worst case.</v>

275
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 2>How far are we from some cows?</v>

276
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

277
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 2>not that far.</v>

278
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>We can get to 100 an hour.</v>

279
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:09.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

280
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.371
<v Speaker 2>Does it count?</v>

281
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:11.091
<v Speaker 2>Sleep standing?</v>

282
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Common misconception that cows don't lie down.</v>

283
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Why cows may doze off for a few minutes at a time while standing up.</v>

284
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>They typically lie down to sleep or simply to rest.</v>

285
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

286
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling bullshit on the people calling bullshit.</v>

287
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 2>I think Brian's right.</v>

288
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I think Brian is right.</v>

289
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 2>He went cow tipping and that's how you really count because what everybody says</v>

290
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 2>is the cows are sleeping and you go up and push him.</v>

291
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.911
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

292
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 2>obviously if that's not true,</v>

293
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.250
<v Speaker 2>if they only take a little nap standing up and usually they sleep lying down,</v>

294
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 2>then their whole premise sucks because they don't understand what cow tipping</v>

295
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.723
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

296
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Calex hipping starts from the knees,</v>

297
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 2>like Jujitsu class.</v>

298
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Like if you take wrestling class,</v>

299
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 2>you start standing up for the most part,</v>

300
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>a room full of 50 dudes trying to double leg each other.</v>

301
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 2>That shit gets really dangerous.</v>

302
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 2>So jujitsu classes,</v>

303
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll start from the knees.</v>

304
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 2>So real cow tipping like the idea of it doesn't exist because that's like</v>

305
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 2>wrestling style.</v>

306
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody starts from their feet.</v>

307
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 2>But jujitsu style when you're already on the ground,</v>

308
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.940
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>

309
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.461
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>

310
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Now whenever I drive past a bunch of cows will be thinking about Jujitsu.</v>

311
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I just what I do,</v>

312
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.583
<v Speaker 2>that's the vision.</v>

313
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.423
<v Speaker 2>That's my gift.</v>

314
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.181
<v Speaker 2>You should,</v>

315
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

316
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.403
<v Speaker 2>you should totally</v>

317
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.110
<v Speaker 1>no snuff to go fuck themselves.</v>

318
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.920
<v Speaker 1>The craziest thing is that modern farmer incorporate or whatever it is,</v>

319
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.940
<v Speaker 1>how scary it was.</v>

320
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered it now because I'd be scared I wouldn't go that way.</v>

321
00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:28.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going over there.</v>

322
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 1>That man we did,</v>

323
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I remember twice,</v>

324
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 1>but we only remembers twice.</v>

325
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Speaker 1>First Time scared the fuck out of you and then you're like listen,</v>

326
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I can do better.</v>

327
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why it's because one of the,</v>

328
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.620
<v Speaker 1>we used to hang out with this bridge where we would drink and under age and it</v>

329
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:47.500
<v Speaker 1>was just like everyone would go to this bridge in the middle of nowhere and</v>

330
00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 1>there was all these farms around it and that's why we'd go there cause there was</v>

331
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:50.861
<v Speaker 1>no police,</v>

332
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:52.390
<v Speaker 1>there's no one could even know you were there.</v>

333
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>You see you can have bonfires and all this shit like that sit after he got</v>

334
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.251
<v Speaker 1>wasted,</v>

335
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>everyone kind of just move,</v>

336
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 1>laid around in all the fields and one of the fields,</v>

337
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.593
<v Speaker 1>his cows,</v>

338
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 1>and it was pitch black because it was in the middle of the country.</v>

339
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>So it was just stars and you see shadows of cows and so you would like sneak up</v>

340
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>going up to these cows.</v>

341
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have cell phones for lights or anything like that.</v>

342
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So it was literally just lighters and Shit and you just go up and just push it</v>

343
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:15.151
<v Speaker 1>real fast.</v>

344
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll go and you'd just run away and it was the scariest shit ever.</v>

345
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

346
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>And you'd be stoked.</v>

347
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever find mushrooms on those cow patties?</v>

348
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>but back then you just didn't think about that.</v>

350
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't get into mushrooms too.</v>

351
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:30.264
<v Speaker 1>I was in college,</v>

352
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin went to school in Asheville,</v>

353
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina and when I went up there I understand Dunkin so much more after</v>

354
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>visiting Asheville cause it's just a hippie Mecca and they were getting,</v>

355
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.960
<v Speaker 2>there's apparently the mushroom flora or whatever it is.</v>

356
00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 2>The spores are so healthy up there because it rains a lot and there's so many of</v>

357
00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:53.371
<v Speaker 2>them that they had to start giving the cows some sort of an antifungal diet to</v>

358
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:58.360
<v Speaker 2>kill the mushrooms because so many core harvesting meanwhile probably makes the</v>

359
00:09:58.361 --> 00:09:59.051
<v Speaker 2>kids sick.</v>

360
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Cause a few mushrooms probably grow on that.</v>

361
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Some poor poisoned psilocybin when you want to talk about missing the fucking</v>

362
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:05.644
<v Speaker 2>point right.</v>

363
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Poisoning cow shit.</v>

364
00:10:08.321 --> 00:10:12.220
<v Speaker 2>So that the most beautiful thing that God ever created can't grow there.</v>

365
00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:13.450
<v Speaker 2>You fucking dummies.</v>

366
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.890
<v Speaker 2>But he said that they would constantly go there and just pluck them off and just</v>

367
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.221
<v Speaker 2>eat them.</v>

368
00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:21.610
<v Speaker 2>They were everywhere and just trip balls.</v>

369
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.860
<v Speaker 2>The whole town is so psychedelic,</v>

370
00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:25.390
<v Speaker 2>like partially because of that.</v>

371
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.850
<v Speaker 2>The whole town is like Asheville,</v>

372
00:10:27.851 --> 00:10:28.571
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina.</v>

373
00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Is it trippy fucking place?</v>

374
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I need to visit now.</v>

375
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:31.871
<v Speaker 2>You got to visit.</v>

376
00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:32.620
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

377
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.341
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>

378
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's walking around like they have a main area where like bars and</v>

379
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:39.070
<v Speaker 2>restaurants are and he would just walking around like everybody's walking around</v>

380
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:43.390
<v Speaker 2>and it's like a small town that exists in a giant world,</v>

381
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.410
<v Speaker 2>but they're modern.</v>

382
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Since I fucked up,</v>

383
00:10:46.481 --> 00:10:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have told you guys about it up.</v>

384
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.521
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to go a road.</v>

385
00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:49.354
<v Speaker 2>Asheville,</v>

386
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.020
<v Speaker 2>they the,</v>

387
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.430
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of understand Dunkin way more now after going to this town.</v>

388
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:54.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

389
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.271
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

390
00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:56.104
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

391
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.071
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

392
00:10:57.071 --> 00:11:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you were spawned in one of the most awesome environments on earth.</v>

393
00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Like this place is fucking sweet.</v>

394
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.620
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

395
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.850
<v Speaker 2>What did they call it</v>

396
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.570
<v Speaker 1>when they went out on an expedition?</v>

397
00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:06.404
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

398
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 1>do you want to go like candy harvesting?</v>

399
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

400
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.873
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of thing</v>

401
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.970
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

402
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.260
<v Speaker 1>it's so dangerous though,</v>

403
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 1>because I remember even as a kid just going up and eating berries cause I was</v>

404
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:18.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

405
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.600
<v Speaker 1>oh look berries.</v>

406
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I would just start kicking fairies.</v>

407
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

408
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.490
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

409
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 1>And then like you find out something with us kids a hundred years ago,</v>

410
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:28.220
<v Speaker 1>you would never survive.</v>

411
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you would have been dead before you were fire.</v>

412
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

413
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.550
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

414
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.640
<v Speaker 1>that honeysuckle shit like I used to eat out a lot of plant because there's</v>

415
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:38.121
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do.</v>

416
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:38.451
<v Speaker 1>So you look,</v>

417
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:39.590
<v Speaker 1>what's that purple stuff for you?</v>

418
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Pull it out.</v>

419
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Just suck on it has nothing to do.</v>

420
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:43.670
<v Speaker 1>So we just eat grass.</v>

422
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

423
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I would eat a few things.</v>

424
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.710
<v Speaker 1>You know what I found out that tastes good actually is dandy lions.</v>

425
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Like Danny Lyon,</v>

426
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Greens make salads at a Dandelion Greens.</v>

427
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Grandmother used to make</v>

428
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 2>them and I went over the house once and she had this Dandy Lion Salad.</v>

429
00:11:57.611 --> 00:11:57.971
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

430
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 2>what is that in the garden dandy lines.</v>

431
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

432
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:02.981
<v Speaker 2>it's really good for you.</v>

433
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:03.990
<v Speaker 2>It's edible to my aunt,</v>

434
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 2>my uncle telling me it was good for me.</v>

435
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I think is what convinced me,</v>

436
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 2>but then I found out that it's like a common vegetable that a lot of people eat</v>

437
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.530
<v Speaker 2>to meet.</v>

438
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.630
<v Speaker 2>T am I crazy?</v>

439
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:12.241
<v Speaker 2>You make tea out of it.</v>

440
00:12:12.241 --> 00:12:12.821
<v Speaker 2>I believe you can.</v>

441
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

442
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

443
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.651
<v Speaker 2>it's actually good.</v>

444
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Like as a salad.</v>

445
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a good tasting green and pretty fucking good for you to,</v>

446
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

447
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.763
<v Speaker 2>What's not to like,</v>

448
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how we got on sandy line business.</v>

449
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't know how we got us to the dentist.</v>

450
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 2>We've covered a lot of grants on this Yam and ECO friendly.</v>

451
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.561
<v Speaker 2>It makes the world go round.</v>

452
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 2>My friend.</v>
