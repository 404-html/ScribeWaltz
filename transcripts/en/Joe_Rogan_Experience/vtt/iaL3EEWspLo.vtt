WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can handle that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the clock's wrong.</v>

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean just subtly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subtly,</v>

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>and we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them's wrong.</v>

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Which one is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're both wrong.</v>

5
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>That's all stuff that says 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 1>One says 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.450
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 on my 12.</v>

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrong.</v>

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>This one says 12 slash 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one says 12.</v>

10
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to strap c four to this.</v>

11
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And this one I want to spike against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

12
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Are you ocd with time or with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything?</v>

13
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>With everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>like my reloading room is disgustingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and if I load the dishwasher,</v>

15
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>all the forks have to be symmetrical in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side and the spoons have to be in</v>

16
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all like all the mugs that tall</v>

17
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>ones have to be on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I.</v>

18
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that all about.</v>

19
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it came back to um,</v>

20
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>pull this sucker up to your face.</v>

21
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

22
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>when everything's the same and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's not the same,</v>

23
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easiest to see that way.</v>

24
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like counterfeiting,</v>

25
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're buying a chick in a 13 year</v>

26
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>old girl in Tiawana and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get the guy for counterfeit</v>

27
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>money and do you want to get them for</v>
<v Speaker 1>human trafficking?</v>

28
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he starts handing you crappy bills.</v>

29
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>The easiest way to spit spot the bills</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be able to see,</v>

30
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>have all of your proper bills all in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right order.</v>

31
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>So the one that's fake is going to stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

32
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

33
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would use that example when you're</v>

34
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 1>going to tijuana and someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trafficking human slavery.</v>

35
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>But that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Counterfeit money.</v>

36
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>It is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a 13 year old girl with</v>

37
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of 18 year old girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that third year old get a</v>

38
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>little bit easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it applies to everything you know.</v>

40
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And if you have like 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of,</v>

41
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>if you reload and you have a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>grain bullets and you're going to</v>

42
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>measure and then lock them all point</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

43
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>separation and grain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like one 75,</v>

44
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>75 point five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 76,</v>

45
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:59.270
<v Speaker 1>one 74 point five and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you stack them all together,</v>

46
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>the easiest way to to group them instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of measuring every single one is to look</v>

47
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>at them and just put the ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>similarly sized all together,</v>

48
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>smallest to largest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can then you can weigh them</v>

49
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>in batches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you always been like this?</v>

50
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I think so with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>My mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about with like when you were</v>

52
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>fighting your training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you like map out everything to the</v>

53
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>wrap up to the detail training notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

54
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

55
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.310
<v Speaker 1>if you watched some of our fights and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you're a cage side for almost all</v>

56
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>of mine in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd hear Greg be like okay,</v>

57
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>so that went according to plan or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

58
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go ahead and change things up a</v>

59
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>little bit because you just got your ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked,</v>

60
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'd have to adjust.</v>

61
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the more interesting corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

62
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>He's so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

63
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he enjoys it and he seems to like want</v>

64
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>you to enjoy it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

65
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That went amazing,</v>

66
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

67
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>let's get some deep breaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing fantastic.</v>

68
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In between um,</v>

69
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>rounds with Michael Bisbing as a five</v>
<v Speaker 1>round fight.</v>

70
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes in and tells me a,</v>

71
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told,</v>

72
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 2>he told me like a knock knock joke and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why the chicken crossed the road</v>

73
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>joke and I sit in there and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture of me like critically looking at</v>

74
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:07.564
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

75
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

76
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just wanted me to relax.</v>

77
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>You just want me to breathe when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing everything that's supposed to be</v>

78
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

79
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.500
<v Speaker 3>he just thought you were too tense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.230
<v Speaker 3>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

82
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a Dick playing mind games in the</v>

83
00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:27.230
<v Speaker 3>middle of the middle of a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have one minute to figure out what</v>

84
00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:31.850
<v Speaker 3>to do and what to say to a guy who just</v>
<v Speaker 3>was for five minutes.</v>

85
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Some people have a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

87
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I discussed that yesterday with big John</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big John,</v>

88
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 3>the podcast yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We fucked up and he forgot to talk about</v>

89
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:43.640
<v Speaker 3>it during the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after the podcast he explained what</v>

90
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:48.050
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says that it was the UFC cut man's</v>

91
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.860
<v Speaker 3>fault because he left a giant Glob of</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaseline on yokels.</v>

92
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to touch it because he</v>

93
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:55.700
<v Speaker 3>felt like if he touched it could open</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cut up again.</v>

94
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He called,</v>

95
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was the guys name tate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to call and get the guy to come</v>

96
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:00.740
<v Speaker 3>back in.</v>

97
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.830
<v Speaker 3>The guy wouldn't come back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the corner men tried to come in.</v>

98
00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:04.664
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

99
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.440
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to bring the cut and then back</v>

100
00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:08.180
<v Speaker 3>and then he wound up doing it by</v>
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

101
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.700
<v Speaker 3>It was the perfect storm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he fucked up.</v>

102
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.730
<v Speaker 3>He said Jojo was definitely planted it</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and he said,</v>

103
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:17.660
<v Speaker 3>but if you had to do it differently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have a made you all stand up</v>

104
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 3>and be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have made sure that fucking cut</v>

105
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:24.320
<v Speaker 3>man didn't leave the cage with that big</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glob of asset on the.</v>

106
00:04:24.321 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

107
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I was actually complaining about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

108
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.100
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

109
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.420
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was a giant issue.</v>

110
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:34.400
<v Speaker 3>It was a 32nd 32nd issue for a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was really wobbled at the end of the</v>

111
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 3>second round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

112
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 3>And my route to the title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

113
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.713
<v Speaker 3>it was a big deal.</v>

114
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.280
<v Speaker 2>It was a bummer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the perfect storm,</v>

115
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

116
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.713
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

117
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.120
<v Speaker 2>and now he's fighting for the title,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Specimen when like,</v>

123
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.800
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much going on there.</v>

124
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:02.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the years of training in that crazy Cuba</v>

125
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Olympic program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's phenomenal genetics is</v>

126
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 3>experience and competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much going on there with that</v>

127
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:09.114
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

128
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Layers and layers and layers of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>highest level of competition.</v>

129
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed in with a life that I think has</v>

130
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.820
<v Speaker 2>been very complimentary to a mindset of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an athlete,</v>

131
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

132
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has pretty much been shaped most of</v>

133
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 2>his life to be a highest level athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

134
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 2>tricky part is man whittaker is good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's very good and very young,</v>

136
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

137
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 3>whitaker you gotta remember had his knee</v>
<v Speaker 3>blown out in the first round.</v>

138
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.610
<v Speaker 3>He got his knee hyperextending tours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>MCL pretty badly in the first round and</v>

139
00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 3>still was able to stuff take downs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguably the best wrestlers ever fought</v>

140
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:51.480
<v Speaker 3>in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

141
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Pretty impressive shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great fight.</v>

142
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 3>That's a couple of weeks from now.</v>

143
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Shocker.</v>

144
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>And what's his face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fought calvin.</v>

145
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it,</v>

146
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>are you still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you still,</v>

147
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>are you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so close to the division,</v>

148
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>you're paying attention to it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just recently retired.</v>

149
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you still get itchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

150
00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:15.991
<v Speaker 1>I have a crazy competition bug but not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight.</v>

151
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a bunch of Jujitsu this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

152
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm competing in long gun smart marksman</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

153
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>a three gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

154
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you steal stuff.</v>

155
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.650
<v Speaker 1>So what is a long gun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like,</v>

156
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.830
<v Speaker 1>just like really long range but not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of different styles</v>

157
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.730
<v Speaker 1>of competitive shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>there's like guys that run around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot around barricades very quickly.</v>

159
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's kind of a slowing fire</v>

160
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>nra style where you're going standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>offhand or weird shooting positions and</v>

161
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter,</v>

162
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.090
<v Speaker 1>it just matters how far you can shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

163
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy he's into that.</v>

164
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>He's into banging steel or like a mile</v>
<v Speaker 1>away or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

165
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.633
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

166
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Crazy ballistic calculations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally calculating the curve of the</v>

167
00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:06.390
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barometric pressure and the temperature</v>

169
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 1>of your ammo to a degree plays a factor.</v>

170
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm that</v>

171
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.370
<v Speaker 1>every imaginable measurable thing plays</v>
<v Speaker 1>a factor into how the bullet is going to</v>

172
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

173
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a real touchy subject and hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a,</v>

174
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that with like really long range</v>

175
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>shots on animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question about whether or not</v>

176
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:34.200
<v Speaker 1>it's ethical and who is it ethical for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

177
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I stand on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

178
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I really love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

179
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I bounced between rifle hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting.</v>

180
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.413
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

181
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 1>as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the first time that I took a shot,</v>

182
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't 100 percent positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal wouldn't just fall over.</v>

183
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my dad scuffed me up,</v>

184
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

185
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.710
<v Speaker 1>and I was like 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there has since then been a</v>

186
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.120
<v Speaker 1>preponderance of responsibility has</v>
<v Speaker 1>always been on the hunter to without</v>

187
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.440
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

188
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.200
<v Speaker 1>the animal is going to fall right then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

189
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:12.360
<v Speaker 1>We're not stocking it for two days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not following a blood trail for nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours to see an animal.</v>

191
00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Hyperventilating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now the meat's not even good.</v>

192
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Huge adrenaline spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

193
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:23.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your meat and you're going to go</v>

194
00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

195
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.240
<v Speaker 1>so that's best case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even then animals jumped the string.</v>

196
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And how do you do that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting something that the bullet</v>

197
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:35.520
<v Speaker 1>flight is going to be up for six</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>

198
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

199
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wasn't really that long.</v>

200
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.010
<v Speaker 1>How long has it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're shooting,</v>

201
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.840
<v Speaker 1>say a thousand yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand,</v>

202
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.540
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three seconds.</v>

203
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a long time.</v>

204
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Animals can take a couple steps in three</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds for the hearts.</v>

205
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>This big size of two fists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not lot of margin of error.</v>

206
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 2>The wind changing one mile an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one mile an hour at a thousand at a</v>

207
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 2>thousand yards could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could make you miss that heart.</v>

208
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

209
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.170
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those weird sort of things</v>

210
00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:13.940
<v Speaker 5>where people are getting into it because</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a bragging rights aspect of it.</v>

211
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he shot this elk at 800 yards and you</v>

212
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.830
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people go 800 yards.</v>

213
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.810
<v Speaker 5>You tell somebody shot some of the 200</v>
<v Speaker 5>yards.</v>

214
00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:21.640
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

215
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.990
<v Speaker 5>so good shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's reasonable ethical.</v>

216
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have your crosshairs on a,</v>

217
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:29.300
<v Speaker 5>an animal's vitals at 200 yards is</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically a dead animal.</v>

218
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.380
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you get,</v>

219
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 5>you get to like six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>700,</v>

220
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.180
<v Speaker 5>like that's a tiny little spot you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>aiming at.</v>

221
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.470
<v Speaker 5>Now Shit gets wiggly.</v>

222
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

223
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.970
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a conservationist.</v>

224
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a conservationist and you</v>

225
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

226
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.700
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking in the tens of millions of</v>

227
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.080
<v Speaker 2>dollars go into conservation from</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters every single day from,</v>

228
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.180
<v Speaker 2>from hunting and the U,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s,</v>

229
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.340
<v Speaker 2>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>department of Wildlife.</v>

230
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.360
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying for the protection of habitats</v>

231
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.240
<v Speaker 2>without hunting permits because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people that are hunting are</v>

232
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:03.530
<v Speaker 2>shrinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

233
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge influx in question of</v>

234
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 2>about how moral are different styles of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

235
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.210
<v Speaker 2>what are the best and how are we going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that we protect these</v>

236
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 2>animals and protect their habitats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

237
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.833
<v Speaker 2>all the while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.570
<v Speaker 2>I was telling you about the elk I shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of the year</v>

239
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.520
<v Speaker 2>and I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a clean broadside shot at,</v>

240
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.560
<v Speaker 2>at 600 meters and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shooting a threeway totally,</v>

241
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 2>super doable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

243
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that almost in my sleep on my</v>

244
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:36.270
<v Speaker 2>home range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm shooting an animal.</v>

245
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.970
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah man,</v>

246
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just walk this guy down another</v>

247
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 2>ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So move up when I come back down.</v>

248
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my neck shot was at like 3:20,</v>

249
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one shot and he sits down.</v>

250
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.140
<v Speaker 2>So there I think the responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>always in all things should fall on the</v>

251
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:55.870
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

252
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 2>but now it's just getting all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals to actually have</v>

253
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets really stupid,</v>

254
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:04.930
<v Speaker 2>really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

255
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just people that they're not</v>

256
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:09.110
<v Speaker 2>good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

257
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't raised well.</v>

258
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people in,</v>

259
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in moments.</v>

260
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean when you say that?</v>

261
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Like my mom and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we argue about this a lot.</v>

262
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Like she thinks people are inherently</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

263
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like when you've seen so much of</v>

264
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 2>the bad for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

265
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm gonna have a catalyst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

266
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna have the most objective</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

267
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to think people are good.</v>

268
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 2>But like I think hunters and jet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just use that as.</v>

269
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

270
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Have 100 hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What percentage are going to do the</v>

271
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 2>right thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are going to do the moral thing,</v>

272
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:49.890
<v Speaker 2>the ethical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's the best interest for</v>

273
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 2>the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for conservation,</v>

274
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 2>for nature out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of 100.</v>

275
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're on a hunt,</v>

276
00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:58.550
<v Speaker 2>did they say</v>

277
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:03.290
<v Speaker 5>for sure the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now it gets down to guesswork as to</v>

278
00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:05.720
<v Speaker 5>what the numbers are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I like 60 percent.</v>

279
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 5>I'd say more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

280
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.890
<v Speaker 5>I would like to think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to think it's in the seventies or</v>

281
00:12:09.891 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 5>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish it was 100 for sure.</v>

282
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:13.470
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't wish anything other than that.</v>

283
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:17.360
<v Speaker 5>It was just a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's gonna be people that poach.</v>

284
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.730
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be people that cross</v>
<v Speaker 5>property boundaries when they know</v>

285
00:12:19.731 --> 00:12:22.100
<v Speaker 5>they're not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be people that shoot an</v>

286
00:12:22.101 --> 00:12:26.750
<v Speaker 5>animal when the season opens tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 5>morning and they get there a day early</v>

287
00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:28.100
<v Speaker 5>and they see an animal and they just</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

288
00:12:28.101 --> 00:12:29.540
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to shoot it and hang it</v>

289
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:33.310
<v Speaker 5>and say I shot at the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like gray area stuff where</v>

290
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.120
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're definitely doing something</v>

291
00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.070
<v Speaker 5>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's still haunting.</v>

292
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.990
<v Speaker 5>You still have a tag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

293
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.290
<v Speaker 5>and it still people bending the rules</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when.</v>

294
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.850
<v Speaker 5>And then there's people that just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

295
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.270
<v Speaker 5>they'll shoot two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three animals and the only supposed to</v>

296
00:12:47.271 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 5>shoot one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll hide the meat.</v>

297
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

298
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.480
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always going to be people like</v>

299
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Assholes.</v>

300
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>selfish.</v>

301
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's always going to be people like</v>

302
00:12:58.341 --> 00:12:59.360
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunately.</v>

303
00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:04.361
<v Speaker 5>And the thing about hunting is it so</v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial in a world where 95 to 97,</v>

304
00:13:05.181 --> 00:13:07.160
<v Speaker 5>depending on who you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of the people who eat meat,</v>

305
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 5>it's still very controversial to go out</v>
<v Speaker 5>and kill yourself.</v>

306
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.060
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

307
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I still can't understand this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

308
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 2>in addition to people being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe moral or immoral or most are good</v>
<v Speaker 2>or bad.</v>

310
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

311
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.300
<v Speaker 2>the contradiction of people not even</v>
<v Speaker 2>using their brains,</v>

312
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

313
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the best Tacos I've ever had in my</v>

314
00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:36.140
<v Speaker 2>life last week and it have to getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>waterboarded right?</v>

315
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.053
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

316
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they tasted extra sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had a bunch of friends over.</v>

317
00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:45.521
<v Speaker 2>We had some wine from right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right next door to where my parents,</v>

318
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.650
<v Speaker 2>like where I grew up and that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

319
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:53.390
<v Speaker 2>the elk we're cooking meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it for a day as I walked this</v>

320
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:55.400
<v Speaker 2>thing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it most beautiful majestic</v>

321
00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:58.290
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like I said I was 600,</v>

322
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 2>moved into unjust under three or right</v>
<v Speaker 2>at three.</v>

323
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.140
<v Speaker 2>And so I got to see it in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to see it at its death.</v>

324
00:14:06.141 --> 00:14:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I got to see after death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:09.200
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

326
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I have the whole entire trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

327
00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:12.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just like you.</v>

328
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.270
<v Speaker 2>But I have two freezers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a garnered six,</v>

329
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:22.271
<v Speaker 2>almost 600 cumulative pounds from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hide the head and the meat for just shy</v>

330
00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:28.760
<v Speaker 2>of 400 pounds of meat off that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have two freezers full of meat,</v>

331
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big animal.</v>

332
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a big end of delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

333
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.040
<v Speaker 5>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the best for you too.</v>

334
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.350
<v Speaker 5>It just feels different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So good in your mouth.</v>

335
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.350
<v Speaker 5>It's the best for you and your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

336
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.850
<v Speaker 5>That's best for your body to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it charges me up.</v>

337
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I want to fight velociraptors after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as like,</v>

338
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to Columbia to where the</v>

339
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:50.840
<v Speaker 2>good stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steal some of the good,</v>

340
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>like the old</v>

341
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar style coke and then bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>that back to wherever I am.</v>

342
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what good elk tastes like in your mouth.</v>

343
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 1>I've never done good coke or bad coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've never done any coke,</v>

344
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but judging from the amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Pablo Escobar made and the way that</v>

345
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:11.350
<v Speaker 1>people talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

346
00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 1>and how rich means delays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty good stuff.</v>

347
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just,</v>

348
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:17.700
<v Speaker 1>use is definitely a high demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

349
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.210
<v Speaker 1>So this is the contrast of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction would be like people who</v>

350
00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 1>are animal rights lovers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like you just talked about this</v>

351
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 1>majestic animal that you watched and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>admired and then you shot it and killed</v>

352
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.920
<v Speaker 1>God is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that.</v>

354
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still love it.</v>

355
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 1>I love every single ounce of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and I,</v>

356
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for people that are,</v>

357
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe animal rights activists or many of</v>

358
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:45.551
<v Speaker 1>them have ever been to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I'm dogging on the cattle</v>

359
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 1>industry because I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they try to do the best that</v>

360
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 1>they can with what they have to produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough food to feed a huge ever growing</v>

361
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

362
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a hard thing.</v>

363
00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been to one of those farms.</v>

364
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

365
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the good ones and I've been</v>

366
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:03.810
<v Speaker 1>the bad ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I know how my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my animal died and it died fast,</v>

368
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 1>peacefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Where it loved being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm never felt anything.</v>

370
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Never saw anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just crumbled.</v>

371
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also the balance of life to</v>

372
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

373
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to bring wolves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions into Texas and to</v>

374
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:25.640
<v Speaker 1>wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:16:25.641 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tried that,</v>

376
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 1>that's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not working.</v>

377
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought the wolves and now they're</v>

378
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 1>looking to hundreds like me to come into</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance the wolves because the wolves</v>

379
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 1>are decimating the herds a to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a degree that they've never seen</v>

380
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:40.184
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's,</v>

381
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.060
<v Speaker 1>there's no balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to balance the wolves.</v>

382
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>So what was the amount of available food</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

383
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Now the wolves are just killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

384
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So even yellowstone and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

385
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we bring in some pro hunters to try</v>

386
00:16:53.811 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 1>and balance this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They docked on the herd in yellowstone</v>

387
00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:58.390
<v Speaker 1>by 90 percent at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

388
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 1>90 percent this from the wolves they</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought in the nineties.</v>

389
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.950
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

390
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.520
<v Speaker 1>well we lost the wolves from the sixties</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the eighties,</v>

391
00:17:06.521 --> 00:17:09.350
<v Speaker 1>so let's bring back some wolves in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties and think that we can balance</v>

392
00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:13.430
<v Speaker 1>things and while it paid a positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect for about 10 years,</v>

393
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>then 20 2010 rolls around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

394
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

395
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>They're killing entire hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we might lose all indigenous elk</v>

396
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 1>here if we don't do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

397
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now they're bringing in guys like me</v>

398
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 1>to dark them and retry and relocate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bring whatever.</v>

399
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea behind it was so crazy.</v>

400
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>They went and got these giant Canadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray wolves and brought them over here</v>

401
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.440
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a place where the animals had,</v>

402
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had no knowledge of walls.</v>

403
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 1>They had wiped out the wolf population</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the size of the wolf is bigger than</v>

404
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 1>what was originally here.</v>

405
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 2>So naturally the amount of calories</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

406
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 2>that wolf needed was greater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

407
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.840
<v Speaker 2>and with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a hundred years of lack of</v>

408
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 2>evolution for the animals that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>there to know what to do.</v>

409
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just fish in a barrel for these</v>

410
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 5>wolves that had adapting though they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>adapting,</v>

411
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 5>adapting quick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're still getting jacked.</v>

412
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 5>The part of the problem is people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

413
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 5>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're killing the weak animals,</v>

414
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.850
<v Speaker 5>but they're not the weak ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go down into the farm lands you're</v>

415
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 5>getting like the the cows and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>calves,</v>

416
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 5>the smaller elk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the female and the babies.</v>

417
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 5>They're moving into farmlands and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>big males when they're not running,</v>

418
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 5>they stay up in the mountains and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>use usually formed these like bachelor</v>

419
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.390
<v Speaker 5>records and when they're not running and</v>
<v Speaker 5>when this is happening,</v>

420
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.020
<v Speaker 5>that's where the wolves are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the wolves are killing me.</v>

421
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.770
<v Speaker 5>I have friends that live in Idaho and</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends that live in Montana and they're</v>

422
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

423
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 5>Like there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of fucking wolves killing</v>

424
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 5>giant elk.</v>

425
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I've been failing in communicating what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now we,</v>

426
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.120
<v Speaker 2>we agree with each other and we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're almost echoing the same sediments.</v>

427
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 2>So that person that doesn't agree with</v>
<v Speaker 2>us that,</v>

428
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Vegetarian Vegan,</v>

429
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conservationist that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks at us.</v>

430
00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:06.181
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

431
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:06.991
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are hunters.</v>

432
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:10.140
<v Speaker 2>You can't be conservationist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does the conversation start?</v>

433
00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:15.141
<v Speaker 2>Where's the middle ground where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>find one where an opportunity to build</v>

434
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 2>rapport and to have a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a discussion,</v>

435
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:22.971
<v Speaker 2>to have maybe even a debate where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can intellectually talk through your</v>

436
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:28.850
<v Speaker 2>different perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been failing at this miserably of</v>

437
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:31.330
<v Speaker 2>late and I've been getting a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

438
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.360
<v Speaker 2>it's weird when my social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a lot of conservative</v>

439
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.990
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

440
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.620
<v Speaker 2>pro second amendment types that follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>me when that whole entire base is mad at</v>

441
00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:44.510
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is weird.</v>

442
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.810
<v Speaker 2>And then on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the far left progressive side is looking</v>

443
00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.290
<v Speaker 2>at me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

444
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:53.140
<v Speaker 2>we hate you too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

445
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I have now pissed off 95 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on social media because I'm</v>

446
00:19:57.651 --> 00:19:59.600
<v Speaker 2>trying to find middle ground so we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

447
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Have you pissed off the conservatives?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you done that?</v>

448
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Lance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong and I were talking about</v>

449
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.430
<v Speaker 2>gun control after the parklands shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Florida and he asked me,</v>

450
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.330
<v Speaker 2>do you think gun control is a solution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

451
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.760
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gun control can be a massive</v>

452
00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:21.800
<v Speaker 2>solution verbatim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I said.</v>

453
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.103
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

454
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.070
<v Speaker 2>gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were words.</v>

455
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Words like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well regulated militia.</v>

456
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.500
<v Speaker 2>The words in the constitution that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's almost synonymous to me.</v>

457
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Gun Laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also a form of gun control,</v>

458
00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:36.860
<v Speaker 2>just like a well regulated militia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that having good,</v>

459
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.990
<v Speaker 2>safe gun laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save lives.</v>

460
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have a felon and Ms. 13</v>

461
00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:43.670
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an illegal immigrant.</v>

462
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Somebody that's been dishonorably</v>
<v Speaker 2>discharged from the military to get</v>

463
00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 2>their hands on a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have laws.</v>

464
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Those are forms of gun control in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

465
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.440
<v Speaker 2>But the Conservatives Second Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you use the words gun control,</v>

466
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

467
00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I was immediately called Benedict</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arnold.</v>

468
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm a trader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>

469
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.140
<v Speaker 2>a duff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what a duff is.</v>

470
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.610
<v Speaker 2>That was a reoccurring one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the guy from.</v>

471
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:10.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger Rabbit,</v>

472
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 2>the guy that would hunt around with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun,</v>

473
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't know how to use the gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he always missed Roger Rabbit.</v>

474
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean bugs bunny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

475
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bugs bunny step.</v>

476
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Elmer Fudd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

477
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 2>that's where they called fid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I all,</v>

478
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean hundreds of people and I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

479
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to have a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong,</v>

480
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 2>a guy that had never shot a gun at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time that was against private private</v>

481
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 2>citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really owning guns and he couldn't be</v>

482
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:42.850
<v Speaker 2>more for gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wonder just to talk to him and so</v>

483
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I had no problem using his vernacular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using,</v>

484
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words that he's comfortable with,</v>

485
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 2>like gun control even though to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just gun laws,</v>

486
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>that's well regulated.</v>

487
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Militia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a huge second member</v>

488
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 2>proponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody has ever</v>

489
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Speaker 2>questioned that until this moment when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they just pay attention to you for</v>

490
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 2>five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they have dudes is go to your social</v>

491
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 2>media and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not an anti gun guy.</v>

492
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 2>No guys on the range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many days a week?</v>

493
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five.</v>

494
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.233
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

495
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 2>like I'm mad that I'm here with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on the range,</v>

496
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said I'll make it up tomorrow.</v>

497
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

498
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.300
<v Speaker 2>you're a gun nut for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

499
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 2>It's an occupational thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

500
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

501
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do know.</v>

502
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.000
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be excellent at your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be a good.</v>

503
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

504
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in that conversation I disavowed</v>

505
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 2>apparently my huge group of Second</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amendment loving people.</v>

506
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 5>I have a theory on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of people that</v>

507
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.590
<v Speaker 5>just looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get pissed off and if you say any word</v>

508
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.860
<v Speaker 5>that they decide is a hot button word</v>
<v Speaker 5>like gun control,</v>

509
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:48.780
<v Speaker 5>they don't care if you've thought it out</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have a rational perspective on</v>

510
00:22:48.781 --> 00:22:52.980
<v Speaker 5>what you consider gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there was a statement that was</v>

511
00:22:52.981 --> 00:22:57.981
<v Speaker 5>released by a group of hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunters for gun control and they had a</v>

512
00:22:58.801 --> 00:23:03.801
<v Speaker 5>bunch of reasonable reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't have a firearm that could get</v>

513
00:23:04.621 --> 00:23:07.140
<v Speaker 5>a firearm currently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it all made sense,</v>

514
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.320
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the response to that,</v>

515
00:23:10.321 --> 00:23:13.380
<v Speaker 5>the backlash of it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not debate.</v>

516
00:23:13.381 --> 00:23:16.770
<v Speaker 5>It's like people on that side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pro second amendment side,</v>

517
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.870
<v Speaker 5>they're so terrified of any new</v>
<v Speaker 5>regulation and they think that you have</v>

518
00:23:21.871 --> 00:23:26.550
<v Speaker 5>to hold your ground because any slipping</v>
<v Speaker 5>backwards is going to eventually lead to</v>

519
00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:27.660
<v Speaker 5>someone taking your guns away.</v>

520
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

521
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I do understand the death by a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuts,</v>

522
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

523
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that has always been the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

524
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at,</v>

525
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.980
<v Speaker 2>it's not like Adolf Hitler said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

526
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:40.140
<v Speaker 2>we're going to kill all the blacks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Jews overnight.</v>

527
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 2>That's not what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

528
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.620
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was over the course of seven,</v>

529
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 2>eight years where he just very</v>
<v Speaker 2>incrementally</v>

530
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 1>change laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

531
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 1>They're not allowed to shop here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

532
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 1>They're not allowed to go here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

533
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Now we're gonna move them all into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same area and very slowly,</v>

534
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 1>not slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a matter of five,</v>

535
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:55.940
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years,</v>

536
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 1>he started a genocide of an entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity.</v>

537
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's that fear.</v>

538
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.140
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be,</v>

539
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be incremental and we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at some point we're going to turn</v>

540
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 1>around and look and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all of this freedom that we've</v>

541
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.600
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same with during,</v>

542
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.460
<v Speaker 1>right after nine slash 11 when George</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush,</v>

543
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

544
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the Freedom Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

545
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.720
<v Speaker 1>or the Patriot Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Patriot Act,</v>

546
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that was one of the largest losses</v>

547
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:25.790
<v Speaker 1>of privacy that Americans have ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever experienced.</v>

548
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:28.940
<v Speaker 1>But we were fearful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were scared and you know,</v>

549
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love dangerous freedom,</v>

550
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>but overnight we lost a ton of that.</v>

551
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not incrementally just overnight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

552
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.390
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most efficient way is to take it</v>

553
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 1>bit by bit by bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get that.</v>

554
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for Christ sakes,</v>

555
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:44.420
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

556
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you can't find somebody that's more of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>proponent of the second one than me,</v>

557
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.790
<v Speaker 1>except apparently on that day when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed off.</v>

558
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to figure out how to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conversation.</v>

559
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that there are any more of</v>

560
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:56.810
<v Speaker 1>a second amendment proponents than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

561
00:24:56.811 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I just think they're ideologically so</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid in this idea that you can't change</v>

562
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:03.720
<v Speaker 1>gun laws at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that someone who's on</v>

563
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 1>anti psychotic medication and when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>bouts of schizophrenia,</v>

564
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you think that person should be allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have guns.</v>

565
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.620
<v Speaker 1>When they hear voices that aren't real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

566
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see things that aren't really there</v>

567
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 1>had been reported to the FBI a handful</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>

568
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.650
<v Speaker 1>The sheriff knows about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

569
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 1>the principal knows about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pro.</v>

570
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously the problem with that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can decide to report Tim</v>

571
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make up some story.</v>

572
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy's been acting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy's doing these.</v>

573
00:25:27.711 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Sandy's going to kill my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy's doing this.</v>

574
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone just decides to actively</v>

575
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>target you in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can sort of frame you as some sort</v>

576
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 1>of a crazy person and then use that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excuse to go after guns.</v>

577
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is what people are terrified</v>
<v Speaker 1>of and that is possible.</v>

578
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It is been an objective and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>due process on the back side.</v>

579
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody was wrongfully put on a</v>

580
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 1>list or you would not be allowed to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gun,</v>

581
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 1>how do you get off that list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

582
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.060
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

583
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.921
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

584
00:25:57.921 --> 00:26:00.080
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that spends quite a bit of time.</v>

585
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.710
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting gun laws and protecting gun</v>

586
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to get off that</v>

587
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

588
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 1>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably don't ever get off.</v>

589
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like the no fly list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just not a way to not get off</v>

590
00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:13.070
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the fuck ever gets back on the</v>

591
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:16.040
<v Speaker 1>flight and I know you were off the list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're back on.</v>

592
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Come on back southwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>

593
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Sitting near the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

594
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Can I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My beverage service and peanut please.</v>

595
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's things where there's a left side</v>

596
00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and a right side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say something that the left</v>

597
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 1>believes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a trader and if you see if you're</v>

598
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of say something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right beliefs and you're a trader.</v>

599
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:34.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation has to happen in the</v>

600
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:34.821
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

601
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Does that how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

602
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.480
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you live?</v>

603
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Conversation with animals has to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle.</v>

604
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 1>When you talk you about the consumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>of animals.</v>

605
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 1>You have the hardcore animal rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>activists who don't want anything to</v>

606
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do they feel about wolves eating</v>

607
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 1>elk asshole first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tear him apart.</v>

608
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Many of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay with that.</v>

609
00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you okay with natural probation?</v>

610
00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 1>You are just not okay with humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>predating.</v>

611
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:58.510
<v Speaker 1>So how do you want to balance out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population of say,</v>

612
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 1>wild pigs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you.</v>

613
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 1>What's your proposal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have one.</v>

614
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You mean there's not enough resources in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to go out and trap them and if</v>

615
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you did trap them when you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them.</v>

616
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.610
<v Speaker 1>You got to fix them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to give him vasectomies.</v>

617
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So we tried to give him to the homeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the homeless were eating them in</v>

618
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

619
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not eat wild pig?</v>

620
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delicious Texas wild pigs.</v>

621
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it funky?</v>

622
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.600
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really isn't how you just.</v>

623
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 1>How you take care of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to take care of it.</v>

624
00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:28.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is as these are swamp</v>
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

625
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

626
00:27:29.071 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rough.</v>

627
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Pretty nasty things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a period of time where we</v>

628
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 1>could go and during the eradication</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to curb the ever growing</v>

629
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.180
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

630
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:43.370
<v Speaker 1>if you shot x number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could bring maybe a fat Sao in and</v>

631
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 1>to the food shelter and they'd have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>butcher and then they tried to serve it</v>

632
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:47.670
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

633
00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 1>nobody was eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we tried that for about six</v>

634
00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:52.620
<v Speaker 1>months and then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>

635
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 1>We're just wasting money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to is just so goofy,</v>

636
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.650
<v Speaker 1>goofy world we live in where people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are starving or picky,</v>

637
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 1>picky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that wild pig.</v>

638
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in their defense maybe he's just</v>

639
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:06.690
<v Speaker 1>really poorly handled and by the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get it it's tainted.</v>

640
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It smells bad and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

641
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody fucked it up along the way.</v>

642
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 1>They don't treat wild pigs in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you would treat like a deer that</v>

643
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hunted down,</v>

644
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.790
<v Speaker 1>took a long time to track and you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

645
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into perfect position and you</v>

646
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 1>cherish that meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild pigs are shooting them out of</v>

647
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:26.080
<v Speaker 1>helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

648
00:28:26.081 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've seen those Ted nugent</v>

649
00:28:27.481 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

650
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I do it if you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

651
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Hello hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

652
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 1>there'll be farmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a farm in,</v>

653
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.140
<v Speaker 1>let's say central Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>north of Austin,</v>

654
00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:41.700
<v Speaker 1>south of Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're losing 10 to 15 percent of their</v>

655
00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>agriculture every single year to wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs and millions of dollars.</v>

656
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a $10,000,000 ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're losing one and a half million</v>

657
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.660
<v Speaker 1>dollars to wild pigs.</v>

658
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

659
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And there's not a lot of profit in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

660
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.790
<v Speaker 1>in being a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one and a half million dollars is a</v>

661
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:03.090
<v Speaker 1>lot of money to these guys and not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the flip side,</v>

662
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:07.230
<v Speaker 1>you have a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using hunters,</v>

663
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.290
<v Speaker 1>guys that are coming to because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport fun.</v>

664
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much fair game here.</v>

665
00:29:13.381 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 1>There's not stocking these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's thermals,</v>

666
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 1>it's white lights off jeeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's any way you can imagine to try to</v>

667
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Speaker 1>kill these things and we're not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a dent in how fast these things</v>

668
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:25.340
<v Speaker 1>are breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

669
00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

670
00:29:26.211 --> 00:29:30.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sow can have at the age of one.</v>

671
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.790
<v Speaker 1>It could start having three or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>litters a year.</v>

672
00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:34.250
<v Speaker 1>We get six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

673
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they can start breeding at six</v>

674
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:40.410
<v Speaker 1>months and they're having multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>litters a year and each litter can have</v>

675
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:41.770
<v Speaker 1>six to pigs.</v>

676
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're done.</v>

677
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.540
<v Speaker 3>If there's zombies where it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

678
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were predators,</v>

679
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if these things were like wolves</v>

680
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 3>spread like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

681
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I bet you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

682
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 3>You'll know how tim goes to sleep at</v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

683
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 3>You just nailed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

684
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.260
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

685
00:29:57.261 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 3>could you imagine if wolves were doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

686
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.540
<v Speaker 3>If there were that many wolves and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were just roaming through the</v>

687
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 3>countryside packs of a thousand dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>of erection now.</v>

688
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

689
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Curb it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull it back,</v>

690
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:07.910
<v Speaker 3>pull back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use your mind.</v>

691
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

692
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that conversation is the conversation</v>

693
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:14.650
<v Speaker 3>where the vegans run into an ideological</v>
<v Speaker 3>wall,</v>

694
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 3>like what do you would you say about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

695
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 3>You want to just let live and let be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

696
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:21.160
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to have any vegan food</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they eat vegan food.</v>

697
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna have any food.</v>

698
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 3>The pigs are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat All your food unless you're growing</v>

699
00:30:25.121 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 3>your own food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then what are you going to do with</v>

700
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:28.860
<v Speaker 3>the pigs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Break your fences and eat your food.</v>

701
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any food left or they</v>
<v Speaker 3>break your fences.</v>

702
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 3>They do break your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Break your everything.</v>

703
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.020
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are big and they're powerful</v>

704
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 3>creatures and they decimate ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>nesting birds.</v>

705
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Anything that's small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

706
00:30:40.191 --> 00:30:42.340
<v Speaker 3>there's some videos that we have from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

707
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Have A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big boar running away with an access</v>

708
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 3>to your font and it's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

709
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.290
<v Speaker 3>they eat everything they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's their,</v>

710
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.290
<v Speaker 3>they're monsters and they're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Filling or know about Texas ones.</v>

711
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll never had eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>

712
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.670
<v Speaker 3>I've eaten a couple of California ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were fantastic.</v>

713
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad,</v>

714
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in Monterey County.</v>

715
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.523
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

716
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.530
<v Speaker 3>he has his pig trough pig pond and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a herd of pigs that come every</v>

717
00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:08.740
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

718
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.930
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

719
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a visceral response for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me to watch my dad drive down in his</v>

720
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 3>four wheeler and feed these things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

721
00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.400
<v Speaker 3>oh no god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does he feed him?</v>

722
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Because he loves them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He elk come through there,</v>

723
00:31:21.521 --> 00:31:23.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he has truly lt got wonder since</v>

724
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.390
<v Speaker 3>his property and so he has a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these wild pigs and so he and his,</v>

725
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.830
<v Speaker 3>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sit on the porch and they watched</v>

726
00:31:29.831 --> 00:31:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the wild animals and deer and it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cool,</v>

727
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.280
<v Speaker 3>super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then like the texting and he's like,</v>

728
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to just get rid of all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

729
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.280
<v Speaker 3>They're bombing nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Missouri has an interesting take on it.</v>

730
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.460
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making hunting them illegal and</v>

731
00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:48.280
<v Speaker 3>the reason why they're making hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>them illegal is because people are</v>

732
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:52.210
<v Speaker 3>bringing them into areas and releasing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in public land so that they can</v>

733
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 3>hunt these wild pigs and the recognizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

734
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:58.660
<v Speaker 3>So what they've done to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to curb the desire for people to do that</v>

735
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:59.800
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

736
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 3>they're trapping them instead of running</v>
<v Speaker 3>down down with dogs or shooting them and</v>

737
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:05.840
<v Speaker 3>they find by trapping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

738
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>there's a great podcast that Steve</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rinella,</v>

739
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:10.480
<v Speaker 3>he has the mediator podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great podcast,</v>

740
00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:15.481
<v Speaker 3>but he had a guy who is a wild pick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild pig eradication expert from</v>

741
00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He works for the Department of fish and</v>

742
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 3>wildlife down there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a,</v>

743
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess they call it fishing game down</v>
<v Speaker 3>there for California,</v>

744
00:32:24.321 --> 00:32:26.130
<v Speaker 3>they call it fish and wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

745
00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:27.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've used these traps.</v>

746
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can get as many as 63 pigs at a</v>

747
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 3>time and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we tried to shoot 63 pigs,</v>

748
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:37.480
<v Speaker 3>it would take forever to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're using these large scale</v>

749
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 3>traps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>catching these and</v>

750
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just killing them and the way</v>

751
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 5>they're doing their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

752
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 5>get a lot of backlash from hunters</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the hunters like,</v>

753
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.510
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't you just let us hunt them to</v>

754
00:32:47.511 --> 00:32:50.000
<v Speaker 5>say no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to get rid of all of them.</v>

755
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 5>These are a dangerous invasive species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys want to keep something around</v>

756
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:55.160
<v Speaker 5>for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're not going to manage the</v>

757
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:56.810
<v Speaker 5>population correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really can't.</v>

758
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:57.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're just,</v>

759
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.170
<v Speaker 5>they're on an eradication bend down</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

760
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to see how that works.</v>

761
00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 5>They're apparently doing a really good</v>
<v Speaker 5>job in keeping them from spreading into</v>

762
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 5>new areas of public land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they'll get a notification,</v>

763
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:10.610
<v Speaker 5>someone will say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

764
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 5>we saw sow and two baby piglets in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>one area,</v>

765
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:18.710
<v Speaker 5>and they will just go there immediately</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just track those things down and try</v>

766
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 5>to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The areas where populations are clearly</v>

767
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:23.300
<v Speaker 5>established that trying to get them from</v>
<v Speaker 5>spreading.</v>

768
00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

769
00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.500
<v Speaker 2>it's huge industry too though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

770
00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean hunting in general,</v>

771
00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.780
<v Speaker 2>we're talking billions and billions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars and you know,</v>

772
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:34.290
<v Speaker 2>whether your trophy hunting in in Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your,</v>

773
00:33:34.291 --> 00:33:37.860
<v Speaker 2>your pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few hundred thousand dollars for water</v>

774
00:33:37.861 --> 00:33:40.200
<v Speaker 2>buffalo or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going in,</v>

775
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just getting some</v>

776
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 2>blessed balk or an impala and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>still paying $10,000.</v>

777
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 2>The flight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the donating the food to the village,</v>

778
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:52.040
<v Speaker 2>the trophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trophy fee,</v>

779
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 2>the processing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the shipping.</v>

780
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:57.680
<v Speaker 2>And we're the gun itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ammo pain for the Pah,</v>

781
00:33:57.681 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 2>pain for the guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain for the tracker,</v>

782
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.280
<v Speaker 2>that that's all real real money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on even on the local American</v>

783
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.140
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer hunting,</v>

784
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.210
<v Speaker 2>elk hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pig hunting,</v>

785
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.840
<v Speaker 2>still billion dollar industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

786
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:20.620
<v Speaker 2>that money directly goes back to habitat</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection conservation.</v>

787
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

788
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.780
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in like incremental percentages,</v>

789
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.980
<v Speaker 2>massive portions of that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

790
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:26.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a Sigmund</v>

791
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:27.780
<v Speaker 5>Robert's act,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

792
00:34:27.781 --> 00:34:28.710
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it?</v>

793
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:31.350
<v Speaker 5>Eleven percent Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if you could find that they,</v>

794
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:34.050
<v Speaker 5>I think they established that in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>thirties and this was uh,</v>

795
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.120
<v Speaker 5>in response to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

796
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:41.150
<v Speaker 5>what Teddy Roosevelt did when they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to keep large swaths of public</v>

797
00:34:42.031 --> 00:34:46.900
<v Speaker 5>land available for people to recreate on</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then try to bring back populations</v>

798
00:34:46.901 --> 00:34:51.060
<v Speaker 5>of these animals that needed funds to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>that because market hunting,</v>

799
00:34:51.061 --> 00:34:54.660
<v Speaker 5>people think it was like just hunters</v>
<v Speaker 5>have decimated the population sort of,</v>

800
00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.990
<v Speaker 5>but market hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was hunting wild animals for people</v>

801
00:34:57.991 --> 00:34:59.250
<v Speaker 5>to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is now illegal.</v>

802
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.910
<v Speaker 5>You can't just go shoot a bunch of deer</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then sell it to people.</v>

803
00:35:02.911 --> 00:35:04.830
<v Speaker 5>It's illegal and one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's illegals,</v>

804
00:35:04.831 --> 00:35:07.680
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to stop market hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they take all this money,</v>

805
00:35:07.681 --> 00:35:10.470
<v Speaker 5>which I believe is 11 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it 11 percent?</v>

806
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.410
<v Speaker 5>Eleven percent of all the money from</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting supplies,</v>

807
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.610
<v Speaker 5>gear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guns,</v>

808
00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:15.360
<v Speaker 5>all that shit.</v>

809
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:20.190
<v Speaker 5>All of it goes towards conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That turns out to be billions and</v>

810
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.023
<v Speaker 5>billions of dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

811
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.850
<v Speaker 5>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what keeps the protection.</v>

812
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.460
<v Speaker 5>Here it goes right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

813
00:35:26.461 --> 00:35:28.590
<v Speaker 5>The ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>early 19 hundreds marine wildlife</v>

814
00:35:28.591 --> 00:35:32.490
<v Speaker 5>species are disappearing or declining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The firearms and ammunition industry</v>

815
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.120
<v Speaker 5>asked Congress to impose an excise tax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

816
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 5>that is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They asked to impose this tax on the</v>

817
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 5>sale of firearms and ammunition to help</v>
<v Speaker 5>fund wildlife conservation in the United</v>

818
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Pittman Robertson Act passed in 1937</v>

819
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 5>known as the federal aid and wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 5>restoration.</v>

820
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:53.820
<v Speaker 5>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is how wetlands get preserved.</v>

821
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 5>Wildlife Habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like a traveling corridors for mule</v>

822
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 5>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How they keep them from getting</v>

823
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 5>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that stuff is through conservation</v>

824
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 5>money that comes from hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The difference between the amount of</v>

825
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 5>money that comes from hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 5>conservation acts that gets donated to</v>

826
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:13.140
<v Speaker 5>preserve wildlife versus animal rights</v>
<v Speaker 5>groups is so stunning.</v>

827
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 5>You can't even count.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

828
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.520
<v Speaker 5>there's like not even pennies on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>dollar,</v>

829
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they don't donate.</v>

830
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people donate a few dollars here or</v>

831
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:21.950
<v Speaker 5>there to things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

832
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.290
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of the money comes</v>
<v Speaker 5>from hunters,</v>

833
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 5>which creates this really confusing</v>
<v Speaker 5>place for a lot of people.</v>

834
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 5>That's the middle ground killing</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

835
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.330
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's ended up being like the middle</v>

836
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 5>ground conversation that nobody will</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually have the conversation about</v>

837
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 5>Africa to right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That those animals,</v>

838
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 5>when you let people hunt them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're worth a lot more than if you</v>

839
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:45.770
<v Speaker 5>just let the poachers come in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>protect them.</v>

840
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.630
<v Speaker 5>But the moment that the hunters go away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they disappear.</v>

841
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.840
<v Speaker 5>But the animal rights activists and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegans were like us to move past that</v>

842
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 5>and get to the point where we don't kill</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals at all.</v>

843
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.000
<v Speaker 5>And if you eat animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get it from a lab.</v>

844
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 5>It's not impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's go to Africa,</v>

845
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking hot in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably impossible unless some</v>

846
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.000
<v Speaker 5>massive evolution happens with</v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness and people just stop being</v>

847
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:09.610
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

848
00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Limpopo,</v>

849
00:37:11.531 --> 00:37:14.710
<v Speaker 2>which is north of South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on the Botswana border,</v>

850
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kinda like gave this world of</v>

851
00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:22.000
<v Speaker 2>trying to 90 percent of the exact right</v>
<v Speaker 2>location,</v>

852
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

853
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.770
<v Speaker 2>they outlawed the hunting of some</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific wild game and the farmers that</v>

854
00:37:29.201 --> 00:37:31.720
<v Speaker 2>have had them just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

855
00:37:31.721 --> 00:37:33.700
<v Speaker 2>we're just gonna we're just going to let</v>
<v Speaker 2>them go because you're not worth</v>

856
00:37:33.701 --> 00:37:38.380
<v Speaker 2>anything to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of their animals disappeared in a</v>

857
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.310
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poached.</v>

858
00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.840
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a year.</v>

859
00:37:40.841 --> 00:37:43.750
<v Speaker 2>One year all of them were gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just disappeared.</v>

860
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the intent was,</v>

861
00:37:45.251 --> 00:37:46.120
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

862
00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:50.620
<v Speaker 2>these are nearing endangered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're gonna allow people to Hump</v>

863
00:37:50.621 --> 00:37:51.520
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

864
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:56.110
<v Speaker 2>and then they went from endangered to</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost endangered to absolutely</v>

865
00:37:56.111 --> 00:38:00.550
<v Speaker 2>endangered the critically because nobody</v>
<v Speaker 2>was protecting them because there are no</v>

866
00:38:00.551 --> 00:38:02.080
<v Speaker 2>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one too did</v>

867
00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:02.923
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

868
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.080
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard for people to wrap their head</v>

869
00:38:05.081 --> 00:38:08.230
<v Speaker 5>around because it's so messy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a clean issue.</v>

870
00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:11.350
<v Speaker 5>It's so messy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you see some fat slob holding his</v>

871
00:38:11.351 --> 00:38:16.351
<v Speaker 5>rifle over a lion and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no way in nature this fat fuck</v>

872
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.570
<v Speaker 5>should be able to shoot that lion and</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

873
00:38:19.571 --> 00:38:21.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and mounted on his wall.</v>

874
00:38:21.011 --> 00:38:23.110
<v Speaker 5>There's a photo that I got off the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet of a guy.</v>

875
00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:27.220
<v Speaker 5>He looks like he's about 500 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me just overflowing with gluttony</v>

876
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.470
<v Speaker 5>just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's got a rifle and there's a</v>

877
00:38:29.471 --> 00:38:30.640
<v Speaker 5>deadline there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

878
00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:31.980
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does every,</v>

879
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.930
<v Speaker 5>this is everything that's wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting because he's not going to eat</v>

880
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.000
<v Speaker 5>that lion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why did he go over there to shoot</v>

881
00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 5>that line?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing if that line was like</v>

882
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 5>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his family are interfering with his</v>

883
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 5>cattle business and no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

884
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

885
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.330
<v Speaker 5>That guy flew over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wattled over to the bike,</v>

886
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 5>the bog pod,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rest of the rifle down and pulled the</v>

887
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 5>trigger on one of the biggest apex</v>
<v Speaker 5>predators on the planet.</v>

888
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 5>Everybody should have a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

889
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

890
00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 5>But now here's the contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If those animals aren't worth money for</v>

891
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 5>people to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then what happens is they will happens</v>

892
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 5>in Zimbabwe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just kill hundreds of them because</v>

893
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:07.930
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's too many of them now because</v>

894
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:10.000
<v Speaker 5>people aren't hunting them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're decimating the Angelo</v>

895
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they have to curb the lions.</v>

896
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Speaker 5>So instead of getting $50,000 or</v>
<v Speaker 5>$100,000 a lion from a hunter,</v>

897
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 5>which goes to the villagers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes to conservation NGOs to hire</v>

898
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:22.930
<v Speaker 5>professional hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they get nothing and they have to</v>

899
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:25.150
<v Speaker 5>pay someone to go and shoot these lines</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they should,</v>

900
00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:26.800
<v Speaker 5>all of them should all have issued all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of them.</v>

901
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:27.903
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

902
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 5>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not good.</v>

903
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.050
<v Speaker 5>None of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This ain't good both ways.</v>

904
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:34.390
<v Speaker 5>Not good to lose that fat guy standing</v>
<v Speaker 5>over a line.</v>

905
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 5>And it's not good to look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

906
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:39.940
<v Speaker 5>these government people shooting 200</v>
<v Speaker 5>lions and just dumping them into a hole</v>

907
00:39:39.941 --> 00:39:41.710
<v Speaker 5>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing's a mess.</v>

908
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.190
<v Speaker 2>That's Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we try to do the right thing.</v>

909
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

910
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna,</v>

911
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:54.530
<v Speaker 2>get a bear tag from Colorado or are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to bear tag from New Mexico for</v>

912
00:39:54.531 --> 00:39:57.560
<v Speaker 2>that tag to be issued?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They measured the amount of food that's</v>

913
00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:01.910
<v Speaker 2>in each district and then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to issue six tags because</v>

914
00:40:01.911 --> 00:40:05.180
<v Speaker 2>there's enough food to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 12 bears there,</v>

915
00:40:05.181 --> 00:40:07.820
<v Speaker 2>but there's only enough food to feel to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed six of them,</v>

916
00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.380
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to issue six tags that</v>
<v Speaker 2>or all 12 of them might starve to death</v>

917
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.890
<v Speaker 2>or the majority of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to issue and you can go</v>

918
00:40:15.891 --> 00:40:18.890
<v Speaker 2>and buy your six tags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That leaves six animals in that,</v>

919
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.270
<v Speaker 2>in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that region.</v>

920
00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:22.520
<v Speaker 2>They are able to hunt your pain for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>tech.</v>

921
00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:24.140
<v Speaker 2>A lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes if you're out of state,</v>

922
00:40:24.141 --> 00:40:25.550
<v Speaker 2>you know you're paying a few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

923
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:25.941
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

924
00:40:25.941 --> 00:40:28.820
<v Speaker 2>$700,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flights,</v>

925
00:40:28.821 --> 00:40:31.670
<v Speaker 2>hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for a bear and it adds up.</v>

926
00:40:31.671 --> 00:40:32.300
<v Speaker 2>It adds up</v>

927
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.340
<v Speaker 5>is up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

928
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:38.180
<v Speaker 5>understand the mindset of people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want any of this to happen.</v>

929
00:40:38.181 --> 00:40:41.030
<v Speaker 5>I do understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do think that they don't</v>

930
00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:44.180
<v Speaker 5>understand nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really don't think they understand</v>

931
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:48.140
<v Speaker 5>that this is the best death these</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals will ever experience and they're</v>

932
00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:50.300
<v Speaker 5>not going to live forever in the wild</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the wild.</v>

933
00:40:50.301 --> 00:40:52.490
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be torn apart by</v>
<v Speaker 5>something bigger than that.</v>

934
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.980
<v Speaker 5>That's just how it goes 100 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>

935
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.410
<v Speaker 5>Or they freeze to death or they starve</v>
<v Speaker 5>to death</v>

936
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.270
<v Speaker 2>or they're starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They walked out onto the road and try to</v>

937
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.960
<v Speaker 2>find some food in the town they get hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a semi truck.</v>

938
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sounds good.</v>

939
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if I have a buddy who lives in Iowa</v>

940
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.200
<v Speaker 5>and when you drive in his neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 5>at night,</v>

941
00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:10.590
<v Speaker 5>you'd better go 35 miles an hour because</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fuckers just darting out in front</v>

942
00:41:10.591 --> 00:41:11.610
<v Speaker 5>of the street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>left and right.</v>

943
00:41:11.611 --> 00:41:13.890
<v Speaker 5>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

944
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.210
<v Speaker 5>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the solution?</v>

945
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:17.370
<v Speaker 5>Don't drive cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drive your bike everywhere man.</v>

946
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:18.653
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

947
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.090
<v Speaker 5>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

948
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.290
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get where those people are coming</v>

949
00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:23.520
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're coming from a place of</v>

950
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.960
<v Speaker 5>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it becomes very culty and it becomes</v>

951
00:41:27.961 --> 00:41:30.300
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very team oriented.</v>

952
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.860
<v Speaker 5>Their team Vegan and</v>

953
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.290
<v Speaker 2>there's like words were circling back</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

954
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to have that middle</v>

955
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that discussion,</v>

956
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 2>that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

957
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 2>there's like this pre assigned talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

958
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where everybody from every respect of</v>

959
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 2>side mixed essentially the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments and you're just regurgitating</v>

960
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:55.610
<v Speaker 2>what you've heard other people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no new thoughts is new and</v>

961
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no one taking a step to either</v>
<v Speaker 2>side like,</v>

962
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:00.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want maybe maybe there's</v>

963
00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:02.750
<v Speaker 2>something I'm not seeing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me look at it from this perspective</v>

964
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 2>or vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where this side,</v>

965
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:05.571
<v Speaker 2>the hunters like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

966
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:07.490
<v Speaker 2>no you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stupid snowflake,</v>

967
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go get your starbucks latte with soy</v>

968
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:13.940
<v Speaker 2>milk and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're never looking at it from</v>

969
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:17.000
<v Speaker 2>anything new right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just regurgitating their talking</v>

970
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you said gun control and</v>

971
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 2>people freaked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked out because I didn't stay to the</v>

972
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 2>script and there's a script.</v>

973
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pull up my,</v>

974
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of my social,</v>

975
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 2>you will see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you what you should've said was or</v>

976
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.513
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 2>shall not be infringed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>

978
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Shall not be infringed upon and believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to death.</v>

980
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Have you fought for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you bled for it?</v>

981
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:39.770
<v Speaker 2>You've been blown up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can try it.</v>

982
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

983
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I really believe in this shit but I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't stay to the script and then I get</v>

984
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.070
<v Speaker 2>murdered by both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what,</v>

985
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.170
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

986
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 2>you do a pretty good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so teach me Joe,</v>

987
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 2>how do you bring people in to have</v>

988
00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.360
<v Speaker 5>a talk?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's got to be a lot of people that</v>

989
00:42:58.361 --> 00:43:01.150
<v Speaker 5>disagree with you and say I do a</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible job that I repeat the same</v>

990
00:43:01.151 --> 00:43:02.890
<v Speaker 5>things over and over again and I agree</v>
<v Speaker 5>with them too,</v>

991
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:07.150
<v Speaker 5>for for a certain amount of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations like this one.</v>

992
00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:08.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had this conversation about</v>

993
00:43:08.921 --> 00:43:11.230
<v Speaker 5>conservation and animals a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 5>times,</v>

994
00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:14.110
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's worth having 100 more</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I think it's an important that</v>

995
00:43:14.111 --> 00:43:16.510
<v Speaker 5>if someone is listening to this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they didn't understand how it all</v>

996
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:20.380
<v Speaker 5>works and they didn't understand that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who hunt and eat meat,</v>

997
00:43:20.381 --> 00:43:22.840
<v Speaker 5>they're not monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not evil people,</v>

998
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:27.400
<v Speaker 5>just like people who eat grain aren't</v>
<v Speaker 5>monsters because you counselee disregard</v>

999
00:43:27.401 --> 00:43:30.940
<v Speaker 5>the lives of mice and rats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the things they get ground up and</v>

1000
00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:34.210
<v Speaker 5>combines and bunnies like if you buy</v>
<v Speaker 5>grain,</v>

1001
00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:37.810
<v Speaker 5>large scale agriculture is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

1002
00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.590
<v Speaker 5>It's bad in terms of factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also bad in terms of growing</v>

1003
00:43:41.591 --> 00:43:45.460
<v Speaker 5>food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you grow a thousand acres of corn,</v>

1004
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:49.750
<v Speaker 5>you are absolutely displacing wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when that stuff gets harvest,</v>

1005
00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:53.110
<v Speaker 5>you see vultures fly over those fields</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a reason.</v>

1006
00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.940
<v Speaker 5>It's because there's a bunch of dead</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1007
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:58.240
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more dead lives,</v>

1008
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.780
<v Speaker 5>more dead lives occur in a pound of</v>
<v Speaker 5>grain than occur in a pound of beef</v>

1009
00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:10.380
<v Speaker 5>because if you think that a cow is more</v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable than a bunny because it's</v>

1010
00:44:11.951 --> 00:44:15.670
<v Speaker 5>larger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you've got some weird thing going</v>

1011
00:44:15.671 --> 00:44:16.660
<v Speaker 5>on in your own head.</v>

1012
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell me how to balance the soles</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth on box</v>

1013
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.810
<v Speaker 5>and how'd you feel about insects?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they are a large scale poisoning</v>

1014
00:44:24.811 --> 00:44:28.560
<v Speaker 5>those fucking insects and you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows and they're grinding</v>

1015
00:44:28.561 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 5>those fuckers up with earth worms and</v>
<v Speaker 5>mice</v>

1016
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.850
<v Speaker 3>and gophers and chipmunks and anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else that gets stuck in those wheels.</v>

1017
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 3>That is just how large scale agriculture</v>
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>

1018
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 3>so unless you have some isolated farm</v>
<v Speaker 3>where everything is fenced in and you</v>

1019
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:44.480
<v Speaker 3>only have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1020
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of acreage and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>farm feeds you will you are Karma free</v>

1021
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.850
<v Speaker 3>and congratulations to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You figured out how to do it.</v>

1022
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.790
<v Speaker 3>But most of us who buy pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go and buy bread in the store,</v>

1023
00:44:54.791 --> 00:44:59.791
<v Speaker 3>you're paying someone who's killed a</v>
<v Speaker 3>large amount of living things in order</v>

1024
00:45:00.361 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 3>to harvest that grain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a fact.</v>

1025
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fact and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>inconvenient fact that they like to look</v>

1026
00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Speaker 3>at with blinders on because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1027
00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 3>like Hashtag cruelty free not to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bunny rabbit that's a part of</v>

1028
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 3>your tofu because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what's really going on.</v>

1029
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good part of the b vitamin B that a</v>

1030
00:45:22.171 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 3>lot of vegans get is from ground up bugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ground up into their grain and</v>

1031
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 3>ground up into their vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1032
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:30.780
<v Speaker 3>this is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just,</v>

1033
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.620
<v Speaker 3>you can't get away around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1034
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you are being real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>

1035
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.850
<v Speaker 2>if you're being real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1036
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.690
<v Speaker 2>and that maybe that's the problem in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first place is nobody is going to have</v>

1037
00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:46.660
<v Speaker 2>the courage to come into that middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and let,</v>

1038
00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.380
<v Speaker 2>let go of all of their baggage and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their</v>

1039
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.940
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and just cool with eating bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should eat crickets.</v>

1040
00:45:55.941 --> 00:45:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Get cricket meal,</v>

<v Speaker 3>My back</v>

1073
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.210
<v Speaker 2>bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1074
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I really can't sit for very long periods</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time on my desk at home.</v>

1075
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.350
<v Speaker 2>My reloading station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all standing height or one of those</v>

1076
00:47:17.351 --> 00:47:18.530
<v Speaker 2>standing desk guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1077
00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll even take a medicine ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the balance balls and um,</v>

1078
00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll get on my knees on it and I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

1079
00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good move.</v>

1080
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels good and it's good.</v>

1081
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:32.070
<v Speaker 2>But his type type of your core strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less of the core and it's more um,</v>

1082
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I like a seven year old brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1083
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:37.600
<v Speaker 2>that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>

1084
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing a lot of things at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get distracted so I just do lots</v>

1085
00:47:42.521 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 2>of things at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like having to balance on a ball so I</v>

1086
00:47:45.251 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 2>don't smash my face into the desk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock myself out while I'm reloading</v>

1087
00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:50.590
<v Speaker 2>ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And playing with explosives like that is</v>

1088
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>a perfect recipe for me to be successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>at reloading bullets.</v>

1089
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.870
<v Speaker 2>You reload explosive as well as bullets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1090
00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1091
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh well I'm gunpowder isn't explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1092
00:47:59.111 --> 00:47:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1093
00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I thought you meant like grenades and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit to.</v>

1094
00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will take a,</v>

1095
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.960
<v Speaker 2>like if we are going to go do so</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow I'm playing with the Dutch</v>

<v Speaker 2>Austin,</v>

1097
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:15.571
<v Speaker 2>Texas and we are going to set up a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of booby traps for them when they come</v>

1098
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:20.410
<v Speaker 2>in to do their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their final culmination hit the</v>

1099
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:23.410
<v Speaker 2>full mission profile.</v>

1100
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 2>planning and they're going to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they're going to walk through the</v>

1101
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:28.330
<v Speaker 2>woods and not get caught and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially the terrorists that they're</v>

1102
00:48:28.331 --> 00:48:31.980
<v Speaker 2>going to try and come kill 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm a really good terrorist.</v>

1103
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.530
<v Speaker 2>So how do you guys keep from actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing each other when you're doing</v>

<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1106
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.373
<v Speaker 2>simunitions.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So what's the official story?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The official story is that he killed</v>

1156
00:50:59.271 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 5>himself right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Killed themself in the bunker with David</v>

1157
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:04.040
<v Speaker 5>Braun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

1158
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 5>And is there any photographic evidence</v>
<v Speaker 5>of his death or anything?</v>

1159
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:11.730
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians got the body and they got</v>

1160
00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 2>his school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1161
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:17.970
<v Speaker 2>and when they brought it back to Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody has ever been able to</v>

1162
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:23.130
<v Speaker 2>independently verify who and what this</v>
<v Speaker 2>body is.</v>

1163
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:28.490
<v Speaker 2>They let one genetic tests occur and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body with the bullet holes that they</v>

1164
00:51:28.741 --> 00:51:32.010
<v Speaker 2>said was Hitler and have said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the narrative.</v>

1165
00:51:32.011 --> 00:51:32.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

1166
00:51:32.911 --> 00:51:37.650
<v Speaker 2>all the eyewitness accounts that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the vicinity of collaborating</v>

1167
00:51:37.651 --> 00:51:39.060
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1168
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:43.770
<v Speaker 2>and cooperating each other's testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the closest version because none of</v>

1169
00:51:43.771 --> 00:51:47.340
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be very accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay?</v>

1170
00:51:47.341 --> 00:51:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Here's Hitler school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they did the genetic testing,</v>

1171
00:51:50.701 --> 00:51:53.190
<v Speaker 2>it's that of a 35 year old woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1172
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this isn't Hitler.</v>

1173
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.850
<v Speaker 2>But they have said for the past 80 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is Hitler.</v>

1174
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:02.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1175
00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:05.580
<v Speaker 2>first before we start throwing stones at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

1176
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.470
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to 1945.</v>

1177
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:12.450
<v Speaker 2>April Ma in Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the allies coming in,</v>

1178
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:14.040
<v Speaker 2>wrecking shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping bombs,</v>

1179
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:16.440
<v Speaker 2>blowing everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can in every single which way you</v>

1180
00:52:16.441 --> 00:52:18.390
<v Speaker 2>have the Russians coming from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite direction.</v>

1181
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have enough guns to arm</v>
<v Speaker 2>all their soldiers.</v>

1182
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.850
<v Speaker 2>So if they have 200 guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,000 guys,</v>

1183
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.220
<v Speaker 2>they have 100,000 guns that the guy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you dies.</v>

1184
00:52:26.221 --> 00:52:30.480
<v Speaker 2>You just pick up his gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening in April of 1945</v>

1185
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.600
<v Speaker 2>in Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the noose is tightening.</v>

1186
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:36.870
<v Speaker 2>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is chaos.</v>

1187
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Anarchy pandemonium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1188
00:52:39.151 --> 00:52:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hell on earth is Berlin.</v>

1189
00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if you could get a real</v>

1190
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:48.630
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real.</v>

1191
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.240
<v Speaker 2>The way that we do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we have,</v>

1192
00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this forensic experts that come in and</v>

1193
00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.060
<v Speaker 2>document everything and we look at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different testimonies.</v>

1194
00:52:57.061 --> 00:52:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Say this is this exactly how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

1195
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not CSI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is 1945 Berlin.</v>

1196
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.220
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1197
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:09.960
<v Speaker 5>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no like absolute proof.</v>

1198
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:14.880
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of Nazis did escape and go to</v>

1199
00:53:14.881 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 5>South America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>America,</v>

1200
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:19.150
<v Speaker 2>the majority of anyone with power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nuremberg trials a,</v>

1201
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.170
<v Speaker 2>we're not a witch hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was too close a chapter so we</v>

1202
00:53:23.171 --> 00:53:25.060
<v Speaker 2>could start moving forward with</v>
<v Speaker 2>communism.</v>

1203
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:30.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The threat of fascism,</v>

1204
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 2>the threat of Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the threat of killing all the Jews,</v>

1205
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 2>the threat of world domination by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis that threat's gone.</v>

1206
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.680
<v Speaker 2>What's the next threat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Communism.</v>

1207
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that had to be a closed chapter of</v>

1208
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:46.500
<v Speaker 2>our history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could focus our resources and our</v>

1209
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 2>efforts to what inevitably was going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the wall goes up.</v>

1210
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.990
<v Speaker 2>We have east and West Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1211
00:53:51.991 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 2>we're already looking at Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1212
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:55.050
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happens almost overnight,</v>

1213
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 2>no one patents like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no homies,</v>

1214
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 2>we need to go all the way to Matt</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moscow.</v>

1215
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:02.330
<v Speaker 2>This is not the end of our war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't listen to him.</v>

1216
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we then had been fighting communism for</v>

1217
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 2>the past 75 years.</v>

1218
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 2>So the ones with power that went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>

1219
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I know a bunch of them went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentina.</v>

1220
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

1221
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went to Honduras and a few other</v>

1222
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 2>places where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do they think they wound up?</v>

1223
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 2>So what you had in South America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both Chile and Argentina,</v>

1224
00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:29.661
<v Speaker 2>back to back head fascist regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a parone who was part of the</v>

1225
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Nazi party starting all the way back</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the mid thirties.</v>

1226
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 2>He's the president of Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Red Cross,</v>

1227
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were facilitate.</v>

1228
00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 2>There was about three different rat</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines that guys were able to</v>

1229
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 2>successfully get out of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into South America.</v>

1230
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are,</v>

1231
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:51.960
<v Speaker 2>there's no question that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>

1232
00:54:51.961 --> 00:54:54.840
<v Speaker 2>if not tens of thousands of high ranking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis made it there.</v>

1233
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Tens of thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands.</v>

1234
00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking like little</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>

1235
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking high ranking Nazis officers</v>
<v Speaker 2>got guys like Joseph Mengele and Adolf</v>

1236
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:05.131
<v Speaker 2>Eichmann.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1237
00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 2>these are the most disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despicable humans to exist at the time.</v>

1238
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.140
<v Speaker 2>If Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Hitler is dead,</v>

1239
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Mengele is the guy that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>take syringes full of blue ink and</v>

1240
00:55:14.341 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 2>inject them and you have blue eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1241
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:20.280
<v Speaker 2>or you have brown eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if I can make them blue and</v>

1242
00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:23.310
<v Speaker 2>then take twins and start torturing them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if one would feel the pain.</v>

1243
00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:24.960
<v Speaker 2>That's Josef Mengele.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1244
00:55:24.961 --> 00:55:27.870
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy that then in South</v>
<v Speaker 2>America was helping.</v>

1245
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high ranking Argentinians have abortions</v>

1246
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 2>and he set up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1247
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.870
<v Speaker 2>have you seen the movie Colonia about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colonia Dignity?</v>

<v Speaker 2>almost warn you not to google it because</v>

1250
00:55:42.781 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 2>it is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a torture camp that was started</v>

1251
00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:51.021
<v Speaker 2>by Joseph Shaffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Nazi and Joseph Mengele the doctor of</v>

1252
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 2>death that escaped trial in Nuremberg</v>
<v Speaker 2>and made it.</v>

1253
00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the behest of parone into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentina.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He sat at the hospital at Colonia</v>
<v Speaker 2>dignity that,</v>

1255
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:06.960
<v Speaker 2>which was another safe house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe haven for more Nazis in South</v>

1256
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.793
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1259
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:15.750
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took the gloves off and they were</v>

1260
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 2>just sending assassins to try to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people and killed them.</v>

1261
00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you got in South America were</v>

1262
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:25.720
<v Speaker 2>isolated German only communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could go into Bariloche,</v>

1270
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:41.530

<v Speaker 2>So in 2017 you were there and they were</v>

1271
00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:42.500
<v Speaker 2>speaking German.</v>

1279
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no Spanish being spoken there.</v>

1280
00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:14.290
<v Speaker 2>It is exclusively German and these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>descendants of Nazis.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1288
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:39.970
<v Speaker 2>if you look the second generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of.</v>

1289
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:45.630
<v Speaker 2>So it was a huge problem for Chile that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to hide for years and they,</v>

1290
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:51.660
<v Speaker 2>they got so much power from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>torturing that they did at Colonia dicta</v>

1291
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:56.670
<v Speaker 2>dad on a whole bunch of other high</v>
<v Speaker 2>ranking South American dictators that</v>

1292
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 2>they're almost untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

1293
00:57:59.081 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1294
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd blow your mind if you look into</v>

1295
00:58:02.231 --> 00:58:02.840
<v Speaker 2>this jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1296
00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you'd love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm the second generation,</v>

1297
00:58:06.641 --> 00:58:08.050
<v Speaker 2>the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grandkids,</v>

1298
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they're even more fanatical</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the original generation.</v>

1299
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen this where like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is away from,</v>

1300
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 2>like when you travel abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1301
00:58:16.691 --> 00:58:20.170
<v Speaker 2>it's so cool to like get into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and get into the food and get</v>

1302
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're dancing this style and you</v>

1303

00:58:23.941 --> 00:58:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go to a soccer game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't go to soccer games in</v>

1305
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:29.590
<v Speaker 2>America that I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then maybe after like two months you</v>

1306
00:58:29.591 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 2>kind of miss home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:36.211
<v Speaker 2>and then like a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you really miss home and then 10</v>

1308
00:58:36.431 --> 00:58:40.750
<v Speaker 2>years like you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really miss home and you see the same</v>

1309
00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:44.380
<v Speaker 2>thing in the United States where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really a perfect assimilation.</v>

1310
00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:48.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not the melting pot where you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations that are espousing to be</v>

1311
00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:51.490
<v Speaker 2>more like their ethnic heritage than</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are American,</v>

1312
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're flying the Irish flag and like</v>

1313
00:58:53.711 --> 00:58:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Irish,</v>

1314
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm what's just times a thousand with</v>
<v Speaker 2>these communities because they're</v>

1315
00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.890
<v Speaker 2>exclusively German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1316
00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of weird.</v>

1317
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.140
<v Speaker 2>So exclusively German and really missing</v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1319
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:14.440

<v Speaker 2>the second generations I was talking</v>

1320
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:15.320

<v Speaker 2>and were high ranking white supremacists</v>

1322
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:25.021
<v Speaker 2>that are now in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in prison for their racial crimes.</v>

1323
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.800
<v Speaker 2>And they came out of South America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came out of Colonia dignity.</v>

1324
00:59:29.801 --> 00:59:33.310

1330
00:59:43.741 --> 00:59:46.530
<v Speaker 3>All told in South America that can come</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of this.</v>

1331
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean tens of thousands went there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many German communities and</v>

1332

<v Speaker 3>How big are they?</v>

1333
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 3>We maybe have 50 German communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty fifth.</v>

1334
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.980
<v Speaker 3>How many people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a few hundred thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>somebody's parlor and it's like you're</v>

1340

<v Speaker 2>style and all the art is very German.</v>

<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1346
01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Things that Hitler loved and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>

1347
01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:43.390
<v Speaker 2>That's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they come out and like with</v>

1348
01:00:43.391 --> 01:00:45.520
<v Speaker 2>white gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're holding their GRANDPA,</v>

1354
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.450
<v Speaker 2>that they're holding their hands.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So we followed the first two seasons.</v>

1366
01:01:31.081 --> 01:01:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It was really just unraveling the rumors</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what happened to Hitler.</v>

1367
01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.480
<v Speaker 2>The third season was my favorite because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually got to do real work.</v>

1368
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.373
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1369
01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I got to the second season I got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring in more special forces.</v>

1370
01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:48.311
<v Speaker 2>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a CIA targeter Nadia who helped my</v>

1371
01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:55.001
<v Speaker 2>unit kill Zarqawi in 2006 that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the team that is now looking at real</v>

1372
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>evidence trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1373
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>how did we find Bin Ladin?</v>

1374
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:04.190
<v Speaker 2>How do we find the car is our county.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We looked at their associates and we</v>

1375
01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.290
<v Speaker 2>looked at how they move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We looked at how they communicated,</v>

1376
01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 2>we looked at what routes they were using</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to and from places,</v>

1377
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>and then we just started tightening the</v>
<v Speaker 2>noose and that's exactly what we did in</v>

1378
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:14.210
<v Speaker 2>this third season was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1379

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.360
<v Speaker 2>that was a colonel in the ss that went</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto work for everybody after the war</v>

1383
01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fascists do not like communists.</v>

1384
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:38.810
<v Speaker 2>So this guy was working for everybody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>include the CIA fighting fascism and</v>

1385
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:43.050
<v Speaker 2>South America are fighting communism as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fascist in South America in the</v>

1386
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:43.711
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

1387
01:02:43.711 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 2>and seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creepy stuff.</v>

1388
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1389
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.520
<v Speaker 2>so haunting Hiller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there any legitimate eye witness</v>

1390
01:02:55.741 --> 01:03:00.390
<v Speaker 2>accounts of Hitler in South America or</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially legitimate?</v>

1391
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.531
<v Speaker 2>You?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1392
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1393
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I witnessed counts.</v>

1394
01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:10.251
<v Speaker 2>I saw him get off a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him meet here and if it was just</v>

1395
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:14.430
<v Speaker 2>some person saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost meaningless.</v>

1396
01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the context of who</v>

1397
01:03:17.011 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 2>this person is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wealth that they have that they</v>

1398
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you explain how you got so rich and</v>

1399
01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>two generations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1400
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.950
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1401
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>your grandpa got here from Germany in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1946.</v>

1402
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.670
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1403
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1404
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.870
<v Speaker 2>he's on a legitimate visa with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentinian passport,</v>

1405
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.250
<v Speaker 2>also weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1406
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.230
<v Speaker 2>and now he's a war refugee that's now</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth millions of dollars.</v>

1407
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 2>How does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does this work?</v>

1408
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.263
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1409
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 2>but people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this is the hard part.</v>

1410
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>People want to be connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant events and,</v>

1411
01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 2>and especially in small rural areas of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

1412
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>developing areas like they want their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nothing there so little happening.</v>

1413
01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:06.240
<v Speaker 2>They want to be attached to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>

1414
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.660
<v Speaker 2>And like the fact that they saw you boat</v>
<v Speaker 2>land on this beach and the pop,</v>

1415
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 2>the hatch opened and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1416
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.300
<v Speaker 2>these cars were sitting there and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing morse code and this guy gets</v>

1417
01:04:18.301 --> 01:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>off and he had this little mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1418
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:25.380
<v Speaker 2>W for u boats can't beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how that works.</v>

1419
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 2>But you know what they're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to be connected.</v>

1420
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1421
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.680
<v Speaker 2>and now we're removed 70 to 80 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the facts.</v>

1422
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.750
<v Speaker 2>It has been painful to try to use real</v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

1423
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.230
<v Speaker 2>real investigative tools to try to sift</v>
<v Speaker 2>through</v>

1424
01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>this lore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1425
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:49.000
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1426
01:04:49.001 --> 01:04:51.520
<v Speaker 2>you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been studying this for how long</v>

1427
01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:52.730
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>

1428
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had to guess,</v>

1429
01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>if you had like a million bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to put it on one side or</v>

1430
01:04:57.521 --> 01:04:58.450
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he go there?</v>

1431
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1432
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1433
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:05.083
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that.</v>

1434
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the first time I've ever said it</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat out like that.</v>

1435
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.740
<v Speaker 2>What would I want to say is the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>history is written is wrong.</v>

1436
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.780
<v Speaker 2>That that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's clear.</v>

1437
01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that we can say he died</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this day,</v>

1438
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here is his body.</v>

1439
01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's what a physical proof is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1440
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>The woman that had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were saying was Hitler is</v>

1441
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:26.590
<v Speaker 2>definitely not Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's absolutely.</v>

1442
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:29.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't have Hitler's body.</v>

1443
01:05:29.121 --> 01:05:30.990
<v Speaker 2>So then our other option was kate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it ava?</v>

1444
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Brahms did.</v>

1445
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.380
<v Speaker 2>He just grabbed the wrong body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1446
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:38.550
<v Speaker 2>So there are still descendants of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of eva and we tried to have them allow</v>

1447
01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:42.930
<v Speaker 2>us to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we tried to go through like,</v>

1448
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can get DNA off of the skull.</v>

1449
01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Just meat on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a tooth.</v>

1450
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1451
01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>but they wouldn't consent to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we tried to.</v>

1452
01:05:54.611 --> 01:05:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Do you know where people have like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree,</v>

1453
01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 2>they're ethnic treat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are those websites called?</v>

1454
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Twenty three in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a bunch of them.</v>

1456
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 2>We try to go that route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1457
01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.870
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't consent to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1458
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.520
<v Speaker 2>The Eva Braun's family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want it gone.</v>

1459
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:14.340
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1460
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 2>there are super pissed that we even</v>
<v Speaker 2>found them,</v>

1461
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which was hard.</v>

1462
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Which is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold them down and get them to spit in</v>

1463
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:22.414
<v Speaker 2>the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1464
01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:25.630
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1465
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or pull the trash and pull stuff out of</v>

1466
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1467
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Now it was totally not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>

1468
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1469
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.780
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's how they caught the</v>
<v Speaker 2>golden state killer,</v>

1470
01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:39.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was off a cigarette.</v>

1471
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:42.340
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got dna off a cigarette butt.</v>

1472
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:47.460
<v Speaker 2>So history is wrong for it to be black</v>
<v Speaker 2>and white like that and fuck man.</v>

1473
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1474
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:51.500
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to 1945,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1475
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>we needed scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We needed every single German,</v>

1476
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.360
<v Speaker 2>electrical engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical engineer,</v>

1477
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.070
<v Speaker 2>aerospace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

1478
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.560
<v Speaker 2>You're on the [inaudible] program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1479
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will,</v>

1480
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:05.470
<v Speaker 2>all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because now it's a race.</v>

1481
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the bomb,</v>

1482
01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 2>now we need delivery systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we need to get to the moon.</v>

1483
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Now we need to know like all of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are real time.</v>

1484
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war of dollars and a wharf science.</v>

1485
01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.710
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got all those scientists.</v>

1486
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 2>The Russians didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they got some,</v>

1487
01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:26.670
<v Speaker 2>some not very many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Operation paperclip was what</v>

1488
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:29.450
<v Speaker 5>brought over the what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wernher von Braun,</v>

1489
01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Speaker 5>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you talk to Jews that were in</v>

1490
01:07:32.301 --> 01:07:35.960
<v Speaker 5>Berlin during the time that Wernher von</v>
<v Speaker 5>Braun was running his rocket program</v>

1491
01:07:35.961 --> 01:07:40.490
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would hang the five slowest Jews in</v>

1492
01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:44.750
<v Speaker 5>front of the rocket factory in Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just to give everybody motivation to</v>

1493
01:07:44.751 --> 01:07:45.710
<v Speaker 5>work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1494
01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:47.930
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if</v>

1495
01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:50.540
<v Speaker 5>Wernher von Braun was alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would prosecute him for crimes</v>

1496
01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:53.030
<v Speaker 5>against humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a Nazi,</v>

1497
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:56.150
<v Speaker 5>straight up Nazi and people there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>apologist that say,</v>

1498
01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:56.361
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1499
01:07:56.361 --> 01:07:57.590
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a scientist.</v>

1500
01:07:57.591 --> 01:07:59.480
<v Speaker 5>He was forced into doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's like,</v>

1501
01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.310
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a Nazi.</v>

1502
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.330
<v Speaker 5>There's photographs of him wearing Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 5>garb hanging out with Nazis.</v>

1503
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:08.940
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his rocket factory killed Jews like this</v>

1504
01:08:08.941 --> 01:08:10.630
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are all undeniable</v>

1505
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.620
<v Speaker 2>except the war ends and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

1506
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:14.450
<v Speaker 2>That's not how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1507
01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>but they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were forgiven</v>

1508
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.820
<v Speaker 1>because they came over and contributed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our rocket program.</v>

1509
01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Not that I'm not that good of a human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that in me.</v>

1510
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:22.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1511
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're forgiven because they wanted to</v>

1512
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:27.700
<v Speaker 1>beat the Russians and they knew the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians got a bunch of them to know,</v>

1513
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians got a bunch of them for</v>

1514
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>their rocket propelled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians did.</v>

1515
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:35.680
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians were trying to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery system to drop bombs into</v>

1516
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Ben Gurion started having these</v>

1517
01:08:38.661 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Nazi scientists tried to have them</v>
<v Speaker 1>assassinated.</v>

1518
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.830
<v Speaker 1>They were mailing the facade was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you familiar with this facade</v>

1519
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 1>was mailing package bombs into Egypt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout Europe trying to kill these,</v>

1520
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.080
<v Speaker 1>these German scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were all German Nazi rocket</v>

1521
01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>guys that were working for Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt and Egypt and wanting to go blow</v>

1522
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is into the sixties.</v>

1523
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 1>So they're still trying to find ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the Jews and they're like,</v>

1524
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:05.480
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go work for you.</v>

1525
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1526
01:09:06.411 --> 01:09:11.411
<v Speaker 1>so it sounds crazy is how fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically advanced that Germans</v>

1527
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 1>were so far ahead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing.</v>

1528
01:09:13.611 --> 01:09:16.340
<v Speaker 1>And to this day you drive a bmw and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1529
01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on human fuckers are on point.</v>

1530
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chevy Malibu right now.</v>

1531
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drive a corvette,</v>

1532
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 1>get a new corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty fucking bad ass.</v>

1533
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It's on what you buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1534
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's German engineering in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties is fucking phenomenal.</v>

1535
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you drove a German car for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties and an American car from the</v>

1536
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no comparison.</v>

1537
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a 1991 porsche and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking piece of engineering man.</v>

1538
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:49.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a marvel of engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fast like a modern car.</v>

1539
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:54.500
<v Speaker 1>But when you compare like the build</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality and how they constructed it and</v>

1540
01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.200
<v Speaker 1>how it's put together in comparison to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

1541
01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking dodge Daytona from 1990.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hunk of shit.</v>

1542
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants one of those today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1543
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're going to build a VB IED</v>

1544
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.840
<v Speaker 1>than you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's the only time you'd.</v>

1545
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 1>If you could blow it up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

1546
01:10:10.461 --> 01:10:11.840
<v Speaker 1>The way you think is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1547
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:16.900
<v Speaker 1>13 year old child trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterfeit money and it's will be.</v>

1548
01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>We'll be in some country and I'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking by and I'll look at a car and be</v>

1549
01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:25.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make a great bomb and I swear</v>

1550
01:10:25.491 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 1>to God she would go through my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1551
01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1552
01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Well that's how the business works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll grow up someday.</v>

1553
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:39.220
<v Speaker 1>So when you're over there in Argentina</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're meeting with these people and</v>

1554
01:10:39.321 --> 01:10:44.321
<v Speaker 1>you know that the descendants of Nazis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll bring out this grandfathers</v>

1555
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 1>chest of things and war medals and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this jazz,</v>

1556
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this feeling like?</v>

1557
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like these people got away</v>
<v Speaker 1>with something and then they kind of</v>

1558
01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:56.240
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these aren't the people that did it,</v>

1559
01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:59.870
<v Speaker 1>but they're the descendants of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that did it and they're still</v>

1560
01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:01.960
<v Speaker 1>worshiping those people in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1561
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1562
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of soul searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out what is the</v>

1563
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:12.350
<v Speaker 1>appropriate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the appropriate spots?</v>

1564
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>What am I seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I supposed to be feeling</v>

1565
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:15.900
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I'm a pretty.</v>

1566
01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm exposed person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm in tuned with what I feel and</v>

1567
01:11:22.081 --> 01:11:27.081
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the hardest days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in Chile and I interviewed this,</v>

1568
01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.910
<v Speaker 2>this man and this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1569
01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:37.040
<v Speaker 2>they are both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is a second generation.</v>

1570
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:42.050
<v Speaker 2>She was born on a Colonia dignity dad on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this compound as a Nazi.</v>

1571
01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm separated from her parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't know who her parents was,</v>

1572
01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.561
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1573
01:11:45.561 --> 01:11:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was brought there at like age three</v>

1574
01:11:47.751 --> 01:11:49.790
<v Speaker 2>or four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she grew up there and see,</v>

1575
01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.090
<v Speaker 2>and they're separated from parents who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are parents was her husband,</v>

1576
01:11:53.150 --> 01:11:58.150
<v Speaker 2>was a Chilean boy that was local and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard about this new hospital that's</v>

1577
01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.720
<v Speaker 2>built by Dr Mengele and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how everybody has food there and he's a</v>

1578
01:12:03.801 --> 01:12:08.801
<v Speaker 2>porch lane kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was able to get onto the compound.</v>

1579
01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the locals and the Germans aren't</v>

1580
01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:16.700
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was kind of kept separated.</v>

1581
01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.260
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he was local,</v>

1582
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.360
<v Speaker 2>they started testing him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1583
01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 2>and grow.</v>

1584
01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:28.330
<v Speaker 2>It got really violent and disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time he is a teenager,</v>

1585
01:12:28.331 --> 01:12:31.360
<v Speaker 2>he's been thrown out of out of windows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having his bones broken,</v>

1586
01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.730
<v Speaker 2>being nursed back to health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being set on fire,</v>

1587
01:12:33.731 --> 01:12:37.570
<v Speaker 2>be nurse back to health for like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years.</v>

1588
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:43.380
<v Speaker 2>He finally talks his what will be his</v>
<v Speaker 2>future wife into escaping with him and</v>

1589
01:12:44.321 --> 01:12:48.400
<v Speaker 2>they sneak out on in a chief's truck</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of his friends,</v>

1590
01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:52.060
<v Speaker 2>when he was a Chilean kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up to be a police officer in nearby</v>

1591
01:12:52.061 --> 01:12:54.310
<v Speaker 2>and he was able to get a letter out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and be like,</v>

1592
01:12:54.311 --> 01:12:56.320
<v Speaker 2>please come help us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they came in and do a health</v>

1593
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:59.110
<v Speaker 2>inspection and they hopped inside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cheese cheese truck and they got</v>

1594
01:12:59.111 --> 01:12:59.750
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

1595
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to this guy and he's telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>me about the things that happened to</v>

1596
01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:06.400
<v Speaker 2>them and I'm not going to get into it.</v>

1597
01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were the most horrible things</v>

1598
01:13:08.831 --> 01:13:11.020
<v Speaker 2>that could happen to a little boy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could imagine,</v>

1599
01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond rape,</v>

1600
01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:14.920
<v Speaker 2>beyond being burnt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>

1601
01:13:14.921 --> 01:13:18.580
<v Speaker 2>beyond being broken for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years and years and years.</v>

1602
01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And I'm shaking because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1603
01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:23.770
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Afghanistan and you know,</v>

1604
01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.150
<v Speaker 2>they threw some acid on some kids and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>found those guys to kill those guys</v>

1605
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.300
<v Speaker 2>because that's what you do when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hurt little kids.</v>

1606
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1607
01:13:32.711 --> 01:13:35.900
<v Speaker 2>I got a soft spot for people that can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of themselves,</v>

1608
01:13:35.901 --> 01:13:39.190
<v Speaker 2>that can protect themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every real human isn't gonna let</v>

1609
01:13:39.191 --> 01:13:42.130
<v Speaker 2>anything weaker them ever get hurt in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of them.</v>

1610
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to the story,</v>

1611
01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

1612
01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.980
<v Speaker 2>and I know I have to go back to Colonia</v>
<v Speaker 2>digging dad the next day and put on like</v>

1613
01:13:50.981 --> 01:13:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm a tourist guy hosting a travel show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that's always our disguise to</v>

1614
01:13:55.901 --> 01:13:56.280
<v Speaker 2>get in there.</v>

1615
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.113
<v Speaker 2>And was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a beautiful Bavarian village.</v>

1617
01:13:58.991 --> 01:14:00.490

<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

1618
01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:05.670
<v Speaker 2>our little way in and I was just going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go in and destroy that whole entire</v>

1619
01:14:07.931 --> 01:14:09.280
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my plan.</v>

1620
01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's looking at me and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1621
01:14:10.901 --> 01:14:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I see your anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1622
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.270
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1623
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them.</v>

1624
01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:16.290
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1625
01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you no more pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1626
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:20.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

1627
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.140
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks at his wife and he goes,</v>

1628
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:26.400
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She saved me every time that I burned.</v>

1629
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Every time that was broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just love.</v>

1630
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.120
<v Speaker 2>That's how I got out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're alive today and we're</v>

1631
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 2>going to die of old age together with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman that I fell in love with on this</v>

1632
01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:37.180
<v Speaker 2>colony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that matters is love.</v>

1633
01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

1634
01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still want to go hurt.</v>

1635
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.460
<v Speaker 2>All of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1636
01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:46.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these people that were doing this to</v>

1637
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

1638
01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:49.960
<v Speaker 2>what was their objective?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to understand.</v>

1639
01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the same test that Joseph Mengele was</v>

1640
01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:57.211
<v Speaker 2>doing in Germany in 1943,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's now doing in Chile in 1953.</v>

1641
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 2>He just has a different population to</v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

1642
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.040
<v Speaker 2>They're not Jews there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chalene boys.</v>

1643
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And they're strong and they're wirey and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less food,</v>

1644
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.200
<v Speaker 2>they're not like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using quotation marks,</v>

1645
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:14.110
<v Speaker 2>the cockroach Jews that you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't kill,</v>

1646
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:14.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these were,</v>

1647
01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.670
<v Speaker 2>these were young strong browns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these are their words verbatim that</v>

1648
01:15:18.671 --> 01:15:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1649
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.390
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1650
01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell your guys' faces out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick soldering irons in your ear</v>

1651
01:15:25.301 --> 01:15:26.470
<v Speaker 2>because you guys are so evil.</v>

1652
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:28.750
<v Speaker 2>But then I'm the same as them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just really torn.</v>

1653
01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to kill them all.</v>

1654
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the worst aspects of human</v>

1655
01:15:34.151 --> 01:15:39.151
<v Speaker 2>beings is the desire to hurt people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are weaker than you and tortured them.</v>

1656
01:15:39.821 --> 01:15:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And this is just coming into contact</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1657
01:15:42.551 --> 01:15:45.160
<v Speaker 2>And then some guy who has this most</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful response to it.</v>

1658
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1661
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:53.290
<v Speaker 2>So I never knew how to respond to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1662
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>valor like crazy.</v>

01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:37.510
<v Speaker 2>He got snatched by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1678

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.390
<v Speaker 2>He died of old age actually in the 19 in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sixties.</v>

1680
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.660
<v Speaker 2>The Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're trying to build that rocket</v>

1681
01:16:49.661 --> 01:16:51.700
<v Speaker 2>plug program to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to annihilate the,</v>

1682
01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.400
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to annihilate Israel scores.</v>

1683
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:59.170
<v Speaker 2>NCS started working for the facade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't really know it for their</v>

1684
01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:01.120
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him millions of millions of dollars to</v>

1685
01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 2>hold these parties for what he thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the rise of the Fourth Reich.</v>

1686
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1687
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:11.130
<v Speaker 2>He was bringing in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1688
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes and a crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crucial steel steel crushed,</v>

1689
01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.390
<v Speaker 2>steal these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these massive billion dollar</v>

1690
01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:25.391
<v Speaker 2>corporations for the time he was hosting</v>
<v Speaker 2>these soirees and talk and having other</v>

1691
01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:28.130
<v Speaker 2>high level Nazis that were still alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in.</v>

1692
01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just really being used by the</v>

1693
01:17:30.831 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 2>massage to try to figure out who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitating this Egyptian rocket</v>

1694
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:37.190
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've just been putting on these</v>

1695
01:17:37.191 --> 01:17:40.460
<v Speaker 2>parties to kind of get everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>together so they could keep tabs on</v>

1696
01:17:40.461 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 2>everybody and figure out who's who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the facade was doing.</v>

1697
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:45.960
<v Speaker 2>He was doing it with the intent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the forthright,</v>

1698
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rising the Fourth Reich.</v>

1699
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 2>So the massage did this and then what</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they do once they figured out who</v>

1700
01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 2>was who</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally,</v>

1701
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:58.160
<v Speaker 2>they don't like this part because I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>just getting killing bad people.</v>

1702
01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out that the,</v>

1703
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big problem with the delivery system</v>

1704
01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:09.461
<v Speaker 2>for the Egyptians in their missile</v>
<v Speaker 2>program was the navigation system and</v>

1705
01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:13.340
<v Speaker 2>they are trying to hire a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these experts,</v>

1706
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:17.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come work for this program.</v>

1707
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:22.400
<v Speaker 2>And they diplomatically kind of went</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the back and they got all of</v>

1708
01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really the only experts in the</v>

1709
01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:27.020
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they prevented them from going and</v>

1710
01:18:27.021 --> 01:18:29.730
<v Speaker 2>traveling to and work for Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1711
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:34.910
<v Speaker 2>so they kind of diplomatically ended the</v>
<v Speaker 2>development of delivery system for</v>

1712
01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their warheads.</v>

1713
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's how they handled it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After they poisoned some people and they</v>

1714
01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:44.660
<v Speaker 2>sent some mail bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kidnapped a guy and tortured him</v>

1715
01:18:44.661 --> 01:18:47.660
<v Speaker 2>and killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

1716
01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real torture.</v>

1717
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not fake torture.</v>

1718
01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:55.690
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how few people know about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi escapees that went to South</v>

1719
01:18:59.000 --> 01:18:59.460
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1720
01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how when this comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1721
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it's relatively unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1722
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:07.310
<v Speaker 2>your show has done a lot to shed some</v>
<v Speaker 2>light on it.</v>

1723
01:19:07.311 --> 01:19:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And I've read some articles about Nazis</v>
<v Speaker 2>that escaped to South America,</v>

1724
01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's not common knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1725
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.560
<v Speaker 2>By design,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you're down there,</v>

1726
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.760
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a shroud of silence.</v>

1727
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.880
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1728
01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to talk about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1729
01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.850
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long time for me to get an</v>

1730
01:19:26.851 --> 01:19:31.110
<v Speaker 2>interview with a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time for building</v>

1731
01:19:31.111 --> 01:19:31.861
<v Speaker 2>rapport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1732
01:19:31.861 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 2>we're talking like we have some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level people working with me,</v>

1733
01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:40.260
<v Speaker 2>special operations from every single</v>
<v Speaker 2>branch to include the CIA,</v>

1734
01:19:40.261 --> 01:19:45.261
<v Speaker 2>Army special forces and we are pulling</v>
<v Speaker 2>out every trick in the book to try to</v>

1735
01:19:45.451 --> 01:19:50.451
<v Speaker 2>get these people to talk to us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>include bribing them and the um,</v>

1736
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.793
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

1737
01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:55.570
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still don't talk about it.</v>

1738
01:19:55.571 --> 01:19:58.090
<v Speaker 2>To this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to bring in German speaking</v>

1739
01:19:58.091 --> 01:19:58.880
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1740
01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.610
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1741
01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can be done?</v>

1742
01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1743
01:20:08.911 --> 01:20:11.280
<v Speaker 2>These are people that benefited from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that went down there.</v>

1744
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.100
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about like third</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation removed,</v>

1745
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:16.400
<v Speaker 2>but what can be done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1746
01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:19.080
<v Speaker 2>the kind of the damage is done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1747
01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a lot of damage.</v>

1748
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.950
<v Speaker 2>What can be done is the ideas can die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ideas of,</v>

1749
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.560
<v Speaker 2>of fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas of racism,</v>

1750
01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1751
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:30.060
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

1752
01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 2>We can kill 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are those ideas,</v>

1753
01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:38.550
<v Speaker 2>are those ideas being fostered in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these communities?</v>

1754
01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:39.861
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1755
01:20:39.861 --> 01:20:40.770
<v Speaker 2>there are being cultivated.</v>

1756
01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like you experienced it.</v>

1757
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:20:45.781 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm a white guy,</v>

1759
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 2>white guy walking down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

1760
01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I am a higher degree than the locals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1761
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:55.710
<v Speaker 2>like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go and shop in some places that</v>

1762
01:20:55.711 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 2>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go in and sit down and have a meal</v>

1763
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.540
<v Speaker 2>in some places that they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

1764
01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:02.370
<v Speaker 2>And being greeted on the street and good</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morgan,</v>

1765
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:04.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1766
01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:06.450
<v Speaker 2>not the brown dude next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

1767
01:21:06.451 --> 01:21:11.451
<v Speaker 2>And His kid definitely can't date the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue eyed blonde girl at the high school</v>

1768
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 2>that's not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they basically created these little</v>

1769
01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:17.730
<v Speaker 2>colonies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1770
01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Yahtzee colonies in South America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you Google Google Colonia dignity</v>

1771
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 2>that you will have nightmares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not freak it out right now.</v>

1772
01:21:26.010 --> 01:21:28.320
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how many people got away with</v>

1773
01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:32.210
<v Speaker 2>it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wife.</v>

1774
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:33.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1775
01:21:33.191 --> 01:21:33.560
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1776
01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.780
<v Speaker 2>that would hurt me because he's a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me just on the ops because he,</v>

1777
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a special operations guy.</v>

1778
01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:39.510
<v Speaker 2>He was an ss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1779
01:21:39.511 --> 01:21:40.080
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1780
01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 2>he was a physical specimen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for the time,</v>

1781
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:42.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we didn't,</v>

1782
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.190
<v Speaker 2>we didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1783
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:48.270
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very early on into the,</v>

1784
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:50.700
<v Speaker 2>one of the first real Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1785
01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:53.610
<v Speaker 2>this isn't okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of Germany's going this way.</v>

1786
01:21:53.611 --> 01:21:57.690
<v Speaker 2>The chancellor is Adolf Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where we're going.</v>

1787
01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I kind of just have to go along and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see some of that in the third,</v>

1788
01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:03.720
<v Speaker 2>like 43,</v>
<v Speaker 2>44.</v>

1789
01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

1790
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:07.530
<v Speaker 2>We might be losing this war now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so invoke.</v>

1791
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:13.040
<v Speaker 2>But when you got guys like 1939 that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking eugenics and um,</v>

1792
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:18.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher calling for breeding and</v>

1793
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.700
<v Speaker 2>segregation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1794
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.590
<v Speaker 2>early on you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1795
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:23.933
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that guy.</v>

1796
01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Gonna beat him to death with my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's massive.</v>

1797
01:22:27.811 --> 01:22:31.400
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be a pretty good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

1798
01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:34.410
<v Speaker 2>there we go form Nazi cult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to.</v>

1799
01:22:34.411 --> 01:22:35.910
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

1801
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:39.690
<v Speaker 2>What is the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

1802
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:41.640
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a marketing thing because</v>

1803
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:44.100
<v Speaker 2>it's still the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reformed Nazi,</v>

1804
01:22:44.101 --> 01:22:46.470
<v Speaker 2>cult trying to open it's colony to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tourism.</v>

1805
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.180
<v Speaker 2>And where's this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in Chile.</v>

1806
01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time.</v>

1807
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:54.870
<v Speaker 2>They're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made a movie about it.</v>

1808
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:59.340
<v Speaker 2>So that's current day right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1809
01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:03.450
<v Speaker 2>That later hose in range is freaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>gorgeous though.</v>

1810
01:23:03.451 --> 01:23:04.051
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1811
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:09.051
<v Speaker 2>it is Shangri a German flag flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've tried to hide the Nazi things</v>

1812
01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 2>they've had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had dinner right there.</v>

1813
01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Look at them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1814
01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That got in the left.</v>

1815
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:17.143
<v Speaker 2>Do you really?</v>

1816
01:23:18.710 --> 01:23:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that bro?</v>

1817
01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:23.240
<v Speaker 2>We talked in the butchery there is right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1818
01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had this guy with me,</v>

1819
01:23:28.101 --> 01:23:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Mike Simpson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is a,</v>

1820
01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:34.580
<v Speaker 2>he works with me a sheepdog response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a doctor.</v>

1821
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:38.990
<v Speaker 2>He was a ranger that became a green</v>
<v Speaker 2>beret that then went to medical school</v>

1822
01:23:38.991 --> 01:23:40.820
<v Speaker 2>and then came back to special</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations,</v>

1823
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:43.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of the war.</v>

1824
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:45.830
<v Speaker 2>And he's our director of training for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheepdog response.</v>

1825
01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.900
<v Speaker 2>He was with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and I both speak Spanish when we were</v>

1826
01:23:47.901 --> 01:23:49.580
<v Speaker 2>down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't know that he was a</v>

1827
01:23:49.581 --> 01:23:52.640
<v Speaker 2>doctor and they didn't know that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoke Spanish and they didn't know that</v>

1828
01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:56.390
<v Speaker 2>our translator that looked very Chilean</v>
<v Speaker 2>could also speak German,</v>

1829
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:58.730
<v Speaker 2>perfect German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She translates for Porsche,</v>

1830
01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.000
<v Speaker 2>so they thought that they could have all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little conversations with the</v>

1831
01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:07.430
<v Speaker 2>stupid hairy handed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Irish guy hosts from the tourism</v>

1832
01:24:07.431 --> 01:24:10.020
<v Speaker 2>channel that [inaudible] they could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1833
01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we understood everything that they're</v>

1834
01:24:12.571 --> 01:24:16.710
<v Speaker 2>saying are they saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of our tour guides was formally a</v>

1835
01:24:16.711 --> 01:24:21.540
<v Speaker 2>nurse in the hospital that they closed</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and we stole one of their little ID</v>

1836
01:24:21.541 --> 01:24:24.810
<v Speaker 2>cards to get into that hospital and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>stole a bunch of documents of them</v>

1837
01:24:24.811 --> 01:24:28.410
<v Speaker 2>documenting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>torturing little kids in the hospital</v>

1838
01:24:28.411 --> 01:24:30.730
<v Speaker 2>and the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this made the air because it's,</v>

1839
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:32.760
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much litigation going on</v>

1840
01:24:32.761 --> 01:24:36.900
<v Speaker 2>where all of these victims of Colonia</v>
<v Speaker 2>dignity that are suing via Bavaria.</v>

1841
01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:39.290
<v Speaker 2>And what time period are you talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about when they were torturing kids?</v>

1842
01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Like when was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixties to nineties.</v>

1843
01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:44.533
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1844
01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:50.420
<v Speaker 2>And so this is essentially Nazis and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors of Nazis carrying on those</v>

1845
01:24:50.421 --> 01:24:54.980
<v Speaker 2>practices in secret</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1846
01:24:54.981 --> 01:24:55.814
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1847
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't just people that got away with it.</v>

1848
01:24:57.891 --> 01:25:00.710
<v Speaker 2>And then their ancestors moved here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they evolved and changed.</v>

1849
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And what you do at that place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said the pitchers that,</v>

1850
01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:03.590
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1851
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:08.590
<v Speaker 2>that place is worth maybe $100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they bought that with Nazi money.</v>

1852
01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:12.590
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does that go?</v>

1853
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Where does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the Nazi money.</v>

1854
01:25:15.951 --> 01:25:19.760
<v Speaker 2>We're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking melted fillings from Jews</v>

1855
01:25:19.761 --> 01:25:22.920
<v Speaker 2>mouths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking wedding rings off of Jews</v>

1856
01:25:22.921 --> 01:25:25.940
<v Speaker 2>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bought that land with that money.</v>

1857
01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.090
<v Speaker 2>It's gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1858
01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:33.350
<v Speaker 2>And they have a German colony there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1859
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what the right answer is.</v>

1860
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1861
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.020
<v Speaker 2>how does Chili feel about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chile has been in a tough position</v>

1862
01:25:39.021 --> 01:25:43.130
<v Speaker 2>because of the amount of power that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had their nobody.</v>

1863
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:44.600
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1864
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:49.370
<v Speaker 2>in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were at behest of the president.</v>

1865
01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:52.170
<v Speaker 2>They were bringing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1866
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:57.430
<v Speaker 2>people that disagreed with the dictator</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were torturing them and they're</v>

1867
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.540
<v Speaker 2>getting that information and giving it</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the president.</v>

1868
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that went on for like 10 years.</v>

1869
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.330
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis were doing that for yes,</v>

1870
01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:10.880
<v Speaker 2>for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1871
01:26:10.881 --> 01:26:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I cannot believe I have whoever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator was so embarrassed.</v>

1872
01:26:14.151 --> 01:26:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's around the tip of my tongue</v>

1873
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:19.340
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that information they also had.</v>

1874
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:24.550
<v Speaker 2>So not only the information went back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president that he could use against</v>

1875
01:26:25.461 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 2>his rivals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also had it so they know all</v>

1876
01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:33.380
<v Speaker 2>the dirt about everybody they know who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is having sex with who,</v>

1877
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:36.140
<v Speaker 2>who has a kid with who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who went to this prostitute place,</v>

1878
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.220
<v Speaker 2>who has a deal with the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's working with the Venezuelans,</v>

1879
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:41.930
<v Speaker 2>who's working with the Argentinians.</v>

1880
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Like they have all that dirt because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave it to the president.</v>

1881
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.940
<v Speaker 2>They have it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had been untouchable politically</v>

1882
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.630
<v Speaker 2>for 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years because they had so much power</v>

1883
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 2>because they had so much information</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had so much dirt on every</v>

1884
01:26:58.221 --> 01:27:01.370
<v Speaker 2>single high ranking person in South</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1885
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1886
01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.770
<v Speaker 2>That's been a tricky year for me from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show.</v>

1887
01:27:06.771 --> 01:27:10.550
<v Speaker 2>And then straight into hard to kill show</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the discovery channel from going</v>

1888
01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>then deployed to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this year.</v>

1889
01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even.</v>

1890
01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.520
<v Speaker 2>How does that all work while you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>still serving?</v>

1891
01:27:16.521 --> 01:27:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you get the freedom to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things when you read</v>

1892
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.820
<v Speaker 2>after you reenlisted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the army will always get with the</v>

1893
01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:24.770
<v Speaker 2>army once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1894
01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.930
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to help them.</v>

1895
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Having you be so high profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge presented live of the</v>

1896
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:31.724
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>

1897
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:34.250
<v Speaker 2>If you're listening to right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to your local recruiter.</v>

1898
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.600
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously we are having special forces</v>

1899
01:27:38.601 --> 01:27:41.810
<v Speaker 2>specifically we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to have the biggest deficit</v>

1900
01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.200
<v Speaker 2>of eligible up a pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a population to select from because you</v>

1901
01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:50.060
<v Speaker 2>have to have a certain level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

1902
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:53.810
<v Speaker 2>a certain level of physicality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to be eligible for special forces</v>

1903
01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:57.080
<v Speaker 2>to pick from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That pool is the smallest that has ever</v>

1904
01:27:57.081 --> 01:28:00.590
<v Speaker 2>been in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why kids are playing video games.</v>

1905
01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:05.620
<v Speaker 2>They're not eating cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm less participation in sports.</v>

1906
01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you could just go to a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

1907
01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.090
<v Speaker 2>it'll at a high schooler now compared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago.</v>

1908
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1909
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1910
01:28:13.651 --> 01:28:17.720
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we weren't like barely getting kids past</v>

1911
01:28:17.721 --> 01:28:20.810
<v Speaker 2>obesity 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in high school</v>

1912
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:24.710
<v Speaker 2>if you walk into a classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half the kids are obese,</v>

1913
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:27.350
<v Speaker 2>so you think this is just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sedentary because they're</v>

1914
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:29.780
<v Speaker 2>playing video games and fucking around</v>
<v Speaker 2>online all day.</v>

1915
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:33.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not me thinking this is us.</v>

1916
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quantifiably saying we do not have</v>

1917
01:28:36.051 --> 01:28:38.230
<v Speaker 2>enough people to to pick from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1918
01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.440
<v Speaker 2>That would be one of the best ways to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really find out what the actual average</v>

1919
01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:47.600
<v Speaker 2>health of viable males is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1920
01:28:47.601 --> 01:28:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1921
01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:52.970
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be the best of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best that want to test themselves.</v>

1922
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just always how it's been.</v>

1923
01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we teach 100 forces.</v>

1924
01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:00.320
<v Speaker 2>We only have that 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only get six or eight,</v>

1925
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's a hundred people that go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>special forces selection.</v>

1926
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>That hundred that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to have a GT score.</v>

1927
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 2>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to have us scores high enough</v>

1928
01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 2>on the military entrance exams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to be eligible.</v>

1929
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.070
<v Speaker 2>They have to have a pt score high enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be eligible so we can't even get</v>

1930
01:29:17.071 --> 01:29:20.790
<v Speaker 2>that 100 and then 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only eight or the eight of them are</v>

1931
01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:21.624
<v Speaker 2>making it.</v>

1932
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.950
<v Speaker 2>So we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're.</v>

1933
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.430
<v Speaker 2>This is to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I'm able to do these things is I'm</v>

1934
01:29:26.431 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 2>in a position where I can say for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>love of God,</v>

1935
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:32.730
<v Speaker 2>please get healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please walk to your recruiter's office</v>

1936
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>and please take a test to see if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>eligible because we are just needing</v>

1937
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:39.000
<v Speaker 2>people like we've never needed them</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1938
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.300
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1939
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the best indications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean most people don't know or people</v>

1940
01:29:46.531 --> 01:29:48.540
<v Speaker 2>like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 50 year old father,</v>

1942
01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:52.090

<v Speaker 2>high school kids look.</v>

1943
01:29:52.630 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't have no idea.</v>

<v Speaker 2>pen and stabbing it into his own eye</v>

1947
01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:06.420
<v Speaker 2>because he just can't get somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't smoking weed.</v>

01:30:15.031 --> 01:30:20.031
<v Speaker 2>So we measure their neck and their waist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can't even pass that.</v>

1952
01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.250
<v Speaker 2>So the two fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two fat is the neck too little or</v>

1953
01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:24.440
<v Speaker 2>too big?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1954
01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.140
<v Speaker 2>so if you have a big neck and a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>waste,</v>

1955
01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:30.870
<v Speaker 2>this is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like I have a big neck,</v>

1956
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's from working out.</v>

1957
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have a tiny little waist so that</v>

1958
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.650
<v Speaker 2>gives me my bmi and my body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They measure it.</v>

1959
01:30:37.651 --> 01:30:40.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a gross measurement,</v>

1960
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:43.330
<v Speaker 2>height,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and measurement and the other.</v>

1961
01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 2>There's only like four things that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need for some,</v>

1962
01:30:45.810 --> 01:30:47.850
<v Speaker 2>for us to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's harder to get into the military</v>

1963
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:49.230
<v Speaker 2>than it is to get into college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1964
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:50.640
<v Speaker 2>that's absolutely true.</v>

1965
01:30:50.670 --> 01:30:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Not Regular military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but special forest.</v>

1966
01:30:52.511 --> 01:30:54.400
<v Speaker 2>So regular military wives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1968
01:30:55.890 --> 01:31:00.890
<v Speaker 2>It is not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then from that we only pick combat</v>

1969
01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:04.170
<v Speaker 2>arms and then have that combined arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only pick the top 100.</v>

1970
01:31:04.171 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Is it harder for someone to get into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>military than it is to get into college?</v>

1971
01:31:07.381 --> 01:31:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was fairly easy to get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military.</v>

1972
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:13.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure anybody can go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

1973
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:15.111
<v Speaker 2>Anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1974
01:31:15.111 --> 01:31:17.040
<v Speaker 2>you can go to community college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's college,</v>

1975
01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1976
01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it says easy to get</v>

1977
01:31:20.941 --> 01:31:22.470
<v Speaker 2>into Mit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1978
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 2>But anybody can go to any college that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want,</v>

1979
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.620
<v Speaker 2>not any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any college that can get in and they can</v>

1980
01:31:28.621 --> 01:31:33.330
<v Speaker 2>go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a local community college and then two</v>

1981
01:31:33.331 --> 01:31:35.670
<v Speaker 2>years there they can go and get into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next unit,</v>

1982
01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the state school.</v>

1983
01:31:37.021 --> 01:31:38.020
<v Speaker 2>And then from there they can get a good.</v>

1984
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean anybody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't go to the military if you</v>

1985
01:31:40.941 --> 01:31:43.620
<v Speaker 2>smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't go to the military if you have</v>

1986
01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:45.240
<v Speaker 2>bad eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't go to the military.</v>

1987
01:31:45.241 --> 01:31:46.800
<v Speaker 2>If you're diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't go into the military.</v>

1988
01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:47.850
<v Speaker 2>If you have asthma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't go.</v>

1989
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.740
<v Speaker 2>You can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to college if you have all</v>

1990
01:31:49.741 --> 01:31:51.280
<v Speaker 2>those things right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you.</v>

1991
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.390
<v Speaker 2>You can't go into the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your Iq is x number,</v>

1992
01:31:54.391 --> 01:31:56.580
<v Speaker 2>depending on your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can still go to college.</v>

1993
01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.120
<v Speaker 2>You can't go in the military if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't run a mile or two miles in this</v>

1994
01:32:01.121 --> 01:32:03.490
<v Speaker 2>speed and do this number of pushups in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this many sit ups.</v>

1995
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any college has that</v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement,</v>

1996
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:07.960
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just in those seven things alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>

1997
01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:11.290
<v Speaker 2>we just exed out 80 percent of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

1998
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.880
<v Speaker 2>And do you have.</v>

1999
01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Is there also a problem with people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards military</v>

2000
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:19.480
<v Speaker 2>with young people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:20.700
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

2002
01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:24.400
<v Speaker 2>that that is mostly a physical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is way less of an issue.</v>

2003
01:32:24.401 --> 01:32:28.750
<v Speaker 2>The perception of the military is way</v>
<v Speaker 2>less of an issue than us just having a</v>

2004
01:32:28.751 --> 01:32:31.840
<v Speaker 2>qualified population of viable</v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates for us to pick from.</v>

2005
01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really bad where we're.</v>

2006
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 2>We're freaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

2007
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:39.100
<v Speaker 2>We were borderline freaking out about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to do.</v>

2008
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:44.550
<v Speaker 2>So an average special force of Oda has</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to have 12 guys in it.</v>

2009
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2010
01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Now you're not going to find a team that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has more than 10 and</v>

2011
01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.720
<v Speaker 2>we only have 70 percent of our teams</v>
<v Speaker 2>with 10.</v>

2012
01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God we didn't go to war with North</v>

2013
01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got at war ended and that we're not</v>

2014
01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:06.940
<v Speaker 2>dropping nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody because we're in.</v>

2015
01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.920
<v Speaker 2>We're in a hurt locker for qualified</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2016
01:33:09.921 --> 01:33:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Have no idea about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2017
01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.490
<v Speaker 2>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2018
01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:19.410
<v Speaker 2>So this is like part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the best ways to measure what's</v>

2019
01:33:19.411 --> 01:33:20.970
<v Speaker 2>wrong with the way people are living</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2020
01:33:21.150 --> 01:33:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean forget about whether or not they</v>

2021
01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.600
<v Speaker 2>want to go and serve the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2022
01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.530
<v Speaker 2>the viable quality candidates like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A number of them that are even available</v>

2023
01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.620
<v Speaker 2>is the lowest it's ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2024
01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:38.420
<v Speaker 2>what about high school athletics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2025
01:33:38.421 --> 01:33:39.960
<v Speaker 2>have they decreased?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finished?</v>

2026
01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really at the same rate.</v>

2027
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.580
<v Speaker 2>The part very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar.</v>

2028
01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.880
<v Speaker 2>The participation in not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can go and play for your,</v>

2029
01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.860
<v Speaker 2>the rec time volleyball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to get onto the varsity football</v>

2030
01:33:57.861 --> 01:34:00.770
<v Speaker 2>team or the varsity volleyball team or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the varsity track team,</v>

2031
01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:03.590
<v Speaker 2>the number of people in percentage to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2032
01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:08.450
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had 100 of them that were picked to</v>

2033
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:11.320
<v Speaker 2>participate in those athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice way.</v>

2034
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Ten percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That number now is down to like five or</v>

2035
01:34:14.361 --> 01:34:16.250
<v Speaker 2>six percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2036
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.630
<v Speaker 2>the overall percentage per capita and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of people participating in</v>

2037
01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:25.610
<v Speaker 2>these sports has been consistently</v>
<v Speaker 2>decreasing for the past 20 years.</v>

2038
01:34:27.170 --> 01:34:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years in 20 years is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Internet became a huge thing.</v>

2039
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's basically the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>timeline you're looking at like 94,</v>

2040
01:34:34.641 --> 01:34:36.800
<v Speaker 2>99.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see obesity going like this,</v>

2041
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:42.590
<v Speaker 2>you've got bad food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to.</v>

2042
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Our jobs are getting less and less</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical that the focus on what jobs</v>

2043
01:34:48.591 --> 01:34:50.870
<v Speaker 2>people should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's been like no,</v>

2044
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.480
<v Speaker 2>go to college and become an academic.</v>

2045
01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.570
<v Speaker 2>So you can be this intellectual that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go and do this job.</v>

2046
01:34:56.571 --> 01:34:59.450
<v Speaker 2>And then you graduate college with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>student loan and you have no job to go</v>

2047
01:34:59.451 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2048
01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.050
<v Speaker 2>where there's this guy that needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>welders,</v>

2049
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:05.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's not cool to be a welder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so don't,</v>

2050
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:09.740
<v Speaker 2>don't do that or to be a mechanic like</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these trade jobs that are just</v>

2051
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 2>begging and pleading for and they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes physical but they need people.</v>

2052
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's not core to do that because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2053
01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:18.240
<v Speaker 2>like I want to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go to long beach state or I want</v>

2054
01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:23.250
<v Speaker 2>to go to ucla or I want to go hang out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of hot chicks.</v>

2055
01:35:23.361 --> 01:35:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Lsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2056
01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.310
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focus has been wrong for awhile and</v>

2057
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:31.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is evident in special forces</v>

2058
01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:33.050
<v Speaker 2>selection when we don't have anybody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick from,</v>

2059
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.630
<v Speaker 2>we can't select,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2060
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:38.030
<v Speaker 2>why don't we hear about this?</v>

2061
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Is this something that I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep hush hush or it has been a problem</v>

2062
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:49.330
<v Speaker 2>because our community motto is the quiet</v>
<v Speaker 2>professionals.</v>

2063
01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.560
<v Speaker 2>That's our motto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you fit into that?</v>

2064
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:55.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2065
01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get so much crap all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but thank God like guys that really</v>

2066
01:36:00.651 --> 01:36:05.180
<v Speaker 2>understand what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realize I don't shut up because I'm</v>

2067
01:36:05.181 --> 01:36:08.870
<v Speaker 2>trying to help the regiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying the best ways that I can,</v>

2068
01:36:08.871 --> 01:36:11.720
<v Speaker 2>the best ways that we can figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people way smarter than me helping</v>

2069
01:36:11.721 --> 01:36:15.410
<v Speaker 2>me know I was on the phone yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some of the best and brightest in</v>

2070
01:36:15.411 --> 01:36:18.320
<v Speaker 2>the special operations recruiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>battalion about how were we going to fix</v>

2071
01:36:18.321 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to market,</v>

2072
01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:22.910
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to develop interest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2073
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:25.520
<v Speaker 2>so thankfully they're smarter than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2074
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 2>but we were almost</v>

2075
01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:33.290
<v Speaker 2>screwing ourselves over because that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2076
01:36:34.450 --> 01:36:36.250
<v Speaker 2>how we live and that's how we do our</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

2077
01:36:36.251 --> 01:36:38.170
<v Speaker 2>If you read about us on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we failed.</v>

2078
01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read about army special forces</v>

2079
01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.780
<v Speaker 2>doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may,</v>

2080
01:36:42.781 --> 01:36:44.800
<v Speaker 2>we have done messed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
01:36:44.801 --> 01:36:47.140
<v Speaker 2>this is not the navy seals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not writing books,</v>

2082
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about our exploits.</v>

2083
01:36:49.271 --> 01:36:50.800
<v Speaker 2>We didn't kill bin Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2084
01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:54.760
<v Speaker 2>this is us just doing our work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's supposed to know about it.</v>

2085
01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.580
<v Speaker 2>But because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now have a huge recruiting problem.</v>

2086
01:36:58.910 --> 01:37:01.630
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the approach to try to balance</v>

2087
01:37:01.631 --> 01:37:03.640
<v Speaker 2>that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any strategies in play?</v>

2088
01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked through a bunch.</v>

2089
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to figure out,</v>

2090
01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:09.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2091
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:10.263
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2092
01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.450
<v Speaker 2>just getting the word out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting people know,</v>

2093
01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:19.080
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to get that population healthy.</v>

2094
01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:23.640
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go specifically after athletes.</v>

2095
01:37:23.641 --> 01:37:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to a high school wrestling room</v>

2096
01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:28.560
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey fellas like this.</v>

2097
01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:31.620
<v Speaker 2>That's where I heard about it when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>first heard about army special forces</v>

2098
01:37:31.621 --> 01:37:36.621
<v Speaker 2>was a guy in a really bad cut suit from</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably like JC penny's or macy's</v>

2099
01:37:36.631 --> 01:37:37.231
<v Speaker 2>walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2100
01:37:37.231 --> 01:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

2101
01:37:38.311 --> 01:37:40.770
<v Speaker 2>you ever thought about army special</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces?</v>

2102
01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:42.050
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that is.</v>

2103
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I like the navy seals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2104
01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.341
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check it out.</v>

2105
01:37:44.341 --> 01:37:47.280
<v Speaker 2>And he gave us this crappy car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked away and I never saw him again.</v>

2106
01:37:47.281 --> 01:37:48.950
<v Speaker 2>But that planted that seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2107
01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:50.460
<v Speaker 2>And then nine slash 11 happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2108
01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I know where I'm going to go into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude that had that bad suit.</v>

2109
01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna Find Him Gore for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just we're talking about my show hard</v>

2110
01:37:59.401 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 2>to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2111
01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just army special forces,</v>

2112
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 2>it's marine recon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the navy seals,</v>

2113
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.800
<v Speaker 2>it's air force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>PJ's every special operations that has a</v>

2114
01:38:10.801 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 2>selection process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a population to pick</v>

2115
01:38:14.191 --> 01:38:16.170
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have that body,</v>

2116
01:38:16.171 --> 01:38:19.320
<v Speaker 2>that pool of qualified applicants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>select from.</v>

2117
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 2>So everybody is having the same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

2118
01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 2>let's do the top gun thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's show how cool it is to be an</v>

2119
01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 2>aviator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another job that we don't have enough</v>

2120
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.340
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't have enough pilots.</v>

2121
01:38:31.341 --> 01:38:36.341
<v Speaker 2>So was this the motivation behind hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill part of it to get me.</v>

2122
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:38.940
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why I was allowed to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2123
01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.670
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to have an episode</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single season where I'm going to</v>

2124
01:38:41.671 --> 01:38:46.671
<v Speaker 2>highlight some crazy bad ass military</v>
<v Speaker 2>job doing things that way.</v>

2125
01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:50.580
<v Speaker 2>You're going to jump off a Zodiac a mile</v>
<v Speaker 2>from water,</v>

2126
01:38:50.581 --> 01:38:54.450
<v Speaker 2>you're going to swim in to walk for</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles with a rucksack to them.</v>

2127
01:38:54.451 --> 01:38:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Go do a raid on a bomb makers house</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging off the side of a players with a</v>

2128
01:38:59.010 --> 01:39:00.440
<v Speaker 2>machine gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2129
01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:02.820
<v Speaker 2>so just like freaking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is the job.</v>

2130
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:06.990
<v Speaker 2>So let's show them what this job is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's show them how hard it is because</v>

2131
01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not easy stuff that these guys</v>

2132
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:14.490
<v Speaker 2>do and hopefully somebody will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspired and somebody would be like,</v>

2133
01:39:14.491 --> 01:39:15.031
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

2134
01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Get off the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

2135
01:39:16.101 --> 01:39:18.810
<v Speaker 2>what is hard to kill?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've heard of it,</v>

2136
01:39:18.811 --> 01:39:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really haven't looked into it.</v>

2137
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tried so hard to get discovery</v>

2138
01:39:23.731 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 2>channel to let you show the first bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2139
01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.160
<v Speaker 2>They won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

2140
01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't see.</v>

2141
01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.140
<v Speaker 2>They said it's a hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>

2142
01:39:31.141 --> 01:39:32.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a rough cut.</v>

2143
01:39:32.611 --> 01:39:34.530
<v Speaker 2>And they want everything perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2144
01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Well when they get it perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send it to me.</v>

2145
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 2>We'll play it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we find a job that is inherently</v>

2146
01:39:40.621 --> 01:39:45.621
<v Speaker 2>dangerous that people die and doing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>is necessary for our way of life.</v>

2147
01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the first part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We find whatever that is that um,</v>

2148
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:55.020
<v Speaker 2>that might be a guy that changes light</v>
<v Speaker 2>bulbs at the top of Cell Towers.</v>

2149
01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.140
<v Speaker 2>That might be somebody that's hanging</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the side of a building,</v>

2150
01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Washington windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be an experimental test</v>

2151
01:39:59.731 --> 01:40:02.220
<v Speaker 2>pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be somebody that works on a</v>

2152
01:40:02.221 --> 01:40:04.230
<v Speaker 2>bull ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2153
01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.790
<v Speaker 2>it might be a guy that delivering</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics in Alaska to families that</v>

2154
01:40:08.791 --> 01:40:11.700
<v Speaker 2>live out in the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not necessarily military jobs</v>

2155
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:13.710
<v Speaker 2>now we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's jobs in general.</v>

2156
01:40:13.711 --> 01:40:13.891
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2157
01:40:13.891 --> 01:40:14.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2158
01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I think we only do one military job in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this first season.</v>

2159
01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:18.861
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2160
01:40:18.861 --> 01:40:20.580
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I have a very distorted</v>

2161
01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:23.040
<v Speaker 2>perception of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought hard to kill was all about</v>

2162
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.090
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

2163
01:40:24.091 --> 01:40:25.380
<v Speaker 2>just one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2164
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.440
<v Speaker 2>it's anybody anywhere that does</v>
<v Speaker 2>something necessary for our way of life</v>

2165
01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 2>and they die doing their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2166
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:36.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm trying to highlight and I'm</v>

2167
01:40:36.751 --> 01:40:40.080
<v Speaker 2>trying to pay homage and respect to</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that nobody thinks about or</v>

2168
01:40:40.081 --> 01:40:41.700
<v Speaker 2>appreciates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2169
01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:44.250
<v Speaker 2>like let's walk on our southwest flight</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're like,</v>

2170
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:45.084
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2171
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:47.730
<v Speaker 2>can I get my beverage service and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>peanuts man.</v>

2172
01:40:47.731 --> 01:40:50.820
<v Speaker 2>But in the fifties and sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average life expectancy of an</v>

2173
01:40:50.821 --> 01:40:52.980
<v Speaker 2>experimental test pilot was like four</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2174
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have stories that these sr 71 pilots</v>

2175
01:40:57.010 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 2>that are flying at mach two and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole entire thing just disintegrates</v>

2176
01:41:00.341 --> 01:41:02.500
<v Speaker 2>around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the guys has killed instantly,</v>

2177
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.910
<v Speaker 2>the other guy starts falling.</v>

2178
01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I think there's like 30,000 feet in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air strapped to his chair.</v>

2179
01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:11.650
<v Speaker 2>So we can't even use this parachute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wakes up,</v>

2180
01:41:11.651 --> 01:41:13.690
<v Speaker 2>he's blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't look at it as visor because his</v>

2181
01:41:13.691 --> 01:41:17.950
<v Speaker 2>visors frozen and he just did a deadspin</v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen at 200 miles an hour at any</v>

2182
01:41:17.951 --> 01:41:19.340
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

2183
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Because he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

2184
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:22.840
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did he live?</v>

2185
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recreate that whole entire thing in</v>

2186
01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:27.690
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that.</v>

2187
01:41:27.691 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm full stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

2188
01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm done man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did that?</v>

2189
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come over there.</v>

2190
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It's very tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did this guy survive?</v>

2191
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:41.870
<v Speaker 2>So he wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2192
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in a free fall.</v>

2193
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:46.750
<v Speaker 2>He strapped to his chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His parachute won't deploy his visors</v>

2194
01:41:46.751 --> 01:41:48.440
<v Speaker 2>frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2195
01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:53.700
<v Speaker 2>he gets his harness off and then he goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the box which is free fall</v>

2196
01:41:53.741 --> 01:41:55.870
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which kind of stabilizes.</v>

2197
01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Super impressive that he knew how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the first place.</v>

2198
01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.660
<v Speaker 2>A lot of pilots never even practiced</v>
<v Speaker 2>free fall.</v>

2199
01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.660
<v Speaker 2>So He's free falling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And first,</v>

2200
01:42:05.530 --> 01:42:09.010
<v Speaker 2>let's remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was a combat pilot in Vietnam</v>

2201
01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:11.470
<v Speaker 2>and in Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2202
01:42:11.471 --> 01:42:11.761
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2203
01:42:11.761 --> 01:42:14.230
<v Speaker 2>this guy has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually been shot down before,</v>

2204
01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:18.040
<v Speaker 2>so pretty heroic fella and he gets out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his harness,</v>

2205
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:20.860
<v Speaker 2>he's in the box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he deploys his parachute in the box</v>

2206
01:42:20.861 --> 01:42:22.300
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do it?</v>

2207
01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:23.050
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2208
01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:26.200
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty much driving your hips</v>
<v Speaker 2>down as a massive sprawl.</v>

2209
01:42:26.630 --> 01:42:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

2210
01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you're driving your hips</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to massive sprawl.</v>

2211
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Your arms are pushed back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so air is evenly flowing off of your</v>

2212
01:42:34.451 --> 01:42:36.550
<v Speaker 2>body from spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you stable.</v>

2213
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:39.790
<v Speaker 2>So the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the friction of the air off of your body</v>

2214
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.750
<v Speaker 2>makes you stop spinning in circles or</v>
<v Speaker 2>tumbling overhead.</v>

2215
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.140
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of his,</v>

2216
01:42:46.141 --> 01:42:49.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>center sat parachute,</v>

2217
01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:52.810
<v Speaker 2>he naturally had weight on his hips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which dropped his hips down.</v>

2218
01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:57.760
<v Speaker 2>And then he just kind of stabilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coincidentally through his parachute and</v>

2219
01:42:57.761 --> 01:43:00.130
<v Speaker 2>the lat landed on his records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was on fire.</v>

2220
01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Which we recreated for me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got burnt pretty jacked up.</v>

2222
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:08.080
<v Speaker 2>They put me inside of a experimental</v>
<v Speaker 2>test plane,</v>

2223
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:11.320
<v Speaker 2>put aviation fluid on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locked the cabinets,</v>

2224
01:43:11.410 --> 01:43:15.220
<v Speaker 2>are locked the cockpit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then set it on fire with me inside</v>

2225
01:43:15.221 --> 01:43:17.530
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you do this?</v>

2226
01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not even like real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're choosing to do this.</v>

2227
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they did it.</v>

2228
01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>They did it and they survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're doing it to recreate it in</v>

2229
01:43:30.431 --> 01:43:32.080
<v Speaker 2>their honor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we have,</v>

2230
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are there,</v>

2231
01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>there are safety measures in place where</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I only got,</v>

2232
01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Kinda got burned so my shirt got melted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my.</v>

2233
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 2>I was able to get out of my seat belt</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my seatbelt melted.</v>

2234
01:43:43.710 --> 01:43:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought out because it melted.</v>

2235
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

2236
01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And then I was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get the cockpit open because</v>

2237
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:50.920
<v Speaker 2>the cockpit held.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mel had melted,</v>

2238
01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.620
<v Speaker 2>so I just tore the cockpit open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2239
01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:59.860
<v Speaker 2>but we are maybe one or two seconds away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the fire department just descending</v>

2240
01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:04.580
<v Speaker 2>upon me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save my life and then take me to the</v>

2241
01:44:04.581 --> 01:44:09.581
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the motivation is everybody I think</v>

2242
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.520
<v Speaker 2>takes for granted all of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have in our life and there are some</v>

2243
01:44:15.561 --> 01:44:20.300
<v Speaker 2>pretty heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>courageous people that risk at every</v>

2244
01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.220
<v Speaker 2>single day to do these jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get our food,</v>

2245
01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.820
<v Speaker 2>to get our oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that stuff is pumped from the</v>

2246
01:44:25.821 --> 01:44:28.460
<v Speaker 2>center of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes know there's a guy diving</v>

2247
01:44:28.461 --> 01:44:32.180
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing helium and nitrogen at a few</v>

2248
01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:36.470
<v Speaker 2>hundred feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messing with gases that if he cuts just</v>

2249
01:44:36.471 --> 01:44:39.830
<v Speaker 2>one millimeter to deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get sucked into the pipe</v>

2250
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.670
<v Speaker 2>because the negative pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know guys that are flying a plane,</v>

2251
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:46.790
<v Speaker 2>there's no test dummy for flying a</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>

2252
01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:47.983
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2253
01:44:48.170 --> 01:44:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Some dude is going to sit inside of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane sometime and be like,</v>

2254
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:53.830
<v Speaker 2>let's say fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if this works.</v>

2255
01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about the whole thing on that too.</v>

2256
01:44:56.250 --> 01:44:59.330
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the whole point was we wanted</v>

2257
01:44:59.331 --> 01:45:03.440
<v Speaker 2>to show and there's hundreds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of people that do these jobs</v>

2258
01:45:03.441 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 2>that we just don't think about in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of a hurricane.</v>

2259
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Like how has your power still on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's somebody out there trying to fix</v>

2260
01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:12.530
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2261
01:45:12.570 --> 01:45:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you're in the middle of a blizzard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just feet and feet of snow or descending</v>

2262
01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:17.720
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's power lines and you think</v>

2263
01:45:17.721 --> 01:45:18.710
<v Speaker 2>they're just staying up there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2264
01:45:18.711 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's somebody hanging off the side of</v>

2265
01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:25.340
<v Speaker 2>that tower that's negative 20 outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's trying to fix that stuff.</v>

2266
01:45:25.341 --> 01:45:27.320
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your heater stays on so you don't</v>

2267
01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:29.600
<v Speaker 2>freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to get one of those planes</v>

2268
01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:30.830
<v Speaker 2>that flies into hurricanes?</v>

2269
01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2270
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:36.620
<v Speaker 2>we do the dumbest stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to do that?</v>

2271
01:45:36.621 --> 01:45:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are?</v>

2272
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about putting me at the bottom of a,</v>

2273
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.140
<v Speaker 2>of a mountain and setting off an</v>
<v Speaker 2>avalanche?</v>

2274
01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:43.791
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2275
01:45:43.791 --> 01:45:44.780
<v Speaker 2>let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take it.</v>

2276
01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to do that or are we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that?</v>

2277
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't die.</v>

2278
01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I like you?</v>

2279
01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:54.110
<v Speaker 2>An [inaudible] to helicopter and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arctic Ocean and go and crash it into</v>

2280
01:45:54.111 --> 01:45:58.460
<v Speaker 2>the ocean and then make me swim to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>iceberg and live on the iceberg.</v>

2281
01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2282
01:45:59.361 --> 01:46:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I did that because somebody else did on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the iceberg for I was too,</v>

2283
01:46:02.610 --> 01:46:04.320
<v Speaker 2>too cold account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2284
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:06.020
<v Speaker 2>what I had to do once I got to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>iceberg,</v>

2285
01:46:06.021 --> 01:46:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I had to get my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had like these tasks that I had to do</v>

2286
01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:12.350
<v Speaker 2>for them to come and get me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once the helicopter went underwater</v>

2287
01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:16.250
<v Speaker 2>and I had to swim down into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter and the water was 33 degrees</v>

2288
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:17.690
<v Speaker 2>and then I just swam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was about,</v>

2289
01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few hundred meters and it's 33 degree</v>

2290
01:46:20.811 --> 01:46:24.590
<v Speaker 2>water is about 30 minutes total time in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 33 degree water.</v>

2291
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I fortunately was able to bounce some</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas off of Calkins,</v>

2292
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Berrien and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went hoff and a bunch of guys from on it</v>

2293
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:33.710
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty into that cold weather</v>

2294
01:46:33.711 --> 01:46:34.544
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cold.</v>

2295
01:46:36.090 --> 01:46:38.240
<v Speaker 2>What did that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does kyle know about swimming in</v>

2296
01:46:38.241 --> 01:46:39.950
<v Speaker 2>the ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't three degrees.</v>

2297
01:46:39.951 --> 01:46:42.620
<v Speaker 2>He knows about the extreme temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2298
01:46:42.621 --> 01:46:45.250
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does the contrast showers and like</v>

2299
01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.560
<v Speaker 2>the heart rate breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was just trying.</v>

2300
01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I experimented a bunch of it before I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went and did the episode to make sure I</v>

2301
01:46:52.351 --> 01:46:54.690
<v Speaker 2>didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much time can you spend in that</v>

2302
01:46:54.691 --> 01:46:56.340
<v Speaker 2>water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was only like a few</v>

2303
01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.173
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they said.</v>

2304
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2305
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I wonder were in there for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see how long I could do it.</v>

2306
01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so once I lost small motor function so I</v>

2307
01:47:05.911 --> 01:47:07.650
<v Speaker 2>couldn't move my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2308
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I could still swim.</v>

2309
01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:13.700
<v Speaker 2>So then once I could have my arms went</v>
<v Speaker 2>next but I could still kind of do the</v>

2310
01:47:13.951 --> 01:47:18.270
<v Speaker 2>eggbeater kick from swimming and water</v>
<v Speaker 2>polo and that lasted about another eight</v>

2311
01:47:18.271 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 2>or nine minutes and then it was Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was just trying to keep my head</v>

2312
01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:23.710
<v Speaker 2>above water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2313
01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:26.490
<v Speaker 2>and then they sent him the rescue diver</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pulled me out.</v>

2314
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took me four hours to get moving to,</v>

2315
01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:37.210
<v Speaker 2>to be able to move again for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't,</v>

2316
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:40.710
<v Speaker 2>they can't warm you back up either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

2317
01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:43.440
<v Speaker 2>like they put you in a sleeping bag but</v>
<v Speaker 2>no heater and no,</v>

2318
01:47:43.650 --> 01:47:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you have to very slowly because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into shock if you warm up too fast.</v>

2319
01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2320
01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:49.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2321
01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have,</v>

2322
01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:53.253
<v Speaker 2>should've been a golfer.</v>

2323
01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:58.470
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't have worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiger Woods is surging again,</v>

2324
01:47:58.530 --> 01:47:59.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2325
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the heck.</v>

2326
01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.670
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have got bored.</v>

2327
01:48:04.590 --> 01:48:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Bush pilot and Alaskan Bush pilot</v>

2328
01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:09.670
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2329
01:48:09.670 --> 01:48:13.050
<v Speaker 2>they like deliver food to these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>living out in the middle of nowhere in</v>

2330
01:48:13.051 --> 01:48:18.051
<v Speaker 2>Alaska and he's flying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>an engine stops.</v>

2331
01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:19.410
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2332
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:21.930
<v Speaker 2>that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it auto rotation is,</v>

2333
01:48:21.931 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 2>they still have a little bit of lift</v>
<v Speaker 2>from just the friction of the blades so</v>

2334
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:30.750
<v Speaker 2>they kind of can control because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blades are still kind of like rutgers.</v>

2335
01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.040
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about a helicopter</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter so they can somewhat control</v>

2336
01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:38.370
<v Speaker 2>their descent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he finds an iceberg and he's like,</v>

2337
01:48:38.371 --> 01:48:40.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go crash by that iceberg.</v>

2338
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:45.180
<v Speaker 2>So it goes and crashes by the ass near</v>
<v Speaker 2>the iceberg and the helicopter</v>

2339
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:47.550
<v Speaker 2>submerging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he dives into this emerging</v>

2340
01:48:47.551 --> 01:48:49.470
<v Speaker 2>helicopter to get his survival</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment.</v>

2341
01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:54.890
<v Speaker 2>And then he swims over to the iceberg</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he sets his kinda like shelter up</v>

2342
01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.900
<v Speaker 2>and then he has to fight off polar bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a couple of days.</v>

2343
01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 2>He lifts this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude survives.</v>

2344
01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.610
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

2345
01:49:02.611 --> 01:49:06.870
<v Speaker 2>the source for our Bush pilot episode</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this one guy,</v>

2346
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:10.950
<v Speaker 2>but there's hundreds and hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories of these guys crashing all the</v>

2347
01:49:10.951 --> 01:49:14.520
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just try to figure out what the</v>

2348
01:49:14.521 --> 01:49:16.560
<v Speaker 2>job is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it's hard,</v>

2349
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:19.050
<v Speaker 2>why it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what is the worst case</v>

2350
01:49:19.051 --> 01:49:21.000
<v Speaker 2>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the worst day on the job?</v>

2351
01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.180
<v Speaker 2>And let's see what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you find off the polar bears?</v>

2352
01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:25.471
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

2353
01:49:25.471 --> 01:49:28.230
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a raft like the,</v>

2354
01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:30.960
<v Speaker 2>his flotation raft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was an inverted,</v>

2355
01:49:30.961 --> 01:49:34.560
<v Speaker 2>which he had turned into like a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>Igloo and he could hear the bears</v>

2356
01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:38.450
<v Speaker 2>starting to come up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't get dark there.</v>

2357
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:41.790
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the time of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly had like one or two hours of</v>

2358
01:49:41.791 --> 01:49:42.860
<v Speaker 2>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2359
01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.540
<v Speaker 2>so we could still kind of see and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could see the bears coming.</v>

2360
01:49:45.541 --> 01:49:48.730
<v Speaker 2>So he was sitting inside that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoarding super still and they could just</v>

2361
01:49:48.731 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 2>smell that something was off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure out what it was</v>

2362
01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:56.900
<v Speaker 2>and then it would stand up with his raft</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his shoulders and back were banging</v>

2363
01:49:57.401 --> 01:49:59.740
<v Speaker 2>on the big plastic you rafting and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2364
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:03.910
<v Speaker 2>they could figure out what it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was just 12 by 12 raft rising</v>

2365
01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:07.180
<v Speaker 2>and running with them and with lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>noise and that's.</v>

2366
01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 2>And he was able to scare them away I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think three times before you finally</v>

2367
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:11.890
<v Speaker 1>rescued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2368
01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:13.210
<v Speaker 1>No weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no weapons.</v>

2369
01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christ.</v>

2370
01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2371
01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't have those balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2372
01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you would if you were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do whatever you had to do if you</v>

2373
01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:26.020
<v Speaker 1>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polar bears scare me.</v>

2374
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.750
<v Speaker 1>They scare the shit out of me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actively hunt us.</v>

2375
01:50:28.810 --> 01:50:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one of the few animals.</v>

2376
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they do is eat meat.</v>

2377
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Anything that moves largest car on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>more on the planet.</v>

2378
01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that video where they</v>

2379
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:41.620
<v Speaker 1>took a guy from BBC and they put them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big giant glass box,</v>

2380
01:50:41.621 --> 01:50:46.240
<v Speaker 1>like a plexiglass box and put them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the Arctic and polar bear came up,</v>

2381
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:48.460
<v Speaker 1>was trying to bite through the box and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get him.</v>

2382
01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.420
<v Speaker 1>So he's inside the box filming it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing could smell them and it's</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

2384
01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That's when you really get a perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how large they are and it's trying to</v>

2385
01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 1>bite into this box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

2386
01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's the guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2404
01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very disturbing video.</v>

2405
01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:55.990
<v Speaker 1>And it went on for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing left and came back and left</v>

2406
01:51:55.991 --> 01:51:58.270
<v Speaker 1>and came back again and finally they got</v>
<v Speaker 1>him out of there.</v>

2407
01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2408
01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.890
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:52:02.891 --> 01:52:05.680
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't find a polar bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you want to?</v>

2410
01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always going to try to scare them</v>

2411
01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:09.154
<v Speaker 1>off that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm kinda ended really badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But another poor decision in Tim's life,</v>

2413
01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:15.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2414
01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:20.750
<v Speaker 1>the discovery channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the most expensive insured show</v>

2415
01:52:20.751 --> 01:52:22.220
<v Speaker 1>they've ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

2416
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:25.100
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just some things</v>

2417
01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:28.150
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2418
01:52:28.150 --> 01:52:32.750
<v Speaker 2>we know shit took explosives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tnt through them from the side of the</v>

2419
01:52:32.751 --> 01:52:34.850
<v Speaker 2>helicopter to cause avalanches</v>

2420
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.240
<v Speaker 1>that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm in.</v>

2421
01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.920
<v Speaker 1>And so do you have one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflatable suits?</v>

2422
01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:43.740
<v Speaker 1>It keeps you from getting completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed?</v>

2423
01:52:43.770 --> 01:52:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tried that one time</v>

2424
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:49.550
<v Speaker 2>that I definitely use that and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that saved me one time.</v>

2425
01:52:49.551 --> 01:52:52.220
<v Speaker 2>It kept me up on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those things don't keep you from</v>

2426
01:52:52.221 --> 01:52:53.900
<v Speaker 2>being compressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps you on top.</v>

2427
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:58.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like a flotation device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a life preserver for the snow,</v>

2428
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>so it gives you more surface area of</v>
<v Speaker 2>friction which rises you to be like when</v>

2429
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:05.390
<v Speaker 2>you have a big jar of pebbles and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>shake them,</v>

2430
01:53:05.391 --> 01:53:08.330
<v Speaker 2>the biggest ones go to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all that's happening is you're</v>

2431
01:53:08.331 --> 01:53:12.110
<v Speaker 2>trying to make yourself the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>pebble to raise you to the top of this</v>

2432
01:53:12.111 --> 01:53:15.470
<v Speaker 2>huge friction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because most people,</v>

2433
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:19.610
<v Speaker 2>they actually die of traumatic injuries</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the avalanche,</v>

2434
01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:22.220
<v Speaker 2>not from a fixation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2435
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though when they finally put me in</v>

2436
01:53:25.491 --> 01:53:26.860
<v Speaker 2>the avalanche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was low.</v>

2437
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I was inside of the snow for 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the amount of time that the</v>

2438
01:53:31.941 --> 01:53:34.670
<v Speaker 2>network would let us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would let me see if I could survive.</v>

2439
01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:35.750
<v Speaker 2>And I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

2440
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:38.540
<v Speaker 2>a button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I clicked it every minute on the</v>

2441
01:53:38.541 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would leave me in there for another</v>

2442
01:53:40.821 --> 01:53:44.000
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I stayed in for 29,</v>

2443
01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.850
<v Speaker 2>59 and so as soon as it's over 30 they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

2444
01:53:46.851 --> 01:53:48.500
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all the time we allow.</v>

2445
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2446
01:53:49.641 --> 01:53:51.710
<v Speaker 2>What was it like in there for really</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold?</v>

2447
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was super cold.</v>

2448
01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:56.540
<v Speaker 2>It was dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard to figure out which way was</v>

2449
01:53:56.541 --> 01:53:58.250
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2450
01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.180
<v Speaker 2>so I figured out which way was up</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was able to,</v>

2451
01:54:02.181 --> 01:54:05.780
<v Speaker 2>like I took my snowboard and goggles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put them over my mouth.</v>

2452
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:09.680
<v Speaker 2>So the snow went side initially have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of um,</v>

2453
01:54:10.110 --> 01:54:14.810
<v Speaker 2>a few breaths of air because what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is you get a ice seal around</v>

2454
01:54:14.811 --> 01:54:18.710
<v Speaker 2>your face from you exhaling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>melting,</v>

2455
01:54:18.730 --> 01:54:23.540
<v Speaker 2>it freezes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you have this cocoon of no fresh</v>

2456
01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:24.374
<v Speaker 2>air coming in.</v>

2457
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:25.693
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2458
01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I was able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I locked my hand inside of my helmet</v>

2459
01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:32.090
<v Speaker 2>and I held my goggles over my mouth so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have a little bit of air.</v>

2460
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:35.570
<v Speaker 2>So then I was able to take that off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it over my son and I have a little</v>

2461
01:54:35.571 --> 01:54:40.571
<v Speaker 2>bit of air here and that was like moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>snow with my pinned hand too.</v>

2462
01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:46.060
<v Speaker 2>But then I saw a drip of water drip off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my glasses at a 45 degree angle to my</v>

2463
01:54:46.281 --> 01:54:47.114
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2464
01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:48.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up is that way.</v>

2465
01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:50.810
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like the best thing for my</v>

2466
01:54:50.811 --> 01:54:54.240
<v Speaker 2>brain to know which way up was because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the only way you could tell was</v>

2467
01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:56.180
<v Speaker 2>because you just your waiting list and</v>
<v Speaker 2>snow.</v>

2468
01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy feeling.</v>

2469
01:54:58.341 --> 01:55:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't know where the up is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2470
01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.570
<v Speaker 2>So up could be your feet.</v>

2471
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2472
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:09.710
<v Speaker 2>And you wouldn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just gravity watching that drop of</v>

2473
01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:14.711
<v Speaker 2>water drip off of my snow goggles as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qa piece for my brain.</v>

2474
01:55:15.170 --> 01:55:16.940
<v Speaker 2>What if it went up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've,</v>

2475
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:20.570
<v Speaker 2>I would've pissed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you spit and you go up,</v>

2476
01:55:20.571 --> 01:55:21.560
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2477
01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:25.000
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go with that date.</v>

2478
01:55:25.690 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 2>And there's no moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either get rescued or you freeze to</v>

2479
01:55:28.251 --> 01:55:29.061
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's.</v>

2480
01:55:29.061 --> 01:55:32.690
<v Speaker 2>This is not a controlled avalanche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just actually starting an</v>

2481
01:55:32.691 --> 01:55:33.524
<v Speaker 2>avalanche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2482
01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:36.440
<v Speaker 2>How many of these episodes are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>planning on doing,</v>

2483
01:55:36.441 --> 01:55:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Tim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2484
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:39.860
<v Speaker 2>can we stop now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

2485
01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world needs to know about that,</v>

2486
01:55:43.531 --> 01:55:45.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we take for granted how we get our</v>

2487
01:55:45.511 --> 01:55:46.610
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we get our gas,</v>

2488
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.500
<v Speaker 2>how we get our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2489
01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I think I got a bunch of special forces</v>
<v Speaker 2>recruiting slots I need to fill and this</v>

2490
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:54.534
<v Speaker 2>is the way to do it.</v>

2491
01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I hope cells killing yourself every</v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

2492
01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I went,</v>

2493
01:55:58.321 --> 01:56:00.870
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost only died three times in this,</v>

2494
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:04.040
<v Speaker 2>in this first season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2495
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 2>and if somebody is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a cool job or weight,</v>

2496
01:56:09.841 --> 01:56:11.040
<v Speaker 2>the only way that Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm there,</v>

2497
01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:14.550
<v Speaker 2>there are some times where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching me inside of a cockpit that's</v>

2498
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:17.040
<v Speaker 2>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only way I got out is because</v>

2499
01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just a beast.</v>

2500
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.501
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2501
01:56:20.501 --> 01:56:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like getting burned alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2502
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:26.180
<v Speaker 2>So I tear the cockpit open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think somebody at some point it's</v>

2503
01:56:26.181 --> 01:56:30.030
<v Speaker 2>going to draw the conclusion that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do that because of physicality</v>

2504
01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:32.460
<v Speaker 2>that if you're a fat person sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of there,</v>

2505
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:36.750
<v Speaker 2>you would be burnt alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they'd get off their couch and</v>

2506
01:56:36.751 --> 01:56:38.370
<v Speaker 2>they go and do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they,</v>

2507
01:56:38.371 --> 01:56:40.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a weird way to motivate people</v>

2508
01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.780
<v Speaker 2>want anyways.</v>

2509
01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.710
<v Speaker 2>A good way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it.</v>

2510
01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whose idea was this for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this show?</v>

2511
01:56:46.650 --> 01:56:48.090
<v Speaker 2>That was my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2512
01:56:48.091 --> 01:56:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an unusual human.</v>

2513
01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:54.150
<v Speaker 2>It's fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many of these episodes have you</v>

2514
01:56:54.151 --> 01:56:56.010
<v Speaker 2>done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have finished six.</v>

2515
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:59.400
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the entire season?</v>

2516
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:00.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be seasoned.</v>

2517
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:03.360
<v Speaker 2>One comes out in July.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You excited about it?</v>

2518
01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pumped.</v>

2519
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.960
<v Speaker 2>So 50 percent of the time you almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

2520
01:57:07.570 --> 01:57:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's gross math.</v>

2521
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:12.510
<v Speaker 2>Rounding around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2522
01:57:12.511 --> 01:57:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So there's the water one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you almost froze to death.</v>

2523
01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That definitely.</v>

2524
01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And then the avalanche one way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>lasted 30 minutes.</v>

2525
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:22.890
<v Speaker 2>What was the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

2526
01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2527
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2528
01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:26.243
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2529
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.280
<v Speaker 2>it was less pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2530
01:57:30.670 --> 01:57:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I was a bull fighter for an episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

2531
01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.750
<v Speaker 2>And not a bull rider because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

2532
01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:38.790
<v Speaker 2>But the bull fighter is the guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>

2533
01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:43.170
<v Speaker 2>So when the bull fighter gets thrown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the bodyguard for the bull rider.</v>

2534
01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:48.920
<v Speaker 2>His only job is to take the hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the bowl writer doesn't get trampled</v>

2535
01:57:49.771 --> 01:57:52.860
<v Speaker 2>to death because the moment the bull</v>
<v Speaker 2>rider comes off the Bulls back,</v>

2536
01:57:53.070 --> 01:57:57.720
<v Speaker 2>the bowl is turning around to crush</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever was on his back and that's</v>

2537
01:57:57.721 --> 01:57:59.280
<v Speaker 2>where the bullfighter runs into save</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2538
01:57:59.790 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2539
01:58:01.230 --> 01:58:02.940
<v Speaker 2>the PBR,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the professional bull riders</v>

2540
01:58:02.941 --> 01:58:04.140
<v Speaker 2>association,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2541
01:58:04.770 --> 01:58:09.770
<v Speaker 2>those guys are the most selfless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>courageous guys trying to protect those</v>

2542
01:58:10.681 --> 01:58:12.250
<v Speaker 2>bullfighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2543
01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:17.370
<v Speaker 2>bull riders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I trained for a while and I was,</v>

2544
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:22.820
<v Speaker 2>went to the biggest rodeo in the nation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was bullfighter and um,</v>

2545
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean this isn't one of those shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people don't get hurt,</v>

2546
01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:31.890
<v Speaker 2>like you see the inside of my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see people get really,</v>

2547
01:58:31.891 --> 01:58:34.080
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really jacked up and go to the hospital</v>

2548
01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.040
<v Speaker 2>and like it does.</v>

2549
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.050
<v Speaker 2>You have a punctured lung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that guy going to live?</v>

2550
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 2>This is that type of show because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no other way to do it.</v>

2551
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 2>The only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only direction we had from discovery</v>

2552
01:58:44.501 --> 01:58:48.360
<v Speaker 2>was don't fake anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great direction.</v>

2553
01:58:48.370 --> 01:58:50.080
<v Speaker 2>That's great direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The glad they came up with that.</v>

2554
01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Now what happened with the bull?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2555
01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I got owned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is humiliating because they're not</v>

2556
01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:03.250
<v Speaker 2>really smart animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fast over there.</v>

2557
01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's a wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2558
01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 2>To encourage all little boys and girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>that follow me on any social media</v>

2559
01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:11.260
<v Speaker 2>platform to stay in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become engineers,</v>

2560
01:59:11.261 --> 01:59:12.820
<v Speaker 2>architects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accountants,</v>

2561
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:16.720
<v Speaker 2>or anything that doesn't lead to</v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent brain damage or need of an</v>

2562
01:59:16.721 --> 01:59:21.721
<v Speaker 2>orthopedic surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you legs up at a bowl watching you</v>

2563
01:59:24.791 --> 01:59:27.250
<v Speaker 2>through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the training week.</v>

2564
01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:31.690
<v Speaker 2>So this was when you were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>distract the bull.</v>

2565
01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 2>What kind of techniques do you use a</v>
<v Speaker 2>football running back stuff.</v>

2566
01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Just Joo Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2567
01:59:39.710 --> 01:59:42.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is you actually have to sell</v>

2568
01:59:42.611 --> 01:59:45.470
<v Speaker 2>that body movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like your weight,</v>

2569
01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:50.140
<v Speaker 2>your weight has to shift far enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the bowl is going to really</v>

2570
01:59:50.141 --> 01:59:52.090
<v Speaker 2>believe that you're going to go to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

2571
01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish bowls were so I wish they're</v>

2572
01:59:57.340 --> 01:59:58.990
<v Speaker 2>dumber than they are because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2573
01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Because if you fake them once one</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>

2574
02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:04.630
<v Speaker 2>they won't take it the next time</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

2575
02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:07.870
<v Speaker 2>they'll you try to fake to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll already start going right into</v>

2576
02:00:07.871 --> 02:00:08.950
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you flick to the right,</v>

2577
02:00:08.951 --> 02:00:10.810
<v Speaker 2>you go back to the left and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2578
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I have done an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at that moment that tim realized he</v>

2579
02:00:14.801 --> 02:00:16.250
<v Speaker 2>had fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2580
02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:17.890
<v Speaker 2>then it just gets own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got destroyed.</v>

2581
02:00:19.570 --> 02:00:21.670
<v Speaker 2>And so when you get launched into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air by a bull,</v>

2582
02:00:22.210 --> 02:00:22.870
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2583
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:24.640
<v Speaker 2>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2584
02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.770
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weightless,</v>

2585
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a second and you are</v>

2586
02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:31.960
<v Speaker 2>completely inverted.</v>

2587
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:36.820
<v Speaker 2>No control over where your body is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't generate the energy.</v>

2588
02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other part of you,</v>

2589
02:00:39.670 --> 02:00:43.300
<v Speaker 2>the other part of your brain is knowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that bowl is going to try to turn</v>

2590
02:00:43.301 --> 02:00:48.010
<v Speaker 2>as fast as it can and get you when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>land on the ground because that's what</v>

2591
02:00:48.011 --> 02:00:51.190
<v Speaker 2>it's really good is when you're down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2592
02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:57.100
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to keep track of where</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bowl is while you're hurling</v>

2593
02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:57.971
<v Speaker 2>through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2594
02:00:57.971 --> 02:00:59.680
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to Tuck my chin so I don't</v>

2595
02:00:59.681 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 2>break my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2596
02:01:01.241 --> 02:01:02.860
<v Speaker 2>hopefully I'm not close enough to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>

2597
02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.570
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the fence doesn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fences,</v>

2598
02:01:04.571 --> 02:01:05.470
<v Speaker 2>metal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2599
02:01:05.471 --> 02:01:08.200
<v Speaker 2>the ground is pretty soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather land on the ground then</v>

2600
02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:11.200
<v Speaker 2>landed on the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fence will mess you up.</v>

2601
02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that up.</v>

2602
02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:19.090
<v Speaker 2>And how'd you get away from the bull?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an athlete.</v>

2603
02:01:19.210 --> 02:01:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2604
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:24.670
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just athleticism.</v>

2605
02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No luck that you didn't get stomped now.</v>

2607
02:01:29.111 --> 02:01:30.030
<v Speaker 2>So there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:34.810
<v Speaker 2>some real bull fighters in the ring with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me that I think saved my life every</v>

2609

<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2632
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Those shows in this episodic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really go into the personalities</v>

2633
02:02:52.191 --> 02:02:55.250
<v Speaker 1>and the people that do these jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they really go.</v>

2634
02:02:55.430 --> 02:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>They gloss over how hard that job is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the there on this decks for 14,</v>

2635
02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:06.890
<v Speaker 1>15 hours working a net poll to a net</v>
<v Speaker 1>poll to put out a net to next,</v>

2636
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:11.720
<v Speaker 1>and then they go in and the net is out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have 45 minutes to sleep before</v>

2637
02:03:11.721 --> 02:03:14.900
<v Speaker 1>they have to pull the net back in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do that for 28 days.</v>

2638
02:03:15.110 --> 02:03:18.470
<v Speaker 1>So they're getting like cat naps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then slowly their,</v>

2639
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.720
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their cognitive ability is starting to</v>

2640
02:03:20.721 --> 02:03:25.721
<v Speaker 1>diminish and their physical capability</v>
<v Speaker 1>is starting to diminish and so</v>

2641
02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:28.790
<v Speaker 1>everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they're on a platform that is</v>

2642
02:03:29.050 --> 02:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>intended to 12 foot waves that slippery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the water is 38 degrees.</v>

2643
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>So everything about what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is setting them up to die.</v>

2644
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are great shows.</v>

2645
02:03:44.031 --> 02:03:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadliest catch.</v>

2646
02:03:45.321 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a handful of their shows</v>

2647
02:03:47.841 --> 02:03:51.350
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it has ever gotten</v>

2648
02:03:51.351 --> 02:03:54.260
<v Speaker 1>close enough to showing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've always been.</v>

2649
02:03:54.261 --> 02:03:56.390
<v Speaker 1>I did that job for one day and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2650
02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I just need a break dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any way you could</v>

2651
02:03:59.691 --> 02:04:04.691
<v Speaker 1>really accurately portrayed unless you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a 12 hour show and showed you.</v>

2652
02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And then multiple 12 hour show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they did a live stream of you,</v>

2653
02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:11.780
<v Speaker 1>that would be the way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2654
02:04:11.781 --> 02:04:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Like there's satellite feed somehow have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an internet connection showing you</v>

2655
02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:17.210
<v Speaker 1>fishing for 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can just tune in.</v>

2656
02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's Tim still fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to sleep.</v>

2657
02:04:19.851 --> 02:04:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll wake up eight hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get coffee,</v>

2658
02:04:21.861 --> 02:04:23.180
<v Speaker 1>get breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we check out Tim,</v>

2659
02:04:23.181 --> 02:04:24.560
<v Speaker 1>look at Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still awake,</v>

2660
02:04:24.710 --> 02:04:26.510
<v Speaker 1>one wrong step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one wrong,</v>

2661
02:04:26.511 --> 02:04:28.280
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to count on these other</v>

2662
02:04:28.281 --> 02:04:31.880
<v Speaker 1>guys that are also exhaustive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One second,</v>

2663
02:04:32.130 --> 02:04:35.330
<v Speaker 1>if you have one second to realize where</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person went.</v>

2664
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>If he's in the water one second and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>

2665
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck in 38 degree water with 12 and 12</v>

2666
02:04:43.711 --> 02:04:46.530
<v Speaker 2>foot swells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've been out for 20 days.</v>

2667
02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of fish were you catching</v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

2668
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're pulling scallops.</v>

2669
02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Those were scabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the stuff that was just pushing off,</v>

2670
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>like we weren't even using any of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just pushing them back into the</v>

2671
02:04:56.731 --> 02:04:58.620
<v Speaker 2>ocean with a lot of scabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like these,</v>

2672
02:04:58.621 --> 02:05:00.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like little sting rays.</v>

2673
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll chop them up for sometimes.</v>

2674
02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:04.890
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all the stuff.</v>

2675
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>So the bucket to my left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all the um,</v>

2676
02:05:07.930 --> 02:05:11.820
<v Speaker 2>the fish that we had picked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the leftovers.</v>

2677
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an inefficient process.</v>

2678
02:05:15.690 --> 02:05:18.320
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all those things die so that you can</v>

2679
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:19.501
<v Speaker 2>bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2680
02:05:19.501 --> 02:05:20.370
<v Speaker 2>they're still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2681
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Those go back in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2682
02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:25.380
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what's in the bucket there?</v>

2683
02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:29.880
<v Speaker 2>A scallops</v>
<v Speaker 2>clams.</v>

2684
02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

2685
02:05:32.371 --> 02:05:36.340
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff gets scooped up and you</v>

2686
02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:37.940
<v Speaker 2>don't want it [inaudible].</v>

2687
02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.340
<v Speaker 2>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2688
02:05:41.341 --> 02:05:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a second after this photo was</v>

2689
02:05:43.951 --> 02:05:47.160
<v Speaker 2>taken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a step and I stepped on one of</v>

2690
02:05:47.161 --> 02:05:48.060
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it?</v>

2691
02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:50.070
<v Speaker 2>They kind of match when they're facing</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2692
02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:51.540
<v Speaker 2>We'll know in their belly up when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're white,</v>

2693
02:05:51.541 --> 02:05:55.230
<v Speaker 2>but when they're brown and facing down</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same color as the rust.</v>

2694
02:05:55.410 --> 02:05:57.900
<v Speaker 2>The deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I stepped on one that I thought was</v>

2695
02:05:57.901 --> 02:06:01.350
<v Speaker 2>the deck and in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my right hand right now,</v>

2696
02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:03.060
<v Speaker 2>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pike.</v>

2697
02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a spike with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a nail sticking out the end of it</v>

2698
02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.130
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you use to sort.</v>

2699
02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>And I step on this thing and I fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my,</v>

2700
02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:14.490
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear my feet were all the way up at</v>

2701
02:06:14.491 --> 02:06:16.440
<v Speaker 2>the top of that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I five,</v>

2702
02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:19.620
<v Speaker 2>five feet up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just inverted flying through the air</v>

2703
02:06:19.621 --> 02:06:24.621
<v Speaker 2>with 12 foot swells in the sea and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spike holding onto that spike and I'm</v>

2704
02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>two feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three feet from the edge of the boat to</v>

2705
02:06:29.331 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2706
02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:35.340
<v Speaker 2>These guys do it all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2707
02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I hope you liked the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fish that you walk to the</v>

2708
02:06:38.651 --> 02:06:40.410
<v Speaker 2>supermarket and pluck out at whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>

2709
02:06:40.411 --> 02:06:45.090
<v Speaker 2>You know it got there somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it says wild caught,</v>

2710
02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:48.960
<v Speaker 2>it's freaking wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caught is we have a real problem with a</v>

2711
02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:51.990
<v Speaker 2>disconnect from things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disconnect from food,</v>

2712
02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:54.510
<v Speaker 2>disconnect from how difficult these jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2713
02:06:54.511 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Where's the fucking power?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The power going back on.</v>

2714
02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Somebody is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's out there in that blizzard it.</v>

2715
02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the things that's</v>

2716
02:07:03.781 --> 02:07:07.740
<v Speaker 2>wrong with the society right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is just taken for granted</v>

2717
02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:10.020
<v Speaker 2>everything about their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want it easy.</v>

2718
02:07:10.021 --> 02:07:11.670
<v Speaker 2>They want it fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want it quick.</v>

2719
02:07:11.730 --> 02:07:13.680
<v Speaker 2>That's what people are getting fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're going to the grocery</v>

2720
02:07:13.681 --> 02:07:14.970
<v Speaker 2>store and getting the thing that's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>sale.</v>

2721
02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:18.330
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're getting mad at guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you that go and talk about hunting</v>

2722
02:07:18.690 --> 02:07:20.670
<v Speaker 2>because they just want the easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

2723
02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:21.670
<v Speaker 2>In truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be it.</v>

2724
02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:24.780
<v Speaker 2>There isn't an easy solution that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right solution.</v>

2725
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually you know the other.</v>

2726
02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:31.020
<v Speaker 2>There can be a smart way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a smart way,</v>

2727
02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:34.710
<v Speaker 2>sometimes is the hard way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody wants this quick fix.</v>

2728
02:07:34.711 --> 02:07:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to take a pill and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel better.</v>

2729
02:07:36.821 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works.</v>

2730
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:41.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't pain or suffering from</v>

2731
02:07:41.231 --> 02:07:43.570
<v Speaker 2>depression and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

2732
02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:46.150
<v Speaker 2>if you've been having these thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a pill and feel</v>

2733
02:07:46.151 --> 02:07:48.250
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While that might be a portion of the</v>

2734
02:07:48.251 --> 02:07:51.550
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about you lose 10 percent body fat?</v>

2735
02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:53.860
<v Speaker 2>How about you get off the couch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you go make out with your</v>

2736
02:07:53.861 --> 02:07:55.510
<v Speaker 2>wife?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you go down on her for a</v>

2737
02:07:55.511 --> 02:07:57.070
<v Speaker 2>couple of our gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of Orgasms,</v>

2738
02:07:57.660 --> 02:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>then have sex with her and then go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gym.</v>

2739
02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Promise you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel better after that.</v>

2740
02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:02.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

2741
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have this easy solution and</v>

2742
02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:08.920
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2743
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for me the show is hopefully an</v>

2744
02:08:11.501 --> 02:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to give people.</v>

2745
02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:21.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've made a weird society.</v>

2746
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:26.260
<v Speaker 2>We made a society where we've nerfed all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hard edges and we're trying to make</v>

2747
02:08:26.261 --> 02:08:28.700
<v Speaker 2>it safer and safer every day and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things that just,</v>

2748
02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:30.510
<v Speaker 2>they're just messy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to be safe,</v>

2749
02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:35.100
<v Speaker 2>but us making everything safer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's making us weaker now,</v>

2750
02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:35.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2751
02:08:35.851 --> 02:08:38.020
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in every time that we've had a weak</v>

2752
02:08:38.021 --> 02:08:41.140
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we end up with tough times.</v>

2753
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:46.240
<v Speaker 2>The tough times make hardman that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardmin make good times than good times</v>

2754
02:08:46.241 --> 02:08:49.870
<v Speaker 2>make weak men than weak men know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the cycle just keeps going.</v>

2755
02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:53.990
<v Speaker 2>And right now we have week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't even,</v>

2756
02:08:54.110 --> 02:08:57.200
<v Speaker 2>we even allowed to say men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the men out there.</v>

2757
02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:58.220
<v Speaker 2>There are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

2758
02:08:58.221 --> 02:09:00.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if we're allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just driving,</v>

2759
02:09:00.111 --> 02:09:03.860
<v Speaker 2>driving here to your studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the girl scouts office is one</v>

2760
02:09:03.861 --> 02:09:07.910
<v Speaker 2>block away and your neighbors that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>no security cameras right back behind</v>

2761
02:09:07.911 --> 02:09:10.460
<v Speaker 2>fries with their backdoor lodged open</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

2762
02:09:10.610 --> 02:09:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm like all of that right here in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly to girl scouts,</v>

2763
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:17.660
<v Speaker 2>which isn't even a thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's just the scouts.</v>

2764
02:09:17.661 --> 02:09:19.340
<v Speaker 2>There's no boy scouts and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl scouts.</v>

2765
02:09:19.341 --> 02:09:24.341
<v Speaker 2>There's just the scouts and in a week a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a million members of the boy scouts</v>

2766
02:09:24.831 --> 02:09:27.980
<v Speaker 2>have left because you can't have just</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy scouts.</v>

2767
02:09:28.130 --> 02:09:31.100
<v Speaker 2>You have to have just scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on now?</v>

2768
02:09:31.101 --> 02:09:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Is that how they're doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2769
02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a half a million scouts have last.</v>

2770
02:09:36.761 --> 02:09:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean that if you go on these camping</v>
<v Speaker 2>trips,</v>

2771
02:09:38.901 --> 02:09:40.350
<v Speaker 2>the boys and the girls go together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2772
02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.500
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>

2773
02:09:42.501 --> 02:09:43.640
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bad idea.</v>

2774
02:09:43.670 --> 02:09:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Kids get raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2775
02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:47.720
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also changes things.</v>

2776
02:09:48.890 --> 02:09:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how I feel about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2777
02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I think women in the military to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go anywhere and to include special</v>

2778
02:09:56.431 --> 02:09:59.360
<v Speaker 2>operations if they meet the standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

2779
02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:03.370
<v Speaker 2>when you have a girl present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changes.</v>

2780
02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Men Act differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2781
02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:08.320
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it changes the chemistry of the team</v>

2782
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:11.320
<v Speaker 2>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to raise men,</v>

2783
02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:15.790
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to rear boys and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>them becoming men and you're doing</v>

2784
02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:17.950
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're taking them horseback</v>

2785
02:10:17.951 --> 02:10:22.951
<v Speaker 2>riding or you're teaching them knots or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're showing them how to set up a tent</v>

2786
02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:26.710
<v Speaker 2>or how to purify water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a girl there,</v>

2787
02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.640
<v Speaker 2>the focus isn't on time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Boland the focuses on is Christina</v>

2788
02:10:32.681 --> 02:10:36.980
<v Speaker 2>watching time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Bolin and while that's good and bad,</v>

2789
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to have an opportunity</v>

2790
02:10:40.221 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to nurture elements that are very</v>

2791
02:10:44.931 --> 02:10:49.931
<v Speaker 2>beautifully separate equally for girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can we teach Christina that</v>

2792
02:10:50.721 --> 02:10:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Bolin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2793
02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Can we teach how to ride a horse 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

2794
02:10:54.110 --> 02:10:55.880
<v Speaker 2>take her hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd be willing to do everything that</v>

2795
02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:57.980
<v Speaker 2>every one of these boys should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe so,</v>

2796
02:10:57.981 --> 02:10:58.814
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2797
02:10:58.990 --> 02:11:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that mix,</v>

2798
02:11:00.850 --> 02:11:02.200
<v Speaker 3>it changes things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes things.</v>

2799
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've always been supportive</v>

2800
02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:06.460
<v Speaker 3>of all girl gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2801
02:11:06.461 --> 02:11:09.370
<v Speaker 3>they should be able to have a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>gym when no one's trying to bang them</v>

2802
02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:10.750
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2803
02:11:10.751 --> 02:11:12.790
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of women that want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to go to the gym and not have</v>

2804
02:11:12.791 --> 02:11:15.820
<v Speaker 3>somebody ogling them and stare at their</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass when they're doing squats.</v>

2805
02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:18.970
<v Speaker 3>But all boys gems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watched the title fight get</v>

2806
02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.620
<v Speaker 3>squirrely this last weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which one?</v>

2807
02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me Chanko or Amanda.</v>

2808
02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:25.460
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2809
02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2810
02:11:26.230 --> 02:11:27.020
<v Speaker 3>I did</v>

2811
02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:30.500
<v Speaker 2>think if those were two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the end of the,</v>

2812
02:11:30.501 --> 02:11:34.700
<v Speaker 2>in between the fourth and fifth round</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm Raquel Pennington,</v>

2813
02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:39.050
<v Speaker 2>warner pendants and said I went out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>her team said no,</v>

2814
02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:43.640
<v Speaker 2>that it would have been different if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was two male fighters.</v>

2815
02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would have been as well.</v>

2816
02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2817
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that had her team let her out.</v>

2818
02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.900
<v Speaker 2>She would have regretted it the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>her life.</v>

2819
02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the failure and it didn't happen by her</v>

2820
02:11:59.131 --> 02:12:01.080
<v Speaker 2>team there in between the fourth and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifth round.</v>

2821
02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:04.590
<v Speaker 2>It happened in preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting her ready for that because I</v>

2822
02:12:04.591 --> 02:12:07.830
<v Speaker 2>think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2823
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:09.400
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2824
02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:12.670
<v Speaker 2>those words would never be uttered out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my mouth in the middle of the fight.</v>

2825
02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be my team begging and pleading</v>

2826
02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:18.980
<v Speaker 2>for them to end the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2827
02:12:20.230 --> 02:12:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there was a route for</v>
<v Speaker 2>her to win that fight.</v>

2828
02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:25.240
<v Speaker 2>There was a path to victory for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there was.</v>

2829
02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think she felt that,</v>

2830
02:12:27.730 --> 02:12:28.563
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2831
02:12:29.670 --> 02:12:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I think the journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the MMA media attacked her coaches</v>

2832
02:12:35.010 --> 02:12:37.260
<v Speaker 2>unfairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One because she's a girl.</v>

2833
02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that played a part in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's like,</v>

2834
02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:42.180
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl fighter in between four and</v>

2835
02:12:42.181 --> 02:12:44.220
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just a fighter first of all,</v>

2836
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:45.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And her coaches know her better than</v>

2837
02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:48.940
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not defending what they did or</v>

2838
02:12:48.941 --> 02:12:51.570
<v Speaker 2>attacking them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is you're not on either</v>

2839
02:12:51.571 --> 02:12:55.350
<v Speaker 2>side of that fence and you've never had</v>
<v Speaker 2>your feet on that canvas and felt the</v>

2840
02:12:55.351 --> 02:13:00.351
<v Speaker 2>fury and pain of defeat and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweetness of success and the worst thing</v>

2841
02:13:01.351 --> 02:13:04.730
<v Speaker 2>ever is regret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have you.</v>

2842
02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:05.760
<v Speaker 2>You feel like she would been,</v>

2843
02:13:06.150 --> 02:13:09.180
<v Speaker 3>even though I absolutely agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was no path to victory.</v>

2844
02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Amanda Nunez was,</v>

2845
02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:14.440
<v Speaker 3>she was searching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was destroying her.</v>

2846
02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Her nose was shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's getting beaten down and she didn't</v>

2847
02:13:17.641 --> 02:13:19.830
<v Speaker 3>have anything left turn and so she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2848
02:13:19.890 --> 02:13:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I want out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big John Mccarthy and I talked about</v>

2849
02:13:22.831 --> 02:13:27.831
<v Speaker 3>this yesterday and he feels that his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the coroner did a big disservice to</v>

2850
02:13:28.651 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 3>her by letting her take a in that fifth</v>

2851
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:36.450
<v Speaker 5>round that every fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take something out of you and some</v>

2852
02:13:36.451 --> 02:13:40.590
<v Speaker 5>fights take more out of you and there</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes a point in time where there's a</v>

2853
02:13:40.591 --> 02:13:44.580
<v Speaker 5>tipping point fight and that that could</v>
<v Speaker 5>have been the tipping point round,</v>

2854
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:46.410
<v Speaker 5>that she might not ever be the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

2855
02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.820
<v Speaker 5>And he was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2856
02:13:47.821 --> 02:13:51.240
<v Speaker 5>you've got to understand that you only</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a certain amount of holes you can</v>

2857
02:13:51.241 --> 02:13:55.380
<v Speaker 5>punch in your ticket and if she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you're talking about</v>

2858
02:13:55.381 --> 02:13:58.110
<v Speaker 5>someone who's that ticket off the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tickets of fight card,</v>

2859
02:13:58.130 --> 02:13:59.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the ticket.</v>

2860
02:13:59.810 --> 02:14:01.020
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2861
02:14:01.050 --> 02:14:02.790
<v Speaker 5>she's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's not a janitor.</v>

2862
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:08.100
<v Speaker 5>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she only has to fight again or be beaten</v>

2863
02:14:08.101 --> 02:14:10.920
<v Speaker 5>down so badly in that fight that she's</v>
<v Speaker 5>never the same physically.</v>

2864
02:14:11.180 --> 02:14:13.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have every time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we talked about this with Robbie</v>

2865
02:14:13.201 --> 02:14:15.230
<v Speaker 5>lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael is being,</v>

2866
02:14:15.250 --> 02:14:17.380
<v Speaker 5>but it might be the case with Robbie</v>
<v Speaker 5>lawler.</v>

2867
02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:20.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you look at Robbie lowers last</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight with Javiel dos Anjos.</v>

2868
02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:22.780
<v Speaker 5>He didn't really look like the Lara</v>
<v Speaker 5>volt.</v>

2869
02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:24.690
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could that be because of dos Anjos very</v>

2870
02:14:24.691 --> 02:14:25.400
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could have been.</v>

2871
02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.140
<v Speaker 5>Dos Anjos is a beast in our business to</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell him when he's dealing.</v>

2872
02:14:29.141 --> 02:14:30.830
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not our business.</v>

2873
02:14:30.850 --> 02:14:32.280
<v Speaker 5>Tell him he's done it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His ticket,</v>

2874
02:14:32.370 --> 02:14:34.470
<v Speaker 5>but it's his ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if he wants to quit?</v>

2875
02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:38.490
<v Speaker 5>Could I says if he says he wants out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she said she wanted out.</v>

2876
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:41.850
<v Speaker 5>Like there's certain times in a fight</v>
<v Speaker 5>where someone says they want it.</v>

2877
02:14:41.851 --> 02:14:45.010
<v Speaker 5>Like here's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember Jeremy Mclellan when</v>

2878
02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.720
<v Speaker 5>fought Nigel Benn?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2879
02:14:46.770 --> 02:14:51.360
<v Speaker 5>This was the fight that put him into</v>
<v Speaker 5>this catatonic state and bleeding on the</v>

2880
02:14:51.361 --> 02:14:53.130
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are criticizing him because he</v>

2881
02:14:53.131 --> 02:14:55.830
<v Speaker 5>took a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were saying like the commentators</v>

2882
02:14:55.831 --> 02:14:56.670
<v Speaker 5>are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is he doing?</v>

2883
02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:57.570
<v Speaker 5>Why is he doing this?</v>

2884
02:14:57.690 --> 02:14:59.820
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he fucking knew something was wrong and</v>

2885
02:14:59.821 --> 02:15:02.610
<v Speaker 5>he took a knee and then blacked out and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then eventually had bleeding on the</v>

2886
02:15:02.611 --> 02:15:03.610
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>

2887
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Gerald Mcclellan was a beast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean world champion boxer,</v>

2888
02:15:06.511 --> 02:15:08.910
<v Speaker 5>but he knew something was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2889
02:15:08.911 --> 02:15:11.440
<v Speaker 5>if Raquel Pennington had said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2890
02:15:11.630 --> 02:15:13.890
<v Speaker 5>I won out and our coach said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2891
02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:15.990
<v Speaker 5>go back in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then she goes back in there and</v>

2892
02:15:15.991 --> 02:15:20.220
<v Speaker 5>collapses and as bleeding in the brain</v>
<v Speaker 5>and winds up in the same state as Gerald</v>

2893
02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:22.620
<v Speaker 5>Mcclellan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then people would be going crazy.</v>

2894
02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:27.090
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know your point because that's the</v>

2895
02:15:27.091 --> 02:15:29.850
<v Speaker 5>kind of fighter you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the kind of fighter you were.</v>

2896
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.460
<v Speaker 5>You were a die on your sword guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2897
02:15:32.461 --> 02:15:36.750
<v Speaker 5>that's what you always did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you had some fucking amazing fights</v>

2898
02:15:36.751 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 5>because of that attitude and that never</v>
<v Speaker 5>quit mentality where you were in there</v>

2899
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:44.310
<v Speaker 5>to win or die trying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2900
02:15:44.311 --> 02:15:47.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm so scared of that regret though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand it.</v>

2901
02:15:48.010 --> 02:15:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if all the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to because I have</v>

2902
02:15:53.630 --> 02:15:54.990
<v Speaker 2>mentally checking out at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2903
02:15:54.991 --> 02:15:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ramiro fight,</v>

2904
02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I regret that to the day I die that I</v>

2905
02:15:57.591 --> 02:16:00.800
<v Speaker 2>didn't stay because I'm looking at Dana</v>
<v Speaker 2>anticipating my money.</v>

2906
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:01.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marty,</v>

2907
02:16:01.281 --> 02:16:01.971
<v Speaker 2>look at and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2908
02:16:01.971 --> 02:16:03.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay me for this one.</v>

2909
02:16:03.231 --> 02:16:04.750
<v Speaker 2>This is one hell of a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2910
02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about me destroyed Michael</v>

2911
02:16:07.521 --> 02:16:09.200
<v Speaker 2>bisbing and that's what he's already</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>

2912
02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I had already left the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have that regret,</v>

2913
02:16:11.091 --> 02:16:13.480
<v Speaker 2>that like nags at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2914
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine what the regret</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be like for me not to go out all</v>

2915
02:16:18.231 --> 02:16:19.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all like all my,</v>

2916
02:16:20.590 --> 02:16:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't have posttraumatic stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all the things that nag at me,</v>

2917
02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.280
<v Speaker 2>it's the things that I didn't do and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

2918
02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 5>but aren't those things would make you</v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

2919
02:16:29.090 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 5>The realization of the mistakes that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>made.</v>

2920
02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 5>Those are the lessons and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes you a stronger person,</v>

2921
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:37.690
<v Speaker 5>but you don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get stronger by doing the</v>

2922
02:16:37.691 --> 02:16:41.590
<v Speaker 5>right thing every single time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of getting stronger is by fucking</v>

2923
02:16:41.591 --> 02:16:46.120
<v Speaker 5>up and having this horrible feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucked up and realizing you never</v>

2924
02:16:46.121 --> 02:16:47.080
<v Speaker 5>want to feel that again.</v>

2925
02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2926
02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:54.150
<v Speaker 2>That's how muscle and that's how our</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain works is you damage it and it</v>

2927
02:16:54.151 --> 02:16:55.690
<v Speaker 2>comes back stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2928
02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:58.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's how the human</v>
<v Speaker 2>condition is to a degree,</v>

2929
02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:02.370
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the hurry to failure of the rush to</v>

2930
02:17:02.371 --> 02:17:05.160
<v Speaker 2>failure or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2931
02:17:05.161 --> 02:17:07.550
<v Speaker 2>that's how you get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want that,</v>

2932
02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:12.660
<v Speaker 2>that point where I'm going to fail to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>so unattainable and so hard to reach</v>

2933
02:17:12.991 --> 02:17:15.350
<v Speaker 2>where if I ever reached that point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>failure and I,</v>

2934
02:17:15.351 --> 02:17:18.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I go to the gym and I'm</v>

2935
02:17:18.001 --> 02:17:20.670
<v Speaker 2>training on it and I want you to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hang out with us one day if you ever</v>

2936
02:17:20.671 --> 02:17:24.960
<v Speaker 2>make it back to Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we try and find the quitter and each</v>

2937
02:17:24.961 --> 02:17:27.240
<v Speaker 2>other every single time that we train</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>

2938
02:17:27.390 --> 02:17:28.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2939
02:17:28.291 --> 02:17:30.450
<v Speaker 2>we even have workouts called find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>quitter.</v>

2940
02:17:30.930 --> 02:17:32.040
<v Speaker 2>And we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have guys,</v>

2941
02:17:32.041 --> 02:17:35.400
<v Speaker 2>professional athletes from all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports come in and join us and they,</v>

2942
02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:38.490
<v Speaker 2>they will quit in the middle of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of one of our just</v>

2943
02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:42.480
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because my little group,</v>

2944
02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Shane one myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are looking for that failure and it's</v>

2945
02:17:47.881 --> 02:17:51.000
<v Speaker 2>getting so hard to find just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting.</v>

2946
02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for that miss [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>that misses that opportunity that I'm</v>

2947
02:17:54.241 --> 02:17:55.880
<v Speaker 2>going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at that,</v>

2948
02:17:55.930 --> 02:17:59.370
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rep that I just can't get or that</v>

2949
02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:02.680
<v Speaker 2>5:30 mile one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2950
02:18:02.730 --> 02:18:04.260
<v Speaker 2>because that's going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity for growth.</v>

2951
02:18:04.261 --> 02:18:07.980
<v Speaker 2>So I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also has to be hard to reach</v>

2952
02:18:07.981 --> 02:18:09.080
<v Speaker 2>because failure should never be</v>

2953
02:18:09.130 --> 02:18:11.740
<v Speaker 5>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you think her being able to say I</v>

2954
02:18:11.741 --> 02:18:14.110
<v Speaker 5>want out that she still had enough left</v>
<v Speaker 5>to keep going.</v>

2955
02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:17.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think only her in her corner are going</v>

2956
02:18:17.371 --> 02:18:18.790
<v Speaker 5>to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>

2957
02:18:18.970 --> 02:18:22.990
<v Speaker 5>I would say that I agree with you except</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have so much respect for her and I</v>

2958
02:18:22.991 --> 02:18:25.420
<v Speaker 5>think she's one of the toughest girls in</v>
<v Speaker 5>an mma,</v>

2959
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:27.610
<v Speaker 5>one of the toughest people and she's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking animal.</v>

2960
02:18:27.611 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 5>Raquel Pennington.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She really is tough.</v>

2961
02:18:29.591 --> 02:18:33.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big fan of hers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When someone like her says I'm out,</v>

2962
02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:36.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think she's beaten down so badly</v>

2963
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:40.900
<v Speaker 5>that she doesn't physically have the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to fight anymore.</v>

2964
02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:44.620
<v Speaker 5>And then she went out and proved that in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fifth round and took a ferocious</v>

2965
02:18:44.621 --> 02:18:47.110
<v Speaker 5>beating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But she agrees with you,</v>

2966
02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:49.780
<v Speaker 5>she agrees with her coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she agrees.</v>

2967
02:18:49.781 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 5>She says now after the fact that her</v>
<v Speaker 5>coaches were right and that she had hit</v>

2968
02:18:54.101 --> 02:18:55.210
<v Speaker 5>this moment of weakness.</v>

2969
02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.210
<v Speaker 2>If I sit on the stool in my coach and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>told my coaches,</v>

2970
02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I went out and you know I got Great</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson Winkle,</v>

2971
02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:05.800
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Palmisano all sitting there and</v>

2972
02:19:05.801 --> 02:19:08.980
<v Speaker 2>they let me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hate them forever.</v>

2973
02:19:11.770 --> 02:19:14.140
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would regret my decision and I will be</v>

2974
02:19:14.141 --> 02:19:16.360
<v Speaker 5>mad at them forever and they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>

2975
02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:17.470
<v Speaker 5>they're some of my best friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

2976
02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:22.210
<v Speaker 5>What if right after you said that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>collapsed and they took you to the</v>

2977
02:19:22.211 --> 02:19:25.660
<v Speaker 5>hospital and they had to open up your</v>
<v Speaker 5>skull to alleviate pressure on your</v>

2978
02:19:25.661 --> 02:19:30.661
<v Speaker 5>brain because you were bleeding and your</v>
<v Speaker 5>legs stopped working and you're in a</v>

2979
02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:33.710
<v Speaker 5>wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>electrical McClellan trying to relive</v>

2980
02:19:33.711 --> 02:19:36.530
<v Speaker 5>the past through distant foggy memories.</v>

2981
02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:39.080
<v Speaker 2>That would be less than ideal.</v>

2982
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:41.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2983
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand what you're saying.</v>

2984
02:19:42.531 --> 02:19:46.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like the balance of the physical</v>
<v Speaker 5>limitations of the human body and then</v>

2985
02:19:46.191 --> 02:19:49.760
<v Speaker 5>the limitations of the mind and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>minds willingness to find a way out,</v>

2986
02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:52.670
<v Speaker 5>which brings me to the one thing that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to get to before we leave.</v>

2987
02:19:52.671 --> 02:19:57.671
<v Speaker 5>This is waterboarding and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is something that came up because</v>

2988
02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:01.280
<v Speaker 5>you were defending.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did gail,</v>

2989
02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 5>Gina.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gina,</v>

2990
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:04.090
<v Speaker 5>what is your name and spell?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spell.</v>

2991
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:09.310
<v Speaker 5>And she is the person that was being</v>
<v Speaker 5>appointed by to lead the CIA.</v>

2992
02:20:09.390 --> 02:20:11.240
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was a bunch of people that</v>

2993
02:20:11.241 --> 02:20:15.770
<v Speaker 5>were saying that she shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 5>because she advocated torture and you to</v>

2994
02:20:15.771 --> 02:20:19.940
<v Speaker 5>defend her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>decided to get waterboarded.</v>

2995
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've actually been talking about this</v>

2996
02:20:23.001 --> 02:20:25.180
<v Speaker 2>for the past hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2997
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:27.370
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been talking about it's</v>

2998
02:20:29.170 --> 02:20:33.130
<v Speaker 2>the slow erosion of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the human condition.</v>

2999
02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:37.740
<v Speaker 2>US getting softer and US getting weaker</v>
<v Speaker 2>and US getting nerfing the edges and</v>

3000
02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.120
<v Speaker 2>finding the easy outs and the easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

3001
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation of middle ground,</v>

3002
02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:45.370
<v Speaker 2>finding a way that we can communicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people and have a discussion.</v>

3003
02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've been,</v>

3004
02:20:46.990 --> 02:20:50.880
<v Speaker 2>we've been having this discussion for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past 90 minutes and um,</v>

3005
02:20:51.430 --> 02:20:56.330
<v Speaker 2>what I have is a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are sane what something is,</v>

3006
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:59.920
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

3007
02:20:59.930 --> 02:21:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I know what torture is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it in Africa,</v>

3008
02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>

3009
02:21:04.850 --> 02:21:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it on almost.</v>

3010
02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm pushing 20 trips overseas in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>military capacity,</v>

3011
02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:14.730
<v Speaker 2>a handful of combat deployments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3012
02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:16.420
<v Speaker 2>from looking for poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human traffic,</v>

3013
02:21:16.421 --> 02:21:18.080
<v Speaker 2>ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug cartel.</v>

3014
02:21:18.390 --> 02:21:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of piracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that I have done,</v>

3015
02:21:21.981 --> 02:21:25.250
<v Speaker 2>like you want to talk about knowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimately what torture is.</v>

3016
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I fucking know what torture is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pouring water on of face is not torture</v>

3017
02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Kate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you starve them,</v>

3018
02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.600
<v Speaker 2>if you beat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you isolate them,</v>

3019
02:21:35.601 --> 02:21:36.680
<v Speaker 2>if they're there for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3020
02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:39.920
<v Speaker 2>you're the only getting the yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can start adding things onto it.</v>

3021
02:21:40.490 --> 02:21:42.800
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that was the most irritating</v>

3022
02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:44.970
<v Speaker 2>was everybody's just throwing out this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3023
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:48.290
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this woman is immoral to be in this</v>

3024
02:21:48.291 --> 02:21:52.400
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember people jumping to their</v>

3025
02:21:52.401 --> 02:21:55.250
<v Speaker 2>deaths on nine slash 11 because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't look at burnt alive,</v>

3026
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I saw a guy on his knees and</v>

3027
02:21:59.541 --> 02:22:04.541
<v Speaker 2>have his throat slit open by somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling his hair back and sliding that</v>

3028
02:22:04.641 --> 02:22:06.980
<v Speaker 2>knife across his throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the guys that she</v>

3029
02:22:06.981 --> 02:22:08.960
<v Speaker 2>interrogated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not I'm not saying two wrongs make a</v>

3030
02:22:08.961 --> 02:22:10.580
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she interrogated them to get a</v>

3031
02:22:10.581 --> 02:22:12.290
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get questions out of them,</v>

3032
02:22:12.291 --> 02:22:13.970
<v Speaker 2>to try to save more Americans.</v>

3033
02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:16.640
<v Speaker 2>The intent was to try to save more</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

3034
02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:18.021
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3035
02:22:18.021 --> 02:22:23.021
<v Speaker 2>well if it's not that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why did it work and this is why,</v>

3036
02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:26.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is what nobody understands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can't understand the</v>

3037
02:22:26.611 --> 02:22:31.611
<v Speaker 2>difference between the easy way and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard way is because these people that we</v>

3038
02:22:31.771 --> 02:22:35.310
<v Speaker 2>were waterboarding are cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were pussies.</v>

3039
02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 2>They're impotent little bullies their</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole entire lives.</v>

3040
02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:41.970
<v Speaker 2>If I put you on that water board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could waterboard you for days.</v>

3041
02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:45.150
<v Speaker 2>You have your moral convictions and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would never change because you believe</v>

3042
02:22:45.151 --> 02:22:47.370
<v Speaker 2>in what's right and wrong and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great and beautiful thing.</v>

3043
02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:52.170
<v Speaker 2>They're not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pieces of shit that that throw</v>

3044
02:22:52.171 --> 02:22:54.810
<v Speaker 2>acid on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little girls that fly planes into</v>

3045
02:22:54.811 --> 02:22:58.850
<v Speaker 2>buildings because it's capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's who these people are and if</v>

3046
02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:01.650
<v Speaker 2>they're only tough when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by 60,</v>

3047
02:23:01.651 --> 02:23:06.240
<v Speaker 2>70 other of their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you take one of them away from that</v>

3048
02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.200
<v Speaker 2>and you put them in a in a position</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're powerless and that's what</v>

3049
02:23:10.201 --> 02:23:15.201
<v Speaker 2>waterboarding is to powerless and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>cave and they cower in seconds.</v>

3050
02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't need to drive a nail</v>
<v Speaker 2>through their hands.</v>

3051
02:23:18.271 --> 02:23:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to pull their teeth out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take a drill bit and</v>

3052
02:23:20.671 --> 02:23:23.430
<v Speaker 2>drive it through their fingernails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's torture.</v>

3053
02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:29.100
<v Speaker 2>This is us pouring water on a cowards</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and they freak out and people can't</v>

3054
02:23:29.101 --> 02:23:33.640
<v Speaker 2>understand that because they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what these people are and</v>

3055
02:23:34.170 --> 02:23:36.270
<v Speaker 2>their animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3056
02:23:36.271 --> 02:23:36.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3057
02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:41.340
<v Speaker 2>these aren't beautiful religious people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to do the best thing for</v>

3058
02:23:41.341 --> 02:23:46.341
<v Speaker 2>the families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people were the worst of our kind.</v>

3059
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:51.270
<v Speaker 2>These were the Nazis of the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the current version of it</v>

3060
02:23:51.271 --> 02:23:55.080
<v Speaker 2>and the these radical fanatics that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing anything for any reason to hurt</v>

3061
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:58.680
<v Speaker 2>anybody so they can feel better about</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and you take them out of that</v>

3062
02:23:58.681 --> 02:24:01.050
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take them out of that control.</v>

3063
02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:04.530
<v Speaker 2>You take them out of that opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they can be the bully and they're</v>

3064
02:24:04.531 --> 02:24:08.820
<v Speaker 2>just shadows of themselves and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you everything that you need and</v>

3065
02:24:08.821 --> 02:24:11.130
<v Speaker 2>what you need is an opportunity to save</v>
<v Speaker 2>more lives.</v>

3066
02:24:11.650 --> 02:24:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two.</v>

3067
02:24:12.220 --> 02:24:15.580
<v Speaker 3>There's two things that were discussed</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this one,</v>

3068
02:24:15.581 --> 02:24:20.581
<v Speaker 3>that your situation that you were in was</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in any way similar to the situation</v>

3069
02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:23.110
<v Speaker 3>they were in because you were doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your friends.</v>

3070
02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:27.010
<v Speaker 3>You knew you were going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You willingly did this.</v>

3071
02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:30.380
<v Speaker 3>The whole process was very controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

3072
02:24:30.430 --> 02:24:35.380
<v Speaker 3>You weren't being held by people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoke a different language in a country</v>

3073
02:24:35.381 --> 02:24:37.240
<v Speaker 3>that hates you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3074
02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:40.120
<v Speaker 3>it's a situation where you knew you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe,</v>

3075
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:44.500
<v Speaker 3>so you could relax yourself and calm</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and tolerate it to the point where</v>

3076
02:24:44.501 --> 02:24:47.150
<v Speaker 3>you knew that you would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

3077
02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:52.460
<v Speaker 3>and what was the other side?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other side is if torture works,</v>

3078
02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:56.950
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the best form of torture</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be?</v>

3079
02:24:56.951 --> 02:24:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3080
02:24:58.570 --> 02:25:00.040
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if torture does work,</v>

3081
02:25:00.041 --> 02:25:01.810
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if torture works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been torched.</v>

3082
02:25:01.811 --> 02:25:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I've never been around torture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know there's a debate both in both</v>

3083
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:06.630
<v Speaker 3>torture doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

3084
02:25:06.650 --> 02:25:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's not torture.</v>

3085
02:25:08.350 --> 02:25:10.990
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think you feel like that works,</v>

3086
02:25:10.991 --> 02:25:11.920
<v Speaker 3>but torture doesn't.</v>

3087
02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:14.900
<v Speaker 2>So I think maybe we're</v>

3088
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:19.160
<v Speaker 3>arguing about vernacular and verbs or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're forcing someone to do something</v>

3089
02:25:19.161 --> 02:25:21.110
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to do and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're freaking them out.</v>

3090
02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing something physical to them.</v>

3091
02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:25.953
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3092
02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I think we just have to define torture</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3093
02:25:28.291 --> 02:25:30.600
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's me doing something to somebody</v>

3094
02:25:30.690 --> 02:25:33.480
<v Speaker 2>that makes them uncomfortable is</v>
<v Speaker 2>torture.</v>

3095
02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean me asking a pointed question that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody in an interrogation room down</v>

3096
02:25:38.551 --> 02:25:40.230
<v Speaker 2>at lapd could be torture,</v>

3097
02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:41.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3098
02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:43.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you smack him in the face,</v>

3099
02:25:43.041 --> 02:25:44.000
<v Speaker 3>is it become torture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3100
02:25:44.001 --> 02:25:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that torture?</v>

3101
02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:45.973
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3102
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:48.170
<v Speaker 3>well if I know if I hit him with a phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

3103
02:25:48.171 --> 02:25:51.140
<v Speaker 3>maybe the problem is the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the problem is defining the word</v>

3104
02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:52.330
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3105
02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:55.790
<v Speaker 3>then they called it enhanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>interrogation techniques when,</v>

3106
02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:59.720
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to get information out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of someone that would save American</v>

3107
02:25:59.721 --> 02:26:01.760
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me,</v>

3108
02:26:02.310 --> 02:26:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I may be ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but waterboarding seems to me to be one</v>

3109
02:26:05.871 --> 02:26:07.740
<v Speaker 3>of the most humane ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3110
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:09.800
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to do any permanent</v>

3111
02:26:09.801 --> 02:26:13.040
<v Speaker 3>damage to the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like what they did a John</v>

3112
02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Mccain when he was a prisoner of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam.</v>

3113
02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:19.070
<v Speaker 3>That disturbed the shit out of me when</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy was on Fox News and he called</v>

3114
02:26:19.071 --> 02:26:22.070
<v Speaker 3>them songbird mccain because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that,</v>

3115
02:26:22.100 --> 02:26:23.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorism.</v>

3116
02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.550
<v Speaker 3>That torture other worked on became</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3117
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:27.650
<v Speaker 3>how could you stoop like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3118
02:26:27.651 --> 02:26:28.700
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you do that?</v>

3119
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:29.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3120
02:26:29.141 --> 02:26:30.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that guy has been through to</v>

3121
02:26:30.621 --> 02:26:33.470
<v Speaker 3>humiliate him and humiliate yourself by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

3122
02:26:33.770 --> 02:26:36.050
<v Speaker 3>by taking that position on television</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3123
02:26:36.051 --> 02:26:38.930
<v Speaker 3>that was so disappointing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

3124
02:26:40.050 --> 02:26:42.130
<v Speaker 2>about usable information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

3125
02:26:42.210 --> 02:26:45.480
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're questioning and if you cross that</v>

3126
02:26:45.481 --> 02:26:48.720
<v Speaker 2>threshold of torture where you are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage,</v>

3127
02:26:48.721 --> 02:26:51.660
<v Speaker 2>physical damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they'll tell you anything that's</v>

3128
02:26:51.661 --> 02:26:56.400
<v Speaker 2>not usable information that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that you've been dating your</v>

3129
02:26:56.401 --> 02:27:00.900
<v Speaker 2>producer for seven years and secretly</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I could get you to say anything</v>

3130
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:02.810
<v Speaker 2>under the right conditions that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do any.</v>

3131
02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Just want to stop the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3132
02:27:04.021 --> 02:27:05.910
<v Speaker 2>just anything to make it stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3133
02:27:06.390 --> 02:27:08.220
<v Speaker 2>that's not what was happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3134
02:27:08.250 --> 02:27:10.410
<v Speaker 2>and when we start talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>

3135
02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:11.491
<v Speaker 2>if they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3136
02:27:11.491 --> 02:27:13.650
<v Speaker 2>if this is a moral act than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than okay,</v>

3137
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:17.340
<v Speaker 2>this make me and all of my friends that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have done all sorts of,</v>

3138
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:20.340
<v Speaker 2>some in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible things are we now a moral</v>

3139
02:27:20.341 --> 02:27:24.720
<v Speaker 2>people because we did it in the interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of protecting our country and serving</v>

3140
02:27:24.721 --> 02:27:27.960
<v Speaker 2>our country and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and providing protection for our</v>

3141
02:27:27.961 --> 02:27:28.560
<v Speaker 2>freedoms.</v>

3142
02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:32.100
<v Speaker 2>And Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know those are cliche phrases that</v>

3143
02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.960
<v Speaker 2>people grab onto and I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it then by extension,</v>

3144
02:27:37.050 --> 02:27:42.050
<v Speaker 2>throwing and lobbying those accusations</v>
<v Speaker 2>at her extend to a to me and to,</v>

3145
02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:46.200
<v Speaker 2>to the things that I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I'm a very moral person.</v>

3146
02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:51.290
<v Speaker 2>And I try to be a good person in every</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I can imagine.</v>

3147
02:27:51.781 --> 02:27:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3148
02:27:53.370 --> 02:27:58.370
<v Speaker 2>but I try and the politics of bleeding</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and misusing words,</v>

3149
02:28:00.211 --> 02:28:02.820
<v Speaker 2>manipulating everything just so it fits</v>
<v Speaker 2>your agenda,</v>

3150
02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:04.440
<v Speaker 2>but nobody's in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

3151
02:28:04.441 --> 02:28:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's a green and nobody has the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest at heart and that's the people</v>

3152
02:28:09.330 --> 02:28:13.650
<v Speaker 2>like the best interest should always be</v>
<v Speaker 2>serving the people and none of them are</v>

3153
02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:17.160
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only care about what is going to</v>

3154
02:28:17.161 --> 02:28:19.140
<v Speaker 2>get them reelected or what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them more power,</v>

3155
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 2>was getting more money from the lobby or</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to give them more</v>

3156
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.650
<v Speaker 1>clout for the next vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to give a little handout</v>

3157
02:28:24.651 --> 02:28:26.120
<v Speaker 1>from the president or what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3158
02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:28.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever games that play that happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the beltway.</v>

3159
02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:31.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was an example of that in the</v>

3160
02:28:31.551 --> 02:28:36.110
<v Speaker 1>most horrible of ways because it came</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to a human lives.</v>

3161
02:28:36.410 --> 02:28:40.490
<v Speaker 1>It came down to somebody that had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving their country since the eighties</v>

3162
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:43.280
<v Speaker 1>in the best way that she knew how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ways that we're legal for her to</v>

3163
02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:46.550
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody else just manipulating the</v>

3164
02:28:46.551 --> 02:28:49.610
<v Speaker 1>narrative to fit their agenda when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sitting here being like,</v>

3165
02:28:50.330 --> 02:28:51.920
<v Speaker 1>how about the people and how about</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom?</v>

3166
02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Who's fighting for us is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you guys just going to keep</v>

3167
02:28:54.381 --> 02:28:57.500
<v Speaker 1>bickering about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So me strapped,</v>

3168
02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:00.250
<v Speaker 1>starving myself to that board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3169
02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harder.</v>

3170
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Do what's easy is to lay there strapped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have somebody put water on your face</v>

3171
02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:06.050
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3172
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I did to Steven crowder,</v>

3173
02:29:09.490 --> 02:29:13.010
<v Speaker 1>watch his hands where he'd reach up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull the.</v>

3174
02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:15.170
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't take it.</v>

3175
02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:18.770
<v Speaker 1>He would pull the rag off his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many times I pulled the rag off my</v>

3176
02:29:18.771 --> 02:29:20.180
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not once,</v>

3177
02:29:20.181 --> 02:29:21.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single time I said,</v>

3178
02:29:21.381 --> 02:29:21.621
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3179
02:29:21.621 --> 02:29:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Poor longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3180
02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:24.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use the host.</v>

3181
02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Use the bucket right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at a two.</v>

3182
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I need you at an eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I need CIA interrogation friends,</v>

3183
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:33.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sitting there willingly with my</v>

3184
02:29:33.261 --> 02:29:35.720
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the sensation of me drowning as</v>

3185
02:29:35.721 --> 02:29:40.070
<v Speaker 1>that water's running into my sinuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that was intentional.</v>

3186
02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>

3187
02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:42.620
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was safe.</v>

3188
02:29:42.621 --> 02:29:47.210
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even tied down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that to demonstrate how a man of</v>

3189
02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:52.211
<v Speaker 1>resolve can do it effortlessly and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not torture because I could</v>

3190
02:29:52.611 --> 02:29:56.450
<v Speaker 1>willingly lay there with my hands free</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull the rag off at any juncture,</v>

3191
02:29:56.810 --> 02:29:57.590
<v Speaker 1>but I did it.</v>

3192
02:29:57.590 --> 02:30:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I just sat there and I asked for more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>

3193
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:04.850
<v Speaker 1>but I also understand the position that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people take where they say,</v>

3194
02:30:04.851 --> 02:30:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you knew you were safe and so this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you had this resolve.</v>

3195
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:11.030
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not in enemy soil.</v>

3196
02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Being interrogated by isis being</v>
<v Speaker 1>strapped down by them where you didn't</v>

3197
02:30:15.021 --> 02:30:17.290
<v Speaker 1>know what was next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think this,</v>

3198
02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:20.330
<v Speaker 1>what would be next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say Rachel maddow from MSNBC,</v>

3199
02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:22.790
<v Speaker 1>because we agree on so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

3200
02:30:22.791 --> 02:30:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to come onto my show.</v>

3201
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bring in five CIA</v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogators and we're going to do it</v>

3202
02:30:27.771 --> 02:30:30.380
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in control of nothing.</v>

3203
02:30:31.310 --> 02:30:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the result would be any</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from not the same?</v>

3204
02:30:33.741 --> 02:30:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Because you're on a television show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still,</v>

3205
02:30:36.051 --> 02:30:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Americans are going to do this to</v>

3206
02:30:38.091 --> 02:30:39.500
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't been captured.</v>

3207
02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:41.030
<v Speaker 1>You're not an enemy soil.</v>

3208
02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:43.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how far did on how far do we have to</v>

3209
02:30:43.941 --> 02:30:47.420
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of be the person who's</v>

3210
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:50.570
<v Speaker 1>really captured is really capture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a game.</v>

3211
02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you get choked out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

3212
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:54.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't tap out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3213
02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:57.650
<v Speaker 1>If you get into a physical fight to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death of someone and they take your</v>

3214
02:30:57.651 --> 02:31:00.680
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tap out right in this</v>

3215
02:31:00.681 --> 02:31:01.880
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3216
02:31:01.881 --> 02:31:04.850
<v Speaker 1>you can tap out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that even if it's cei</v>

3217
02:31:04.851 --> 02:31:06.620
<v Speaker 1>interrogating you and they're yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3218
02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:11.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of your brain that knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Rachel maddow show.</v>

3219
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:13.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't kill soldiers on Rachel</v>
<v Speaker 1>maddow show.</v>

3220
02:31:14.250 --> 02:31:15.750
<v Speaker 1>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3221
02:31:15.890 --> 02:31:18.170
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know how I could better have</v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrated.</v>

3222
02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you did a fantastic job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem</v>

3223
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:23.940
<v Speaker 2>lies in it's impossible to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreate it without you being an actual</v>

3224
02:31:23.941 --> 02:31:25.680
<v Speaker 2>prisoner of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3225
02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:27.673
<v Speaker 2>do what we do,</v>

3226
02:31:28.610 --> 02:31:29.443
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3227
02:31:30.350 --> 02:31:34.700
<v Speaker 2>reverse the roles we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>snatching these guys from their bomb</v>

3228
02:31:34.701 --> 02:31:39.410
<v Speaker 2>making facility in whisking them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>upgrade and pouring water on their face.</v>

3229
02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:42.140
<v Speaker 2>What happens to me and my friends when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're captured,</v>

3230
02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:44.960
<v Speaker 2>we waterboarded no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3231
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.780
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3232
02:31:45.780 --> 02:31:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that what they do to us</v>

3233
02:31:47.451 --> 02:31:48.650
<v Speaker 2>makes what we do to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3234
02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:53.370
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying is it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it,</v>

3235
02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:53.880
<v Speaker 2>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3236
02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:55.760
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I was saying before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is torture,</v>

3237
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:59.180
<v Speaker 2>if you want to use the word torture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we'd use the words drugs,</v>

3238
02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:02.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drugs are coffee and it's also heroin,</v>

3239
02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:03.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all drugs.</v>

3240
02:32:03.711 --> 02:32:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Caffeine is a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3241
02:32:05.450 --> 02:32:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Torture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're just going to say torture,</v>

3242
02:32:07.940 --> 02:32:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that torture every day because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows what that is.</v>

3243
02:32:11.241 --> 02:32:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because even if it sucks,</v>

3244
02:32:12.770 --> 02:32:14.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start to live.</v>

3245
02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:17.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>

3246
02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:20.840
<v Speaker 2>methodically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painfully murdered.</v>

3247
02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's my only option there.</v>

3248
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:27.710
<v Speaker 2>There is never any other option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I got captured,</v>

3249
02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:31.130
<v Speaker 2>there's no moral equivalency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can both agree there's no.</v>

3250
02:32:31.131 --> 02:32:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between us and them there's not.</v>

3251
02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:37.610
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mccain himself said that she shouldn't</v>

3252
02:32:37.611 --> 02:32:41.780
<v Speaker 2>be appointed because she willingly</v>
<v Speaker 2>participated in torture.</v>

3253
02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:43.020
<v Speaker 2>He said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3254
02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:44.780
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you think about that?</v>

3255
02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I've one respect his opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3256
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:50.090
<v Speaker 2>the things that he has done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we agree on things</v>

3257
02:32:51.010 --> 02:32:51.980
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is irrelevant.</v>

3258
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:53.920
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his resume speaks for itself.</v>

3259
02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Agree and I think very few people could</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak to torture better than him.</v>

3260
02:32:59.570 --> 02:33:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3261
02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:05.770
<v Speaker 2>so him coming from that position and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that she isn't eligible to serve,</v>

3262
02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:09.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very powerful statement.</v>

3263
02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also feel that I'm pretty intimately</v>

3264
02:33:13.100 --> 02:33:17.880
<v Speaker 2>familiar with torture and that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the full spectrum of,</v>

3265
02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:20.450
<v Speaker 2>of what somebody can do selflessly for</v>
<v Speaker 2>their country.</v>

3266
02:33:20.451 --> 02:33:25.190
<v Speaker 2>And I'm selfless selfishly for their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction as a psychopath.</v>

3267
02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm like Zarqawi's enforcer that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>go around and kill people in front of</v>

3268
02:33:30.291 --> 02:33:33.470
<v Speaker 2>their own family members had carried</v>
<v Speaker 2>around a battery power drill.</v>

3269
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:37.400
<v Speaker 2>And I saw that we tracked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3270
02:33:40.170 --> 02:33:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I also know that when she was doing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these things for her whole entire</v>

3271
02:33:45.721 --> 02:33:48.270
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day were you have to look at the</v>

3272
02:33:48.271 --> 02:33:51.570
<v Speaker 2>context of the time and what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

3273
02:33:51.980 --> 02:33:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when she did every single one of</v>

3274
02:33:54.211 --> 02:33:56.640
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were authorized techniques.</v>

3275
02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.930
<v Speaker 2>They were encouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were successful in some degrees,</v>

3276
02:34:01.350 --> 02:34:04.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree and so she was trying to</v>

3277
02:34:04.531 --> 02:34:06.840
<v Speaker 2>do the best that she could in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

3278
02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:10.260
<v Speaker 2>in some cases limitation that she had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3279
02:34:11.130 --> 02:34:16.130
<v Speaker 2>and I think that is a trait that I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>in somebody leading the CIA that is,</v>

3280
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:20.950
<v Speaker 2>that they are going to do the best that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can with what they have and what</v>

3281
02:34:20.951 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

3282
02:34:24.860 --> 02:34:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I liked that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that,</v>

3283
02:34:27.540 --> 02:34:30.110
<v Speaker 5>but this isn't someone who's talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about this in the,</v>

3284
02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:31.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the comfort of a boardroom.</v>

3285
02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:36.000
<v Speaker 5>This is someone who's dealing with it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>time of war and you're dealing with some</v>

3286
02:34:36.001 --> 02:34:38.310
<v Speaker 5>of the most horrible people that we've</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever experienced it or making these</v>

3287
02:34:38.311 --> 02:34:42.390
<v Speaker 5>videos of cutting journalists heads off</v>
<v Speaker 5>and sending them to their families.</v>

3288
02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:43.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is,</v>

3289
02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:45.420
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really what</v>

3290
02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:49.080
<v Speaker 2>we were experiencing when people were</v>

3291
02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:52.780
<v Speaker 5>deciding to use these enhanced</v>
<v Speaker 5>interrogation techniques.</v>

3292
02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:56.650
<v Speaker 5>This is what they were up against.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't something you can discuss in</v>

3293
02:34:56.651 --> 02:35:01.651
<v Speaker 5>a classroom and and get a full sense of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tone and what was happening in these</v>

3294
02:35:02.951 --> 02:35:03.784
<v Speaker 5>people's lives.</v>

3295
02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Nine slash 11 was the tip of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>iceberg.</v>

3296
02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:11.790
<v Speaker 2>When that happened there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were hundreds of other plans to do</v>

3297
02:35:12.011 --> 02:35:15.220
<v Speaker 2>similar things with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was just successful.</v>

3298
02:35:15.250 --> 02:35:17.620
<v Speaker 2>They had been trying to others and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have tried other sense,</v>

3299
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:20.470
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a shoe bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a parish train,</v>

3300
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:22.870
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a San Bernardino bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a,</v>

3301
02:35:23.350 --> 02:35:24.001
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3302
02:35:24.001 --> 02:35:26.230
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a garbage truck and France,</v>

3303
02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:27.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or London Bridge.</v>

3304
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:28.710
<v Speaker 2>It's any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>

3305
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:33.710
<v Speaker 2>They have consistently been trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and duplicate and replicate that.</v>

3306
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:40.110
<v Speaker 2>The reason that it hasn't happened again</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that scale to that level is because</v>

3307
02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:45.570
<v Speaker 2>of the uncompromising selflessness of</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroes trying to protect Americans.</v>

3308
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:53.520
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't want to go into what is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater good care?</v>

3309
02:35:53.521 --> 02:35:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Are we losing morality coming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a rabbit hole that we could talk</v>

3310
02:35:56.301 --> 02:35:58.720
<v Speaker 2>about forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

3311
02:35:58.730 --> 02:35:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I just want to preserve life.</v>

3312
02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:02.910
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think that concept is so hard</v>
<v Speaker 5>for people to grasp?</v>

3313
02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:04.470
<v Speaker 5>Because Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3314
02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:07.950
<v Speaker 5>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the concept that the reason why this</v>

3315
02:36:07.951 --> 02:36:12.951
<v Speaker 5>hasn't happened more often is because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people doing the heart work.</v>

3316
02:36:14.310 --> 02:36:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Why is that so hard for people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand your skin hard work?</v>

3317
02:36:17.970 --> 02:36:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I just made a guide to MTV show just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could see for the first time that</v>

3318
02:36:21.541 --> 02:36:24.300
<v Speaker 2>people work hard so they can have food</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have work hard.</v>

3319
02:36:24.330 --> 02:36:26.780
<v Speaker 2>They get of oil and they got power that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3320
02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:31.200
<v Speaker 2>They may look at a post when I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a shirt on.</v>

3321
02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says men tend to loving being</v>
<v Speaker 2>off Usada.</v>

3322
02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:37.860
<v Speaker 2>I've looked the same sense as 19 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

3323
02:36:37.970 --> 02:36:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I have looked exactly like this with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same eight pack,</v>

3324
02:36:40.531 --> 02:36:43.860
<v Speaker 2>with the same muscle definition since I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was an 18 year old kid.</v>

3325
02:36:44.130 --> 02:36:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how many times I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been tested from the military for Usada</v>

3326
02:36:47.170 --> 02:36:49.590
<v Speaker 2>to different events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been cleaned my whole entire</v>

3327
02:36:49.591 --> 02:36:51.630
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody can in their mind.</v>

3328
02:36:51.870 --> 02:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>They can't understand to get from here</v>
<v Speaker 2>to there is hard work.</v>

3329
02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:58.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be an easier way.</v>

3330
02:36:58.290 --> 02:37:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It has to be steroids or it has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>this or it has to be that.</v>

3331
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It's the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're protected and they're safe,</v>

3332
02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:08.000
<v Speaker 2>but they can't grasp the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard work that it took to keep them</v>

3333
02:37:08.431 --> 02:37:09.020
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even</v>

3334
02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:10.490
<v Speaker 5>think they're thinking that deeply into</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3335
02:37:10.491 --> 02:37:12.530
<v Speaker 5>I think they're just talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people see you.</v>

3336
02:37:12.531 --> 02:37:15.830
<v Speaker 5>You Look Jack Storage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't there's that much thought,</v>

3337
02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:16.000
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

3338
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the same lack of thought.</v>

3339
02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:22.250
<v Speaker 3>It's the same lack of consideration of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it took for us,</v>

3340
02:37:22.251 --> 02:37:27.251
<v Speaker 3>for us currently to be safe and what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>still takes for us to be safe.</v>

3341
02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:31.410
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the departure.</v>

3342
02:37:31.411 --> 02:37:32.640
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the break in,</v>

3343
02:37:32.641 --> 02:37:33.230
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3344
02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:36.390
<v Speaker 3>in the thought process is they just want</v>
<v Speaker 3>the easiest way and they don't want to</v>

3345
02:37:36.391 --> 02:37:40.050
<v Speaker 3>even believe that this hard way is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that actually has happened.</v>

3346
02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:45.090
<v Speaker 3>What is the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the alternative suggestion and</v>

3347
02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:47.400
<v Speaker 3>instead of enhanced interrogation</v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques,</v>

3348
02:37:47.401 --> 02:37:50.640
<v Speaker 3>waterboarding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of letting the CIA do what it's</v>

3349
02:37:50.641 --> 02:37:54.200
<v Speaker 3>done up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the alternative I can.</v>

3350
02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:56.880
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody offered in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3351
02:37:57.210 --> 02:37:59.490
<v Speaker 3>in response to that instead of doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>

3352
02:37:59.670 --> 02:38:02.160
<v Speaker 3>do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean now we're just leaving them and</v>

3353
02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:04.860
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're leaving them all be great for how</v>

3354
02:38:04.861 --> 02:38:05.694
<v Speaker 3>long</v>

3355
02:38:06.830 --> 02:38:08.770
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3356
02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:11.090
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like now they're in perpetual</v>

3357
02:38:11.091 --> 02:38:16.091
<v Speaker 3>purgatory for eternity</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is no other solution.</v>

3358
02:38:17.291 --> 02:38:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's presented one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just complaining about the</v>

3359
02:38:19.091 --> 02:38:20.170
<v Speaker 3>options that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3360
02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:22.930
<v Speaker 3>But that's the point is that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's said,</v>

3361
02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:25.060
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the CIA has done a terrible job.</v>

3362
02:38:25.061 --> 02:38:26.230
<v Speaker 3>This is the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3363
02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:28.840
<v Speaker 3>They're just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>

3364
02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Torture people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I agree with that.</v>

3365
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:32.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoot.</v>

3366
02:38:32.441 --> 02:38:35.380
<v Speaker 3>People with paintball pellets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't shoot him with bullets.</v>

3367
02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:36.400
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3368
02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.470
<v Speaker 3>hit them with rubber bats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't hit them with.</v>

3369
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:40.750
<v Speaker 3>What are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they saying?</v>

3370
02:38:40.751 --> 02:38:44.830
<v Speaker 3>If they do you think part of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the vast majority of the population</v>

3371
02:38:44.831 --> 02:38:48.340
<v Speaker 3>will never truly understand combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll never truly understand what</v>

3372
02:38:48.341 --> 02:38:51.640
<v Speaker 3>people are capable of in the worst case</v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario.</v>

3373
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:52.503
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

3374
02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:53.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3375
02:38:53.290 --> 02:38:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I hope that 99 percent of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>population never has to see any of the</v>

3376
02:38:58.121 --> 02:39:00.690
<v Speaker 3>things that we've seen otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3377
02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:01.533
<v Speaker 3>failed.</v>

3378
02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that maybe it wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst idea in the world to force</v>

3379
02:39:06.791 --> 02:39:10.660
<v Speaker 3>people to have some sort of mandatory</v>
<v Speaker 3>service,</v>

3380
02:39:10.661 --> 02:39:15.661
<v Speaker 3>whether it's mandatory service in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coast guard or whether it's the peace</v>

3381
02:39:16.121 --> 02:39:20.410
<v Speaker 3>corps or whether it's the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just some service of your country for a</v>

3382
02:39:20.411 --> 02:39:23.950
<v Speaker 3>predetermined period of time like they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do in Israel like they do in South Korea</v>

3383
02:39:23.951 --> 02:39:26.670
<v Speaker 3>like they do in several other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3384
02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:29.230
<v Speaker 3>I would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that would fix things?</v>

3385
02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I think he's give people an</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what's required.</v>

3386
02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Like send people to Afghanistan for six</v>
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>

3387
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:37.270
<v Speaker 3>let people understand like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

3388
02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:39.670
<v Speaker 3>like God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kansas is pretty fucking bad ass.</v>

3389
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:44.470
<v Speaker 3>How about to send them to El Paso?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A more come down there on the Flores?</v>

3390
02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:45.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3391
02:39:45.810 --> 02:39:49.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean I understand that the world is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not San Francisco.</v>

3392
02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:55.380
<v Speaker 3>There are dark places and you could see</v>
<v Speaker 3>that on cnn all you want and look at it</v>

3393
02:39:56.111 --> 02:39:59.650
<v Speaker 3>on our t until you can smell it until</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live it.</v>

3394
02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:02.260
<v Speaker 3>Until we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to take these pills every single</v>

3395
02:40:02.260 --> 02:40:04.030
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which gives me the shits or otherwise I</v>

3396
02:40:04.031 --> 02:40:05.800
<v Speaker 3>get malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>

3397
02:40:05.801 --> 02:40:07.600
<v Speaker 3>they are all these people walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>around?</v>

3398
02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Are they taking these pills?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3399
02:40:09.430 --> 02:40:10.420
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3400
02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:12.520
<v Speaker 3>some of them have mullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3401
02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:14.250
<v Speaker 3>we're the having that reality</v>

3402
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:17.430
<v Speaker 1>sink into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way I'm going to eat that goat and</v>

3403
02:40:17.431 --> 02:40:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I have to pull the pieces of hair out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mouth that that's the reality for the</v>

3404
02:40:22.321 --> 02:40:24.690
<v Speaker 1>majority of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

3405
02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I would love for somebody to force</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody to have a taste of hard work.</v>

3406
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants something free,</v>

3407
02:40:33.451 --> 02:40:35.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want the government to do many</v>

3408
02:40:35.371 --> 02:40:37.830
<v Speaker 1>things for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide services and do things for her.</v>

3409
02:40:37.831 --> 02:40:42.820
<v Speaker 1>But the government is essentially just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of us and a group of private</v>

3410
02:40:42.821 --> 02:40:45.270
<v Speaker 1>versions of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody telling me I have</v>

3411
02:40:45.271 --> 02:40:47.310
<v Speaker 1>to go do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody telling me I have</v>

3412
02:40:47.311 --> 02:40:50.580
<v Speaker 1>to go serve somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's the worst option</v>

3413
02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:55.880
<v Speaker 1>to get people if we really hit a pivotal</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where people have such a complete</v>

3414
02:40:56.250 --> 02:40:59.910
<v Speaker 1>lack of appreciation and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what it takes to make the world work</v>

3415
02:40:59.970 --> 02:41:00.803
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

3416
02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:05.850
<v Speaker 1>That might be one of the only viable</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions is some sort of mandatory</v>

3417
02:41:05.851 --> 02:41:09.180
<v Speaker 1>service for some agreed upon period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3418
02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen when you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

3419
02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I think a war fighter should always and</v>
<v Speaker 1>only be volunteer.</v>

3420
02:41:16.470 --> 02:41:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3421
02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving your country for two years,</v>

3422
02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:23.970
<v Speaker 1>working on the border of working at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless shelter,</v>

3423
02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:26.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian aid,</v>

3424
02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:29.520
<v Speaker 1>working in a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the different things that we</v>

3425
02:41:29.521 --> 02:41:33.240
<v Speaker 1>could do with all of these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have their eyes opened.</v>

3426
02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it strengthened people.</v>

3427
02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it could their,</v>

3428
02:41:38.470 --> 02:41:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their character,</v>

3429
02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:40.530
<v Speaker 1>their soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies,</v>

3430
02:41:40.531 --> 02:41:42.270
<v Speaker 1>their minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

3431
02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just being forced to understand that</v>

3432
02:41:44.341 --> 02:41:47.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of messy work that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to make this thing work</v>

3433
02:41:47.191 --> 02:41:51.090
<v Speaker 1>correctly and we all benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of us benefit from it and just</v>

3434
02:41:51.091 --> 02:41:54.630
<v Speaker 1>sit at home and play video games and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheetos and do nothing.</v>

3435
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:57.800
<v Speaker 1>And you still complained about Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sneak out.</v>

3436
02:41:59.550 --> 02:42:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3437
02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:06.560
<v Speaker 1>everything that we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's success or food.</v>

3438
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Good looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at a beautiful girlfriend,</v>

3439
02:42:09.871 --> 02:42:11.160
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful boyfriend.</v>

3440
02:42:11.250 --> 02:42:14.640
<v Speaker 1>All of that is always just on the far</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of hard work.</v>

3441
02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3442
02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:21.900
<v Speaker 1>There's some dudes I've never going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a hot chick is you work all day.</v>

3443
02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Shit rolls of the dice out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're genetically.</v>

3444
02:42:25.801 --> 02:42:27.210
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never going to pan out.</v>

3445
02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Everything I've ever wanted has always</v>
<v Speaker 1>been everything I've ever had.</v>

3446
02:42:31.681 --> 02:42:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Everything I've ever gained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

3447
02:42:32.770 --> 02:42:37.770
<v Speaker 1>every bit of who I am has always been on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the far side of hard work.</v>

3448
02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lance Armstrong and I were talking</v>

3449
02:42:42.390 --> 02:42:46.350
<v Speaker 1>and arguing about a performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drugs,</v>

3450
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:48.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I fought for two world titles and I</v>

3451
02:42:48.331 --> 02:42:50.820
<v Speaker 1>lost two world titles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3452
02:42:50.821 --> 02:42:54.540
<v Speaker 1>he wants seven and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was in the dirtiest of dirty</v>

3453
02:42:54.541 --> 02:42:55.374
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3454
02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

3455
02:42:58.240 --> 02:42:59.800
<v Speaker 1>doesn't Tim Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3456
02:42:59.810 --> 02:43:01.770
<v Speaker 1>world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that sound better?</v>

3457
02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:03.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

3458
02:43:03.571 --> 02:43:04.830
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>

3459
02:43:05.130 --> 02:43:09.960
<v Speaker 1>but I would have lost everything because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I've ever had has been from</v>

3460
02:43:09.961 --> 02:43:11.100
<v Speaker 1>hard work and that would have been,</v>

3461
02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:16.020
<v Speaker 3>is he trying to justify his own</v>
<v Speaker 3>existence dummy.</v>

3462
02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:17.920
<v Speaker 3>What's happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also it's a different sport.</v>

3463
02:43:18.010 --> 02:43:19.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a different thing between no</v>

3464
02:43:19.901 --> 02:43:22.750
<v Speaker 3>one gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take epo and you run your bike</v>

3465
02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:24.010
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

3466
02:43:24.011 --> 02:43:27.220
<v Speaker 3>No one gets hurt if you're on something</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it allows you to beat someone's</v>

3467
02:43:27.221 --> 02:43:31.750
<v Speaker 3>brains in better and you walk away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>a title knowing that you cheated,</v>

3468
02:43:31.751 --> 02:43:36.520
<v Speaker 3>but the guy you beat was natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to a guy like you is a torture.</v>

3469
02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:38.980
<v Speaker 3>The you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna be in prison and the rest</v>

3470
02:43:38.981 --> 02:43:41.370
<v Speaker 3>of your life with that thought bouncing</v>
<v Speaker 3>around in year head,</v>

3471
02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:48.720
<v Speaker 3>that's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the same thing when we guys like</v>

3472
02:43:48.791 --> 02:43:53.791
<v Speaker 3>Vitor Belfort who failed multiple tests</v>
<v Speaker 3>were world champions multiple times,</v>

3473
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:58.740
<v Speaker 3>sort of he really only one once against</v>
<v Speaker 3>randy because randy got cut memory.</v>

3474
02:43:58.741 --> 02:44:02.770
<v Speaker 3>You got that crazy icon and he won the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament when he was 19,</v>

3475
02:44:02.771 --> 02:44:07.771
<v Speaker 3>but even then he was sauced up so he</v>
<v Speaker 3>still feels like a world champion to</v>

3476
02:44:08.081 --> 02:44:08.830
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

3477
02:44:08.830 --> 02:44:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I would never want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

3478
02:44:09.931 --> 02:44:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm not rationalizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he paid the price though is and he</v>

3479
02:44:13.631 --> 02:44:16.390
<v Speaker 3>will pay the price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he paid the price physically.</v>

3480
02:44:16.391 --> 02:44:18.910
<v Speaker 3>You look at the transformation between</v>
<v Speaker 3>TRT v toward that,</v>

3481
02:44:18.911 --> 02:44:22.240
<v Speaker 3>knocked out luke rockhold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll kick and Michael Bisping,</v>

3482
02:44:22.270 --> 02:44:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Dan Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a fucking monster and then the</v>

3483
02:44:25.181 --> 02:44:28.420
<v Speaker 3>deflated version of him where his body</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3484
02:44:28.421 --> 02:44:31.150
<v Speaker 3>endocrine system's failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't produce testosterone anymore.</v>

3485
02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Can't take a punch anymore is he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>look even remotely similar to what it</v>

3486
02:44:35.591 --> 02:44:36.990
<v Speaker 3>used to look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

3487
02:44:37.050 --> 02:44:40.510
<v Speaker 3>It's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm look at the difference between him</v>

3488
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:42.880
<v Speaker 3>and then look at Yoel Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3489
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Yoel Romero is 40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>41 years old.</v>

3490
02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:49.690
<v Speaker 3>He looks the same older than Victorville</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's fucking jacked.</v>

3491
02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you're dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>significant genetic advantage and you</v>

3492
02:44:54.051 --> 02:44:55.510
<v Speaker 3>all said that when he was on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

3493
02:44:55.511 --> 02:44:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a great podcast.</v>

3494
02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:59.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Joey Diaz translated for them back</v>

3495
02:44:59.561 --> 02:45:00.171
<v Speaker 3>and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3496
02:45:00.171 --> 02:45:02.410
<v Speaker 3>they spoke Spanish and then translated</v>
<v Speaker 3>to English,</v>

3497
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:05.440
<v Speaker 3>but he said if you go to Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like regular people,</v>

3498
02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:07.780
<v Speaker 3>regular people you see a bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drivers jacked.</v>

3499
02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.120
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a phenomenal gene</v>

3500
02:45:10.121 --> 02:45:12.540
<v Speaker 3>pool here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're baseball players that come out</v>

3501
02:45:12.541 --> 02:45:14.050
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they touched the ball and it goes over</v>

3502
02:45:14.051 --> 02:45:14.811
<v Speaker 3>the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3503
02:45:14.811 --> 02:45:17.110
<v Speaker 3>there three printers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say this is the,</v>

3504
02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:21.430
<v Speaker 3>this is the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark aspects of the slave trade.</v>

3505
02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you're dealing with the</v>

3506
02:45:22.811 --> 02:45:24.550
<v Speaker 3>best of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the strongest,</v>

3507
02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:27.370
<v Speaker 3>most athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones who can work the hardest.</v>

3508
02:45:27.371 --> 02:45:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is essentially a big part of the</v>

3509
02:45:31.361 --> 02:45:36.361
<v Speaker 3>gene pool that is Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you deal with the decades and</v>

3510
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:39.370
<v Speaker 3>decades of extremely high level athletic</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>

3511
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:40.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

3512
02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:44.860
<v Speaker 3>with all these different sports and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these different programs where they</v>

3513
02:45:44.861 --> 02:45:48.490
<v Speaker 3>develop the very best athletes in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their area.</v>

3514
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrestlers,</v>

3515
02:45:50.411 --> 02:45:52.600
<v Speaker 3>the boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the judo players,</v>

3516
02:45:52.810 --> 02:45:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean phenomenal athletes and that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gene pool is just outstanding.</v>

3517
02:45:58.420 --> 02:45:59.260
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3518
02:46:02.260 --> 02:46:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Hector Lombard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another physical example,</v>

3519
02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:11.220
<v Speaker 3>but looking at vidors body shrink and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will stay the same mindset,</v>

3520
02:46:11.770 --> 02:46:13.350
<v Speaker 3>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3521
02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:19.030
<v Speaker 3>what do you think the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the actual beating cardiovascular</v>

3522
02:46:19.341 --> 02:46:22.700
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like the soul of Vidor,</v>

3523
02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:27.880
<v Speaker 3>he visibly looked deflated and every one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his fights post Usada he knows he's</v>

3524
02:46:29.301 --> 02:46:33.950
<v Speaker 3>going into that in a compromised state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he was going into it,</v>

3525
02:46:33.951 --> 02:46:36.630
<v Speaker 3>like when he got tested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the times,</v>

3526
02:46:36.650 --> 02:46:39.890
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone replacement therapy got</v>

3527
02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:42.860
<v Speaker 3>eliminated as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or got tested randomly and he was off</v>

3528
02:46:42.861 --> 02:46:46.880
<v Speaker 3>the charts like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look to the point like superhuman levels</v>

3529
02:46:46.881 --> 02:46:47.900
<v Speaker 3>of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3530
02:46:47.901 --> 02:46:49.880
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

3531
02:46:50.110 --> 02:46:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have this massive advantage and</v>

3532
02:46:52.311 --> 02:46:57.311
<v Speaker 3>massive confidence advantage and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically looks like a demon,</v>

3533
02:46:58.370 --> 02:47:01.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One that when that's gone,</v>

3534
02:47:01.700 --> 02:47:05.660
<v Speaker 3>now you're less than a regular man</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically and mentally,</v>

3535
02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:08.480
<v Speaker 3>physically and mentally because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>tired all the time.</v>

3536
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Your body's tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not producing good levels of</v>

3537
02:47:11.601 --> 02:47:13.880
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about it openly about they</v>

3538
02:47:13.881 --> 02:47:17.150
<v Speaker 3>tested his testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the testosterone was 70 year old man</v>

3539
02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:21.260
<v Speaker 3>and he's fighting in a cage for living</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a very high level.</v>

3540
02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:27.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still think it comes down to hard</v>

3541
02:47:29.091 --> 02:47:31.490
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it certainly does,</v>

3542
02:47:31.491 --> 02:47:35.030
<v Speaker 3>but all the hard work in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're built like,</v>

3543
02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:37.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Kevin Smith.</v>

3544
02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:38.700
<v Speaker 3>No disrespect Kevin.</v>

<v Speaker 3>pound your face into the dirt every</v>

3547
02:47:44.901 --> 02:47:48.770
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Smith is a millionaire that is</v>

3548
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:51.940
<v Speaker 3>massively successful in what he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do and disaster.</v>

3549
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Super smart that it didn't go into cage</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting and he works hard and does a,</v>

3550
02:47:58.041 --> 02:48:00.740
<v Speaker 3>you go all the way back to the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's writing scripts and he's doing</v>

3551
02:48:00.741 --> 02:48:03.860
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dude was the first.</v>

3552
02:48:03.861 --> 02:48:08.810
<v Speaker 3>They're the last to leave and then is</v>
<v Speaker 3>success is not,</v>

3553
02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:10.160
<v Speaker 3>is unquestioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3554
02:48:10.161 --> 02:48:11.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you 100 percent.</v>

3555
02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:15.230
<v Speaker 3>He most certainly worked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about genetics.</v>

3556
02:48:15.530 --> 02:48:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Like there's genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Francis and Ghana has freakish</v>

3557
02:48:19.970 --> 02:48:21.300
<v Speaker 3>genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3558
02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:23.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously a steep meo chick also has</v>

3559
02:48:23.961 --> 02:48:25.910
<v Speaker 3>very good genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still a giant person,</v>

3560
02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:31.540
<v Speaker 3>but the genetics and Francis have has in</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to the average person.</v>

3561
02:48:31.671 --> 02:48:34.880
<v Speaker 3>You could work all you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not competing with that.</v>

3562
02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:35.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3563
02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:38.480
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that just get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

3564
02:48:38.481 --> 02:48:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Roll the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He uh,</v>

3565
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:44.720
<v Speaker 3>he also lost his title fight though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddy lost a steep way who was also got</v>

3566
02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:47.260
<v Speaker 3>pretty fucking phenomenal genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a giant duties,</v>

02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:52.040
<v Speaker 3>tough as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very skilled and has a just a lifetime</v>

3568
02:48:52.290 --> 02:48:53.660
<v Speaker 3>championship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No experience.</v>

3569
02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say anything nice about</v>

3570
02:48:54.831 --> 02:48:55.930
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all I get that.</v>

3571
02:48:55.970 --> 02:48:57.560
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for me to say anything nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>about him,</v>

3572
02:48:58.100 --> 02:48:59.140
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

3576
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:10.380
<v Speaker 2>for forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever remember looking at him and</v>

3583
02:49:20.761 --> 02:49:23.520

3584
02:49:23.521 --> 02:49:27.090
<v Speaker 2>doing anything suspicious in his hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

3585

<v Speaker 2>Hard work that made him a warm champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got toughness.</v>

3595
02:49:48.850 --> 02:49:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could pick a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>instances like we,</v>

3596
02:49:51.550 --> 02:49:53.220
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but why not now?</v>

3600
02:49:59.730 --> 02:50:01.830
<v Speaker 2>If he retires and you retire.</v>

3617
02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:42.290
<v Speaker 5>of calling fights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the most powerful experiences</v>

3618
02:50:42.291 --> 02:50:44.870
<v Speaker 5>that I ever saw really wasn't even</v>
<v Speaker 5>televised.</v>

3619
02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:50.080
<v Speaker 5>It was in between you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you knocking out Sapo in the fight for</v>

3620
02:50:52.911 --> 02:50:57.911
<v Speaker 5>the troops and you got on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>cage and all the troops were there</v>

3621
02:50:58.370 --> 02:51:02.240
<v Speaker 5>cheering you on and nobody there was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wasn't televised.</v>

3622
02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:05.300
<v Speaker 5>There'll be saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you were pointing it all those</v>

3623
02:51:05.301 --> 02:51:07.250
<v Speaker 5>people and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love you.</v>

3624
02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:09.290
<v Speaker 5>I do this for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love you.</v>

3625
02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:12.350
<v Speaker 5>And they were cheering and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking powerful moment.</v>

3626
02:51:12.351 --> 02:51:14.630
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a powerful moment that to this</v>

3627
02:51:14.631 --> 02:51:19.631
<v Speaker 5>day I think about sometimes because that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a different kind of a fight.</v>

3628
02:51:19.730 --> 02:51:23.470
<v Speaker 5>It was a different kind of an audience</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was a,</v>

3629
02:51:23.650 --> 02:51:26.780
<v Speaker 5>it was a different kind of a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you launched that left hook on</v>

3630
02:51:26.781 --> 02:51:30.170
<v Speaker 5>him and connected him and stopped him</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then jumped up on the cage and did</v>

3631
02:51:30.171 --> 02:51:33.020
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was that audience.</v>

3632
02:51:33.050 --> 02:51:37.250
<v Speaker 5>The love they had for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the love you had for them was it was</v>

3633
02:51:37.251 --> 02:51:37.911
<v Speaker 5>in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3634
02:51:37.911 --> 02:51:40.080
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking amazingly powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll</v>

3635
02:51:40.690 --> 02:51:42.370
<v Speaker 2>never forget that moment to the day I</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

3636
02:51:42.430 --> 02:51:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the fight,</v>

3637
02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:46.570
<v Speaker 2>not the fight camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3638
02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had so much love for everybody.</v>

3639
02:51:52.811 --> 02:51:53.501
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3640
02:51:53.501 --> 02:51:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I would have melted out of fan ost</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

3641
02:51:56.831 --> 02:52:00.250
<v Speaker 2>vaporized and taken every one of my bits</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just handed it to everybody there.</v>

3642
02:52:00.690 --> 02:52:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not existed just so that they could</v>

3643
02:52:02.891 --> 02:52:06.370
<v Speaker 2>have anything that they wanted because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was just nothing</v>

3644
02:52:06.370 --> 02:52:09.970
<v Speaker 1>in me that I wanted more than just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them anything I had.</v>

3645
02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I believed that it came out</v>

3646
02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:16.000
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were saying what you were</v>

3647
02:52:16.001 --> 02:52:17.080
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way just,</v>

3648
02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:18.870
<v Speaker 1>you could feel the,</v>
