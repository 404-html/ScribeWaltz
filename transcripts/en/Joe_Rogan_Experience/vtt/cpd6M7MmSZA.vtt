00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to quote Sinbad.</v>

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Say that you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the.</v>

4
00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:07.564
<v Speaker 1>I love this quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

5
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>he's a very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was great.</v>

6
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>He did my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hands Club says he's awesome.</v>

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Talk about leaving your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Astral projection.</v>

8
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Same bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>

9
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>He asked truly projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astral project.</v>

10
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>How's he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stopped doing well.</v>

11
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>There's all these techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's there's books and stuff about</v>

12
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long and the short is you get into a</v>

13
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:28.581
<v Speaker 1>trance and you imagine a rope above you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then pull yourself down or what he did</v>

14
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>actually remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

15
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I put something just out of my reach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're trying,</v>

16
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>as you're laying there with your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>closed,</v>

17
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to reach the thing,</v>

18
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>and then he said he felt his hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped around and that's how he knew he</v>

19
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>had left his body and he did it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>months and months and months and months,</v>

20
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>and then one day he said he was like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird place.</v>

21
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>It was in the cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some shadow creature came up and hit him</v>

22
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>in the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is sinbad,</v>

23
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes and it felt like someone had</v>

24
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>cracked me in the chest with a sledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer and he was like,</v>

25
00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I never did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

26
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.421
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

27
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>You got to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and find like booby island or</v>

28
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right though.</v>

29
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's ready to be snatched up by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demons in stranger things.</v>

30
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>It is next dimension demon that lives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>

31
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>It is scary if you read a journey's out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the body are far.</v>

32
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Journey is a Robert Monroe in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>

33
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you read this book and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>still calls black people negros and</v>

34
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>stuff like you can tell it's an old old</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

35
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>but he's telling that's how old this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is.</v>

36
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>It's because way back he would tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about like seeing something fly</v>

37
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>by and being very concerned that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was trying to get into his body</v>

38
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>before he did.</v>

39
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a scary thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things.</v>

40
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So I was under the impression that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people did die when most people are</v>

41
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>under that impression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

42
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken,</v>

43
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>given talks at medical schools and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these doctors think that</v>

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>everyone died at 35 or 35 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>results and they're like,</v>

45
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>and it works its way into medicine where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

46
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.631
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

47
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>the reason you have chronic back pain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the human body was not evolved to</v>

48
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>live beyond 35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so of course you have wear and tear</v>

49
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>and things like that's totally false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human bodies evolved to live into</v>

50
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a statistical thing.</v>

51
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like if Bill Gates moves into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

52
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>suddenly everyone's average annual</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary is hundreds of millions of</v>

53
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you count all these infants who</v>
<v Speaker 1>died in prehistory,</v>

55
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>many of whom by the way died from</v>
<v Speaker 1>infanticide,</v>

56
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>like twins normally are not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

57
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weaker one is left in the woods to</v>

58
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.934
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

59
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and any sort of deform and mal</v>

60
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>formality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just leave them in the woods by</v>

61
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a cruel way to handle it.</v>

62
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

63
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>That's dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would leave him to wolves.</v>

64
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

65
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Leave your baby in a basket and runaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

66
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>

67
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>a lot of infanticide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

68
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>in our world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it,</v>

69
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because the times were harder than.</v>

71
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And it was more accepted that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to do some terrible things</v>

72
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>that you didn't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>if a kid's born physically fucked up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some way,</v>

75
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna,</v>

76
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna have the resources and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid's not going to.</v>

77
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>The person's not going to grow up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to the group.</v>

78
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>And so generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also there's a different sense of</v>

79
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

80
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're death is much more a daily</v>

81
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big a deal.</v>

82
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So we're all gonna die there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading about a tribe in the</v>

83
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

84
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when someone gets too old to keep up</v>

85
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>with the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is chosen randomly,</v>

86
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>like they have a lottery or pick the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shortest straw or whatever it is.</v>

87
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>And their job is to come up behind this</v>
<v Speaker 1>old person and hit him in the back of</v>

88
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>the head with a hatchet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

89
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no one wants to do it.</v>

90
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 1>It really sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone agrees it has to be done.</v>

91
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's the least cruel option that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've come up.</v>

92
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Be careful to do to keep signing up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that job.</v>

93
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got</v>

94
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Papa Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've killed nine old ladies.</v>

95
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>This lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bitches gone over.</v>

96
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just let her stop.</v>

97
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

98
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenton's wife tends to look at me like</v>

99
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.800
<v Speaker 1>that is the source of looseness right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

100
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:27.801
<v Speaker 1>That's single man with a mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This man got cut loose to spend too much</v>

101
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>time with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could all go down a feral.</v>

102
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's why.</v>

103
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Like no one tells Ryan were to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan can just go into the woods anytime</v>

104
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's right.</v>

105
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about d?</v>

106
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have a leash on how many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he call and check in,</v>

107
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.330
<v Speaker 1>but I was just out there with no leash</v>
<v Speaker 1>collar.</v>

108
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I get a long leash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get along,</v>

109
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>especially during hunting season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mark might have a leash.</v>

110
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Brian doesn't have a leash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just asked him.</v>

111
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to call anybody.</v>

112
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>He just goes where he wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

113
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he just decides to take that mustache</v>

114
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>and go for a hike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can tell him that.</v>

115
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.910
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pisses women off because then when</v>

116
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>demand goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

117
