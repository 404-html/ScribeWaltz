00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:04.951
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

3
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>that was a nutty scene,</v>

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Being there and the Wayans felt surreal.</v>

6
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>It felt really nice.</v>

7
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.641
<v Speaker 1>Friendly.</v>

8
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

9
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>it happened.</v>

10
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.541
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

12
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

13
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Like the weight of the event was thick in the air.</v>

14
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>It had this feel to it that was very different than any other show we'd ever put</v>

15
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

16
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.851
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was there that,</v>

17
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:21.451
<v Speaker 1>that's the one show.</v>

18
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was that because it was so special.</v>

19
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be tough to beat that,</v>

20
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>but it'll never be you.</v>

21
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll have big giant events for sure,</v>

23
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>but it'll never be like that because that was the last block of corruption.</v>

24
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.001
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

25
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I was standing in front of the UFC,</v>

26
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>getting into New York.</v>

27
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I got a little worried when I saw,</v>

28
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:37.621
<v Speaker 1>where was,</v>

30
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I think I was in Atlanta doing live show.</v>

31
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I saw on the,</v>

32
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.241
<v Speaker 1>on the Twitter,</v>

33
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>like the crazy press conference with Connor doing that stuff.</v>

34
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

35
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

36
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

37
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And it was kind of weird.</v>

38
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:47.911
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

39
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:48.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>it seems a little gimmicky,</v>

41
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:49.351
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

42
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:49.501
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

43
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:50.334
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

44
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And then the way he looked a little more serious and then the night of the</v>

45
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:53.761
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

46
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

47
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't have written a better show.</v>

49
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

52
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>the fights that night,</v>

53
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>the way everything happened,</v>

54
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>

55
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Man by amazing bar,</v>

56
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>the best UFC I've ever seen.</v>

57
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It was by far the,</v>

58
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>the main event was almost,</v>

59
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it was almost bizarre.</v>

60
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It's almost bizarre how good Connors,</v>

61
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>almost bizarre the way he picked apart Eddie Alvarez.</v>

62
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Almost bizarre.</v>

63
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Like magical.</v>

64
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>That's almost the word I wanna use.</v>

65
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

66
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Like he touches motherfuckers.</v>

67
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Would that left hand?</v>

68
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen any average?</v>

69
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Just like they didn't even look like they were in the same planet.</v>

70
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Like one guy,</v>

71
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>like look like he was from Mars.</v>

72
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>The other guy look like he's just a normal dude trying to figure it out.</v>

73
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>it looked like Eddie,</v>

75
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>the moment he got hit with like,</v>

76
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you could see on his face.</v>

77
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:39.271
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

78
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>holy,</v>

79
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus,</v>

80
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing here?</v>

81
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>

82
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

84
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.951
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

85
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>He's not very good at wrestling.</v>

86
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>We try this wrestling cutters like that was your shot,</v>

87
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.541
<v Speaker 1>I'll bro,</v>

88
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you're in for a long night.</v>

89
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that he realized like,</v>

90
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck boys already touched up a little bit when he finally went in for the</v>

91
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:54.654
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>

92
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.171
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

93
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>And I just think I'm Connor new.</v>

94
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Then also that he had them and how calm was he?</v>

95
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.021
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

96
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Just calm upright and just waiting.</v>

97
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And then the accuracy of that Combo that finally finished Eddie.</v>

98
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think makes Connor show specials is accuracy.</v>

99
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>When he throws punches,</v>

100
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's moving as he's laying in this stuff.</v>

101
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like,</v>

102
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

103
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>it was straight up magical.</v>

104
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

105
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.391
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

106
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>well we've never seen a guy like this.</v>

107
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>We just have it.</v>

108
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.481
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we ever,</v>

109
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>well either.</v>

110
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting too when I was interviewing him and he's like,</v>

111
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta have some attributes.</v>

112
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.101
<v Speaker 1>If you want to beat me,</v>

113
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be tall.</v>

114
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.623
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be big.</v>

115
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.231
<v Speaker 1>It can me.</v>

116
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>These guys my size,</v>

117
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing though,</v>

118
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

119
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

120
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a once in a lifetime guy because he sent in the ceiling.</v>

121
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no,</v>

122
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no boundaries for him.</v>

123
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just like,</v>

124
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight Nate at 70 I'll be 45 sure on merch Aldo in 13 seconds and they'll</v>

125
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>come to 55 like we've never seen this kind of creativity and we've often never</v>

126
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>seen the UFC allow someone to do this either.</v>

127
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Well he's just such a unique personality.</v>

129
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It's undeniable,</v>

130
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but also his style in a lot of ways.</v>

131
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>He kind of does a lot of lightweight Wonderboy does,</v>

132
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>but with less kicks,</v>

133
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>like he throws kicks to the body,</v>

134
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw it some front kicks.</v>

135
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:08.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:08.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 70% has many kicks.</v>

138
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy is a little more kick heavy,</v>

139
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's that sideway style and he's,</v>

140
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

141
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.471
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

142
00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he does it better.</v>

143
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Like there's maybe something about the focus of the shots that he's landing,</v>

144
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>the precision of them,</v>

145
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.830
<v Speaker 1>cause Wonderboy very rarely like touches somebody up like that with a punch.</v>

146
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't have that kind of power.</v>

147
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

149
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I think Wonderboy is better at surprising guys with his kicks in his ankles,</v>

150
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>but commerce set it up and he's landing combos that are all so precise in this</v>

151
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

152
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>like he's touching dudes and you can see it on their face touched Eddie and</v>

153
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's like,</v>

154
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>what duff?</v>

155
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:47.251
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

157
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:47.681
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

158
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>he's hitting him in a surprise way is not telegraphing it at all.</v>

159
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Like his ability to like go from bouncing around to launching that shot is so</v>

160
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:58.774
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

161
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.501
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

162
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>it's so precise and it's so focused and there's no fat in his movements.</v>

163
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just yet,</v>

164
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and they said there's gonna be a big announcement afterwards enough,</v>

165
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>these girls pregnant,</v>

166
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>which I mean it's a personal big announcement for him,</v>

167
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's,</v>

168
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>he said he's going to take time off and he wants a piece of the pie.</v>

169
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.060
<v Speaker 1>He wants a piece of WME and what,</v>

170
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>you know what they're doing now,</v>

171
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.283
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

172
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>

173
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

174
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

175
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.051
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

176
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:23.531
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

177
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>And he's the first fighter ever that can talk like this.</v>

178
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:31.681
<v Speaker 1>How old is he was kind of 26 maybe 27 26</v>

179
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>gotta think 28 I think he's a smart guy too.</v>

180
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.471
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

181
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would hope at least I don't see him fight and deep into his thirties</v>

182
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.761
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

183
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>especially the way he talked because he goes,</v>

184
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>now that I have a kid,</v>

185
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I know what I bring to the table.</v>

186
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I won't be set financially for the rest of my life.</v>

187
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>You guys want me to fight again?</v>

188
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.571
<v Speaker 1>You know I'm leaving.</v>

189
00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>You need to be set for the rest of my life.</v>

190
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

191
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I want to part of this pie and he's,</v>

192
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>he's his next fight and it's going to be such a fight is with WME.</v>

193
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not with anyone out there.</v>

194
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 1>If you think he's fighting for and it could be next.</v>

195
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>You're batshit crazy.</v>

196
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>That's not happening for a very long time.</v>

197
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.291
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

198
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:06.124
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they work it out.</v>

199
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

200
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I think the next slide,</v>

201
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.171
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

202
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:08.651
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

203
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>This is just me going off whatever the hell I think Joe,</v>

204
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>but I think his next fight would be Nate for the belt at 55 because if you think</v>

205
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

206
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.511
<v Speaker 1>it could be even Tony,</v>

207
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>they're both deserving and we're MMA.</v>

208
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Pierce were balls deep in MMA.</v>

209
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>We love it and one of those guys deserves it.</v>

210
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>As far as numbers and and in a big paper view,</v>

211
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be native to really think they would do Nate again,</v>

212
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.280
<v Speaker 1>100% wow.</v>

213
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Nader economy will fight unless it's an if it's,</v>

214
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

215
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 1>if that has to be the matchup,</v>

216
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I think Connor will fight someone else.</v>

217
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I think Connor might even fight Woodley you.</v>

218
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd see a fight with Woodley before you see could be by Ferguson I</v>

219
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:44.930
<v Speaker 1>think could be in first and will fight each other before anything else.</v>

220
00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how fucking crazy it would be if he decided to go up and fight</v>

221
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:48.724
<v Speaker 1>Woodley?</v>

222
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>It's so nice.</v>

223
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Willie has get through Wonderboy again,</v>

224
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't,</v>

225
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 1>it has to.</v>

226
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

227
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.283
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll,</v>

228
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Dana said that's an immediate rematch.</v>

229
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit.</v>

230
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>He says God is fighting for the title.</v>

231
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's good point.</v>

232
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.691
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

233
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

234
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>we sure you're fighting for a title.</v>

235
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.053
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

236
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

237
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>he does that all the time.</v>

238
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that means anything.</v>

239
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.201
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

240
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

241
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going based off what your boys said.</v>

242
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.271
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

243
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the next rematch,</v>

244
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>but put it on me</v>

245
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>more your friend than mine.</v>

246
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Your you've worked on forever.</v>

247
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I liked it and I just think you know you have a closer relationship,</v>

250
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you're a boy,</v>

251
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>but he does say things and pulls back.</v>

252
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 1>If if Woodley and that's there.</v>

254
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>This other thing you got to worry about though,</v>

255
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.281
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

256
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about something to think about.</v>

257
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>How much power or are they going to give Connor 45 55 70 just wraps up all the</v>

258
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

259
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how crazy that would be if he did it though?</v>

260
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I say let them do it.</v>

261
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.301
<v Speaker 1>Let them try it.</v>

262
00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:42.591
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>

263
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:42.841
<v Speaker 1>he's going,</v>

264
00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:43.311
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>

265
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take this pitch Woodley.</v>

266
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.291
<v Speaker 1>We'll say,</v>

267
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>let him try.</v>

268
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.611
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

269
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:47.301
<v Speaker 1>Woodlea say,</v>

270
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>let him try whether we'd love that dude.</v>

271
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:49.731
<v Speaker 1>How crazy.</v>

272
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>That mass square garden and after the fight the lights on the state in which</v>

273
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>they've never done before in the arena.</v>

274
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>We're Irish colors.</v>

275
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty intense.</v>

276
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

277
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>and Brian and I were arguing this,</v>

278
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>do you think Conor McGregor is more well known than Floyd Mayweather?</v>

279
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Currently?</v>

280
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.923
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

281
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Because boxing's a bigger sport.</v>

282
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Cause you look at,</v>

284
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>did you look at Floyd Manny like the paper,</v>

285
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>your numbers destroys anything cottage or been close to.</v>

286
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.843
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

287
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.953
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>

288
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.291
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

289
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.124
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

290
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I was arguing Connor is bigger.</v>

291
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 1>He loves social media,</v>

292
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

293
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>But Floyd has more followers and on Instagram,</v>

294
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:28.921
<v Speaker 1>Twitter.</v>

295
00:07:28.921 --> 00:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>But you can't judge it off that.</v>

296
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.531
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

297
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>the amount of excitement that Floyd generates does not even fucking compare to</v>

298
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>the amount of excitement that Connor generates.</v>

299
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean he's more popular.</v>

300
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Understand,</v>

301
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>but it does kind of,</v>

302
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 1>because the intensity of the popularity,</v>

303
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the love people might know who Floyd Mayweather is,</v>

304
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to how many people love Floyd Mayweather,</v>

305
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not even close.</v>

306
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>He might be like some ridiculous 10 to one or 20 to one because when Connor gets</v>

307
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:52.581
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

308
00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>they go fucking crazy.</v>

309
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:54.741
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

310
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>How many people were there to see Floyd Mayweather lose?</v>

311
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 1>How many people were bored after Floyd Mayweather fights like Floyd Mayweather</v>

312
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>fights so skillfully and surgically that and doesn't take any chances for hardly</v>

313
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>ever gets hit.</v>

314
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not Connor Merck's motherfuckers.</v>

315
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>He wins the world title and the fastest ever title winning knockout ever.</v>

316
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>What did you do after that?</v>

317
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>He comes back and makes Eddie Alvarez look.</v>

318
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez world champion,</v>

319
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>the guy was,</v>

320
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>he's defending hall of Fame Hall of Famer and Connor makes him look like he has</v>

321
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>no business in there with them.</v>

322
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>No business has zero success at all except for a couple of body shots.</v>

323
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 1>This is why I think Connor's bigger and more trend descent because you just</v>

324
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 1>bailed on that word.</v>

325
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

326
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.791
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

327
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Marin's send a transcendent p because I just bailed.</v>

328
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

329
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking out like that.</v>

330
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll just like,</v>

331
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:38.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

332
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:38.871
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

333
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm using it wrong.</v>

334
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

335
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>out and operation.</v>

336
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:44.444
<v Speaker 1>He Jacks.</v>

337
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

338
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.860
<v Speaker 1>but how many successful black athletes do we know of Joe Galen?</v>

339
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>How many white Irish superstars do we know?</v>

340
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>One?</v>

341
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:08:56.131 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>One one weekend was a big star before he came to the United States and he came</v>

343
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>to the United States and eventually lost his belt.</v>

344
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>But Barry Mcwiggin at one point in time was a huge star,</v>

345
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.510
<v Speaker 1>but nowhere near [inaudible] the connoisseur worldwide in,</v>

346
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.380
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

347
00:09:11.381 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>it goes for all athletes.</v>

348
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Connors,</v>

349
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>the green elephant in the room,</v>

350
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 1>everyone else we've seen before,</v>

351
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>every once we know what they can kind of do.</v>

352
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Connors,</v>

353
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>this green elephant amongst all these gray elephants and there's nothing like</v>

354
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

355
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Totally different.</v>

356
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Totally different animal.</v>

357
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.231
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

358
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.870
<v Speaker 1>He's elephant with two fucking trunks.</v>

359
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.241
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

360
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>15 decks,</v>

361
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.020
<v Speaker 1>15 days to China,</v>

362
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 1>gold with a Leprechaun outfit,</v>

363
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:32.424
<v Speaker 1>our act.</v>

364
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>And now he has a little son on the way and they gave him a fucking Rolls Royce</v>

365
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:36.864
<v Speaker 1>with his face on it.</v>

366
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

367
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is how well he manages it all.</v>

368
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

369
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:42.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

370
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

371
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>the pressure in particular,</v>

372
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:45.940
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't seem to have a problem with it at all.</v>

373
00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

374
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes him so special because that magnitude and the pressure and he</v>

375
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 1>has to deliver and he has to do those antics and then back it up,</v>

376
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.460
<v Speaker 1>but he keeps pulling it off like you at the press comes like,</v>

377
00:09:57.461 --> 00:09:57.721
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

378
00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 1>this is stupid man.</v>

379
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>This is getting old to me.</v>

380
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.051
<v Speaker 1>But then we pull it off.</v>

381
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:01.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

382
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>that was brilliant and you know,</v>

383
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy steps in,</v>

384
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:05.300
<v Speaker 1>he loses to ds,</v>

385
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:05.521
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

386
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Takes the Diaz fight on short notice.</v>

387
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:07.621
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

388
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>after a staph infection,</v>

389
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.620
<v Speaker 1>here's something that a lot of people don't even know.</v>

390
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 1>He had a pretty significant staph infection was on antibiotics until like I</v>

391
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>think two weeks before the fight.</v>

392
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think that drains your gas tank,</v>

393
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you never had a staph infection and he never had to take antibiotics.</v>

394
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Antibiotics are brutal on your,</v>

395
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>on your respiratory system.</v>

396
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>They're brutal on your whole body.</v>

397
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:25.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just your body.</v>

398
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>When your body is made up of all this shit that you don't consider it to be you,</v>

399
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.141
<v Speaker 1>but it is you.</v>

400
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:33.830
<v Speaker 1>The stomach flora is a real part of you.</v>

401
00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:34.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

402
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 1>your body is essentially like an ecosystem and when you have a staph infection,</v>

403
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 1>staph infections are dangerous.</v>

404
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:40.344
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck.</v>

405
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.860
<v Speaker 1>And people die from them then.</v>

406
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 1>So they hit you with some heavy duty antibiotics.</v>

407
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I've had staff twice and it's not fun.</v>

408
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And the first time I had it and I took the medication,</v>

409
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how I felt so weird.</v>

410
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I felt light headed.</v>

411
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.171
<v Speaker 1>I felt weak.</v>

412
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:55.501
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

413
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:55.921
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

414
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I can drained.</v>

415
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

416
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 1>You have no energy.</v>

417
00:10:58.081 --> 00:10:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Super strong stuff too.</v>

418
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.451
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

419
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:00.691
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

420
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 1>imagine this guy fighting two weeks after that saying,</v>

421
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>because there's no way you Pete correctly.</v>

422
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

423
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 1>So it comes from that.</v>

424
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.580
<v Speaker 1>And then he fights Nate again,</v>

425
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 1>few months later in a fucking crazy five round war and beats him by the</v>

427
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>narrowest of margins.</v>

428
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

429
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't you agree?</v>

430
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

431
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are the very,</v>

432
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>very close fight were some people thought that Nate one,</v>

433
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

434
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I thought there the decision was correct,</v>

435
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:26.821
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

436
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:27.061
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

437
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that's close fight.</v>

438
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>So takes that fucking crazy chance.</v>

439
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Comes back at fights.</v>

440
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>

441
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>He kind of weighed one 69 that's what he weighed when he weighed in.</v>

442
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what he weighed during the fight,</v>

443
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and they want him to fight at 55 he goes,</v>

444
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:37.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

445
00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:37.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

446
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:37.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

447
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:37.651
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

448
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I can beat him at 70 let me do 70 Nate wade probably around one 90 something.</v>

449
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

450
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean did I mean,</v>

451
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>everybody says that Nate is 155 pounder.</v>

452
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>He is 100% but he's a way bigger man.</v>

453
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 1>They been then congress,</v>

454
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.660
<v Speaker 1>he just is,</v>

455
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:51.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

457
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 1>who's going to weigh more when they actually get in there and Nate's gonna weigh</v>

458
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

459
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So he does that and then goes from there and just see starches.</v>

460
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez like a world beater and just so relaxed and loosened.</v>

461
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 1>They're so amazing.</v>

462
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Madonna was at the show.</v>

463
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Madonna was Madonna.</v>

464
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Madonna was at the fights.</v>

465
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

466
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Madonna's instagramming Mama.</v>

467
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>We made it Mama.</v>

468
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>We made this red penny night.</v>

469
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 1>It's red panty night and Madonna,</v>

470
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Europe thinks she's single with a focus.</v>

471
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 1>My second belt,</v>

472
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I envisioned this where the focus me,</v>

473
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 1>belt nuts,</v>

474
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:28.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

475
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

476
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking actor,</v>

477
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

478
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>He's such a character.</v>

479
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

480
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was gonna make a big announcement.</v>

481
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I thought it's announcement was he's going to retire,</v>

482
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.470
<v Speaker 1>but his nephew was like a life I'm going to continue doing.</v>

483
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.313
<v Speaker 1>So you guys need to,</v>

484
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I need a share of the company.</v>

485
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

486
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what the announcement was going to be all along.</v>

487
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 1>You know that he wants a piece of the Pie.</v>

488
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got an argument that he probably should get a percentage of the</v>

489
00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>promotion because the,</v>

490
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 1>what they're selling is Conor McGregor or selling the UFC plus Conor McGregor.</v>

491
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 1>The question is how much of that card,</v>

492
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

493
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 1>What would the paper,</v>

494
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what the numbers are.</v>

495
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 1>So let's pretend the number is 2 million,</v>

496
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>which would be like the greatest card of all time.</v>

497
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:08.321
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

498
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It probably wouldn't hit that.</v>

499
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

500
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's in one seven.</v>

501
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say 2 million.</v>

502
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's easy to correct.</v>

503
00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:14.171
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

504
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.004
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that,</v>

505
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.650
<v Speaker 1>what percentage bought it because it Connor,</v>

506
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 1>it might be a million.</v>

507
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:21.000
<v Speaker 1>1 million plus for sure might be 1 million,</v>

508
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.060
<v Speaker 1>1 million plus for sure.</v>

509
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.890
<v Speaker 1>1 million people might have bought the paper view specifically because of one</v>

510
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:27.724
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>

511
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>That is not outrageous to say [inaudible] but this is the other thing in</v>

512
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Connor's favorite name,</v>

513
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>another star who can do that.</v>
