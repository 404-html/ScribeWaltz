62
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.390

71
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a novelty one.</v>

72
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like a car that you don't drive because it's a special edition</v>

73
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>corvette or some shit.</v>

96
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.000

<v Speaker 1>I want you to try find what the ingredients are and Alpha brain,</v>

100
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>look it up online and on a.com it's available.</v>

101
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Take the exact ingredients of some bulk stuff that you can buy for much cheaper</v>

102
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>than what we did when we put all this together in like sort of a one-stops</v>

103
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>shopping sort of a situation.</v>

104
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Go buy that stuff,</v>

105

<v Speaker 1>please buy it and just try it.</v>

107
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And I know people have positive results.</v>

108
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people with it.</v>

109
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't.</v>

110
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

111
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know whether that's a subjective thing,</v>

112
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not they,</v>

113
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

114
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>they can't differentiate between a good and a bad day,</v>

115
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>whether it just doesn't work on them.</v>

116
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Where everybody's biologically different.</v>

117
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people can't eat peanuts.</v>

118
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>One peanut no fucking die.</v>

119
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's system is different.</v>

120
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.643
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

121
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the shit works.</v>

122
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lying to you.</v>

123
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Please stop saying I am.</v>

124
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Stop sending me mean tweets.</v>

125
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>It's annoying.</v>

126
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to buy it.</v>

127
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not forcing you to.</v>

128
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But to tell me that I'm not experiencing positive results from it.</v>

129
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And then all these other people that are taking it in and talking to me about</v>

130
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>all the great results.</v>

131
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Just to say that we're not selling,</v>

132
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

133
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth is just insulting and it's stupid and it doesn't make sense.</v>

134
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>You fuckhead you don't know what I'm feeling.</v>

135
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

136
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not the placebo effect because you could have fucking incredible vivid</v>

137
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>dreams and their vivid dreams to me.</v>

138
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember ever having dreams like this for,</v>

139
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I started taking this shit.</v>

140
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it's more vivid.</v>

141
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I think you just,</v>

142
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>it like,</v>

143
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember it more like you usually wake up and you forget it.</v>

144
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Now I can remember true.</v>

145
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

146
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>How would I know if I don't remember him?</v>

148
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not there were vivid.</v>

149
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

150
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>but that to me is like stats,</v>

151
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>some fucking tangible proof,</v>

152
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

153
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And even if it is a placebo,</v>

154
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is.</v>

155
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>But even if it was,</v>

156
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I liked placebos given give me to me,</v>

157
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.231
<v Speaker 1>giving me a trick me,</v>

158
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>trick me with your pet rock trick me.</v>

159
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this for results.</v>

160
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>If you can give me some shit that cures cancer for some fucking crazy reason.</v>

161
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile I was just a sugar pill.</v>

162
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.483
<v Speaker 1>Give it to me,</v>

163
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>give it to me.</v>

164
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>They should sell pills and placebo in it and just call it placebo.</v>

165
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that we have a handle on how the human brain works.</v>

166
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.661
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

167
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk to David Lipton about this.</v>

168
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.860

173
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>The fucking Joe Rogan experience is ready to drop on going old school.</v>

174
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just me and Brian today.</v>

181
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what it seems like.</v>

182
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 3>We were just talking about the apple TV the other day in New York Times today.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's so beloved.</v>

230
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

231
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>how is there ever been a more beloved CEO?</v>

232
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>that guy was a God damn rock star.</v>

234
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs would get out on that stage and those geeks would freak the fuck out.</v>

235
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>There was like,</v>

236
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>he's here,</v>

237
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>he's leading us.</v>

238
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like he was leading a movement.</v>

239
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just like he's a CEO of a technology company.</v>

240
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>He was a part of this apple movement.</v>

241
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And also fueled by that sort of underdog thing that everybody loves.</v>

242
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>People love being an underdog man.</v>

243
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>They love being in the fucking unknown band,</v>

244
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.061
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

245
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Or knowing about the unknown band and going to see them before they broke before</v>

246
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>they go mainstream.</v>

247
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>People love like small things against the fucking oppressive Microsoft regime.</v>

248
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you windows.</v>

252
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.870

253
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>And there's some Unix dorks that do that right now and Linux dorks and you know,</v>

254
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>so I think it was part of that,</v>

255
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that he would all of a sudden made this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he had a vision and no one else is understanding what he's thinking,</v>

291
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>but he has to make sure it goes through to like what he's thinking in his head</v>

292
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>on paper to a product.</v>

293
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 1>And there's people probably putting their 2 cents and like,</v>

294
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:01.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

295
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't do that.</v>

296
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>And it probably was like he was a controlling aspect,</v>

297
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:05.894
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

298
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Those all those people right now,</v>

299
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>they all fucking get it.</v>

300
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.263
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

301
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>like the iPhone probably was weird when he first was trying to talk about it.</v>

302
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

303
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

304
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:14.631
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

305
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>look at all the different people working in all the various companies and just</v>

306
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.081
<v Speaker 1>think about this.</v>

307
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>How much of yourself are you really,</v>

308
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>truly willing to give further your company's success?</v>

309
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 1>How much of yourself do you and how much,</v>

310
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>how intelligent are you truly?</v>

311
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>How well read are you?</v>

312
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>How introspective or you,</v>

313
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>how objective are you?</v>

314
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Are you really honest about your own ideas?</v>

315
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Are you immersed in your ego?</v>

316
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have a handle on all of those things,</v>

317
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like have answers to all of those questions.</v>

318
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>A guy like Steve jobs comes along and he can do some shit that you can't do.</v>

319
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

320
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Because that guy will,</v>

321
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>he will work til he drops.</v>

322
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>He's super fucking smart.</v>

323
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>He's done LSD.</v>

324
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>He said it was like most important things of his life,</v>

325
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.591
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

326
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had some,</v>

327
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>he had some flaws for sure,</v>

329
00:08:58.531 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>but he was also this,</v>

330
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it's really like a cliche,</v>

332
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:03.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>the star that shines twice as bright,</v>

334
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>lasts half as long.</v>

335
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>But it really almost is.</v>

336
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

337
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that he caused his own disease.</v>

338
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:10.681
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

339
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 1>But I can't think that it helps to work like a fucking demon to wear like a man</v>

340
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:20.091
<v Speaker 1>possessed to live the company he worked on the day he died in the hospital room,</v>

341
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>he was finishing off a certain product,</v>

342
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 1>which some are saying the iPhone five some are saying to it,</v>

343
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>the Apple TV and that he did on the day he died.</v>

344
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

345
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess he just figured,</v>

346
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:32.851
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

347
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll just ride this bitch right into the beach.</v>

348
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

349
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

350
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

351
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 1>But what an impact.</v>

352
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 1>You need to think about like the impact that that guy had on all the different,</v>

353
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>different human beings who enjoyed his products,</v>

354
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:44.701
<v Speaker 1>us included.</v>

355
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:44.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

356
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>we're both Mac Dorks,</v>

357
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:46.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I've considered pcs.</v>

359
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I fuck around with them a little bit.</v>

360
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.341
<v Speaker 1>They're beautiful too.</v>

361
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>They have great operating system.</v>

362
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 1>It's way better than the old operating systems,</v>

363
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>but God damn it.</v>

364
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 1>If I don't know a million people with viruses,</v>

365
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.661
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

366
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:57.781
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

367
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everybody I talked to,</v>

368
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>he's got some new thing where they went to a porn site and now every time they</v>

369
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 1>turn in their fucking computer,</v>

370
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 1>they see dicks.</v>

371
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

372
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

373
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

374
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 1>that happens all the time.</v>

375
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Get a bigger dick,</v>

376
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 1>got a bigger Dick and get a bigger dick.</v>

377
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.881
<v Speaker 1>Like God damn it.</v>

378
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>You fuck like Dylan infect you with a big Dick Commercial?</v>

379
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

380
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like your message board.</v>

381
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Anytime somebody gets pink or anything.</v>

382
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And I like putting the pink room.</v>

383
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 1>If they're really bad,</v>

384
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>used to change talktalk's cars,</v>

385
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.450
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst disease Dick we could find on.</v>

386
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I actually asked people to stop doing that because it got obsessive.</v>

387
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call anybody out or what.</v>

388
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.131
<v Speaker 1>The one guy did it,</v>

389
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>he admitted it was like,</v>

390
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:33.430
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>

391
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

392
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:34.200
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

393
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna fucking cocktails.</v>

394
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you given out?</v>

395
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>He'd give it out like hundreds of them and it's so homophobic.</v>

396
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.411
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

397
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

398
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.150
<v Speaker 1>just to start gesture story,</v>

399
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're going to post anymore,</v>

400
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 1>but he was one that I gave a cocktail or two and he was really a funny photo</v>

401
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>because the Dick was so small and what I never told anybody is that every day I</v>

402
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>made a little bit smaller,</v>

403
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.160
<v Speaker 1>a little bit smaller,</v>

404
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>a little bit smarter.</v>

405
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I told there was no dick and no one ever,</v>

406
00:10:58.951 --> 00:10:59.784
<v Speaker 1>never noticed.</v>

407
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It takes the most ridiculous dedication.</v>

408
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do that?</v>

409
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because the days of this,</v>

410
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like probably seven days,</v>

411
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

412
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.193
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

413
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.780
<v Speaker 1>he was so upset because I think it was one of the first cocktail hours.</v>

414
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>He was so upset that,</v>

415
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 1>that he got such a horrible Dick.</v>

416
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

417
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.061
<v Speaker 1>it's so small.</v>

418
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:21.920
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck dude?</v>

419
00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And that is rude to make people post with an Avatar,</v>

420
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 1>someone's deck.</v>

421
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>But some of those guys are dicks.</v>

422
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

423
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

424
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no better way to discourage douchey behavior than to punish</v>

425
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:32.750
<v Speaker 1>people for it.</v>

426
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like it's a real punishment.</v>

427
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>So fucking message board.</v>

428
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be there.</v>

429
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

430
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be there and I'll stop you there.</v>

431
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.641
<v Speaker 1>But for some people,</v>

432
00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:38.911
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

433
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:41.370
<v Speaker 1>you put him in that pink room and they go fucking ballistic on you.</v>

434
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.660
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

435
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to watch.</v>

436
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

437
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:44.881
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

438
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:49.881
<v Speaker 1>the special ed room is really a fascinating experiment because it's like the</v>

439
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Stanford prison studies that they did,</v>

440
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:56.960
<v Speaker 1>when they like students like pretend to be prison guards and then other</v>

442
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

443
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 1>they had to cut though short because people get crazy.</v>

444
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

445
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

446
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 1>they got,</v>

447
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 1>they got nutty and they started behaving as if it was like a real prison.</v>

448
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 1>They've got like really creepy.</v>

449
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.450
<v Speaker 1>They had to like cut the experiments.</v>

450
00:12:06.451 --> 00:12:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

451
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.400
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't very many days and it was like seven days or something like that.</v>

452
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to re reread it over and over again to really get a handle on it.</v>

453
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you would tell them that can only post in one form,</v>

454
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>now all of a sudden it's like prison.</v>

455
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

456
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fucking trapped in here.</v>

457
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.473
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

458
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 1>you're on the Internet.</v>

459
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.501
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>

460
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 1>everyone on the board can read it,</v>

461
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 1>they can read it.</v>

462
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just like what's been with what we decided is we're going to have to forums</v>

463
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.280
<v Speaker 1>and one form is essentially uncensored except for I don't all out autoplays or</v>

464
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.740
<v Speaker 1>you can't have autoplays,</v>

465
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you can't trick people.</v>

466
00:12:37.921 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I can't Rick Roll people,</v>

467
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:39.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 1>nothing stupid like that,</v>

469
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:41.974
<v Speaker 1>then we'll just ban you.</v>

470
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

471
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much do whatever the fuck you want unless you're,</v>

472
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:45.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

473
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 1>if someone tunes in though and finds out that you're a super content there and</v>

474
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:49.391
<v Speaker 1>then you're like,</v>

475
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 1>what does this guy even to here for,</v>

476
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:51.351
<v Speaker 1>what's the point?</v>

477
00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And then there'll be,</v>

478
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.803
<v Speaker 1>we'll just ban you.</v>

479
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>But I find myself hanging out more in a special ed room than the regular form.</v>

480
00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I go only to the podcast foreign.</v>

481
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 1>And then once in a while,</v>

482
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 1>good at Special Ed.</v>

483
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't even go to the regular form.</v>

484
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I probably gone twice in the last year.</v>

485
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

486
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I just started going into the Special Ed Forum recently and checking,</v>

487
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>cause some guys actually will post some cool shit.</v>

488
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 1>They're just assholes.</v>

489
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

490
00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>they'll post some cool shit,</v>

491
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>but then they'll get online and call somebody a nigger or call somebody a faggot</v>

492
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:17.081
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

493
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

494
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.191
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

495
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:19.024
<v Speaker 1>Come on man,</v>

496
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

497
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 1>There's not a need for this.</v>

498
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>

499
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.210
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

500
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>especially when a lot of times it's like no,</v>

502
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>no point to escalating.</v>

503
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Like people would just escalate for no reason.</v>

504
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:30.921
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

505
00:13:30.921 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder how he's,</v>

506
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 1>if it's like the name shit talking one on one because then we change it for a</v>

507
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>little while.</v>

508
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 1>We change it.</v>

509
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.001
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

510
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I changed it for a short period of time,</v>

511
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember what I called it.</v>

512
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.990
<v Speaker 1>What theme are you on?</v>

513
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Are you on the blue or the black?</v>

514
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.083
<v Speaker 1>I like the blue.</v>

515
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

516
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the black.</v>

517
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I went back to the black and I think in the black it used to be on a sign.</v>

518
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that shit talking one on one and then that's it.</v>

519
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.030
<v Speaker 1>That was the art drawing.</v>

520
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like an old drive through movie movie theater or something.</v>

521
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember for what people don't know what the fuck we're talking about.</v>

522
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>There's you,</v>

523
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.030
<v Speaker 1>when you click on the,</v>

524
00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 1>there's like a wink at the pot of money somewhere in the message board that</v>

525
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 1>allows you to choose from different styles of message board.</v>

526
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 1>It's either black with white font or blue with black font.</v>

527
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

528
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Like a really light blue that a lot of people think is gay.</v>

529
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>But I like it.</v>

530
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>No I'm usually on that.</v>

531
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.150
<v Speaker 1>But I switched back to black.</v>

532
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I like it because it's reminds me of sunny skies,</v>

533
00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:17.021
<v Speaker 1>blue skies,</v>

534
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:17.801
<v Speaker 1>I like blue skies,</v>

535
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:18.634
<v Speaker 1>they make me happy.</v>

536
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So I look at that and I like the way it is.</v>

537
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a direct correlation between like looking at like certain dark</v>

538
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 1>dark colors and having dark thoughts.</v>

539
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

540
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a correlation between those two.</v>

541
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

542
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe the message board would be less country if people just use the</v>

543
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 1>blue.</v>

544
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.331
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever,</v>

545
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>have you ever owned a house or an apartment that just had like really bright</v>

546
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 1>yellow walls?</v>

547
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I like like bright light,</v>

548
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>like kitchen,</v>

549
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 1>like bright yellow maybe.</v>

550
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 1>It's so nice.</v>

551
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 1>You always feel happy and clean when you're in it.</v>

552
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

553
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

554
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Try it out.</v>

555
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Try it.</v>

556
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Find a room and just paint it bright yellow.</v>

557
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:51.501
<v Speaker 1>You'll be surprised.</v>

558
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

559
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that all about?</v>

560
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just exactly what you're saying.</v>

561
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:56.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those colors.</v>

562
00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:56.811
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel good.</v>

563
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

564
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.180
<v Speaker 1>The Sun obviously.</v>

565
00:14:58.181 --> 00:14:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

567
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.530
<v Speaker 1>And Blue Sky yellow the sun.</v>

568
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

569
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 1>that totally makes sense.</v>

570
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:02.091
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

571
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean when you talk about people that live in places like Seattle</v>

572
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>where it rains constantly.</v>

573
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:06.830
<v Speaker 1>What's the number one complaint?</v>

574
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:07.521
<v Speaker 1>They don't get sun.</v>

575
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 1>They get depressed and that's why so many of them commit suicide.</v>

576
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

577
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big issue,</v>

578
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:12.741
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

579
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It's really a vitamin D deficiency as well.</v>

580
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.363
<v Speaker 1>Apparently your brain,</v>

581
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.670
<v Speaker 1>your body makes vitamin D while you're in the sun,</v>

582
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:20.481
<v Speaker 1>like while you're in the sun,</v>

583
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:21.830
<v Speaker 1>your body is producing a vitamin.</v>

584
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.664
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting,</v>

585
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.391
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

586
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:23.881
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

587
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that only happens in your body like that.</v>

588
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 1>You know you could eat it and you can supplement it in pill form,</v>

589
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but you only get it make your body only makes it if you're in the sunlight that</v>

590
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.380
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

591
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 1>really kind of fucking interesting.</v>

592
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>You need it,</v>

593
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like important to health.</v>

595
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Before I moved to California,</v>

596
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Speaker 1>I lived in his house and every room was a different color.</v>

597
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Like my office was dark,</v>

598
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Crimson Red and my kitchen one is bright yellow,</v>

599
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 1>exact etc. But it's weird.</v>

600
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Each room did have like a certain feel to it when you were in it.</v>

601
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the bedroom was black Wallace,</v>

602
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was the worst idea ever and that was just horrible.</v>

603
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:54.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

604
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible looking at the comedy store and sleeping.</v>

605
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 1>That's someone who wants to fuck in the dark if you want to fucking dark walls.</v>

606
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Just darkness.</v>

607
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.550
<v Speaker 1>That's some golf sharing.</v>

609
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Some people want to fuck with the lights out,</v>

610
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.063
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

611
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.993
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

612
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

613
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever be able to check and she said turn the lights out?</v>

614
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:14.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

615
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I kind of like it.</v>

616
00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

617
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it bright though.</v>

618
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:17.741
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

619
00:16:17.741 --> 00:16:17.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

620
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.420
<v Speaker 1>like it was just like super bright gynecological.</v>

621
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like it.</v>

622
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I like a like a showroom,</v>

623
00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 1>like a car showroom.</v>

624
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.403
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

625
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:25.971
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

626
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I think if I manscaped war I wouldn't mind it,</v>

627
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like it's going to kill the deal.</v>

628
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It probably will.</v>

629
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.873
<v Speaker 1>Probably will.</v>

630
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the photo of Steven Tyler?</v>

631
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

632
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.540
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

633
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 1>we talked about like how I almost slipped and killed myself in the bathtub.</v>

634
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:45.260
<v Speaker 1>He did it at a hotel room and he slipped and fell and he said that,</v>

635
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:45.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

636
00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:46.284

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:46.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:49.650
<v Speaker 1>he slipped nothing to it and he,</v>

640
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.391
<v Speaker 1>the photo of him,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he like knocked teeth out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got a black eye.</v>

643
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can see this right here,</v>

644
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but it fucked him up,</v>

645
00:16:57.561 --> 00:16:58.230
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

646
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.590
<v Speaker 1>That's just from taking a bath and accidentally slipping.</v>

647
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.403
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done it though?</v>

657
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 1>It'd be just like slimy feed or almost fallen backwards,</v>

658
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:19.790
<v Speaker 1>which is the most terrifying thing,</v>

659
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:20.811
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

660

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

661

662
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>that's how people die.</v>

663
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're sloppy,</v>

664
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:25.641
<v Speaker 1>you're tired,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.240
<v Speaker 1>you're not really 100% paying attention,</v>

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can get slippery.</v>

673
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Bathtubs are fucking dangerous as shit.</v>

674
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

675
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

676
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 1>especially the old ones,</v>

677
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 1>those cast iron ones.</v>

678
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:39.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

679
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 1>if you have an old place and you have a old tub,</v>

680
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 1>those old tubs were fucking iron dude.</v>

681
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.410

<v Speaker 1>it's like fallen.</v>

683
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Think about falling backwards and hitting iron.</v>

684
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially</v>

685
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 4>like getting hit in the head by the world.</v>

686
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:54.961
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:55.591
<v Speaker 4>that's what it's like.</v>

688
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 4>The world came down on you and hit you and that's what it's like.</v>

689
00:17:59.220 --> 00:17:59.551
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

693
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:06.690
<v Speaker 4>If you ever watched those fights where people get in street fights,</v>

694
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 4>a lot of videos on youtube and guys get knocked out.</v>

695
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 4>And what's terrifying is when they get knocked out,</v>

696
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 4>they fall back in their head,</v>

697
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:14.790

702
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 4>It is terrifying.</v>

703
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like a bowling ball dropping on the guards.</v>

704
00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Terrified.</v>

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

724
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.081
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

725
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:02.820
<v Speaker 4>They throw the grenade at them.</v>

726
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.471
<v Speaker 4>Flash bomb.</v>

727
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Athema tear gas bomb after,</v>

728
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

729
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.340
<v Speaker 4>they blow up and they,</v>

730
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

731
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 4>if they hit you in the fucking head while they're exploding,</v>

732
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 4>like you can get jacked.</v>

733
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 4>But it's just so sad to see these cops are targeting these people.</v>

734
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

735
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.671
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

736
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 4>what is this fucking Chicago in the 60s what the fuck is this?</v>

737
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.500
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

738
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe that these are our citizens,</v>

739
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 4>that these cops are our friends and our neighbors and our citizens.</v>

740
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 4>These occupy people aren't hurting anybody.</v>

741
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

742
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 4>Your job is to serve and protect and you don't need to protect anybody from</v>

743
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:36.894
<v Speaker 4>these people.</v>

744
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.400
<v Speaker 4>These people are nonviolent.</v>

745
00:19:38.401 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 4>They're not hurting anybody to serve and protect.</v>

746
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 4>What part of that is throw a fucking grenade at someone's head.</v>

747
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 4>Especially some guy who did two tours,</v>

748
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 4>a fucking duty,</v>

749
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.050
<v Speaker 4>two tours of duty overseas.</v>

750
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 4>He comes back and he's in critical condition from the fellow citizen of fellow</v>

751
00:19:53.311 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 4>American throwing a fucking Flashman had out a guy who's paid by this</v>

752
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker's tax dollars.</v>

753
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 4>That's a sad,</v>

754
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:01.440
<v Speaker 4>sad statement,</v>

755
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

756
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 4>It's sad that people are jumping up and down about this and the politicians</v>

757
00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 4>aren't fucking condemning this and that people aren't all over the news saying,</v>

758
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 4>this can never happen again and we need to fucking sit down with these cops and</v>

759
00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 4>have a long conversation as to what your fucking job entails.</v>

760
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.290
<v Speaker 4>Your job entails helping people out,</v>

761
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:19.770
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

762
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.850
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're here for.</v>

763
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.121
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

764
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:25.920
<v Speaker 4>our citizens that have extra power and we give you that extra power so that you</v>

765
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:27.120
<v Speaker 4>make things nicer.</v>

766
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 4>You're not making things nicer by throwing flash grenades on fucking veterans.</v>

767
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.420
<v Speaker 4>That's not making anything nicer.</v>

768
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.310
<v Speaker 4>And that's the only reason to have cops.</v>

769
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.430
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I have comps is to keep the Douche bags down,</v>

770
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.910
<v Speaker 4>to keep them away from the nice people and then help the nice people in the nice</v>

771
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:42.744
<v Speaker 4>people in trouble.</v>

772
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

773
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 4>And when the nice people get angry because the bags are fucking robbing them,</v>

774
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 4>you don't throw grenades at them.</v>

775
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.570
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking cunts.</v>

776
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it happened in California also.</v>

777
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.261
<v Speaker 1>There's no joke,</v>

778
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:53.530
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

779
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

780
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but like New York City it perfect example,</v>

781
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 1>the the governor or whatever said,</v>

782
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:57.161
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

783
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:57.401

00:20:57.401 --> 00:21:00.970

785
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 1>And the cops were like,</v>

786
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:02.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

787

788
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:04.000

789
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing this.</v>

793
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:07.511
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>

794
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 1>it's no joke.</v>

795
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 1>You need to go and hang out in Oakland for a little while.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I Tom McCormick lives in Oakland now.</v>

828
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Oakland is the weirdest combination of like gangsters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Gangsters and hippies and like,</v>

833
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and and weed people.</v>

834
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Speaker 1>They call it Oaksterdam.</v>

835
00:21:59.370 --> 00:21:59.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

836
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:01.300
<v Speaker 1>they have like Oaksterdam University,</v>

837
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 1>like we don't even know the level of medical weed that the state has reached.</v>

838
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 1>The reason why all these people are clamoring,</v>

839
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 1>and apparently this was just released,</v>

840
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't Obama's idea to go after these medical marijuana dispensaries,</v>

841
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

842
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It was the attorney general or the whoever the fuck gets to was,</v>

843
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:18.491
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

844
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

845
00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It was somebody in California,</v>

846
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the rare people in the Senate,</v>

847
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 1>or we're talking,</v>

848
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 1>we're talking so nuts.</v>

849
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

850
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know the set it is.</v>

851
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I know what that means.</v>

852
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 1>That's like some of them.</v>

853
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I found it on Twitter,</v>

854
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:30.881
<v Speaker 1>so I'll,</v>

855
00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll retweet it or something like that.</v>

856
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.184
<v Speaker 1>But what it is a,</v>

857
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 1>what essentially they're saying is that Obama is not respected enough by these</v>

858
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:37.841
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

859
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 1>for them to follow his lead.</v>

860
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.460
<v Speaker 1>What he said when he was in office was that he wants to only attack or only go</v>

861
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>after the people that are violating both federal and state law.</v>

862
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana is illegal across the board federally.</v>

863
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 1>So as long as they were following state law,</v>

864
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 1>he would leave them alone.</v>

865
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And the state law,</v>

866
00:22:59.050 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

867
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.191
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>

868
00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty tricky because it's really supposed to be nonprofit.</v>

869
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:04.031
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

870
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:04.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

871
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're supposed to be able to make millions of dollars and a lot</v>

872
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:12.220
<v Speaker 1>of these guys are just fucking balling and I support it 100% but I'm just</v>

873
00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>stating the facts.</v>

874
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:18.030
<v Speaker 1>The real true facts is that we don't even know the level of medical marijuana</v>

875
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:20.440
<v Speaker 1>that's hit like California.</v>

876
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Our area is really like on the outskirts.</v>

877
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.330
<v Speaker 1>The real hive of it is in northern California.</v>

878
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 1>The real hive of it is an Oakland where they're having classes where they're</v>

879
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 1>teaching people how to fucking set grow ops up there.</v>

880
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Like people are signing up for classes and it's like,</v>

881
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

882
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>they'd given degrees on how to fucking grow weed.</v>

883
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating shit.</v>

884
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 1>They're taking it to the next level.</v>

885
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:40.840
<v Speaker 1>They're teaching people how to do it.</v>

886
00:23:40.841 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 1>They have these big,</v>

887
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and so the government obviously feels threatened by this,</v>

888
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.381
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

889
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 1>this along</v>

890
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 4>with this whole occupy Wall Street movement.</v>

891
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:51.140
<v Speaker 4>And Pete when when you get hippies with money,</v>

892
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.070
<v Speaker 4>shit gets dangerous as fuck cause you got to a place like Oaksterdam,</v>

893
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 4>you place like it just,</v>

894
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:58.040
<v Speaker 4>let's say there was a place they're going to open up in boulder,</v>

895
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like 30,000 square feet.</v>

896
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.430
<v Speaker 4>It was three stories.</v>

897
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it ever opened,</v>

898
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 4>but that was like the people,</v>

899
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 4>people who are proven it,</v>

900
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.360
<v Speaker 4>people in boulder like fine bringing in just not going to bother us.</v>

901
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 4>And when they were doing that,</v>

902
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 4>people are thinking how much money can I place like this bring in millions of</v>

903
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:13.551
<v Speaker 4>dollars,</v>

904
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:14.930
<v Speaker 4>millions and millions and millions.</v>

905
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 4>It could be incredible amounts of money if you really stop and think about it.</v>

906
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 4>If they have just radical open commerce on marijuana,</v>

907
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 4>how many people are going to grow their own fucking shit?</v>

908
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Not me.</v>

909
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.311
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

910
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that kind of time.</v>

911
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.631
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

912
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 4>I can't be watering plants.</v>

913
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

914
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.301
<v Speaker 4>I got kids,</v>

915
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.021
<v Speaker 4>I got shit to do.</v>

916
00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:30.854
<v Speaker 4>I've got hobbies.</v>

917
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to water plants.</v>

918
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 4>It might be interesting if I decided to take it on as a hobby.</v>

919
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.771
<v Speaker 4>But if it,</v>

920
00:24:34.771 --> 00:24:37.490
<v Speaker 4>if I could just go down the street and buy weed at the store,</v>

921
00:24:37.491 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 4>if I can go to seven 11 and buy some weed,</v>

922
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.020
<v Speaker 4>cause that's how it should,</v>

923
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:40.853
<v Speaker 4>it could be.</v>

924
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 4>It really could be like that.</v>

925
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.940
<v Speaker 4>And when that happens,</v>

926
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Speaker 4>those places,</v>

927
00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:48.680
<v Speaker 4>those places that like those medical marijuana places or whoever,</v>

928
00:24:48.681 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 4>there's decides to open up like a big flashy emporium of weed,</v>

929
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 4>they can become very wealthy and then they become,</v>

930
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 4>they can become very powerful.</v>

931
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 4>When someone becomes wealthy,</v>

932
00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.630
<v Speaker 4>they become powerful.</v>

933
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 4>And as they're seeing people accumulate wealth,</v>

934
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to stop it and then not trying to stop because they're protecting</v>

935
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:05.450
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

936
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 4>They're not protecting any civilians.</v>

937
00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

938
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.620
<v Speaker 4>by stopping these people from making money.</v>

939
00:25:09.621 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 4>If these people are making money and paying taxes on it,</v>

940
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 4>you should be happy they're contributing to the economy.</v>

941
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:14.811
<v Speaker 4>This is good.</v>

942
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 4>This is not bad.</v>

943
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 4>We need to change the law.</v>

944
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to make it so it's legally,</v>

945
00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 4>it's either legal or it's not illegal.</v>

946
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 4>It's legal to sell it to people.</v>

947
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:22.670
<v Speaker 4>It should be illegal to make money off of it.</v>

948
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 4>You're telling me that marijuana can't make money off of it,</v>

949
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:25.940
<v Speaker 4>even though it's legal as a drug.</v>

950
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.680
<v Speaker 4>But they can make money off of opium.</v>

951
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:28.820
<v Speaker 4>They can make money off of heroin,</v>

952
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:32.630
<v Speaker 4>they can make money off of cocaine and fucking oxycontin's and nicotine and</v>

953
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 4>alcohol.</v>

954
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 4>They can make money off that,</v>

955
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:35.330
<v Speaker 4>but they can't make money off week.</v>

956
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.291
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

957
00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:37.430
<v Speaker 4>This is an injust law.</v>

958
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.230
<v Speaker 4>This is an injust law and it's nonsense.</v>

959
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why is because they're scared of hippies with money,</v>

960
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.270
<v Speaker 4>hippies with money or dangerous as fuck.</v>

961
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:44.481
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

962
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:45.590
<v Speaker 4>If you've got a bunch of people,</v>

963
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.150
<v Speaker 4>idealists who really,</v>

964
00:25:47.151 --> 00:25:52.100
<v Speaker 4>truly want to change the world and all of a sudden their richest fuck dude,</v>

965
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.170
<v Speaker 4>things can get slippery,</v>

966
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.840
<v Speaker 4>things can,</v>

967
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 4>it's slippery when we people join together and say,</v>

968
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:01.970
<v Speaker 4>you've got to recognize the weed dollar.</v>

969
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.540
<v Speaker 4>All right cause there's a stoner dollar out there and it's you and it's me and</v>

971
00:26:09.121 --> 00:26:12.230
<v Speaker 4>our taxes and we contribute to society and we're not bad people.</v>

972
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.000
<v Speaker 4>And at a certain point in time,</v>

973
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to respect that stoner dollar.</v>

974
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.761
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you don't,</v>

975
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:19.550
<v Speaker 4>that Shit's going to come back and bite you in the ass because there's too many</v>

976
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:20.090
<v Speaker 4>of us now.</v>

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.460
<v Speaker 4>There's too many of us and now because of the Internet,</v>

978
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:23.780
<v Speaker 4>just like occupy Wall Street,</v>

979
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:24.740
<v Speaker 4>just like anonymous.</v>

980
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 4>We're United,</v>

981
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 4>we're all United.</v>

982
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Likeminded people are United now.</v>

983
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 4>People who exchange ideas and evolve their own ideas on the internet and share,</v>

984
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.740
<v Speaker 4>share a viewpoint with each other and learn from each other.</v>

985
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 4>We're United now.</v>

986
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.260
<v Speaker 4>This is a different time,</v>

987
00:26:39.261 --> 00:26:39.441
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

988
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:42.950
<v Speaker 4>You can't just control people like you used to be able to control people in the</v>

989
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 4>60s and the 70s we couldn't talk to each other.</v>

990
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 4>We had a huddle in our fucking homes at night listening to the radio,</v>

991
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 4>hoping everything was going to be okay.</v>

992
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Well this isn't that day man.</v>

993
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 4>These cops that are staging these fucking fake shootings at schools so they can</v>

994
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:56.760
<v Speaker 4>check the kids for drugs.</v>

995
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.331
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

996
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 4>you're just horse for some pharmaceutical company from some giant conglomerate</v>

997
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 4>and the only reason you're doing that,</v>

998
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 4>it's because the weed dollar hasn't hit you yet.</v>

999
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Once the weed dollar hits you,</v>

1000
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 4>you're going to shut the fuck up.</v>

1001
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to shut the fuck up because the weed people are going to</v>

1002
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.050
<v Speaker 4>help the cops that weed people are going to promote,</v>

1003
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:13.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1004
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:13.581
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1005
00:27:13.581 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 4>a good relationship with the police officers.</v>

1006
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.940

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:32.820
<v Speaker 4>these are rich fucking money thieving cunts.</v>

1014
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.841

<v Speaker 4>When the we dollars starts doing that,</v>

1019
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Speaker 4>two things are gonna change.</v>

1020
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.510
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's going to have to look at it that way and they're so terrified of</v>

1021
00:27:42.511 --> 00:27:42.751
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1022
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 4>That is a,</v>

1023
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 4>that's something that really could truly change the world.</v>

1024
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.670
<v Speaker 4>People who are trippers,</v>

1025
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 4>who have money trippers who have money and philanthropy,</v>

1026
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 4>philanthropic ideas and the ambition to follow through on them.</v>

1027
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.600
<v Speaker 4>And the pharmaceutical companies are terrified of that shit.</v>

1028
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 4>Politicians are terrified of that shit,</v>

1029
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 4>whether they admit it or not,</v>

1030
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.340
<v Speaker 4>they're terrified of that shit on top of the fact that you have to say you don't</v>

1031
00:28:05.341 --> 00:28:08.460
<v Speaker 4>like drugs because everybody thinks about the children and it's saying you like</v>

1032
00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 4>drugs is just too controversial to many people are ignorant.</v>

1033
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:11.484
<v Speaker 4>They don't get it.</v>

1034
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 4>So it's like saying you don't like tools.</v>

1035
00:28:13.471 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 4>To me it's like I don't want tools.</v>

1036
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 4>We're going to just leave things the way they are.</v>

1037
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

1038
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's a certain age group that's just going to die off though</v>

1039
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.090
<v Speaker 4>eventually and then it's going to be more accepted and say like 10 to 20 years?</v>

1040
00:28:24.091 --> 00:28:24.924
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

1041
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.040

<v Speaker 4>all that free talking people,</v>

1052
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:45.930
<v Speaker 4>people who are allowed because of this sort of a format to express themselves in</v>

<v Speaker 4>a way uncensored that millions of people you can get.</v>

<v Speaker 4>38 million people have seen that.</v>

1060
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

1061
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's amazing that you can do that.</v>

1062
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:03.721
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1063
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

1064
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 4>there's never been a time in human history where you could do anything that can</v>

1065
00:29:07.681 --> 00:29:12.120
<v Speaker 4>almost immediately be recognizing and seen by so many people through Twitter,</v>

1066
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:12.781
<v Speaker 4>through Facebook,</v>

1067
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:14.730
<v Speaker 4>through blogs and podcasts.</v>

1068
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.220
<v Speaker 4>And this is the shit that's changing the world,</v>

1069
00:29:17.221 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1070
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 4>This is what's changing the world.</v>

1071
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 4>Free Open communication.</v>

1072
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:21.001
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1073
00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:23.220
<v Speaker 4>this is where the government truly fucked up.</v>

1074
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not what drugs.</v>

1075
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 4>Cause the problem with free open communication is we go,</v>

1076
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 4>why not drugs?</v>

1077
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 4>If it was just drugs and we didn't have free open communication and the,</v>

1078
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 4>the reality is this is not much you can do if you can't communicate with each</v>

1079
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:36.301
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

1080
00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:37.620
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to organize things.</v>

1081
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to get a movement going.</v>

1082
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

1083
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.051
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1084
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a person who's a leader and that person</v>

1085
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 1>gets arrested.</v>

1086
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 1>You can never have the type of situation right now the occupy Wall Street,</v>

1087
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 1>this hive mind situation,</v>

1088
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 1>this exists solely because of the internet and it never existed before.</v>

1089
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.590
<v Speaker 1>This is where there's a total different sort of revolution going on right now.</v>

1090
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And essentially what's happening is we're setting the stage for the next</v>

1091
00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 1>generation in a big,</v>

1092
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:01.751
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1093
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 1>big way because the next generation is not going to be these cops throwing flash</v>

1094
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:06.221
<v Speaker 1>grenades anymore.</v>

1095
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be cops that have to realize that to be a police officer,</v>

1096
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:10.391
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

1097
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 1>another one of us were just,</v>

1098
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you're just one of us that we'd give a weapon so that you protect people and</v>

1099
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 1>when you stop doing nice things and you start being a problem,</v>

1100
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:19.600
<v Speaker 1>you can't be a company more.</v>

1101
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1102
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no union thing.</v>

1103
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:22.264
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

1104
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 1>we got our rights and we go to fucking labor thing and you go to sit down with a</v>

1105
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 1>mediator.</v>

1106
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:26.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1107
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:26.681
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1108
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:26.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1109
00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

1110
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't be that.</v>

1111
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.730
<v Speaker 1>That's not what a police officer is.</v>

1112
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bank or can't steal from you.</v>

1113
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't charge 30% entrance.</v>

1114
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:36.250
<v Speaker 1>You fuck heads.</v>

1115
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't not have the money when the shit hits the fan because you've invested</v>

1116
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:42.310
<v Speaker 1>it shittily you know there's these things.</v>

1117
00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Things cannot be variables and that is,</v>

1118
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.610
<v Speaker 1>the stage is being set right now.</v>

1119
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the stage is being set in our generation.</v>

1120
00:30:51.221 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Our generation is setting the stage for the next generation,</v>

1121
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 1>the generation that is going to grow up and evolve from birth to death with the</v>

1122
00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

1123
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a different generation than us.</v>

1124
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:01.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1125

<v Speaker 1>the generation to come.</v>

1131
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.120
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going to get to the point where it's something like there's going</v>

1132
00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 1>to be a cat as a president or something like that.</v>

1146
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1147
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Dora the explorer or Sarah Pailin.</v>

1148
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Who would make the better choices?</v>

1149
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Dora at least would look at the screen and go,</v>

1150
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys think?</v>

1151
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1152
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.530
<v Speaker 1>we're going to send drones in the Pakistan.</v>

1153
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to waste soldiers.</v>

1154
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 1>We can shoot them from the air.</v>

1155
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>That's how Dora the explorer would be the president.</v>

1156
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1157
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Palin's you to tell your pussy.</v>

1158
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I bet you she's had a bunch of kids.</v>

1159
00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:57.281
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1160
00:31:57.281 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 1>that thing's probably a wreck Dora,</v>

1161
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 1>but I bet she gives up the ass.</v>

1162
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.411
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

1163
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I see that monks,</v>

1164
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I showed you the shots of Jack Daniels.</v>

1165
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>A little cocaine in her.</v>

1166
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Which Lindsay Lohan Mugshot.</v>

1167
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.710

1168
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Lohan got arrested again and her dad got arrested again.</v>

1170
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.210
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

1171
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 1>If you had to pick one though,</v>

1172
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 1>which one would it be?</v>

1173
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:15.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1174
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:16.000
<v Speaker 1>fuck off him.</v>

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:16.691
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

1178
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.063
<v Speaker 1>You have to choose one.</v>

1179
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I would probably go with the one,</v>

1180
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1181

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I would go with the far right.</v>

1183
00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:25.300

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.080
<v Speaker 1>She won't come on this podcast.</v>

1233
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't come here.</v>

1234
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:33.320
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to bring it to your place to say I was a lesbian.</v>

1235
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.380
<v Speaker 1>This is Rebecca.</v>

1236

<v Speaker 1>Skank hang around here.</v>

1238
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.833
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1239
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I think she's still rich,</v>

1240
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:40.401
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1241
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:41.234
<v Speaker 1>I think she's,</v>

1242
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 1>unless she's just been horribly mismanaged court costs though that she's been</v>

1243
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 1>going through so much.</v>

1244
00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:51.491
<v Speaker 1>Coke came probably maybe her court problems aren't like murder or shit.</v>

1245
00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:54.680
<v Speaker 1>They're like really drains you financially because you have to establish some</v>

1246
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:55.514
<v Speaker 1>sort of a case.</v>

1247
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.900
<v Speaker 1>It's for getting in trouble for shit.</v>

1248
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 1>There's really not much court work.</v>

1249
00:33:59.150 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1250
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 1>not much legal work they can do to try to squeeze her out of it.</v>

1251
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:04.730
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking coke ad and she gets drunk.</v>

1252
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:05.541
<v Speaker 1>She gets fucked up.</v>

1253
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:05.751
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1254
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:06.020

1255
00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.220

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 1>And we said this before,</v>

1257
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.640
<v Speaker 1>she's a 20 whatever the fuck she is.</v>

1258
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:12.440
<v Speaker 1>25 2050 she's died.</v>

1259
00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:13.131
<v Speaker 1>I think she should really,</v>

1260
00:34:13.131 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I think she's just find out how will it,</v>

1261
00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:15.340
<v Speaker 1>is Lindsey alone?</v>

<v Speaker 1>22 or 2125</v>

1264
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.371

1276
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see it all go away.</v>

1277
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.253
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:18.203
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1293
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.141
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1294
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:21.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at,</v>

1295
00:35:21.841 --> 00:35:22.674
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find it.</v>

1296
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.060

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1299
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about it on a podcast.</v>

1300
00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 1>So already there's this horrible photo that was at recently.</v>

1301
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1302
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like when people were like shitting on Megan Fox thumbs,</v>

1303
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 1>they'll look luminar thumbs up or thumbs like,</v>

1304
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.070
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

1305
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1306
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:45.000
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the hightest women that's ever walked the face of the planet.</v>

1307
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:45.621
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>

1308
00:35:45.621 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at her thumbs.</v>

1309
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

1310
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.390
<v Speaker 1>she could chop those fucking thumbs off machetes and replaced them with eagle</v>

1311
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.660
<v Speaker 1>cause it could be an eagles talent on each hand.</v>

1312
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:55.494
<v Speaker 1>And I wouldn't mind,</v>

1313
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:56.460
<v Speaker 1>I feel a little weird.</v>

1314
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:56.851
<v Speaker 1>Here's what,</v>

1315
00:35:56.851 --> 00:35:59.100
<v Speaker 1>grabbing my deck with an Eagle Talon for a thumb though.</v>

1316
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.113
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's not odd.</v>

1317
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.601
<v Speaker 1>I found it,</v>

1318
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:01.030
<v Speaker 1>but it gets,</v>

1319
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.441
<v Speaker 1>it's not all.</v>

1320
00:36:01.441 --> 00:36:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It's actually that she has,</v>

1321
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.880
<v Speaker 1>she's anorexic looking like she like it.</v>

1322
00:36:05.881 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 1>You're starting to be able to see like how creepy her arms are.</v>

1323
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1324
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 1>there's another shot that her hand,</v>

1325
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:12.923
<v Speaker 1>I think it's</v>

1326
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.930
<v Speaker 4>this one dude.</v>

1327
00:36:14.931 --> 00:36:15.800
<v Speaker 4>She's just fit.</v>

1328
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.540
<v Speaker 4>She's got muscle.</v>

1329
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:18.663
<v Speaker 4>That's the muscle.</v>

1330
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.160
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

1331
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.120
<v Speaker 4>she's very thin,</v>

1332
00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.410
<v Speaker 4>but she's got muscle.</v>

1333
00:36:21.411 --> 00:36:21.981
<v Speaker 4>She's probably,</v>

1334
00:36:21.981 --> 00:36:23.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't like some fucking crazy,</v>

1335
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.050
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1336
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.890
<v Speaker 4>that looks real skinny,</v>

1337
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.800
<v Speaker 4>but she's fucking 48 years old or whatever the hell she is.</v>

1338
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.713
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1339
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1340
00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:34.490
<v Speaker 4>Well you do start their women's start losing fat in their face and that's one of</v>

1341
00:36:34.491 --> 00:36:35.570
<v Speaker 4>the things that really bums them out.</v>

1342
00:36:35.571 --> 00:36:38.180
<v Speaker 4>So they get fillers and it's really kind of fucking creepy.</v>

1343
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.070
<v Speaker 4>Fillers are really dark,</v>

1344
00:36:40.071 --> 00:36:40.550
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1345
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.410
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of a weird thing when people do,</v>

1346
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.970
<v Speaker 4>they shove like,</v>

1347
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

1348
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:49.090
<v Speaker 4>some stuff in your fucking mug and it,</v>

1349
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1350
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.070
<v Speaker 4>like when you see women with like really puffy cheeks and shit,</v>

1351
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.950
<v Speaker 4>but I think she still looks hot as fuck man.</v>

1352
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.420
<v Speaker 4>I look at that picture right there and my,</v>

1353
00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 4>she's pretty hot dude.</v>

1354
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.510
<v Speaker 4>She just looks fit to me.</v>

1355
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.190
<v Speaker 4>She looks thin but fit.</v>

1356
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.050
<v Speaker 4>She's probably just on a really healthy diet.</v>

1357
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1358
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.440
<v Speaker 4>You'd</v>

1360
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.101
<v Speaker 1>cut off their hair though.</v>

1361
00:37:04.101 --> 00:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like Steve Jobs in that photo where he's wearing a dress though,</v>

1362
00:37:06.621 --> 00:37:08.660
<v Speaker 1>kind of Steve jobs where he went,</v>

1363
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.961
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1364
00:37:08.961 --> 00:37:09.950
<v Speaker 1>she's not that thing.</v>

1365
00:37:09.951 --> 00:37:10.820
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy man.</v>

1366
00:37:10.821 --> 00:37:11.654
<v Speaker 1>She looks healthy,</v>

1367
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.591
<v Speaker 1>she looks healthy,</v>

1368
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:16.460
<v Speaker 1>but she looks like a person is probably fanatical about exercise.</v>

1369
00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Look man.</v>

1371
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to keep it together at that age?</v>

1372
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I just worked out today with Steve Maxwell.</v>

1373
00:37:21.711 --> 00:37:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Steven Maxwell's is Kettlebell guy that I'm friends with and he'll,</v>

1374
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.920
<v Speaker 1>he comes over like a few times a year and puts me through these brutal workouts.</v>

1375
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1376
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1377
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1378
00:37:29.271 --> 00:37:30.170
<v Speaker 1>he's an animal bro.</v>

1379
00:37:30.171 --> 00:37:31.790
<v Speaker 1>And he's 59 years old,</v>

1380
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.860
<v Speaker 1>50 fucking nine years old,</v>

1381
00:37:33.861 --> 00:37:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and he can do some shit that I can't do.</v>

1382
00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.760
<v Speaker 1>He could do a bunch of different exercises I can't do.</v>

1383
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:42.230
<v Speaker 1>He puts me through these wild fucking yoga positions and it makes you do chin</v>

1384
00:37:42.231 --> 00:37:43.040
<v Speaker 1>ups where you,</v>

1385
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.600
<v Speaker 1>you will fully extend,</v>

1386
00:37:44.601 --> 00:37:48.740
<v Speaker 1>pull your chin up all the way up and then you hold it for five breaths and then</v>

1387
00:37:48.741 --> 00:37:49.880
<v Speaker 1>you go to your eyeballs,</v>

1388
00:37:49.881 --> 00:37:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you hold it to him for five breaths and then you go above your head and you hold</v>

1389
00:37:53.361 --> 00:37:56.900
<v Speaker 1>it for five breaths and then you go fully extended and then you pull yourself</v>

1390
00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:58.010
<v Speaker 1>back up and start all over again.</v>

1391
00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.170
<v Speaker 1>And it takes a long time.</v>

1392
00:38:00.171 --> 00:38:02.450
<v Speaker 1>It takes like 90 seconds to do like three of them.</v>

1393
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And when you're doing this man,</v>

1394
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:09.350
<v Speaker 1>he does it like it's nothing and he's fucking 59 years old.</v>

1395
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

1396
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.120
<v Speaker 1>The dude's a stud.</v>

1397
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:11.991
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1398
00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:12.500
<v Speaker 1>he can,</v>

1399
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.240
<v Speaker 1>he can put it,</v>

1400
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.150
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1401
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Some people can fucking,</v>

1402
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.701
<v Speaker 1>they just keep it together.</v>

1403
00:38:16.701 --> 00:38:18.590
<v Speaker 1>But the only way you do it like that,</v>

1404
00:38:18.591 --> 00:38:20.780
<v Speaker 1>like he's a world renowned fitness instructor.</v>

1405
00:38:20.781 --> 00:38:21.640
<v Speaker 1>He works out every day.</v>

1406
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.341
<v Speaker 1>He's teaching people,</v>

1407
00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:23.990
<v Speaker 1>he's training every fucking day of his life,</v>

1408
00:38:23.991 --> 00:38:24.800
<v Speaker 1>like literally.</v>

1409
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.230
<v Speaker 1>And he's training people how to train everyday of his life.</v>

1410
00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.730
<v Speaker 1>So he just maintains fitness,</v>

1411
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.330
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>

1412
00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.630
<v Speaker 1>to look like Demi Moore and basically essentially 50 years old.</v>

1413
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yet I guess they're saying that she lost 98 pounds up to 98 pounds of what she</v>

1414
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:37.640
<v Speaker 1>used to weigh.</v>

1415
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.473
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying.</v>

1416
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1420
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.560
<v Speaker 1>This is reported to have plummeted to around seven stone.</v>

1421
00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 1>That's 98 pounds for all you folks on this side of the pond.</v>

1422
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean she lost 98 pounds.</v>

1423
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:50.920
<v Speaker 1>That means she changed.</v>

1424
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.541
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

1425

<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

1455
00:39:45.461 --> 00:39:48.970
<v Speaker 1>it'd be amazing because it's really like right around the corner from the stage,</v>

1456
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.900
<v Speaker 1>from both stages and you can just get offstage,</v>

00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:12.520
<v Speaker 1>But you're in it too.</v>

1470
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 1>And we talked to the guy that made the Burke Chrysler tee shirts.</v>

1471
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Was that?</v>

1472
00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:15.931

00:40:16.431 --> 00:40:16.931
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:17.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1478
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Towards the very end.</v>

1479
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And then some guy that said he was going to verify me on Twitter anyways,</v>

1480
00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 1>that's up on,</v>

1481
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I just put up the podcast.</v>

1482
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:22.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1483
00:40:22.901 --> 00:40:23.950
<v Speaker 1>You need to verify them.</v>

1484
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Whoever you are are,</v>

1485
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1486
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do that anymore though.</v>

1487
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:27.671
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1488
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:27.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1489
00:40:27.811 --> 00:40:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I think they stopped that whole thing.</v>

1490
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just want it to be your friend,</v>

1491
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.050
<v Speaker 1>so he pretended he could verify you.</v>

1492
00:40:32.051 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a cool thing to say,</v>

1493
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.311
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1494
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I can verify your baby.</v>

1495
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.230

1496
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 1>let me look it up,</v>

1498
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.061

00:40:37.061 --> 00:40:37.650
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

1500
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Want to get verified.</v>

1501
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1502
00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:39.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a new,</v>

1503
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.030
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1504
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna try that.</v>

1505
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to be verified on Twitter and you know,</v>

1506
00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fake people.</v>

1507
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.603
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like,</v>

1508
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Chris Rock's really on Twitter.</v>

1509
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.293
<v Speaker 1>It might be now.</v>

1510
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.540
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't for a long time though.</v>

1511
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:49.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1512
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:50.381
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

1513
00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Chappelle's on,</v>

1514
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1515
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1516
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:53.883
<v Speaker 1>I think that's fair.</v>

1517
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1518
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.153
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

1519
00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think the fake ones got a lot of people on it.</v>

1520
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.550
<v Speaker 1>They think it's unfortunate,</v>

1521
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1524
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.220
<v Speaker 1>But he started,</v>

1525
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>he tweeted something about his new shows.</v>

1526
00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1614
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 4>you went back in time to like some dark age when people,</v>

1615
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:25.580
<v Speaker 4>people were still developing humanity and developing culture and developing,</v>

1616
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:26.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1617
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:27.101
<v Speaker 4>a community,</v>

1618
00:43:27.101 --> 00:43:29.540
<v Speaker 4>the sense of community and you just shoved them all together.</v>

1619
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:32.630
<v Speaker 4>And gave them houses and gave them clothes and cars.</v>

1620
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 4>And it's just,</v>

1621
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.161
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like,</v>

1622
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:37.370
<v Speaker 4>it's like you can't believe that there's a part of the world that's that,</v>

1623
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.300
<v Speaker 4>that nuts.</v>

1624
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.390
<v Speaker 4>And when they were given the figures about the Congo,</v>

1625
00:43:40.391 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 4>but how many people have been murdered there?</v>

1626
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.590
<v Speaker 4>You just go,</v>

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like millions of people.</v>

1629
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Millions.</v>

1630
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 4>And just think of the idea of a million being a thousand,</v>

1631
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 4>a thousand times.</v>

1632
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.250
<v Speaker 4>I think about there's multiple,</v>

1633
00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 4>multiple millions and millions of people have died in the Congo.</v>

1634
00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 4>And think about the,</v>

1635
00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 4>just the,</v>

1636
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.060
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1637
00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1638
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.680
<v Speaker 4>the enormity of the mass of all those bodies together.</v>

1639
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.600
<v Speaker 4>And you realize how crazy it is.</v>

1640
00:44:05.601 --> 00:44:09.320
<v Speaker 4>These fucks went there and they went there to film the fucking video.</v>

1641
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.030

1645
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 4>there's minors and they're fucking putting people through slave labor to get</v>

1646
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 4>them to pull out,</v>

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1648
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 4>rocks and minerals that we're gonna use to make cell phones.</v>

1649
00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:25.770
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1650
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.880
<v Speaker 4>the world is crazy as fuck right now.</v>

1651

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1654
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is just we know we're constantly inundated by information.</v>

1655
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.561
<v Speaker 4>When I was a kid,</v>

1656
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to find out about EDI mean you gotta you got to do some searching.</v>

1660
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 4>you had to talk to a teacher.</v>

1661
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.620
<v Speaker 4>You know Mr. Johnson Q.</v>

00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:51.950
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1667
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't just get the information but like Kadafi man,</v>

1668
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:58.380
<v Speaker 4>we watched that guy's last moments of life.</v>

1669
00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.251
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1670
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:03.900
<v Speaker 4>think about the difference in the leap of information between now and 2030 years</v>

1671
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:04.141
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

1672
00:45:04.141 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 4>We watched Kadafi died.</v>

1673
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I watched a guy shove a stick up Qaddafi's ass while he was covered in blood.</v>

1674
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.680
<v Speaker 4>I saw him with no blood on him.</v>

1675
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 4>I heard gunshots and I see him bleeding in the fucking head.</v>

1676
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:45:19.201 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 4>You see him kicking him.</v>

1680
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.570
<v Speaker 4>We watched that.</v>

1681
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:21.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1682
00:45:21.961 --> 00:45:22.890
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that the,</v>

1683
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 4>it's weird that that happened because they aren't,</v>

1715
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 4>That was the one time where it illuminated to me how much of it is just a job</v>

1716
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:07.170
<v Speaker 4>for George Bush.</v>

1717
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.850
<v Speaker 4>He's just a guy with a job.</v>

1718
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.820
<v Speaker 4>When that guy started throwing the shoes at him and he had a little smile on his</v>

1719
00:46:11.821 --> 00:46:12.121
<v Speaker 4>face,</v>

1720
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:12.690
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1721
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Gee Whiz,</v>

1722
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 4>finally I get a little fun on the job.</v>

1723
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.280
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1724
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.000
<v Speaker 4>But he had a little fun on the job today.</v>

1725
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 4>Normally my job is bullshit and to people while Dick Cheney fucks the world,</v>

1726
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.400
<v Speaker 4>but today I got the ducks</v>

1727
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:23.941
<v Speaker 5>shoes,</v>

1728
00:46:23.941 --> 00:46:24.690
<v Speaker 5>honey.</v>

1729
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.321
<v Speaker 5>It was fun.</v>

1730
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:25.591
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1731
00:46:25.591 --> 00:46:26.550
<v Speaker 5>come on you little fella.</v>

1732
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:27.780
<v Speaker 5>You ain't got no fucking arm.</v>

1733
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 5>Throw it.</v>

1734
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.330
<v Speaker 5>Throw no shoes.</v>

1735
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:35.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like he seemed human to me for like a brief moment because to me Bush was</v>

1736
00:46:35.001 --> 00:46:36.020
<v Speaker 4>always this moron.</v>

1737
00:46:36.021 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 4>It like stood on a battleship with,</v>

1738
00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:38.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1739
00:46:38.001 --> 00:46:40.820
<v Speaker 4>mission accomplished in the background when fucking nothing had been</v>

1740
00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:41.381
<v Speaker 4>accomplished.</v>

1741
00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Like you're talking crazy.</v>

1742
00:46:42.741 --> 00:46:45.050
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to call it first and then we win the war.</v>

1743
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.340
<v Speaker 4>The fuck are you talking about?</v>

1744
00:46:46.341 --> 00:46:47.300
<v Speaker 4>How's it mission accomplished?</v>

1745
00:46:47.301 --> 00:46:50.150
<v Speaker 4>Was 100,000 fucking troops over there and you know,</v>

1746
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.180
<v Speaker 4>50,000 deadly war machine circling the sky,</v>

1747
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.410
<v Speaker 4>dropping bombs on people.</v>

1748
00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:55.610
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1749
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.660
<v Speaker 4>What was your mission?</v>

1750
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Mission accomplished.</v>

1751
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.450
<v Speaker 4>We stolen lied.</v>

1752
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.051
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1753
00:47:00.051 --> 00:47:01.610
<v Speaker 4>if that's what their mission accomplish was,</v>

1754
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:02.480
<v Speaker 4>we got over there,</v>

1755
00:47:02.481 --> 00:47:04.100
<v Speaker 4>we got Halliburton contracts,</v>

1756
00:47:04.101 --> 00:47:04.760
<v Speaker 4>we did it,</v>

1757
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.271
<v Speaker 4>we did it,</v>

1758
00:47:05.271 --> 00:47:05.691
<v Speaker 4>we did it.</v>

1759
00:47:05.691 --> 00:47:05.820
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

1760
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.180
<v Speaker 4>we sold the weapons of mass destruction lie,</v>

1761
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:08.841
<v Speaker 4>Yay,</v>

1762
00:47:08.841 --> 00:47:09.710
<v Speaker 4>mission accomplished.</v>

1763
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Then it's mission accomplished.</v>

1764
00:47:10.821 --> 00:47:12.050
<v Speaker 4>So I always looked at him as being,</v>

1765
00:47:12.051 --> 00:47:15.610
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking new world order mouthpiece,</v>

1766
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:15.831
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1767
00:47:15.831 --> 00:47:16.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1768
00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:19.040
<v Speaker 4>this evil person who is perpetrating these things on the American people.</v>

1769
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.920
<v Speaker 4>And then I looked at him when that guy was throwing a shoe at him and I was</v>

1770
00:47:21.921 --> 00:47:22.101
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1771
00:47:22.101 --> 00:47:23.030
<v Speaker 4>he's just a guy,</v>

1772
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:23.931
<v Speaker 4>is the normal guy.</v>

1773
00:47:23.931 --> 00:47:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Just a guy who got duped.</v>

1774
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.610
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why he comes off dom is because part of the reason why he's</v>

1775
00:47:28.611 --> 00:47:31.150
<v Speaker 4>weighed now than when he was the governor.</v>

1776
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 4>If you go back and listen to,</v>

1777
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:33.790
<v Speaker 4>like George Bush had speeches,</v>

1778
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
<v Speaker 4>George Bush jr w when he was a young man and he was campaigning for governor,</v>

1779
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 4>he was quite eloquent.</v>

1780
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1781
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 4>it's really a shocking difference between that level of,</v>

1782
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:45.010
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1783
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 4>of the ability to communicate that he had back then and how he came across as,</v>

1784
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:49.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1785
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.570
<v Speaker 4>maybe not the most educated guy in the world,</v>

1786
00:47:52.571 --> 00:47:52.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1787
00:47:52.871 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 4>but at least he was focused and prepared and he spoke very clearly and he seemed</v>

1788
00:47:57.551 --> 00:47:58.384
<v Speaker 4>very confident.</v>

1789
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:00.970
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you see him like as a an older man,</v>

1790
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:04.390
<v Speaker 4>it's like he just barely fucking phoning it in and that's what it was like.</v>

1791
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.700
<v Speaker 4>He was like Jack on lost in the last season.</v>

1792
00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Who's phoning it in?</v>

1793
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:13.170
<v Speaker 4>He was just tired of the whole charade and he was forced into that position and</v>

1794
00:48:13.211 --> 00:48:14.910
<v Speaker 4>so that's why he said stuff with the knife,</v>

1795
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.210
<v Speaker 4>no passion behind it.</v>

1796
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Like the evil doers,</v>

1797
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.160
<v Speaker 4>he would say like stupid shit because he would get off script and he really</v>

1798
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:22.450
<v Speaker 4>didn't have any passion for it,</v>

1799
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:23.330
<v Speaker 4>so he didn't have,</v>

1800
00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 4>it's not even that he was dumb.</v>

1801
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 4>He said he never thought about it.</v>

1802
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:27.310
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1803
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.570
<v Speaker 4>he had to shut himself off of the reality of what being the fucking president</v>

1804
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 4>was because everybody,</v>

1805
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:33.701
<v Speaker 4>when they're a little boy,</v>

1806
00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:36.640
<v Speaker 4>thinks that the reality of being the president is all you get to be the fucking</v>

1807
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 4>guy who fixes everything and be the next Teddy Roosevelt would be the guy who</v>

1808
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:41.140
<v Speaker 4>turns America around.</v>

1809
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:42.011
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1810
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:46.960
<v Speaker 4>all you are is just strapping a condom on this giant machine,</v>

1811
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.320
<v Speaker 4>this giant war machine as it fucks America in the ass,</v>

1812
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:51.340
<v Speaker 4>and that's what you're doing.</v>

1813
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:53.680
<v Speaker 4>You're there to provide the condoms so American doesn't know what the fuck is</v>

1814
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:54.514
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1815
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:54.881
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1816
00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:55.051
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1817
00:48:55.051 --> 00:48:56.000
<v Speaker 4>you're there to the,</v>

1818
00:48:56.001 --> 00:48:57.220
<v Speaker 4>to put the put on the show.</v>

1819
00:48:57.221 --> 00:48:59.410
<v Speaker 4>You're there to tell everybody that everything is okay.</v>

1820
00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 4>We have to insert this dick in your ass to fight terror.</v>

1821
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.531
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1822
00:49:02.531 --> 00:49:03.280
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1823
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:03.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1824
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:04.300
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1825
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.021
<v Speaker 4>that's what he was,</v>

1826
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:06.010
<v Speaker 4>he was the mouthpiece,</v>

1827
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:10.210
<v Speaker 4>the mouthpiece for the monster and that guy throwing the shoe at it just</v>

1828
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:11.080
<v Speaker 4>illuminated it.</v>

1829
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 4>I saw him with a glimmer in his eye,</v>

1830
00:49:13.571 --> 00:49:18.340
<v Speaker 4>like a young guy again and meanwhile he's just a fucking 60 year old man,</v>

1831
00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:22.270
<v Speaker 4>60 year old man who just got sucked into the wrong fucking crowd.</v>

1832
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.250
<v Speaker 4>Never really was ambitious,</v>

1833
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 4>never really cared that much.</v>

1834
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:26.770
<v Speaker 4>If you look at his past,</v>

1835
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 4>he was like a lazy guy.</v>

1836
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.900
<v Speaker 4>So when all of a sudden he's in a position,</v>

1837
00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:30.061
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

1838
00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be set for life financially.</v>

1839
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:33.640
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking president now.</v>

1840
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 4>He's even in his second term,</v>

1841
00:49:35.441 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 4>like he just had no ambition.</v>

1842
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:42.420
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about a guy who choked himself unconscious on a pretzel and fell</v>

1843
00:49:42.821 --> 00:49:43.780
<v Speaker 4>and knocked himself out.</v>

1844
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:44.600
<v Speaker 4>You remember that Shit.</v>

1845
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.130
<v Speaker 4>You had like a black eye or that was a story that totally seems like the most</v>

1846
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous story ever.</v>

1847
00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Maybe his dad beat the fuck out of them.</v>

1848
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if he was like doing something wrong or he said something</v>

1849
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:57.070
<v Speaker 4>wrong and his dad put on leather gloves and like beat him and fries.</v>

1850
00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.290
<v Speaker 4>They'll put on like SAP gloves.</v>

1851
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.410
<v Speaker 4>Just beat his ass in front of everybody to show him like,</v>

1852
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 4>this is not how the new world order's run and just fucking beat his ass,</v>

1853
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.690

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 4>like Newsweek.</v>

1875
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.540

1876
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1877
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 4>he was on the cover of Newsweek and it was talking about him being a wimp and it</v>

1878
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:37.820
<v Speaker 4>was like a very controversial thing because here's a guy who's,</v>

1879
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:38.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1881
00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:41.961
<v Speaker 4>And they're saying,</v>

1882
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:42.830
<v Speaker 4>is he a wimp?</v>

1883
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:43.461
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1884
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:44.294

00:50:45.411 --> 00:50:45.681

<v Speaker 4>a fucking magazine sticks that.</v>

1889
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 4>But meanwhile,</v>

1890
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 4>this guy was the head of the fucking CIA.</v>

1891
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 4>You know what kind of Evil Shit you have to do to be the head of the CIA to get</v>

1892
00:50:57.861 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 4>to the top of that monster.</v>

1893
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:01.490
<v Speaker 4>The CIA's a shadow government.</v>

1894
00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:05.480
<v Speaker 4>We have a shadow government that is allowed to murder people.</v>

1895
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.660
<v Speaker 4>They're allowed to go out of the country and murder people.</v>

1896
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:09.171
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1897
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:11.780
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you call these people terrorists or whether or not you can</v>

1898
00:51:11.781 --> 00:51:13.820
<v Speaker 4>connect them to illegal activity.</v>

1899
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 4>The bottom line is the CIA,</v>

1900
00:51:15.981 --> 00:51:17.490
<v Speaker 4>including American civilians.</v>

1901
00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:20.830
<v Speaker 4>The CIA goes over there and kill these motherfuckers and,</v>

1902
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 4>and they don't do shit about it.</v>

1903
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.440
<v Speaker 4>Nobody does a fucking thing about it.</v>

1904
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 4>The government doesn't prosecute him.</v>

1905
00:51:26.031 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 4>They don't go after him.</v>

1906
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 4>For these,</v>

1907
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 4>these drone attacks that they do.</v>

1908
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 4>They do some crazy shit,</v>

1909
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1910
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.080
<v Speaker 4>And this guy was the head of that.</v>

1911
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 4>He was the head so maybe he didn't have to fucking lay the gloves to George</v>

1912
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:38.630
<v Speaker 4>Little Georgie.</v>

1913
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Skim a fucking stiff jab in the face.</v>

1914
00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.430
<v Speaker 4>Bitch will fucking kill you.</v>

1915
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.570
<v Speaker 4>This is how it works.</v>

1916
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.931
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1917
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 4>you can't go back to own a baseball team,</v>

1918
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:47.940

1926
00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I found out that it was a training and then the trainee beat his ass and he</v>

1927
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:05.950

<v Speaker 3>So it's pretty much going to start censoring.</v>

1950
00:52:44.291 --> 00:52:45.480
<v Speaker 3>The Internet's going to start it.</v>

1951
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Who is allowing people to continue to come up with?</v>

1952
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.880
<v Speaker 4>Can we have a moratorium on new laws?</v>

1953
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Just like obviously shit is spiraling out of control.</v>

1954
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:59.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a million new laws introduced every year that upset people that we don't</v>

1955
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:02.020
<v Speaker 4>have a chance to truly reconcile and understand and,</v>

1956
00:53:02.021 --> 00:53:02.181
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1957

00:53:05.531 --> 00:53:06.520
<v Speaker 4>just a dress.</v>

1963
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:07.840
<v Speaker 4>There's too many of them.</v>

1964
00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.220
<v Speaker 4>There's new ones every day,</v>

1965
00:53:09.221 --> 00:53:10.360
<v Speaker 4>whether it's medical marijuana,</v>

1966
00:53:10.361 --> 00:53:13.660
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to do this to try and do that with vitamins and fucking make them</v>

1967
00:53:13.661 --> 00:53:15.340
<v Speaker 4>prescription only to try to do this,</v>

1968
00:53:15.341 --> 00:53:16.031
<v Speaker 4>to try and do that.</v>

1969
00:53:16.031 --> 00:53:16.300
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1970
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.060
<v Speaker 4>it's a constant stream of bullshit.</v>

1971
00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.500
<v Speaker 4>You fucking criminals and I hope,</v>

1972
00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.880
<v Speaker 4>I hope that it doesn't through Bhs stop free speech.</v>

1973
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.730
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to stop people from doing what they're doing now,</v>

1974
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.020
<v Speaker 4>which is organizing.</v>

1975
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 4>When do you think they are going to start making a sensor?</v>

1976
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Podcasts.</v>

1977
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:34.673
<v Speaker 4>They can't.</v>

1978
00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 4>I think they're not because there's too many of them.</v>

1979
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:38.070
<v Speaker 4>There's too many of them.</v>

1980
00:53:38.071 --> 00:53:38.701
<v Speaker 4>There's too much.</v>

1981
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:39.690
<v Speaker 4>It's too much going on.</v>

1982
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 4>What does the sensor censorship for?</v>

1983
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Speaker 4>If it's free and you actually have to download it and it's,</v>

1984
00:53:45.691 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1985
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 4>it's labeled mature,</v>

1986
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be fucking pretty simple.</v>

1987
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're going to start censoring movies and censoring songs,</v>

1988
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 4>which you know they've tried,</v>

1989
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:57.420
<v Speaker 4>they've tried in the past and it essentially they do censor movies because if</v>

1990
00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:58.530
<v Speaker 4>you go above are,</v>

1991
00:53:58.531 --> 00:54:00.330
<v Speaker 4>you can't have any sexual content and movie,</v>

1992
00:54:00.331 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 4>like real interaction.</v>

1993
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.240
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember Brown bunny?</v>

1994
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.440
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that movie?</v>

2080
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 4>But at one point in time,</v>

2081
00:55:52.141 --> 00:55:54.330
<v Speaker 4>you know that was where people thought it was going to go.</v>

2082
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Speaker 4>When deep throat came out,</v>

2083
00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.640
<v Speaker 4>people got in line like and went to that on Bates deep throat came out and it</v>

2084
00:56:01.861 --> 00:56:06.861
<v Speaker 4>was like a real movie that was a pornographic movie and that had really not been</v>

2085
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:10.770
<v Speaker 4>fucking popular before that,</v>

2086
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:11.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2087
00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:11.851
<v Speaker 4>they're really,</v>

2088
00:56:11.851 --> 00:56:15.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was behind the green curtain or door with Marilyn Chambers.</v>

2089
00:56:15.511 --> 00:56:20.511
<v Speaker 4>That was one that was like along similar lines and there's like a picture from</v>

2090
00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:25.581
<v Speaker 4>that I saw online of Johnny Carson waiting in line for deep throat.</v>

2091
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they were interviewing him and he'll just like,</v>

2092
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 4>it was like acceptable to go and see this and go see this.</v>

2093
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:35.590
<v Speaker 4>This movie where people actually fucked because it was a movie they had.</v>

2094
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have porno movies like that.</v>

2095
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 4>So because it was a movie,</v>

2096
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 4>they trick people and all of a sudden people were in this movie watching some</v>

2097
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:42.511
<v Speaker 4>checks,</v>

2098
00:56:42.511 --> 00:56:43.390
<v Speaker 4>sucks some decks.</v>

2099
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2100
00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.000
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of crazy when you think about it.</v>

2101
00:56:46.001 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't that long ago.</v>

2102
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 4>And you've got to wonder what if things,</v>

2103
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:51.071
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2104
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:51.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2105
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 4>weren't,</v>

2106
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 4>maybe they loosened up quicker.</v>

2107
00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:54.071
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2108
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:54.221
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2109
00:56:54.221 --> 00:56:54.680
<v Speaker 4>what if,</v>

2110
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.590
<v Speaker 4>if that was introduced today,</v>

2111
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:01.800
<v Speaker 4>what if we never had porn before and we have this sort of crazy environment</v>

2112
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.220
<v Speaker 4>where we have right now.</v>

2113
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:05.150
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden someone started,</v>

2114
00:57:05.151 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 4>it would be porn used to be just like scenes,</v>

2115
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:10.770
<v Speaker 4>but then someone put together a real good movie where people actually fucking</v>

2116
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.140
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2117
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.150
<v Speaker 4>And it was like the first one ever done like man,</v>

2118
00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 4>and maybe it was an idea before its time because you gotta think of Johnny</v>

2119
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 4>fucking Carson who's like,</v>

00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:48.010
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2138
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:48.843
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>

2139
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.540
<v Speaker 4>It could,</v>

2140
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.800
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what could have happened.</v>

2141
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.680
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it's one of those things where we just as zigged when we could have</v>

2142
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:54.514
<v Speaker 4>zagged,</v>

2143
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:55.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2144
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.370
<v Speaker 4>and maybe when that happened,</v>

2145
00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:58.443
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2146
00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:00.310
<v Speaker 4>they could've started doing,</v>

2147
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2148
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.230
<v Speaker 4>there could have been like a normal genre.</v>

2149
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Like you'd go to see,</v>

2150
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:04.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2151
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:07.630
<v Speaker 4>a fucking Jennifer Aniston movie and it was an ex,</v>

2152
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Jennifer Aniston would get fucked.</v>

2153
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Gerard Butler would just fucking dig in that.</v>

2154
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 4>There'll be craziest shit if you watch a real movie.</v>

2155
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.520
<v Speaker 4>Like that's stupid fucking movie they had where one of them was,</v>

2156
00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2157
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:20.470
<v Speaker 4>a convict or something.</v>

2158
00:58:20.471 --> 00:58:21.640
<v Speaker 4>They're handcuffed together.</v>

2159
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 4>How much better would that movie be of Jennifer Aniston was talking as deck,</v>

2160
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

2161
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:26.530
<v Speaker 4>be a way better moving.</v>

2162
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.000
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a way better movie.</v>

2163
00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 4>It would be fun.</v>

2164
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:29.501
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2165
00:58:29.501 --> 00:58:29.891
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like,</v>

2166
00:58:29.891 --> 00:58:30.191
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

2167
00:58:30.191 --> 00:58:31.270
<v Speaker 4>that girl's got a great mouth.</v>

2168
00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 4>It'd be fun.</v>

2169
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:36.130
<v Speaker 4>You know that big Chin really aids when she's blowing you because it gives you</v>

2170
00:58:36.131 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 4>like extra coverage of your balls on her chin.</v>

2171
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like more chin to go around.</v>

2172
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:42.160
<v Speaker 4>That's how you would look at it.</v>

2173
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:43.143
<v Speaker 4>It'd be fun,</v>

2174
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.400
<v Speaker 4>but instead it didn't go that way.</v>

2175
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:48.190
<v Speaker 4>You can imagine if the porno stars are the ones that made the big cash,</v>

2176
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:49.870
<v Speaker 4>that was like the real,</v>

2177
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 4>those are real money and if you didn't,</v>

2178
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:52.250
<v Speaker 4>if you were,</v>

2179
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:54.700
<v Speaker 4>if you're a hot chick and you're too scared to do porn,</v>

2180
00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:57.371
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2181
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:58.171
<v Speaker 4>well you know,</v>

2182
00:58:58.171 --> 00:58:59.620
<v Speaker 4>and you'd be on a Sitcom I guess,</v>

2183
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.120
<v Speaker 4>which you couldn't do any movies.</v>

2184
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 4>The real big money movies that people want to watch people fuck.</v>

2185
00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.200
<v Speaker 4>That could been really easily been possible.</v>

2186
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:10.930
<v Speaker 4>If you look at how God damn popular pornography is,</v>

2187
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:15.931
<v Speaker 4>it's really just a matter of a public attitude about it because pornography is</v>

2188
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.400
<v Speaker 4>gigantic on the Internet.</v>

2189
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:23.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean they think something like 30 to 40 of all packages that are flying around</v>

2190
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.270
<v Speaker 4>being downloaded on the internet,</v>

2191
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 4>have some sort of pornography on them.</v>

2192
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:29.630
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2193
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2194
00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:30.501
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

2195
00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:32.120
<v Speaker 4>just a staggering number.</v>

2196
00:59:32.121 --> 00:59:35.280
<v Speaker 4>When you think about the billions of human beings on the Internet,</v>

2197
00:59:35.281 --> 00:59:35.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2198
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.250
<v Speaker 4>how many billions or on the internet worldwide,</v>

2199
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.990
<v Speaker 4>is it like four or something like that?</v>

2200
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.660
<v Speaker 4>There's like almost 7 billion people.</v>

2201
00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Let's be conservative and say it's 3 billion on the Internet.</v>

2202
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 4>You think that's conservative or think that's like,</v>

2203
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:49.010
<v Speaker 4>let's go crazy and say 2 billion.</v>

2204
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Let's say it's only 2 billion people online.</v>

2205
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:53.330
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>

2206
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:58.510
<v Speaker 4>2 billion people and 30 to 40% of it is just dicks in pussies and sucking cock</v>

2207
00:59:58.821 --> 00:59:59.690
<v Speaker 4>and that's all it is.</v>

2208
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2209
01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 4>Then when you stop and think about the demand,</v>

2210
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 4>the sheer demand,</v>

2211
01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.430
<v Speaker 4>and yet when you look around,</v>

2212
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't know when you go to the movies,</v>

2213
01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:11.090
<v Speaker 4>it's not represented.</v>

2214
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:12.231
<v Speaker 4>It's is not.</v>

2215
01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:13.400
<v Speaker 4>You go to the magazine store,</v>

2216
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.420
<v Speaker 4>it's not represented.</v>

2217
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:14.961
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2218
01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 4>There's some like weird shit up at the top that sealed off and plastic and</v>

2219
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:20.660
<v Speaker 4>they're so fucking big,</v>

2220
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2221
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.390
<v Speaker 4>subscription thing over the front cover.</v>

2222
01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:27.260
<v Speaker 4>So you can't even see what it's in there until you open the plastic and yeah,</v>

2223
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:28.550
<v Speaker 4>it's a sort of represented,</v>

2224
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 4>but not 30 to 40%.</v>

2225
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.161
<v Speaker 4>Not even close.</v>

2226
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:31.431
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

2227
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like 1% maybe of the,</v>

2228
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.480
<v Speaker 4>all the magazines at a Barnes and noble,</v>

2229
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2230
01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 4>1% of them may be or pornographic.</v>

2231
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:39.800
<v Speaker 4>It's even in there.</v>

2232
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:41.540
<v Speaker 4>They're never like hardcore either.</v>

2233
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.820
<v Speaker 4>It's just like they show you like tits and shit.</v>

2234
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:46.720
<v Speaker 4>They show you like a little little spread apart if you're lucky girls,</v>

2235
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:47.570
<v Speaker 4>peanut on somebody.</v>

2236
01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.190
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2237
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:53.140
<v Speaker 3>That's why I can't understand why like magazines like playboy or giving $1</v>

2238
01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:56.140
<v Speaker 3>million to Lindsay Lohan when you know how the Internet works nowadays.</v>

2239
01:00:56.141 --> 01:00:56.891
<v Speaker 3>If Lindsay Lohan,</v>

2240
01:00:56.891 --> 01:00:58.330
<v Speaker 3>there's a photo of her from playboy.</v>

2241
01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's going to have it in like two seconds.</v>

2242
01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:00.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:02.290
<v Speaker 3>They're counting on the rubes.</v>

2244
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:05.650
<v Speaker 3>The count on the people that just can't get online quick enough.</v>

2245
01:01:05.651 --> 01:01:07.450
<v Speaker 3>They don't know anybody with the forum.</v>

2246
01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:08.573
<v Speaker 3>The forum,</v>

2247
01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.790
<v Speaker 3>I go on the forum and then what do I do it?</v>

2248
01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:12.731
<v Speaker 3>They don't know that.</v>

2249
01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:13.511
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what they're doing.</v>

2250
01:01:13.511 --> 01:01:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

2251
01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.130
<v Speaker 3>they're just fucking knuckleheads.</v>

2252
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad for the board on vacation.</v>

2253
01:01:17.951 --> 01:01:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2254
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad for my mom cause she,</v>

2255
01:01:19.701 --> 01:01:20.490
<v Speaker 3>she recently,</v>

2256
01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:21.010
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2257
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.110
<v Speaker 3>they still don't have internet at her house,</v>

2258
01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:23.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2259
01:01:23.441 --> 01:01:24.274

2261
01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:32.230
<v Speaker 3>a smart phone that has a hot spot so she can get on the Internet through her</v>

2262
01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:33.040
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>

2263
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:33.550
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2264
01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:33.910

2266
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.533
<v Speaker 3>It's shit.</v>

2267
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a four g phone.</v>

2270
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:45.340
<v Speaker 3>she's has fast I internet and we wouldn't have had the internet or like a whole</v>

2271
01:01:45.341 --> 01:01:45.760
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2272
01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.380
<v Speaker 3>And even when porn started coming up,</v>

2273
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:49.750
<v Speaker 3>it used to be like really slow loading porn.</v>

2274
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:50.240
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

01:05:16.231 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>like made a little blog about it and that's when it got</v>

2421
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 4>really creepy cause you made it,</v>

2422
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 4>this little blog about it and then send me,</v>

2423
01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:24.060
<v Speaker 4>sent a tweet about it with my name in it in uh,</v>

2424
01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:25.720
<v Speaker 4>the title of this blog.</v>

2425
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 4>And I got the same tweet from no bullshit,</v>

2426
01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:32.260
<v Speaker 4>maybe 50 or 60 other Twitter sites.</v>

2427
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 4>So he has like all these fake Twitter accounts and all of these accounts.</v>

2428
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:37.540
<v Speaker 4>When I would go to them,</v>

2429
01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 4>they would have all the exact same tweets.</v>

2430
01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:41.590
<v Speaker 4>So he just has like,</v>

2431
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2432
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2433
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:47.190
<v Speaker 4>just swarming the Internet was spam and bullshit and then infecting your Twitter</v>

2434
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.400
<v Speaker 4>and then tweeting from your Twitter and making you follow him.</v>

2435
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 4>So out of the hundred thousand people that were following him,</v>

2436
01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:54.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2437
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:57.490
<v Speaker 4>who knows how many of them voluntarily signed up for it?</v>

2438
01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Cause I know I fucking sure as fuck didn't nobody uses my Twitter except me.</v>

2439
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:01.881
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2440
01:06:01.881 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2441
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 4>no one even has the password except me.</v>

2442
01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:04.721
<v Speaker 4>No one's,</v>

2443
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:07.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an assistant that does that Shit,</v>

2444
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:07.690
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2445
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 4>So when I know who I follow,</v>

2446
01:06:09.371 --> 01:06:11.690
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't following that guy and he was the last one I followed.</v>

2447
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 4>So it was like a recent thing and I looked at it and I was like,</v>

2448
01:06:14.201 --> 01:06:15.550
<v Speaker 4>this is nuts man.</v>

2449
01:06:15.551 --> 01:06:16.210
<v Speaker 4>This is what,</v>

2450
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.230
<v Speaker 4>it's really nothing,</v>

2451
01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:17.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2452
01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:18.364
<v Speaker 4>cause it's isn't,</v>

2453
01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:19.100
<v Speaker 4>there's no point</v>

2454
01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:19.350
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2455
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:19.980
<v Speaker 3>It shows that,</v>

2456
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.820
<v Speaker 3>that somehow he got into something exerts you could be in your email,</v>

2457
01:06:22.821 --> 01:06:23.480
<v Speaker 3>you can be in your,</v>

2458
01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.690
<v Speaker 4>which just shows the vulnerability of at least Twitter.</v>

2459
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2460
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.561
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2461
01:06:27.561 --> 01:06:28.071
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2462
01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:30.950
<v Speaker 4>of course people have done that on Facebook and then a bunch of other things and</v>

2463
01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2464
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:32.480
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2465
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.180
<v Speaker 4>it's a common thing on the Internet to misrepresent who you are.</v>

2466
01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.373
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2467
01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:37.211
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2468
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:37.441
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2469
01:06:37.441 --> 01:06:38.274
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2470
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.051
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2471
01:06:39.051 --> 01:06:39.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2472
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.660
<v Speaker 4>when you have information online,</v>

2473
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:42.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2474
01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:45.860
<v Speaker 4>and then they're putting it on servers and people are going to be able to get</v>

2475
01:06:45.861 --> 01:06:45.981
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2476
01:06:45.981 --> 01:06:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2477
01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:46.700
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2478
01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.840
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to be able to get it.</v>

2479
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.480
<v Speaker 4>You have to assume that the ultimate,</v>

2480
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:55.160
<v Speaker 4>like the fight right now is everybody's trying to keep everybody else from</v>

2481
01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:56.930
<v Speaker 4>getting at their information,</v>

2482
01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:58.190
<v Speaker 4>getting out of their data,</v>

2483
01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.760
<v Speaker 4>getting it.</v>

2484
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.870
<v Speaker 4>But the real truth is eventually there's going to be no secrets.</v>

2485
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:05.140
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be the w.</v>

2486
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.180
<v Speaker 4>The idea of privacy is going to be out the window.</v>

2487
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:10.130
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to exist anymore.</v>

2488
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.930
<v Speaker 4>And essentially that's probably what's going to be the doom of the financial</v>

2489
01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:15.764
<v Speaker 4>system as well.</v>

2490
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:17.960
<v Speaker 4>It'll be impossible to hold onto money.</v>

2491
01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:19.213
<v Speaker 4>There'll be,</v>

2492
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:20.840
<v Speaker 4>it'll be impossible to,</v>

2493
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.340
<v Speaker 4>it won't make any sense.</v>

2494
01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:24.270
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's going to have to access to everybody else's money.</v>

2495
01:07:24.271 --> 01:07:24.471
<v Speaker 4>You're just,</v>

2496
01:07:24.471 --> 01:07:25.700
<v Speaker 4>cause we don't steal from each other.</v>

2497
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:25.940
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2498
01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like the interconnectivity will eventually reach some sort of a boiling</v>

2499
01:07:29.091 --> 01:07:30.470
<v Speaker 4>point when if you look at what's,</v>

2500
01:07:30.471 --> 01:07:32.600
<v Speaker 4>what's what people are capable of doing now,</v>

2501
01:07:32.601 --> 01:07:34.850
<v Speaker 4>it's stealing credit card numbers and you know,</v>

2502
01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:39.470
<v Speaker 4>and and essentially getting at the ones and Zeros that you'll use to get by and</v>

2503
01:07:39.471 --> 01:07:43.310
<v Speaker 4>those ones and Zeros are all tallied and scored online.</v>

2504
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Eventually people are going to get to a point where those don't mean anything.</v>

2505
01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.430
<v Speaker 4>They're going to get into those things and they're just gonna fuck the whole</v>

2506
01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:52.010
<v Speaker 4>system sideways and it won't be worth anything.</v>

2507
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Well I've had my credit card stolen numbers stolen twice,</v>

2509
01:07:56.401 --> 01:07:57.840
<v Speaker 3>three times since I've lived in La.</v>

2510
01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2511
01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:00.150
<v Speaker 3>I've had it stolen before to a gas station.</v>

2512
01:08:00.151 --> 01:08:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Gas Station.</v>

2513
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2514
01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.370
<v Speaker 3>And in waiters,</v>

2515
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.990
<v Speaker 3>waiters will have little readers.</v>

2516
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:05.550
<v Speaker 3>So when you pay for your bill,</v>

2517
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.140
<v Speaker 3>they'll come in and just like scan your thing in.</v>

2518
01:08:07.141 --> 01:08:09.150
<v Speaker 3>They're in their apron and then give it back to yeah.</v>

2519
01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:10.440
<v Speaker 3>That was a weird feeling when I got it.</v>

2520
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:10.811
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2521

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.520
<v Speaker 4>Are you buying $1,000 worth of chocolate?</v>

2523
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2524
01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 4>That was like what they would,</v>

2525
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:17.520
<v Speaker 4>they were buying shit.</v>

2526
01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I wish.</v>

2527
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Well they were buying things that they could sell,</v>

2528
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:21.380
<v Speaker 4>like they're buying.</v>

2529
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.950
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

2543
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:34.250

2544
01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 4>but I wasn't confident with my,</v>

2545
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:36.523
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2546
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:38.780
<v Speaker 4>that sounds just so standard.</v>

2547
01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.520
<v Speaker 4>So formulaic.</v>

2548
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to go with that one.</v>

2549
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:42.471
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this is our fucking big news.</v>

01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 4>All the experts,</v>

2557
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 4>a coalition of prominent BC police officer's health professionals,</v>

2561
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 4>It's really kind of nuts,</v>

2562
01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:00.284
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2563
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2564
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.240
<v Speaker 4>come on man.</v>

2565
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.170
<v Speaker 4>A coalition.</v>

2566
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:03.800
<v Speaker 4>Listen to that.</v>

2567
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Of police officers off of the roof.</v>

2568
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:08.723
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

2569
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:10.913
<v Speaker 4>why.</v>

2570
01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Why do we,</v>

2571
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.700
<v Speaker 4>why is gay associated with a list sometimes?</v>

2572
01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:15.110
<v Speaker 4>What does that cause it's usually have Cox,</v>

2573
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:16.123
<v Speaker 4>Cox in her mouth.</v>

2574
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.963
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

2575
01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.453
<v Speaker 4>Painful.</v>

2576
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.990
<v Speaker 4>But how come girls don't get sloppy when they're sucking Dick all the time?</v>

2577
01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:21.843
<v Speaker 4>They don't start Lisbon.</v>

2578
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.600
<v Speaker 4>If you'd imagine if that would like,</v>

2579
01:09:23.601 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 4>you found out that girls,</v>

2580
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.680
<v Speaker 4>like if you talked to girls like y'alls girls,</v>

2581
01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:27.561
<v Speaker 4>Lisbon like crazy.</v>

2582
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 4>She been sucking dicks all weekend.</v>

2583
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.470
<v Speaker 4>And when you suck decks,</v>

2584
01:09:30.471 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 4>like it feels good for the guy,</v>

2585
01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to lift.</v>

2586
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 4>You're going to make me laugh baby.</v>

2587
01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:35.781
<v Speaker 4>It feels so good though.</v>

2588
01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:36.171
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2589
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about that list.</v>

2590
01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

2591
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't turn you off from nine lift.</v>

2592
01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Has a lot of guys have fed,</v>

2593
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.490
<v Speaker 4>reminds them of all the of the Dick fell off packed.</v>

2594
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have a bank of dicks you can only suck a certain amount and then</v>

2595
01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:51.410
<v Speaker 4>your lips just give out and your tongue gets all sloppy and you produce extra</v>

2596
01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:55.040
<v Speaker 4>saliva and it not only do you list be spit on people dudes,</v>

2597
01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:55.671
<v Speaker 4>it's still want their dick.</v>

2598
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

2599
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't care baby.</v>

2600
01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't care because a new doctor and he's going to glean your drain,</v>

2601
01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 4>your salivary glands.</v>

2602
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.410
<v Speaker 4>The bad news is you got to drink water every 30 seconds,</v>

2603
01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:07.340
<v Speaker 4>but the good news is you won't this pending and their teeth are all nicely</v>

2604
01:10:07.341 --> 01:10:10.770
<v Speaker 4>polished just for the front being rubbed against somebody talks.</v>

2605
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:11.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2606
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.260
<v Speaker 4>they don't even really a brush.</v>

2607
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 4>It's Cox or and going and then pushing that all the food.</v>

2608
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:17.460
<v Speaker 4>You know that's how the head of the Dick has designed these,</v>

2609
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 4>you know the head of the Dick is designed to actually like the reason why your</v>

2610
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:24.380
<v Speaker 4>Dick is like pointing at the top and it has like that little bulging area that</v>

2611
01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:26.630
<v Speaker 4>like goes in and then the shaft comes out.</v>

2612
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:30.770
<v Speaker 4>It's cause it's designed to push down into the woman's vagina and squirt all the</v>

2613
01:10:30.771 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 4>sperm up and then pull the sperm out.</v>

2614
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.150
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's designed for.</v>

2615
01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:35.601
<v Speaker 4>If you like,</v>

2616
01:10:35.601 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 4>look at the way the head is,</v>

2617
01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:37.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2618
01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:41.540
<v Speaker 4>see the head is like sort of like a helmet with the idea is that the way it's</v>

2619
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:42.350
<v Speaker 4>shaped,</v>

2620
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 4>it would go in and whatever sperm was in there would actually get pressed up</v>

2621
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:50.630
<v Speaker 4>against the Dick and forced up to the top where it was stored on this lip and</v>

2622
01:10:50.631 --> 01:10:53.210
<v Speaker 4>then you would pull it out and then you shoot your own in there.</v>

2623
01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2624
01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:55.640
<v Speaker 4>What does,</v>

2625
01:10:55.770 --> 01:11:00.770
<v Speaker 4>the whole idea of breeding is designed under the idea that someone had already</v>

2626
01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:02.384
<v Speaker 4>fucked her first.</v>

2627
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:03.290
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

2628
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:07.580
<v Speaker 4>The whole design of the Dick is designed to just like,</v>

2629
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 4>we just get this,</v>

2630
01:11:08.571 --> 01:11:09.380
<v Speaker 4>get this out of the way.</v>

2631
01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.213
<v Speaker 4>Someone's fucked her.</v>

2632
01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2633
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:12.650
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get that juice out and put your own in this,</v>

2634
01:11:12.651 --> 01:11:13.620
<v Speaker 4>the only one going have kids.</v>

2635
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Fucking amazing.</v>

2636
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.370
<v Speaker 4>It's really amazing when you stop and think about that.</v>

2637
01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:21.400
<v Speaker 4>There was a theory for a while but it was disproven where uh,</v>

2638
01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

2639
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.080
<v Speaker 4>they were thinking that a certain amount of sperm were attacks berm.</v>

2640
01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I love this idea.</v>

2641
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:29.550
<v Speaker 4>It was a great idea and I really wished it was evidence for it cause I would</v>

2642
01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:30.630
<v Speaker 4>have some material on it.</v>

2643
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:33.780
<v Speaker 4>I could almost like ignore it just to do a bid on it but fuck,</v>

2644
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

2645
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.123
<v Speaker 4>it's not true.</v>

2646
01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

2647
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 4>and what they were saying was that a certain amount of sperm were actually</v>

2648
01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 4>designed just to go in and attack and kill other sperm.</v>

2649
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:46.350
<v Speaker 4>But it was like this one guy who had this theory and apparently a lot of other</v>

2650
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:46.831
<v Speaker 4>people are like,</v>

2651
01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:47.940
<v Speaker 4>where's the fucking evidence for it?</v>

2652
01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 4>It's like this is nuts.</v>

2653
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.270
<v Speaker 4>This is like how do you,</v>

2654
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:52.680
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

2655
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:52.900
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2656
01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.270
<v Speaker 4>What are they killing each other with?</v>

2657
01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.200
<v Speaker 4>They have bats,</v>

2658
01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:56.063
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2659
01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 4>he's killer scrub.</v>

2660
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:57.900
<v Speaker 4>They just fucking cells.</v>

2661
01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.070
<v Speaker 4>It just loads.</v>

2662
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Speaker 4>You know what he talking about?</v>

2663
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Loads that kill what bitch you reading some science fiction.</v>

2664
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.891
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2665
01:12:04.891 --> 01:12:05.630
<v Speaker 4>I love the idea though.</v>

2666
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite things to do.</v>

2667
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.150
<v Speaker 3>You ever take your ball skin and then wrap it around your boss and your Dick and</v>

2668
01:12:11.151 --> 01:12:12.890
<v Speaker 3>make a little like backwards bowling ball.</v>

2669
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever done that?</v>

2670
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:14.900
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite things to do.</v>

2671
01:12:14.901 --> 01:12:16.310
<v Speaker 3>You said so if someone says,</v>

2672
01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:17.563
<v Speaker 3>Hey Brian,</v>

2673
01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:17.991
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2674
01:12:17.991 --> 01:12:20.780
<v Speaker 3>would you like to do ride a race car one?</v>

2675
01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:21.970
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2676
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Like Dick Suck.</v>

2677
01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:26.180
<v Speaker 3>It freaks them out because they can't understand what's going on cause they</v>

2678
01:12:26.181 --> 01:12:27.350
<v Speaker 3>don't know balls that well.</v>

2679
01:12:27.351 --> 01:12:29.150
<v Speaker 3>And at that point they'll probably be like,</v>

2680
01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:30.170
<v Speaker 3>why am I here?</v>

2681
01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.000
<v Speaker 3>What have I done to deserve this guy in front of me pulling his ball skin over</v>

2682
01:12:35.001 --> 01:12:35.900
<v Speaker 3>his belly button?</v>

2683
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:36.980
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a lot of hair,</v>

2684
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:38.310
<v Speaker 3>they can't find the scene.</v>

2685
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.460
<v Speaker 4>Amazing</v>

2686
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.580
<v Speaker 4>backwards bullying Paul.</v>

2687
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.031
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2688
01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:45.900
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard of that man.</v>

2689
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.260
<v Speaker 4>Do it.</v>

2690
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:46.991
<v Speaker 4>To go back to this,</v>

2691
01:12:46.991 --> 01:12:47.281
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2692
01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:48.870
<v Speaker 4>this illegalized BC thing,</v>

2693
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:50.080
<v Speaker 4>one of the reason why they're,</v>

2694
01:12:50.081 --> 01:12:50.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2695
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:54.240
<v Speaker 4>thinking about legalizing marijuana is the results from Portugal apparently.</v>

2696
01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.800
<v Speaker 4>So Portugal,</v>

2697
01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.560
<v Speaker 4>they decriminalized all drugs,</v>

2698
01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:00.810
<v Speaker 4>drug use in 2001.</v>

2699
01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:05.250
<v Speaker 4>And the theory was that focusing on prevention and treatment rather than jailing</v>

2700
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:07.800
<v Speaker 4>users would be the most beneficial way.</v>

2701
01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:10.590
<v Speaker 4>So Portugal try decriminalization and,</v>

2702
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:10.711
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2703
01:13:10.711 --> 01:13:12.120
<v Speaker 4>the use of possession of heroin,</v>

2704
01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:12.661
<v Speaker 4>cocaine,</v>

2705
01:13:12.661 --> 01:13:13.141
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

2706
01:13:13.141 --> 01:13:15.360
<v Speaker 4>LSD and other illicit drugs.</v>

2707
01:13:15.361 --> 01:13:16.620
<v Speaker 4>All those were decriminalized.</v>

2708
01:13:16.621 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 4>And five years later they found that the number of street drug overdoses dropped</v>

2709
01:13:20.611 --> 01:13:22.680
<v Speaker 4>from 400 to two 90 annually.</v>

2710
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:27.950
<v Speaker 4>And the new number of HIV cases linked dropped from 1400 to about 400.</v>

2711
01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:31.110
<v Speaker 4>So a thousand less HIV cases and you know,</v>

2712
01:13:31.111 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 4>110 less,</v>

2713
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2714
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2715
01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.290
<v Speaker 4>drug overdoses.</v>

2716
01:13:34.291 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a lot man.</v>

2717
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:36.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2718
01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:38.700
<v Speaker 4>and the dealings drugs is still illegal.</v>

2719
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 4>You still can't deal it,</v>

2720
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.790
<v Speaker 4>but the users aren't jailed.</v>

2721
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 4>Instead they're putting in front of a panel that includes one lawyer or a judge</v>

2722
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:47.370
<v Speaker 4>and a health or a social services worker.</v>

2723
01:13:47.371 --> 01:13:49.710
<v Speaker 4>And the panel can recommend treatment and,</v>

2724
01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:52.080
<v Speaker 4>or a small fine or no sanction at all.</v>

2725
01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:53.040
<v Speaker 4>So it's based on,</v>

2726
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:53.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2727
01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:55.530
<v Speaker 4>what kind of an impact you're having on society.</v>

2728
01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:55.741
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2729
01:13:55.741 --> 01:13:55.830
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2730
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2731
01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:56.200
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2732
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:56.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2733
01:13:56.610 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 4>you do and drugs then breaking people's windows you'd do and drugs and shitting</v>

2734
01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:00.870
<v Speaker 4>in the street.</v>

2735
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Well they might find you for shitting in the street cause someone's got to clean</v>

2736
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:03.810
<v Speaker 4>that up.</v>

2737
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 4>But it's amazing that it's really,</v>

2738
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:05.521
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2739
01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:10.260
<v Speaker 4>it's shown that it's better to have these things legal and decriminalize and not</v>

2740
01:14:10.261 --> 01:14:11.500
<v Speaker 4>lock up the users.</v>

2741
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:13.560
<v Speaker 4>So Canada is looking at this and they're going,</v>

2742
01:14:13.561 --> 01:14:15.070
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck are we in?</v>

2743
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:15.671
<v Speaker 4>The reason why,</v>

2744
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 4>the number one reason why is America,</v>

2745
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:21.320
<v Speaker 4>America wants candidate to keep their fucking laws exactly the same way that</v>

2746
01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.330
<v Speaker 4>constantly been pushing,</v>

2747
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 4>putting pressure on them.</v>

2748
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just embarrassing.</v>

2749
01:14:24.401 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 4>It's getting to the point where it's embarrassing that marijuana,</v>

2750
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.850
<v Speaker 4>it's embarrassing.</v>

2751
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 4>It is embarrassing.</v>

2752
01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:29.261
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

2753
01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:30.011
<v Speaker 4>It's like no,</v>

2754
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:31.840
<v Speaker 4>no other end people.</v>

2755
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:33.000
<v Speaker 4>So it's just drug.</v>

2756
01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.540
<v Speaker 4>You know what he fucking drug him in.</v>

2757
01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:36.370
<v Speaker 4>You need a drug that's not even it.</v>

2758
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Even if I never wanted to do marijuana again for the rest of my life,</v>

2759
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 4>I would still say that you telling me I can't do it as the most ridiculous thing</v>

2760
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 4>I've ever heard in my life.</v>

2761
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you are living alone on an island and there was only four people on</v>

2762
01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 4>the island and one of them said,</v>

2763
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.780
<v Speaker 4>if you smoke weed,</v>

2764
01:14:49.781 --> 01:14:50.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to lock in jail.</v>

2765
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.940
<v Speaker 4>The other three would be like,</v>

2766
01:14:51.941 --> 01:14:53.410
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

2767
01:14:53.411 --> 01:14:53.621
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2768
01:14:53.621 --> 01:14:55.060
<v Speaker 4>we've got other shit to worry about.</v>

2769
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.870
<v Speaker 4>Why do you care if I want to sit on the island and get high once I do my chores?</v>

2770
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 4>What do you give a fuck if I'm productive members so well that that one person</v>

2771
01:15:02.591 --> 01:15:06.670
<v Speaker 4>at a four is just as ridiculous as what we've got going on right now.</v>

2772
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:09.880
<v Speaker 4>What we've got going on right now is some people and they're telling other</v>

2773
01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:12.190
<v Speaker 4>people what they can and can't do with their body.</v>

2774
01:15:12.191 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't hurt a God damn thing.</v>

2775
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.280
<v Speaker 4>And that's stupid.</v>

2776
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:17.770
<v Speaker 4>And at least Canada's figuring that out first.</v>

2777
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:20.890
<v Speaker 4>But they still deported that Mark Emery Guy,</v>

2778
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.061
<v Speaker 4>the poor fucking guy,</v>

2779
01:15:22.061 --> 01:15:25.810
<v Speaker 4>man was living free in his own country and he was selling seeds,</v>

2780
01:15:25.811 --> 01:15:27.550
<v Speaker 4>seeds to a goddamn plant.</v>

2781
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 4>That makes you silly.</v>

2782
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:29.291
<v Speaker 4>What are you going,</v>

2783
01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:29.831
<v Speaker 4>you got to go pee?</v>

2784
01:15:29.831 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to talk about myself.</v>

2785
01:15:30.761 --> 01:15:31.594
<v Speaker 4>This is ridiculous.</v>

2786
01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.670
<v Speaker 4>You fucking weak bladder bitch,</v>

2787
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:34.860
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

2788
01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2789
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 4>I will be playing the,</v>

2790
01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:36.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2791
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:38.770
<v Speaker 4>UFC drinking game this weekend,</v>

2792
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:39.971
<v Speaker 4>this weekend.</v>

2793
01:15:39.971 --> 01:15:40.161
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2794
01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:44.140
<v Speaker 4>the UFC is in Vegas and it's a Bj Penn versus Nick Diaz.</v>

2795
01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:45.573
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately,</v>

2796
01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.340
<v Speaker 4>George St Pierre was supposed to be fighting,</v>

2797
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:50.230
<v Speaker 4>was supposed to be fighting Carlos condit and fucking amazing fight,</v>

2798
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.880
<v Speaker 4>but it was really looking forward to,</v>

2799
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.791
<v Speaker 4>it was the whole car.</v>

2800
01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:53.441
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of crazy.</v>

2801
01:15:53.441 --> 01:15:54.274
<v Speaker 4>It started out,</v>

2802
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:55.090
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>

2803
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Nick Diaz was supposed to be fighting George Saint Pierre and Nick Diaz kind of</v>

2804
01:15:57.911 --> 01:16:01.120
<v Speaker 4>flaked at a few press conferences and then they pulled them out and said,</v>

2805
01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:01.361
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2806
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 4>Carlos Khan is now fighting GSP.</v>

2807
01:16:02.981 --> 01:16:03.641
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was like,</v>

2808
01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:04.474
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2809
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.650
<v Speaker 4>And then they said,</v>

2810
01:16:05.651 --> 01:16:06.071
<v Speaker 4>Nick Diaz,</v>

2811
01:16:06.071 --> 01:16:06.791
<v Speaker 4>you still want to fight,</v>

2812
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:08.440
<v Speaker 4>you got to fucking do press all this shit.</v>

2813
01:16:08.441 --> 01:16:08.741
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

2814
01:16:08.741 --> 01:16:09.041
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2815
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:09.401
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2816
01:16:09.401 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 4>you're fighting Bj Penn.</v>

2817
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:10.841
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's like,</v>

2818
01:16:10.841 --> 01:16:11.770
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2819
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:15.550
<v Speaker 4>Cause actually that made it even like that's pretty God damn exciting.</v>

2820
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.460
<v Speaker 4>It was supposed to be GSP versus um,</v>

2821
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2822
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.510
<v Speaker 4>be GSP versus condit,</v>

2823
01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:21.640
<v Speaker 4>which is an amazing fight.</v>

2824
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:23.600
<v Speaker 4>GSP versus Diaz Rather,</v>

2825
01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.610
<v Speaker 4>which is an amazing fight.</v>

2826
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.623
<v Speaker 4>And he got,</v>

2827
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2828
01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:28.360
<v Speaker 4>condit versus GM versus Bj Penn,</v>

2829
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 4>which is another amazing fight.</v>

2830
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 4>So they essentially just swapped and it was eagle then.</v>

2831
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately it was even rather,</v>

2832
01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:37.390
<v Speaker 4>but unfortunately GSP hurt his knee and he fell out.</v>

2833
01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:37.571
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2834
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:38.250
<v Speaker 4>I think he had a,</v>

2835
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 4>a strain or a strained MCL and uh,</v>

2836
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.960
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be a couple of months.</v>

2837
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:46.030
<v Speaker 4>It has to do rehab on it and shit and so really,</v>

2838
01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:46.841
<v Speaker 4>really big,</v>

2839
01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 4>big disappointment.</v>

2840
01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:50.560
<v Speaker 4>But the rest of the card is still fucking sick.</v>

2841
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:51.581
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>

2842
01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 4>a lot of good fights on this.</v>

2843
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Joey's coming down with me and um,</v>

2844
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Jamie Kilstein is coming up from New York.</v>

2845
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.100
<v Speaker 4>I was bringing his little brother should be fun.</v>

2846
01:17:00.101 --> 01:17:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking forward to it.</v>

2847
01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been to Vegas in a long time either.</v>

2848
01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:03.230
<v Speaker 4>It's been a while.</v>

2849
01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:03.640
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to,</v>

2850
01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.400
<v Speaker 4>to a Halloween party with that South Park.</v>

2851
01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh Oh real.</v>

2852
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 4>The people that work for south park or throwing a party and</v>

2853
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to go as it cause everyone that goes there.</v>

2854
01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 3>I went last year and the year before and every time they go there,</v>

2855
01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2856
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.420
<v Speaker 3>everyone goes overboard.</v>

2857
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone's like spending months on their costumes.</v>

2858
01:17:19.881 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 3>You know you should be the exploding desk squad cat,</v>

2859
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:23.601
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2860
01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:24.330
<v Speaker 3>but what am I going?</v>

2861
01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Where am I going to get that and get a cat outfit and some fucking fix that good</v>

2862
01:17:28.081 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

2863
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Strap yourself together.</v>

2864
01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:29.901
<v Speaker 3>Get a watch.</v>

2865
01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Like a flavor flav clock.</v>

2866
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:31.951
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2867
01:17:31.951 --> 01:17:32.571
<v Speaker 3>that's a good idea.</v>

2868
01:17:32.571 --> 01:17:33.201
<v Speaker 3>We started with a thought,</v>

2869
01:17:33.201 --> 01:17:34.530
<v Speaker 3>don't go with a Hitler mustache.</v>

2870
01:17:34.531 --> 01:17:35.950
<v Speaker 3>She got to get rid of iTunes.</v>

2871
01:17:35.970 --> 01:17:37.040
<v Speaker 3>Where you should take that off the,</v>

2872
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:37.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2873
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:38.551
<v Speaker 3>just take that off anyway.</v>

2874
01:17:38.551 --> 01:17:39.384
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid.</v>

2875
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.711
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2876
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Given that stupid cat a Hitler,</v>

2877
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Hitler's chaplain.</v>

2878
01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Chaplain.</v>

2879
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:47.110
<v Speaker 3>It's Hitler because Hitler is after chaplain every everyone else.</v>

2880
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a mental test to see if you're a Hitler chaplain and it just to see your</v>

2881
01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:51.200
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

2882
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a personality test.</v>

2883
01:17:52.161 --> 01:17:52.591
<v Speaker 3>Have a little,</v>

2884
01:17:52.591 --> 01:17:55.100
<v Speaker 3>or it could be Michael Jordan because he pulled it exactly.</v>

2885
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.910
<v Speaker 3>It's to Jordan,</v>

2886
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:57.850
<v Speaker 3>but that's a goofy move on Michael Jordan.</v>

2887
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:58.820
<v Speaker 3>How big is his ego?</v>

2888
01:17:59.130 --> 01:17:59.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2889
01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.573
<v Speaker 3>Hitler mustache.</v>

2890
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.410
<v Speaker 3>I got the Kingsborough cat too,</v>

2891
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2892
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I got the kick ass girl costume,</v>

2893
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:07.061
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>

2894
01:18:07.061 --> 01:18:10.490
<v Speaker 3>it's too tight because it's a girl's extra large girl,</v>

2895
01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 3>but that's only like a 32 waist,</v>

2896
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.420
<v Speaker 3>like gut hangs out of it.</v>

2897
01:18:14.421 --> 01:18:14.810
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

2898
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.160
<v Speaker 3>It's actually pretty funny looking.</v>

2899
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:19.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I want to embarrass myself because that's embarrassing.</v>

2900
01:18:19.281 --> 01:18:23.030
<v Speaker 3>You know when you have like a super tight and you're dressed up as a girl at the</v>

2901
01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:23.570
<v Speaker 3>same time,</v>

2902
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:24.560
<v Speaker 3>well you're supposed to be funny,</v>

2903
01:18:24.561 --> 01:18:25.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2904
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.180
<v Speaker 3>I guess you gotta be careful though.</v>

2905
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:26.540
<v Speaker 3>You're going to,</v>

2906
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 3>are you going to hang out with your girl?</v>

2907
01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2908
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.140
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be too humiliating.</v>

2909
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2910
01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.690
<v Speaker 3>So the other thing is she's going to go is when would be cool,</v>

2911
01:18:32.691 --> 01:18:33.141
<v Speaker 3>sexy,</v>

2912
01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:33.500
<v Speaker 3>windy,</v>

2913
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 3>sexy Wendy from the hamburger place.</v>

2914
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2915
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be,</v>

2916
01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Zombie.</v>

2917
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.231
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2918
01:18:37.231 --> 01:18:37.650
<v Speaker 3>he's dead.</v>

2919
01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2920
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:39.860
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say she goes a cow with a bullet hole.</v>

2921
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2922
01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Can do that too.</v>

2923
01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I was going to be Dave Thomas,</v>

2924
01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's like decaying.</v>

2925
01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:45.230
<v Speaker 3>He still has a little tie on and stuff,</v>

2926
01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to shave your beard.</v>

2927
01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.173
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2928
01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.440
<v Speaker 3>It won't take two weeks,</v>

2929
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:49.573
<v Speaker 3>two weeks to go back.</v>

2930
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 3>That's not a bad one.</v>

2931
01:18:51.171 --> 01:18:53.210
<v Speaker 3>If she got a theme thing going on,</v>

2932
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:53.811
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>

2933
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:55.330
<v Speaker 3>you've kind of be in the Beta to your,</v>

2934
01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 3>your chick's lead,</v>

2935
01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:56.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2936
01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:57.950
<v Speaker 3>you're following her lead.</v>

2937
01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:58.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2938
01:18:58.761 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe it could be a wolf that,</v>

2939
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 3>that the big bad wolf that catches Wendy in the woods.</v>

2940
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:04.063
<v Speaker 3>Or it could be Ronald,</v>

2941
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:08.150
<v Speaker 3>you'd be aware of wolf catches her on the way home.</v>

2942
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Is there a bringing bonds back and just give her the Dick in the bushes?</v>

2943
01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Is there a tee?</v>

2944
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said that there's a TV show from the 80s.</v>

2945
01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I was about werewolves that Joe Rogan was a character in,</v>

2946
01:19:17.231 --> 01:19:18.064
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

2947
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:19.570
<v Speaker 3>the name Joe Rogan was a character.</v>

2948
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2949
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

2950
01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2951
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Probably some nonsense from Wikipedia.</v>

2952
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:24.411
<v Speaker 3>I didn't check.</v>

2953
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:25.880
<v Speaker 3>So they had a god damn,</v>

2954
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:26.121
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2955
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:26.901
<v Speaker 3>some website.</v>

2956
01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I won't even give them the dignity of naming the website.</v>

2957
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Had a list of a werewolf movies,</v>

2958
01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 3>the best werewolf movies ever.</v>

2959
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:35.480
<v Speaker 3>My God.</v>

2960
01:19:35.481 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Is it a piece of shit list?</v>

2961
01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:38.361
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2962
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:39.410
<v Speaker 3>they had this,</v>

2963
01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.820
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have the howling on,</v>

2964
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 3>which is a goddamn Travis to,</v>

2965
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:44.330
<v Speaker 3>you got to have the howling if you're going to have werewolf movies.</v>

2966
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.530
<v Speaker 3>There's really only two.</v>

2967
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.750
<v Speaker 3>There's American Werewolf in London and the howling,</v>

2968
01:19:47.751 --> 01:19:48.770
<v Speaker 3>those are the only two good ones.</v>

2969
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:51.110
<v Speaker 3>American Werewolf in London being far superior.</v>

2970
01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.450
<v Speaker 3>That's the greatest werewolf movie of all time for sure.</v>

2971
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.670
<v Speaker 3>But they have like ginger snaps,</v>

2972
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.631
<v Speaker 3>which I saw,</v>

2973
01:19:56.631 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 3>which was the werewolf was so bad.</v>

2974
01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:03.860
<v Speaker 3>It looked like someone drew a scary face on a balloon werewolf.</v>

2975
01:20:03.861 --> 01:20:08.240
<v Speaker 3>A TV series for the 1987 to 1988 the character's name was Alamo Joe Rogan.</v>

2976
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:08.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2977
01:20:08.581 --> 01:20:09.660
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

2978
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>That is weird man.</v>

2979
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't Alamo Joe Rogan a fucking baseball player.</v>

2980
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that like a famous black baseball player or there was like no rocket Joe</v>

2981
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Rogan or some point that Joe Rogan.</v>

2982
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan baseball player.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was in the Negro League.</v>

2999
01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

3000
01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>See the resemblance.</v>

3001
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like me.</v>

3002
01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.130
<v Speaker 1>She just,</v>

3003
01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 1>we just had a failure.</v>

3004
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:56.810
<v Speaker 1>We have a mic,</v>

3005
01:20:56.811 --> 01:20:59.470
<v Speaker 1>arm failure and choked down.</v>

3006
01:20:59.500 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

3007

3009
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It just gave up.</v>

3010
01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.000
<v Speaker 1>We don't use the best components here at the Joe Rogan experience podcast.</v>

3011
01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.920

01:21:52.861 --> 01:21:53.151
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3046
01:21:53.151 --> 01:21:53.984
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

3047
01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:54.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3048
01:21:54.781 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 3>I got to get some better mind.</v>

3049
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:56.514
<v Speaker 3>Go arms.</v>

3050
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.141
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>

3051
01:21:57.141 --> 01:21:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I liked the old ones.</v>

3052
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:58.710
<v Speaker 3>We had better actually.</v>

3053
01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching the guests use it.</v>

3054
01:22:00.091 --> 01:22:01.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not an arm,</v>

3055
01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:02.850
<v Speaker 3>it's just kind of like a pacing.</v>

3056
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:03.703
<v Speaker 3>That noise.</v>

3057
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3058
01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the best way is really to have them stationary and you just make the guy come up</v>

3059
01:22:08.661 --> 01:22:09.320
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

3060
01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3061
01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:10.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3062
01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Corolla has it set up where he's got,</v>

3063
01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:14.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3064
01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.730
<v Speaker 1>a straight arm and it's screwed into the table.</v>

3065
01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:17.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a straight arm.</v>

3066
01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:18.620
<v Speaker 1>You can move it left or right,</v>

3067
01:22:18.621 --> 01:22:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but that's it.</v>

3068
01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3069
01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.301
<v Speaker 1>That's really the best.</v>

3070
01:22:20.301 --> 01:22:20.531
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

3071
01:22:20.531 --> 01:22:21.740
<v Speaker 1>this fucking thing is moving around.</v>

3072
01:22:21.741 --> 01:22:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Too much content on it.</v>

3073
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:24.463
<v Speaker 1>But it's back.</v>

3074
01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:28.560
<v Speaker 1>But this seems so cool to have this mechanical arm it cause it seems like we're</v>

3075
01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.413
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>

3076

<v Speaker 1>If you eat healthy,</v>

3128
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.480
<v Speaker 1>take care of yourself,</v>

3129
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a better life.</v>

3130
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:52.320
<v Speaker 1>But Theresa is always a big guy and he also had a lot of health problems too.</v>

3131
01:23:52.321 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 1>He had diabetes,</v>

3132
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.150
<v Speaker 1>which is just fucking,</v>

3133
01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.440
<v Speaker 1>just a huge drag,</v>

3134
01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:57.251
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3135
01:23:57.251 --> 01:23:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

3136
01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what contributes to a stroke that could have easily contributed to</v>

3137
01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:02.531
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3138
01:24:02.531 --> 01:24:04.480
<v Speaker 1>And some people that are real healthy get die,</v>

3139
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:05.411
<v Speaker 1>get strokes.</v>

3140
01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:05.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3141
01:24:05.621 --> 01:24:06.100
<v Speaker 1>strokes.</v>

3142
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Father had a stroke when he was 67 he smoked every day and I struck at 67 and</v>

3143
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:14.110
<v Speaker 1>then he had like a couple heart attacks 10 years later.</v>

3144
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:18.550
<v Speaker 1>But the stroke made him be like eight normal guy to being with a cane.</v>

3145
01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.061
<v Speaker 1>He had to learn,</v>

3146
01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:20.530
<v Speaker 1>relearn how to walk again.</v>

3147
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I nanny ever since he had that stroke was pretty miserable.</v>

3148
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:27.220
<v Speaker 1>That's all I remember him being just bored and miserable.</v>

3149
01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Well I would imagine,</v>

3150
01:24:28.601 --> 01:24:28.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3151
01:24:28.841 --> 01:24:30.520
<v Speaker 1>your shell becomes a prison,</v>

3152
01:24:30.521 --> 01:24:30.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3153
01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:31.211
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

3154
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't fucking get around.</v>

3155
01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.280
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3156
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a drag man.</v>

3157
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:36.390
<v Speaker 1>But there you are smoking,</v>

3158
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.150
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

3159
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:37.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3160
01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.990
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm more concerned about is my mom's been getting crazy.</v>

3161
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.350
<v Speaker 1>My mom gets moles removed all the time cause they're cancerous moles.</v>

3162
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

3163
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:46.090
<v Speaker 1>And they found one the other day and they're like,</v>

3164
01:24:46.091 --> 01:24:47.110
<v Speaker 1>this is really bad.</v>

3165
01:24:47.111 --> 01:24:47.650
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

3166
01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:49.360
<v Speaker 1>we caught it early but this is like,</v>

3167
01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:53.920
<v Speaker 1>this is cancerous and it's like near your or spine or something weird like that.</v>

3168
01:24:53.921 --> 01:24:54.754
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3169
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.140
<v Speaker 1>and the crazy thing is,</v>

3170
01:24:56.141 --> 01:24:56.411
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3171
01:24:56.411 --> 01:24:56.740
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3172
01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:56.981
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3173
01:24:56.981 --> 01:24:58.160
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna schedule you,</v>

3174
01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:58.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3175
01:24:58.421 --> 01:24:59.980
<v Speaker 1>December 14th to take it out.</v>

3176
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:00.311
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3177
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:00.791
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

3178
01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you just said it was cancer.</v>

3179
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't you get that out?</v>

3180
01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Like now?</v>

3181
01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Like who cares if it's a slow growing cancer immediately,</v>

3182
01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:11.590
<v Speaker 1>especially because you know you have cancer now you're freaking out.</v>

3183
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if that's going to accelerate the growth of the thing.</v>

3184
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably a scheduling issue that probably,</v>

3185
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:19.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3186
01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.370
<v Speaker 1>an insurance issue and a bunch of other different things.</v>

3187
01:25:21.371 --> 01:25:22.080
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3188
01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:22.421
<v Speaker 1>a better,</v>

3189
01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:23.171
<v Speaker 1>she had a lot of money,</v>

3190
01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:24.340
<v Speaker 1>they'd probably get around immediately.</v>

3191
01:25:24.730 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And my sister,</v>

3192
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:27.520
<v Speaker 1>it's just got some moles removed for cancer and,</v>

3193
01:25:27.521 --> 01:25:28.271
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm like,</v>

3194
01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:28.541
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3195
01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been to the doctor ever.</v>

3196
01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:31.024
<v Speaker 1>And I got,</v>

3197
01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:32.441
<v Speaker 1>I shave.</v>

3198
01:25:32.441 --> 01:25:32.861
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3199
01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:33.181
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3200
01:25:33.181 --> 01:25:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I you just go all the time.</v>

3201
01:25:35.011 --> 01:25:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3202
01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.153
<v Speaker 1>I hate doctors.</v>

3203
01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a family doctor anymore.</v>

3204
01:25:38.261 --> 01:25:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Our family dentist,</v>

3205
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with like the same doctor my whole life and then I just moved away and</v>

3206
01:25:43.151 --> 01:25:44.800
<v Speaker 1>now I just go to like urgent cares,</v>

3207
01:25:44.801 --> 01:25:45.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3208
01:25:45.011 --> 01:25:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have a relationship with a doctor and too old for that.</v>

3209
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Now when are you going back to Ohio again?</v>

3210
01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is UFC coming here to hemo.</v>

3213
01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:54.611
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

3214
01:25:54.611 --> 01:25:55.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3215
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.140
<v Speaker 1>schedule it,</v>

3216
01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:56.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3217
01:25:56.501 --> 01:25:57.350
<v Speaker 1>and the next time he done.</v>

3218
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:58.303
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3219
01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Since you liked the guy,</v>

3220
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're gonna to go here.</v>

3221
01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:02.141
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3222
01:26:02.141 --> 01:26:02.861
<v Speaker 1>I noticed also,</v>

3223
01:26:02.861 --> 01:26:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this always on Thompson as podcasts.</v>

3224
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:05.280
<v Speaker 1>We always talk,</v>

3225
01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 1>have a dental update every week.</v>

3226
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:07.390
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

3227
01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that dentists out here also seem more like car car salesman.</v>

3228
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

3229
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 1>they're automatically trying to get you to upgrade things when he'd go there.</v>

3230
01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Like the other day I went to the dentist and they,</v>

3231
01:26:16.921 --> 01:26:17.754
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3232
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.910
<v Speaker 1>they charged me for a fluoride treatment.</v>

3233
01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:20.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3234
01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to cleaning.</v>

3235
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.460
<v Speaker 1>What's this fluoride treatment?</v>

3236
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:22.731
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

3237
01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:22.851
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3238
01:26:22.851 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 1>she didn't go through.</v>

3239
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:24.840
<v Speaker 1>That's extra.</v>

3240
01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.131

3241
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:25.731
<v Speaker 1>you can get it.</v>

3242
01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3243
01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:26.481
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3244
01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:28.610
<v Speaker 1>she just gave it to me and I didn't ask for a fluoride,</v>

3245
01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.670
<v Speaker 1>but they were trying to add things on like Monday,</v>

01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:59.203
<v Speaker 1>they're good.</v>

3272
01:26:59.240 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3273
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're all jacked.</v>

3274
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.233
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3275
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.890
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know.</v>

3276
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be like that old person with the wing.</v>

3277
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.273
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel,</v>

3278
01:27:06.730 --> 01:27:09.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't get extra teeth coming in and it gets spread out more.</v>

3279
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:11.600
<v Speaker 1>When a frank shamrock got braces,</v>

3280
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:15.140
<v Speaker 1>the former UFC champion and he needed braces,</v>

3281
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:17.720
<v Speaker 1>he had some weird dental thing going on where you had like double teeth.</v>

3282
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3283
01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:20.740
<v Speaker 1>You ever met people that have like teeth that grow over teeth.</v>

3284
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.540
<v Speaker 1>They're like a lot of weird shit going on.</v>

3285
01:27:22.541 --> 01:27:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3286
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:23.291
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

3287
01:27:23.291 --> 01:27:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that's about,</v>

3288
01:27:24.351 --> 01:27:25.630
<v Speaker 1>but he needed braces,</v>

3289
01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.541
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

3290
01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I understand like you don't want people to let go every time you smiled.</v>

3291
01:27:29.691 --> 01:27:31.310
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on as well?</v>

3292
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:32.481
<v Speaker 1>You know there's certain,</v>

3293
01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:32.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3294
01:27:32.691 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you start tweaking about extra teeth and shit starts fucking with your head.</v>

3295
01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:36.231
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3296
01:27:36.231 --> 01:27:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get rid of some of these goddamn teeth and fix my face.</v>

3297
01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:39.681
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

3298
01:27:39.681 --> 01:27:43.100
<v Speaker 1>But to just have a little bit of a crooked tooth here and they're like,</v>

3299
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.060
<v Speaker 1>come on bitch,</v>

3300
01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:44.893
<v Speaker 1>what are you worried about?</v>

3301
01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I never understood why there's like you see those older people or whatever that</v>

3302
01:27:47.781 --> 01:27:50.630
<v Speaker 1>has that one funky tooth that shoots out of their mouth and they were just like,</v>

3303
01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just at least get that polled?</v>

3304
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You know you're,</v>

3305
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.010
<v Speaker 1>you're just holding onto like,</v>

3306
01:27:55.011 --> 01:27:55.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3307
01:27:55.161 --> 01:27:58.160
<v Speaker 1>like bald people are holding onto that and the last amount of hair and trying to</v>

3308
01:27:58.161 --> 01:27:58.860
<v Speaker 1>comb it over,</v>

3309
01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.950
<v Speaker 1>move it around the circle with a fuck.</v>

3310
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:02.360
<v Speaker 1>If you get that shit,</v>

3311
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:02.920
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

3312
01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.580
<v Speaker 1>There's right writer took all his teeth out.</v>

3313
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

3314
01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 1>All of his teeth.</v>

3315
01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:07.971
<v Speaker 1>He just drank.</v>

3316
01:28:07.971 --> 01:28:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I think I've talked about this before.</v>

3317
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:10.640
<v Speaker 1>He always drinks like mountain dew.</v>

3318
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you drink like a 12 pack of mountain dew a day and his teeth were so bad he</v>

3319
01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:16.450
<v Speaker 1>never went to the dentist cause you're gonna you know,</v>

3320
01:28:16.451 --> 01:28:17.930
<v Speaker 1>whatever for whatever reason.</v>

3321
01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:18.621
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

3322
01:28:18.621 --> 01:28:18.801
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3323
01:28:18.801 --> 01:28:19.730
<v Speaker 1>all your teeth are fucked.</v>

3324
01:28:19.731 --> 01:28:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

3325
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:20.360
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3326
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 1>just pull them all.</v>

3327
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3328
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Pull them all.</v>

3329
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:24.950
<v Speaker 1>It would cause the food.</v>

3330
01:28:24.951 --> 01:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3331
01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.430
<v Speaker 1>he has fake teeth now like ventures,</v>

3332
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:29.320
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's like the,</v>

3333
01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 1>the cost to fix it all was impossible.</v>

3334
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

3335
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3336
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:35.390
<v Speaker 1>like $20,000 something like Oh my God.</v>

3337
01:28:35.391 --> 01:28:35.721
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3338
01:28:35.721 --> 01:28:38.810
<v Speaker 1>so he has like basically like the whole denture thing,</v>

3339
01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:41.720
<v Speaker 1>like a plastic gum and you stick it on with glue.</v>

3340
01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Like they have like the Polident shit.</v>

3341
01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:45.700
<v Speaker 1>You ever see those commercials were like,</v>

3342
01:28:45.701 --> 01:28:45.900
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3343
01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:50.050
<v Speaker 1>your dentures can stay even under water and they'd take a glass and they blew</v>

3344
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 1>the fucking fake teeth to it and they put it under water.</v>

3345
01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Drink your water and not worried about your two falling out.</v>

3346
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:58.640
<v Speaker 1>That's so dark man.</v>

3347
01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.181
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

3348
01:28:59.181 --> 01:29:01.200
<v Speaker 1>when you have your whole mouth full of fake teeth,</v>

3349
01:29:01.201 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 1>that's dark.</v>

3350
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3351
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who had no teeth.</v>

3352
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:04.960
<v Speaker 4>My friend Mal Vernon,</v>

3353
01:29:04.961 --> 01:29:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Tommy,</v>

3354
01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.180
<v Speaker 4>he had no fucking teeth for Vernon.</v>

3355
01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:08.270
<v Speaker 4>Tom Over at Tommy.</v>

3356
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:08.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3357
01:29:08.401 --> 01:29:10.430
<v Speaker 4>He was a pool hustler from white plains for,</v>

3358
01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.131
<v Speaker 4>for Mount Vernon.</v>

3359
01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:11.491
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3360
01:29:11.491 --> 01:29:14.210
<v Speaker 4>he used to come by executive billiards in white plains new year.</v>

3361
01:29:14.211 --> 01:29:15.900
<v Speaker 4>The a certain weird dog and the need,</v>

3362
01:29:15.901 --> 01:29:17.100
<v Speaker 4>you didn't them any teeth.</v>

3363
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:20.760
<v Speaker 4>He had no teeth when he wanted a good little Philemon Yoan.</v>

3364
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.890
<v Speaker 4>And what I do is I put it in the blender,</v>

3365
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 4>puts a Philemon yawn in the blender so that he could just fucking buzz it down</v>

3366
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:28.584
<v Speaker 4>and then eat it.</v>

3367
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like how I make my smoothie with Kale and shit.</v>

3368
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.370
<v Speaker 4>He would do that with steak.</v>

3369
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 4>He would buzz up steak in a blender and then eat them like this poor fuck he's</v>

3370
01:29:36.421 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 4>got no goddamn teeth.</v>

3371
01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:38.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3372
01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:39.120

3373
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 4>he had,</v>

3374
01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.690
<v Speaker 4>I met some crazy fucking people in my pool hall days,</v>

3375
01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.370
<v Speaker 4>but he was one of the craziest,</v>

3376
01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.630
<v Speaker 4>really nice guy.</v>

3377
01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Great Pool Player,</v>

3378
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 4>but terrible organizer of his life.</v>

3379
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:53.800
<v Speaker 4>And what he did was he would work for a taxi dispatch and a,</v>

3380
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 4>he would work like ridiculous,</v>

3381
01:29:55.861 --> 01:29:56.970
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous hours,</v>

3382
01:29:57.150 --> 01:30:00.120
<v Speaker 4>get enough money together and then go play pool with it.</v>

3383
01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:01.080
<v Speaker 4>And gamble is money.</v>

3384
01:30:01.081 --> 01:30:04.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean he has a guy that was probably only making a few hundred bucks a week.</v>

3385
01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:05.101
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3386
01:30:05.101 --> 01:30:05.641
<v Speaker 4>And he would,</v>

01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:06.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3389
01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:12.510

3390
01:30:12.511 --> 01:30:13.080
<v Speaker 4>lose,</v>

3391
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:17.130
<v Speaker 4>then he would go into debt with what's called a Shylock and want a Shylock is,</v>

3399
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:33.600
<v Speaker 4>he would go into debt with these guys,</v>

3406
01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 4>just disappear and then go right back into the hole again.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to come back and play some,</v>

3412
01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 4>show him how to fucking do it.</v>

3413
01:30:58.770 --> 01:30:58.951
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3414
01:30:58.951 --> 01:31:02.160
<v Speaker 4>they don't have good cue ball control and he would like tell you why he was</v>

3415
01:31:02.161 --> 01:31:03.470
<v Speaker 4>going to win and control.</v>

3416
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:04.321
<v Speaker 4>You knew,</v>

3417
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:06.270
<v Speaker 4>you knew the chances are that he's probably going to lose.</v>

3418
01:31:06.271 --> 01:31:08.610
<v Speaker 4>It was going to be the same fucking thing over and over again eventually.</v>

3419
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:09.361
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3420
01:31:09.361 --> 01:31:10.000
<v Speaker 4>it's like you,</v>

3421
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:10.231
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3422
01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:10.501
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3423
01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:11.670
<v Speaker 4>you're running,</v>

3424
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:12.691
<v Speaker 4>you're always,</v>

3425
01:31:12.691 --> 01:31:13.860
<v Speaker 4>always behind.</v>

3426
01:31:13.890 --> 01:31:14.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3427
01:31:14.201 --> 01:31:16.020
<v Speaker 4>the expression always behind the eight ball.</v>

3428
01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:18.270
<v Speaker 4>It just fucking can't quite catch a break.</v>

3429
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:20.760
<v Speaker 4>And I watched this guy and I learned a lot.</v>

3430
01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:21.360
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3431
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:24.540
<v Speaker 4>you learn a lot from people that are out of control in their life about what's</v>

3432
01:31:24.541 --> 01:31:25.141
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

3433
01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Like the justifications,</v>

3434
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:27.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3435
01:31:27.601 --> 01:31:31.500
<v Speaker 4>like when you see people addicted to gambling or addicted to anything,</v>

3436
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:32.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3437
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.341
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

3438
01:31:32.341 --> 01:31:36.480
<v Speaker 4>you can watch people with their control of life slips away.</v>

3439
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.830
<v Speaker 4>And it's fascinating to watch.</v>

3440
01:31:37.831 --> 01:31:38.664
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3441
01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.460
<v Speaker 4>I never been around gamblers until I started playing pool.</v>

3442
01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Do you know anybody that's a gambler?</v>

3443
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:48.060
<v Speaker 4>I know card players and it's kind of sad and depressing because it's all about</v>

3444
01:31:48.061 --> 01:31:48.570
<v Speaker 4>luck,</v>

3445
01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:49.021
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3446
01:31:49.021 --> 01:31:52.750
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes they're like on top of the game and then other times you,</v>

3447
01:31:52.751 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 4>you just see them like are suffering.</v>

3448
01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.720
<v Speaker 4>Like they're fucking selling shit and just,</v>

3449
01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.380
<v Speaker 4>well it's certainly not totally about luck,</v>

3450
01:31:58.381 --> 01:31:59.480
<v Speaker 4>but luck plays a in that.</v>

3451
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3452
01:32:00.191 --> 01:32:01.750
<v Speaker 4>for the most part it plays a part.</v>

3453
01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:02.620
<v Speaker 4>You definitely,</v>

3454
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.180
<v Speaker 4>when you have guys have equal skill,</v>

3455
01:32:04.210 --> 01:32:04.631
<v Speaker 4>then yeah,</v>

3456
01:32:04.631 --> 01:32:06.840
<v Speaker 4>luck certainly plays a part when the game was at uno,</v>

3457
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:07.683
<v Speaker 4>so it was mostly water</v>

3458
01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.010
<v Speaker 4>hooked on,</v>

3459
01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:10.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3460
01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3461
01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3462
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:16.780
<v Speaker 4>Because Ari is a pretty successful at poker and he does it through strategy and</v>

3463
01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:18.190
<v Speaker 4>his intellect and his discipline.</v>

3464
01:32:18.191 --> 01:32:18.391
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

3465
01:32:18.391 --> 01:32:19.330
<v Speaker 4>he's a good poker player,</v>

3466
01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:19.481
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3467
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:20.300
<v Speaker 4>He makes money.</v>

3468
01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.560
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of times where he's making way more money playing poker than he</v>

3469
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:24.550
<v Speaker 4>was doing comedy,</v>

3470
01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.610
<v Speaker 4>but I think that shit's kinda dried up to,</v>

3471
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.473
<v Speaker 4>I think it's hard.</v>

3472
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 4>The Internet apparently just festered infested with bots.</v>

3473
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:37.570
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy who was a on one of these a pool websites and he's a pretty</v>

3474
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 4>pretty knowledgeable dude and he was talking about how it's useless to play</v>

3475
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:45.970
<v Speaker 4>poker on these websites because they're all there.</v>

3476
01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

3477
01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:48.130
<v Speaker 4>when you get on a website,</v>

3478
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 4>you might be playing in a room with five people,</v>

3479
01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:53.130
<v Speaker 4>but two of them might be bots and that might,</v>

3480
01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:56.110
<v Speaker 4>they might be bots set forward by the,</v>

3481
01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:56.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3482
01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:57.101
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3483
01:32:57.101 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 4>the poker company and you can't beat them.</v>

3484
01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:00.551
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>

3485
01:33:00.551 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 4>they're computer programs.</v>

3486
01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 4>They're running,</v>

3487
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:03.190
<v Speaker 4>it's cheating,</v>

3488
01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:03.700
<v Speaker 4>you're cheating.</v>

3489
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:06.910
<v Speaker 4>And they're essentially running up the bents and making people bet more money</v>

3490
01:33:06.911 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 4>and Boston people.</v>

3491
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.951
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

3492
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:11.200
<v Speaker 4>maybe it could just be you and some of the guy who doesn't know how to play</v>

3493
01:33:11.201 --> 01:33:12.910
<v Speaker 4>poker and you could make some fucking money,</v>

3494
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.451
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

3495
01:33:13.451 --> 01:33:13.631
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3496
01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:14.464
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3497
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:14.921
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3498
01:33:14.921 --> 01:33:17.980
<v Speaker 4>It's you and some other guy who doesn't know how to play poker and bots.</v>

3499
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.070
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to win fucking crazy man.</v>

3500
01:33:21.071 --> 01:33:22.330
<v Speaker 4>When you hear about shit like that.</v>

3501
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:23.171
<v Speaker 4>And then those,</v>

3524
01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:56.350
<v Speaker 4>they ripped off online players to the tune of 444 million bucks.</v>

3525
01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.920
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:04.420
<v Speaker 4>well there were poker players there.</v>

3529
01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:05.320
<v Speaker 4>This is who started it,</v>

3530
01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.750
<v Speaker 4>the Department of Justice specifically named pros,</v>

3531
01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Howard Lederer and Chris Ferguson who were the founders of the site back in 2004</v>

3532
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:14.520
<v Speaker 4>in the scheme,</v>

3533
01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:14.681
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3534
01:34:14.681 --> 01:34:18.700
<v Speaker 4>the amount of poker pros who are involved with full tilt is hard to ignore.</v>

3535
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:20.890
<v Speaker 4>So they don't know really how many people were involved.</v>

3536
01:34:20.891 --> 01:34:21.970
<v Speaker 4>But these guys,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they just made mad loot stealing from people.</v>

3540
01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:29.050

<v Speaker 4>is like they're doing,</v>

3554
01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.440
<v Speaker 4>as they're cleaning up degenerates,</v>

3555
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:51.311
<v Speaker 4>they're cleaning up,</v>

3556
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:53.230
<v Speaker 4>degenerates and presenting them to the American public.</v>

3557
01:34:53.231 --> 01:34:54.220
<v Speaker 4>But these are degenerates.</v>

3558
01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Even if they're,</v>

3559
01:34:55.130 --> 01:34:57.530
<v Speaker 4>they're really rich and successful and at it,</v>

3560
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:58.790
<v Speaker 4>at their core,</v>

3561
01:34:58.940 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3562
01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:01.130
<v Speaker 4>most of them were degenerate gamblers.</v>

3563
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:01.780
<v Speaker 4>And those are,</v>

3564
01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 4>those people are crazy.</v>

3565
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:03.421
<v Speaker 4>Those people did not.</v>

3566
01:35:03.421 --> 01:35:03.801
<v Speaker 4>He Shit,</v>

3567
01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:04.340
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3568
01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:06.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain percentage of them that are off their fucking rocker.</v>

3569
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 4>That's why they've wound up as professional gamblers.</v>

3570
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:10.491
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3571
01:35:10.491 --> 01:35:10.671
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3572
01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:14.790
<v Speaker 4>they're junkies for adrenaline and craziness and their impulse people and are</v>

3573
01:35:14.791 --> 01:35:17.600
<v Speaker 4>people that are willing to take ridiculous chances.</v>

3574
01:35:17.601 --> 01:35:17.841
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3575
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:18.080
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3576
01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of nuttiness to the world of the professional gambler.</v>

3577
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I've never been a gambler.</v>

3578
01:35:22.311 --> 01:35:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I never had that in me at all.</v>

3579
01:35:23.721 --> 01:35:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

3580
01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't like making bets.</v>

3581
01:35:25.341 --> 01:35:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And once in a while in Vegas,</v>

3582
01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:26.781
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>

3583
01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll,</v>

3584
01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

3585
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:27.921
<v Speaker 3>I'll just,</v>

3586
01:35:27.921 --> 01:35:28.754
<v Speaker 3>cause I not,</v>

3587
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't get to do that ever unless I'm in Vegas.</v>

3588
01:35:31.671 --> 01:35:32.900
<v Speaker 3>So once in a while I would spend like,</v>

3589
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3590
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 3>like 100 bucks Max,</v>

3591
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:34.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3592
01:35:34.791 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 3>but not really.</v>

3593
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:37.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a scary,</v>

3594
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.280
<v Speaker 4>you never going to win.</v>

3595
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:38.770
<v Speaker 4>You mean what?</v>

3596
01:35:38.770 --> 01:35:40.100
<v Speaker 4>You went a little bit here and there,</v>

3597
01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:41.980
<v Speaker 4>but God damn you can lose a fuckload.</v>

3598
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3599
01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.780
<v Speaker 4>the pool players fuck themselves.</v>

3600
01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:45.740
<v Speaker 4>When it came to gambling,</v>

3601
01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:46.670
<v Speaker 4>they uh,</v>

3602
01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:51.030
<v Speaker 4>there was only one time that the casino put a line on a pool tournament.</v>

3603
01:35:51.031 --> 01:35:52.100
<v Speaker 4>It was the US Open.</v>

3604
01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:52.851
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3605
01:35:52.851 --> 01:35:56.480
<v Speaker 4>when a a casino puts a line on a pool tournament,</v>

3606
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:57.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3607
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 4>essentially they're saying this guy's the favorite.</v>

3608
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:00.380
<v Speaker 4>This guy's the big underdog.</v>

3609
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.760
<v Speaker 4>And the big underdog was like,</v>

3610
01:36:01.761 --> 01:36:01.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3611
01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.660
<v Speaker 4>40 to one or where the fuck it was was Mike Lebron and Mike Bronze.</v>

3612
01:36:05.661 --> 01:36:06.441
<v Speaker 4>A good player.</v>

3613
01:36:06.441 --> 01:36:09.620
<v Speaker 4>But he's not like the best players like Earl Strickland,</v>

3614
01:36:09.621 --> 01:36:10.341
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Archer,</v>

3615
01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:10.641
<v Speaker 4>those are,</v>

3616
01:36:10.641 --> 01:36:13.850
<v Speaker 4>those are the guys that everybody assumed were probably Mike Segal.</v>

3617
01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:14.481
<v Speaker 4>Those are the guys.</v>

3618
01:36:14.481 --> 01:36:17.120
<v Speaker 4>Everybody assumed we're going to get to the top buddy hall.</v>

3619
01:36:17.121 --> 01:36:18.260
<v Speaker 4>Those are like the real names.</v>

3620
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:18.621
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3621
01:36:18.621 --> 01:36:20.570
<v Speaker 4>they all dumped to this Michael Lebron guy.</v>

3622
01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:21.613
<v Speaker 4>They all went,</v>

3623
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:22.870
<v Speaker 4>they all went to the fucking,</v>

3624
01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.500
<v Speaker 4>the gambling booth.</v>

3625
01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:27.950
<v Speaker 4>They bet all their money on Michael Lebron to win.</v>

3626
01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.000
<v Speaker 4>And then everybody lost him.</v>

3627
01:36:29.001 --> 01:36:29.191
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

3628
01:36:29.191 --> 01:36:29.661
<v Speaker 4>Lebron,</v>

3629
01:36:29.661 --> 01:36:31.980
<v Speaker 4>and they all went cleaned up and then the,</v>

3630
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.823
<v Speaker 4>the casino was like,</v>

3631
01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:35.860
<v Speaker 4>you mother fuckers like you,</v>

3632
01:36:35.861 --> 01:36:36.694
<v Speaker 4>you fucking,</v>

3633
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:37.783
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3634
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:39.380
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3635
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.213
<v Speaker 4>what can they say?</v>

3636
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.741
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

3637
01:36:40.741 --> 01:36:40.911
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3638
01:36:40.911 --> 01:36:43.670
<v Speaker 4>you can't leave a cat in a room with a mouse and expect him not to kill it.</v>

3639
01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 4>It's just the way it is.</v>

3640
01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:45.431
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

3641
01:36:45.431 --> 01:36:46.430
<v Speaker 4>they're degenerates.</v>

3642
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:49.550
<v Speaker 4>The things you can help it to them first place,</v>

3643
01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:50.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3644
01:36:50.091 --> 01:36:51.890
<v Speaker 4>at a good pool tournament and Seton home.</v>

3645
01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.260
<v Speaker 4>Back then it might've been like seven grand.</v>

3646
01:36:54.261 --> 01:36:54.960
<v Speaker 4>It might've been like,</v>

3647
01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.020
<v Speaker 4>if it was a big tournament and my us open,</v>

3648
01:36:57.021 --> 01:36:58.580
<v Speaker 4>it's like 40 or 50 back.</v>

3649
01:36:58.630 --> 01:36:59.151
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

3650
01:36:59.151 --> 01:37:00.860
<v Speaker 4>If it was 20 or 30 whatever it was,</v>

3651
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:02.690
<v Speaker 4>$30,000 is a big score,</v>

3652
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:06.020
<v Speaker 4>but you're not short of winning.</v>

3653
01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:06.980
<v Speaker 4>If you're going up,</v>

3654
01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 4>you're playing a pool tournament.</v>

3655
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:09.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a double elimination tournament.</v>

3656
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.650
<v Speaker 4>You lose once to Johnny Archer and then another time to Earl Strickland.</v>

3657
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:13.310
<v Speaker 4>You're out.</v>

3658
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:15.410
<v Speaker 4>You can do that or you just put all your money.</v>

3659
01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:17.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm like Lebron and everybody gets together and say,</v>

3660
01:37:17.271 --> 01:37:18.290
<v Speaker 4>let's make a deal.</v>

3661
01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:19.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to button.</v>

3662
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I bet a dollar make 40 isn't hard to fucking figure out folks.</v>

3663
01:37:22.431 --> 01:37:23.264
<v Speaker 4>It's pull our money.</v>

3664
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.680
<v Speaker 4>We've got 1000 bucks,</v>

3665
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.540
<v Speaker 4>we're going to make $42,000 right now.</v>

3666
01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:27.440
<v Speaker 4>Split that shit up.</v>

3667
01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:27.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3668
01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.011
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3669
01:37:28.011 --> 01:37:29.120
<v Speaker 4>no drama whatsoever.</v>

3670
01:37:29.121 --> 01:37:29.930
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>

3671
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:32.210
<v Speaker 4>And so they all got together and everybody bet on this guy.</v>

3672
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:35.330
<v Speaker 4>And then the casinos never gambled on pool again.</v>

3673
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:35.740
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

3674
01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:35.910
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3675
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:36.860
<v Speaker 4>we're not stupid.</v>

3676
01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:37.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3677
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:38.750
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you can't,</v>

3678
01:37:38.751 --> 01:37:40.340
<v Speaker 4>it's not like basketball.</v>

3679
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like you know,</v>

3680
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:42.620
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of money and winning.</v>

3681
01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:43.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not like boxing.</v>

3682
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:46.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there's any fighters that are going to put money down on</v>

3683
01:37:46.821 --> 01:37:48.320
<v Speaker 4>themselves and then take a dive.</v>

3684
01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.590
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they would if it was the end of their career and they can be assured that</v>

3685
01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.610
<v Speaker 4>they can make a lot of money.</v>

3686
01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:57.940
<v Speaker 4>That was always a big speculation about Marvin because Marvin Hagler lost his</v>

3687
01:37:58.201 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 4>last fight to sugar ray Leonard,</v>

3688
01:37:59.641 --> 01:38:03.360
<v Speaker 4>where he was a big favorite to win that fight and it didn't look like the same.</v>

3689
01:38:03.361 --> 01:38:04.111
<v Speaker 4>Marvin Hagler.</v>

3690
01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:04.944
<v Speaker 4>It didn't look like,</v>

3691
01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 4>like when he got sugary against the ropes,</v>

3692
01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:08.210
<v Speaker 4>didn't look like it was really punishing them.</v>

3693
01:38:08.211 --> 01:38:09.930
<v Speaker 4>It didn't really look like he was trying to stop him.</v>

3694
01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:13.800
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like he knew that the fix was in and he was a part of it because</v>

3695
01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:14.850
<v Speaker 4>after it was over,</v>

3696
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:15.121
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3697
01:38:15.121 --> 01:38:15.630
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just,</v>

3698
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:15.841
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3699
01:38:15.841 --> 01:38:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Marvin Hagler is one of the greatest boxers of all time.</v>

3700
01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:18.481
<v Speaker 4>I'm not implying,</v>

3701
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going with the urban legend.</v>

3702
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.060
<v Speaker 4>After it was over,</v>

3703
01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.480
<v Speaker 4>he leaves and goes to Italy and makes movies.</v>

3704
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 4>He becomes an Italian movie star just leaves.</v>

3705
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.180
<v Speaker 4>So like if he made some sort of a deal with the mob</v>

3706
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:30.841
<v Speaker 6>and they're like,</v>

3707
01:38:30.841 --> 01:38:31.091
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

3708
01:38:31.091 --> 01:38:31.831
<v Speaker 6>this is what I'm gonna do.</v>

3709
01:38:31.831 --> 01:38:33.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to bet a lot of money on a sugar ray Leonard.</v>

3710
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.061
<v Speaker 6>You will knock,</v>

3711
01:38:34.061 --> 01:38:35.760
<v Speaker 6>knock 'em out and you leave them alone.</v>

3712
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.280
<v Speaker 6>The judges are in the bucket to going to make a lot of money.</v>

3713
01:38:38.281 --> 01:38:39.050
<v Speaker 6>Come to Italy.</v>

3714
01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:39.960
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] star.</v>

3715
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:43.380
<v Speaker 6>Fuck this box saying you want to be a movie star in Italy.</v>

3716
01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:44.730
<v Speaker 6>So they taught them Italian,</v>

3717
01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.990
<v Speaker 6>flew him out to Italy.</v>

3718
01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 6>He would give him a fucking movie star.</v>

3719
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:48.670
<v Speaker 4>It's that's those,</v>

3720
01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:49.280
<v Speaker 4>the urban,</v>

3721
01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.280
<v Speaker 4>that's the urban legend.</v>

3722
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:53.370
<v Speaker 4>The reality is one of the greatest boxers of all time.</v>

3723
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:54.204
<v Speaker 4>Marvin Hagler,</v>

3724
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.770
<v Speaker 4>huge Marvin Hagler Fan.</v>

3725
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.450
<v Speaker 4>He was a monster man.</v>

3726
01:38:57.451 --> 01:38:58.380
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

3727
01:38:58.590 --> 01:38:59.101
<v Speaker 4>I watched him,</v>

3728
01:38:59.101 --> 01:39:02.700
<v Speaker 4>he was training from a staff of ham show and they had him on the news cause he</v>

3729
01:39:02.701 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

3730
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.450
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

3731
01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 4>what he would do is on the Cape,</v>

3732
01:39:04.681 --> 01:39:05.790
<v Speaker 4>he would live on Cape Cod,</v>

3733
01:39:05.791 --> 01:39:07.650
<v Speaker 4>which is the ocean that nobody went to in the winter.</v>

3734
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:09.090
<v Speaker 4>God was fucking frigid,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3736
01:39:09.661 --> 01:39:13.500
<v Speaker 4>it's zero degrees and the waves would be crashing and the wind would be whipping</v>

3737
01:39:13.501 --> 01:39:15.120
<v Speaker 4>in the fucking windshield factor was like,</v>

3738
01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:18.750
<v Speaker 4>who knows how many fucking degrees below zero and this motherfucker would be</v>

3739
01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:20.940
<v Speaker 4>running on the beach screaming war.</v>

3740
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 4>You know Marvin Hagler like I remember watching it on TV when I was a little kid</v>

3741
01:39:24.601 --> 01:39:24.811
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

3742
01:39:24.811 --> 01:39:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.180
<v Speaker 4>look at this guy.</v>

3744
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.320
<v Speaker 4>Like that was in my mind,</v>

3745
01:39:28.321 --> 01:39:29.940
<v Speaker 4>like that's what a fighter could be.</v>

3746
01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Like.</v>

3747
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:34.590
<v Speaker 4>The scariest fighter would be a fighter that's doing everything correctly.</v>

3748
01:39:34.591 --> 01:39:36.240
<v Speaker 4>100% focus,</v>

3749
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.830
<v Speaker 4>100% dedicated,</v>

3750
01:39:37.831 --> 01:39:39.270

3751
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.920
<v Speaker 4>doesn't go anywhere near as kids,</v>

3752
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 4>locks himself in a fucking house on the beach and just works out every day and</v>

3753
01:39:45.961 --> 01:39:48.760
<v Speaker 4>runs on the beach and just wants to kill you and can't wait.</v>

3754
01:39:48.761 --> 01:39:52.290
<v Speaker 4>And it's counting the days down for he gets to punch you in the fucking face,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3797
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:50.140
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

3798
01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 4>when you got to practice kicking the shit out of each other and punching each</v>

3799
01:40:53.711 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 4>other and need each other in the face and Shit,</v>

3800
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:56.230
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3801
01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:57.063
<v Speaker 4>people get hurt.</v>

3802
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.341
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3803
01:40:57.341 --> 01:40:58.510
<v Speaker 4>you tweaked knees.</v>

3804
01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:58.871
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3805
01:40:58.871 --> 01:40:59.681
<v Speaker 4>even George Saint Pierre,</v>

3806
01:40:59.681 --> 01:41:03.580
<v Speaker 4>man George has never pulled out with a knee injury before.</v>

3807
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:03.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3808
01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.770
<v Speaker 4>I think he's hurt himself in the past.</v>

3809
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember him pulling out a fight cell because he was hurt.</v>

3810
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>

3811
01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:10.541
<v Speaker 4>I know he,</v>

3812
01:41:10.541 --> 01:41:10.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3813
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:11.140
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3814
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.860
<v Speaker 4>he has been injured like after he fought Tiago Alvarez.</v>

3815
01:41:14.861 --> 01:41:14.961
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3816
01:41:14.961 --> 01:41:18.340
<v Speaker 4>he was laid up for a while because he fucked as growing up in that fight.</v>

3817
01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:22.840
<v Speaker 4>But I can't remember other injuries where he had to pull out of a fight.</v>

3818
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I might be wrong though.</v>

3819
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.000
<v Speaker 4>So many guys do.</v>

3820
01:41:25.001 --> 01:41:27.040
<v Speaker 4>It's just no way around it man.</v>

3821
01:41:27.041 --> 01:41:28.360
<v Speaker 4>And I hate it.</v>

3822
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:30.490
<v Speaker 4>But it's a smart thing to do.</v>

3823
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.271
<v Speaker 4>You got to pull out,</v>

3824
01:41:31.271 --> 01:41:32.380
<v Speaker 4>you can't fight injured,</v>

3825
01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:33.630
<v Speaker 4>you know you fight injured,</v>

3826
01:41:33.631 --> 01:41:34.361
<v Speaker 4>you get fucked up,</v>

3827
01:41:34.361 --> 01:41:37.270
<v Speaker 4>you fight Carlos condit and you only got one wing do.</v>

3828
01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.350
<v Speaker 4>You might get jacked.</v>

3829
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.180
<v Speaker 4>That guy's a beast if you can barely,</v>

3830
01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.680
<v Speaker 4>you know you can't move right.</v>

3831
01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:42.580
<v Speaker 4>And if you get hurts,</v>

3832
01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:46.510
<v Speaker 4>if it gets hurt more like during the fight and you like try to dig in on it and</v>

3833
01:41:46.511 --> 01:41:47.560
<v Speaker 4>move a certain direction,</v>

3834
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:50.410
<v Speaker 4>maybe you can't move and you get hit with a kick you would've never got hit with</v>

3835
01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.960
<v Speaker 4>and then it's lights out and then your whole career changes.</v>

3836
01:41:52.961 --> 01:41:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Your whole life changes.</v>

3837
01:41:53.921 --> 01:41:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Like at that level of the game you can't do it.</v>

3838
01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:02.200
<v Speaker 4>But I seen dudes fight hurt before Mike [inaudible] was the biggest example.</v>

3839
01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.550
<v Speaker 4>He's a real tough guy.</v>

3840
01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:05.260
<v Speaker 4>And he came into the UFC once,</v>

3841
01:42:05.261 --> 01:42:10.261
<v Speaker 4>he fought a CBD Holloway and he came in with his whole leg taped up like a cast.</v>

3842
01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:11.860
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking nuts.</v>

3843
01:42:11.861 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 4>Like Soccer Raba style.</v>

3844
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever saw Sakuraba back in the old pride days?</v>

3845
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Sakharova was amazing fighter,</v>

3846
01:42:17.501 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 4>but his knees were fucked up.</v>

3847
01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 4>He just had been leg locked too many times and kick too many times.</v>

3848
01:42:23.411 --> 01:42:26.800
<v Speaker 4>They were just badly damaged so bad that he would get these,</v>

3849
01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:30.040
<v Speaker 4>his legs taped up before the fights and it was nuts.</v>

3850
01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:30.910
<v Speaker 4>It was like a mummy.</v>

3851
01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:35.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was like he was like from halfway down to is the the to his calf all</v>

3852
01:42:35.471 --> 01:42:38.350
<v Speaker 4>the way up to like a foot above his knee.</v>

3853
01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.520
<v Speaker 4>It was all taped up.</v>

3854
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:40.570
<v Speaker 4>It was like crazy.</v>

3855
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:43.600
<v Speaker 4>But he had to do that and he would like walk like an old man,</v>

3856
01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:44.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3857
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:46.480
<v Speaker 4>you had to do that and then you'd go in and kick you with that same leg.</v>

3858
01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:51.710
<v Speaker 4>Fucking he like stabilize his own knees with tape and raps because it was like</v>

3859
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:53.860
<v Speaker 4>old loose and fucked up.</v>

3860
01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:54.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3861
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 4>it was really one of the reasons why people loved him.</v>

3862
01:42:56.321 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 4>They knew he's all battered up and he was still going there and go fucking</v>

3863
01:42:58.871 --> 01:42:59.650
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

3864
01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 4>But it's really not smart.</v>

3865
01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:02.210
<v Speaker 4>It's really not smart to fight injury,</v>

3866
01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:02.400
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3867
01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.233
<v Speaker 4>And you're supposed to,</v>

3868
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.940
<v Speaker 4>if you like,</v>

3869
01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:05.410
<v Speaker 4>you look at a guy like George Saint Pierre,</v>

3870
01:43:05.411 --> 01:43:07.120
<v Speaker 4>he does everything perfectly.</v>

3871
01:43:07.121 --> 01:43:10.570
<v Speaker 4>It's very technical and he wants to always be able to,</v>

3872
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:11.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3873
01:43:11.141 --> 01:43:13.330
<v Speaker 4>avoid getting hit but hit the other guy.</v>

3874
01:43:13.331 --> 01:43:16.000
<v Speaker 4>He wants to always be able to utilize the right strategy.</v>

3875
01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:18.760
<v Speaker 4>And if you got a fucked up wheel man,</v>

3876
01:43:18.761 --> 01:43:20.240
<v Speaker 4>if your knee is jack,</v>

3877
01:43:20.241 --> 01:43:20.830
<v Speaker 4>that's like,</v>

3878
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:23.350
<v Speaker 4>that's a good percent of his whole game.</v>

3879
01:43:23.770 --> 01:43:27.430
<v Speaker 4>So game is about exploding on people and getting out of the way of people and</v>

3880
01:43:27.431 --> 01:43:30.790
<v Speaker 4>making sure people can't take them down and making sure he can take them down</v>

3881
01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:31.810
<v Speaker 4>and then kicking them.</v>

3882
01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3883
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.230
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3884
01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:35.290
<v Speaker 4>that's his whole game kicking and punching him and taking him down and like,</v>

3885
01:43:35.291 --> 01:43:36.610
<v Speaker 4>fuck you can't kick somebody.</v>

3886
01:43:36.611 --> 01:43:37.000
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

3887
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.110
<v Speaker 4>you can't run out of the way.</v>

3888
01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:38.680
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

3889
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.220
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3890
01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:41.290
<v Speaker 4>That's a terrifying thing for a fighter to have.</v>

3891
01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.670
<v Speaker 4>Only one need at works.</v>

3892
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:44.830
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking Dudee sport,</v>

3893
01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:45.430
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3894
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:48.970
<v Speaker 4>You take your body and you try to blast someone else's body with it.</v>

3895
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:50.930
<v Speaker 4>No thanks.</v>

3896
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3897
01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:52.253
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

3898
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 4>You get exhausted,</v>

3899
01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:55.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3900
01:43:55.641 --> 01:43:58.340
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's just trying to figure out the right way to do it and no one's</v>

3901
01:43:58.341 --> 01:43:59.990
<v Speaker 4>quite got it mastered yet.</v>

3902
01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:03.800
<v Speaker 4>They've only got it mastered against this level and we're always looking at the</v>

3903
01:44:03.801 --> 01:44:04.910
<v Speaker 4>next level coming up.</v>

3904
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:06.500
<v Speaker 4>Like even though Anderson Silva is,</v>

3905
01:44:06.501 --> 01:44:07.550
<v Speaker 4>no doubt about it,</v>

3906
01:44:07.551 --> 01:44:09.980
<v Speaker 4>the greatest fighter that ever walked the face of the earth,</v>

3907
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:11.690
<v Speaker 4>there's nobody that's ever been better.</v>

3908
01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:14.090
<v Speaker 4>No one has ever done the kind of shit that that guy does.</v>

3909
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:15.320
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you look at his fight,</v>

3910
01:44:15.321 --> 01:44:16.550
<v Speaker 4>his last fight that he had.</v>

3911
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:17.331
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

3912
01:44:17.331 --> 01:44:18.830
<v Speaker 4>you should know Cami is a beast.</v>

3913
01:44:18.831 --> 01:44:19.641
<v Speaker 4>He's a tough,</v>

3914
01:44:19.641 --> 01:44:20.810
<v Speaker 4>tough fucking guy.</v>

3915
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.360
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever handled him the way Anderson handled him.</v>

3916
01:44:23.361 --> 01:44:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Anderson is just on this complete total different new level.</v>

3917
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:29.960
<v Speaker 4>But to some people coming up,</v>

3918
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:30.500
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3919
01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.720
<v Speaker 4>they're coming up and they're,</v>

3920
01:44:31.721 --> 01:44:32.630
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be better.</v>

3921
01:44:32.690 --> 01:44:34.370
<v Speaker 4>There's the John Jones is of the world.</v>

3922
01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:34.971
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3923
01:44:34.971 --> 01:44:36.010
<v Speaker 4>you look at John Jones go,</v>

3924
01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:40.880
<v Speaker 4>what's John Jones going to be like when he's 30 John Johnson's like 23 years old</v>

3925
01:44:40.881 --> 01:44:41.420
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3926
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:46.420
<v Speaker 4>and he's way better at 23 then he was at 22 I met him at 22 he was good then.</v>

3927
01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.560
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking way better now.</v>

3928
01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.190
<v Speaker 4>What's going to be like and he's 25 what's eating?</v>

3929
01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Even like when he's 28 years old,</v>

3930
01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.340
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be a fucking comic book Superhero Dude.</v>

3931
01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:56.960
<v Speaker 4>He's just going to be doing shit to people.</v>

3932
01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.610
<v Speaker 4>You can't even believe some young guy,</v>

3933
01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:01.250
<v Speaker 4>people that are coming up that aren't that talented.</v>

3934
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:03.470
<v Speaker 4>People that have physical flaws,</v>

3935
01:45:03.471 --> 01:45:05.720
<v Speaker 4>people that have flaws and their game,</v>

3936
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.790
<v Speaker 4>he's just going to run through them.</v>

3937
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:09.290
<v Speaker 4>Just gonna run through them.</v>

3938
01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:10.640
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>

3939
01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:11.790
<v Speaker 4>when does the,</v>

3940
01:45:11.791 --> 01:45:13.820
<v Speaker 4>the two paths cross like the master,</v>

3941
01:45:13.821 --> 01:45:14.750
<v Speaker 4>like Anderson Silva,</v>

3942
01:45:14.751 --> 01:45:19.460
<v Speaker 4>who's a master at a certain few levels of the game and then this young kid</v>

3943
01:45:19.461 --> 01:45:22.400
<v Speaker 4>coming up who slowly mastering everything,</v>

3944
01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:22.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3945
01:45:22.881 --> 01:45:25.430
<v Speaker 4>comes from this completely different discipline of wrestling.</v>

3946
01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:25.971
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3947
01:45:25.971 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Anderson comes from this Moitai discipline.</v>

3948
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:28.341
<v Speaker 4>His,</v>

3949
01:45:28.341 --> 01:45:31.100
<v Speaker 4>his discipline is all about kicking you and punching and all of sudden there's</v>

3950
01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:33.230
<v Speaker 4>this wrestler who's kicking and punching you and he's like,</v>

3951
01:45:33.231 --> 01:45:33.830
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3952
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:35.000
<v Speaker 4>He can wrestle too.</v>

3953
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.790
<v Speaker 4>And he's developing this ridiculous kicking and punching game.</v>

3954
01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:39.110
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

3955
01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:40.250
<v Speaker 4>that's the next level.</v>

3956
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:42.110
<v Speaker 4>And then there's going to be someone after him,</v>

3957
01:45:42.111 --> 01:45:42.560
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3958
01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 4>There's to be some guy who does everything twice as fast as everybody else does</v>

3959
01:45:45.921 --> 01:45:46.310
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3960
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:47.510
<v Speaker 4>And he's coming up right now.</v>

3961
01:45:47.511 --> 01:45:48.820
<v Speaker 4>He's probably 10 years old right now.</v>

3962
01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:50.020
<v Speaker 4>And what's holding the pads for him?</v>

3963
01:45:50.021 --> 01:45:53.000
<v Speaker 4>It was probably more fighters now in training than there's ever been ever been</v>

3964
01:45:53.001 --> 01:45:53.834
<v Speaker 4>by far.</v>

3965
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.771
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

3966
01:45:54.771 --> 01:45:56.060
<v Speaker 4>the organizations are growing,</v>

3967
01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:56.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3968
01:45:56.361 --> 01:45:58.250
<v Speaker 4>people always say that the UFC is a,</v>

3969
01:45:58.251 --> 01:45:59.084
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3970
01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:00.081
<v Speaker 4>is a,</v>

3971
01:46:00.081 --> 01:46:00.950
<v Speaker 4>a monopoly,</v>

3972
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3973
01:46:01.461 --> 01:46:01.790
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

3974
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:02.010
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

3975
01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:06.710
<v Speaker 4>they're actually even being investigated by someone from federal,</v>

3976
01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:06.991
<v Speaker 4>federal,</v>

3977
01:46:06.991 --> 01:46:07.491
<v Speaker 4>cc,</v>

3978
01:46:07.491 --> 01:46:08.324
<v Speaker 4>federal trade,</v>

3979
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:10.340
<v Speaker 4>FTC federal trade commission,</v>

3980
01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:13.250
<v Speaker 4>and they're being investigated as being a monopoly,</v>

3981
01:46:13.251 --> 01:46:14.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a monopoly.</v>

3982
01:46:14.511 --> 01:46:15.860
<v Speaker 4>They just do it better than anybody else.</v>

3983
01:46:15.861 --> 01:46:16.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't,</v>

3984
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:19.340
<v Speaker 4>you can't say that Nascar is a monopoly,</v>

3985
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.320
<v Speaker 4>but if you wanted to say,</v>

3986
01:46:21.321 --> 01:46:21.501
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3987
01:46:21.501 --> 01:46:23.240
<v Speaker 4>let's start up our own fucking car league.</v>

3988
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:25.430
<v Speaker 4>You know we're going to just race cars all across the country.</v>

3989
01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.270
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to call it?</v>

3990
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:27.290
<v Speaker 4>The new car league.</v>

3991
01:46:27.370 --> 01:46:27.830
<v Speaker 4>Everybody like,</v>

3992
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:28.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's not Nascar,</v>

3993
01:46:28.610 --> 01:46:28.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3994
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3995
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:30.350
<v Speaker 4>Well now it's not.</v>

3996
01:46:30.351 --> 01:46:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Nascar has a monopoly.</v>

3997
01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.720
<v Speaker 4>Just they're the best at it.</v>

3998
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:34.550
<v Speaker 4>You could start your own car league if you want to.</v>

3999
01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.140
<v Speaker 4>That's the same thing with the UFC.</v>

4000
01:46:36.141 --> 01:46:37.340
<v Speaker 4>The UFC is not a monopoly.</v>

4001
01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:37.941
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4002
01:46:37.941 --> 01:46:40.610
<v Speaker 4>they just have the best fighters right now cause they have the most money and</v>

4003
01:46:40.611 --> 01:46:41.510
<v Speaker 4>the most popularity,</v>

4004
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:43.640
<v Speaker 4>but they built this shit up man.</v>

4005
01:46:43.641 --> 01:46:44.900
<v Speaker 4>If you want to do it by yourself,</v>

4006
01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.960
<v Speaker 4>do it by herself and Bella tours doing it by themselves.</v>

4007
01:46:48.170 --> 01:46:49.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a company called [inaudible].</v>

4008
01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:50.433
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking,</v>

4009
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 4>they've got some good fighters,</v>

4010
01:46:51.751 --> 01:46:52.290
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4011
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:54.000
<v Speaker 4>They've got a good show.</v>

4012
01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:56.430
<v Speaker 4>They got this Guy Jimmy Smith who does the commentary.</v>

4013
01:46:56.431 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 4>He's really good at it.</v>

4014
01:46:57.631 --> 01:46:59.070
<v Speaker 4>He's a black belt in Jujitsu,</v>

4015
01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:00.840
<v Speaker 4>knows what the fuck is going on.</v>

4016
01:47:00.841 --> 01:47:02.520
<v Speaker 4>He's gives excellent commentary there.</v>

4017
01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:03.121
<v Speaker 4>Color guys,</v>

4018
01:47:03.121 --> 01:47:03.840
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>

4019
01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.860
<v Speaker 4>They have a good show.</v>

4020
01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.610
<v Speaker 4>They do a different format where they have tournament's and they hold this</v>

4021
01:47:08.611 --> 01:47:11.790
<v Speaker 4>tournament and the tournament takes place over several weeks or several months</v>

4022
01:47:11.791 --> 01:47:12.270
<v Speaker 4>rather.</v>

4023
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:16.140
<v Speaker 4>And then they pick a guy who wins a tournament and he fights for the title and</v>

4024
01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4025
01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.140
<v Speaker 4>they do a fucking real good job man.</v>

4026
01:47:18.141 --> 01:47:20.820
<v Speaker 4>And they do a real good job with it and they just got bought out by Viacom.</v>

4027
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.670
<v Speaker 4>So it's not that the UFC is a monopoly,</v>

4028
01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:25.500
<v Speaker 4>there's other people in the game.</v>

4029
01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 4>They just been in the game longer.</v>

4030
01:47:26.971 --> 01:47:28.020
<v Speaker 4>They spent more money,</v>

4031
01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:29.370
<v Speaker 4>they invested more time,</v>

4032
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.353
<v Speaker 4>they do it better.</v>

4033
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.200
<v Speaker 4>It's that simple.</v>

4034
01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:31.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4035
01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:36.750
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's a certain amount of people that whenever you get to a certain</v>

4036
01:47:36.751 --> 01:47:37.710
<v Speaker 4>level of success,</v>

4037
01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:38.400
<v Speaker 4>they want to,</v>

4038
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.860
<v Speaker 4>they want to think that you did something wrong to get there.</v>

4039
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.660
<v Speaker 4>But if it wasn't for the UFC,</v>

4040
01:47:42.661 --> 01:47:43.050
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4041
01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:44.760
<v Speaker 4>nobody would have invested that kind of money.</v>

4042
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:45.271
<v Speaker 4>Eventually.</v>

4043
01:47:45.271 --> 01:47:50.271
<v Speaker 4>I think MMA would have slowly broken through to the mainstream over the course</v>

4044
01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:51.510
<v Speaker 4>of who knows how many years.</v>

4045
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Or it could have wound up like soccer where everybody thought it was going to</v>

4046
01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:56.191
<v Speaker 4>make it,</v>

4047
01:47:56.191 --> 01:47:56.611
<v Speaker 4>but it never,</v>

4048
01:47:56.611 --> 01:47:57.960
<v Speaker 4>did you remember?</v>

4049
01:47:58.220 --> 01:47:58.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4050
01:47:58.410 --> 01:47:59.670
<v Speaker 4>soccer when we were kids,</v>

4051
01:47:59.790 --> 01:48:00.840
<v Speaker 4>they're pushing soccer.</v>

4052
01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Like soccer is eventually going to be a big professional sport.</v>

4053
01:48:02.881 --> 01:48:03.714
<v Speaker 4>I remember that,</v>

4054
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:04.750
<v Speaker 4>but it never did.</v>

4055
01:48:04.751 --> 01:48:06.690
<v Speaker 4>It just never quite marketed it correctly.</v>

4056
01:48:06.691 --> 01:48:07.830
<v Speaker 4>It never quite got through.</v>

4057
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:09.143
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4058
01:48:09.670 --> 01:48:12.430
<v Speaker 4>and same with hockey for Columbus.</v>

4059
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:14.390
<v Speaker 4>He's still pretty good for Ohio at four I lived,</v>

4060
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 4>they tried to push hockey a lot.</v>

4061
01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:16.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4062
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:17.430
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty big for a while,</v>

4063
01:48:17.431 --> 01:48:18.330
<v Speaker 4>but now it's kind of like,</v>

4064
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:19.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's,</v>

4065
01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:20.610
<v Speaker 4>if someone smart,</v>

4066
01:48:20.850 --> 01:48:21.720
<v Speaker 4>if someone's got balls,</v>

4067
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:22.583
<v Speaker 4>listen to me right now.</v>

4068
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.453
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing.</v>

4069
01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:25.170
<v Speaker 4>K One kickboxing.</v>

4070
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Kickboxing is some of the most exciting shit to watch in the world.</v>

4071
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:33.300
<v Speaker 4>If you watch the highest level kickboxers God damn is that should exciting.</v>

4072
01:48:33.330 --> 01:48:35.640
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking fun to watch.</v>

4073
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:36.840
<v Speaker 4>They go at it,</v>

4074
01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:37.021
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4075
01:48:37.021 --> 01:48:38.310
<v Speaker 4>It's only three rounds.</v>

4076
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:40.080
<v Speaker 4>Even title fights are like three rounds.</v>

4077
01:48:40.081 --> 01:48:42.000
<v Speaker 4>They fucking go to a war man.</v>

4078
01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:42.810
<v Speaker 4>And those,</v>

4079
01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:44.160
<v Speaker 4>some of the fights are five rounds I think.</v>

4080
01:48:44.161 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 4>But either way they,</v>

4081
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:46.170
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

4082
01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:48.600
<v Speaker 4>they're fun and it's all striking,</v>

4083
01:48:48.601 --> 01:48:51.300
<v Speaker 4>which is what a lot of people like a lot of people don't like the wrestling</v>

4084
01:48:51.301 --> 01:48:52.530
<v Speaker 4>aspect of MMA.</v>

4085
01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I love it because I think it's the most realistic sport in the world.</v>

4086
01:48:55.621 --> 01:48:56.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is real fighting.</v>

4087
01:48:56.821 --> 01:49:00.390
<v Speaker 4>It's a sport of real fighting encompassing all the different techniques.</v>

4088
01:49:00.391 --> 01:49:02.040
<v Speaker 4>So to me it's more complicated.</v>

4089
01:49:02.041 --> 01:49:03.210
<v Speaker 4>It's more cerebral.</v>

4090
01:49:03.211 --> 01:49:05.730
<v Speaker 4>There's more strategy involved because there's more variables.</v>

4091
01:49:05.970 --> 01:49:06.181
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4092
01:49:06.181 --> 01:49:09.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm always going to be a huge fan of primarily of MMA.</v>

4093
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:11.460
<v Speaker 4>If I had one thing to watch it would be MMA,</v>

4094
01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:13.410
<v Speaker 4>but I love fucking kickboxing too.</v>

4095
01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:14.461
<v Speaker 4>I love watching it.</v>

4096
01:49:14.461 --> 01:49:17.790
<v Speaker 4>It's so much more exciting than regular boxing and we know how boxing is still</v>

4097
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:18.570
<v Speaker 4>doing well.</v>

4098
01:49:18.570 --> 01:49:20.520
<v Speaker 4>People still want to see a good boxing match.</v>

4099
01:49:20.521 --> 01:49:20.940
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4100
01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.380
<v Speaker 4>if Manny Pacquiao was fighting,</v>

4101
01:49:22.381 --> 01:49:24.990
<v Speaker 4>people are still going to pack in to see that guy light people up.</v>

4102
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:25.891
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

4103
01:49:25.891 --> 01:49:27.690
<v Speaker 4>if you watch some high level kickboxing,</v>

4104
01:49:27.691 --> 01:49:30.510
<v Speaker 4>boxing becomes boring because they can't kick,</v>

4105
01:49:30.511 --> 01:49:32.310
<v Speaker 4>they're not doing all this other crazy shit.</v>

4106
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:32.911
<v Speaker 4>You Watch.</v>

4107
01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Like I went to the um,</v>

4108
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 4>morning time professional league.</v>

4109
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:38.280
<v Speaker 4>They had a show at long beach and I went down and check that shit out.</v>

4110
01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:39.241
<v Speaker 4>God Damn,</v>

4111
01:49:39.241 --> 01:49:39.811
<v Speaker 4>it was fun,</v>

4112
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:40.051
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

4113
01:49:40.051 --> 01:49:43.980
<v Speaker 4>There was some of the best kickboxers in the world and just I was in the front</v>

4114
01:49:43.981 --> 01:49:45.600
<v Speaker 4>row and watching these guys go at it,</v>

4115
01:49:45.601 --> 01:49:46.040
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4116
01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Why Old Wild Shit?</v>

4117
01:49:48.101 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Because they don't have to worry about being taken down.</v>

4118
01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 4>There's no takedowns so they're just fucking t and off on each other.</v>

4119
01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:58.740
<v Speaker 4>Mad Wild head kick knockouts and spinning back fist knockouts and cotton people</v>

4120
01:49:59.081 --> 01:49:59.711
<v Speaker 4>with elbows.</v>

4121
01:49:59.711 --> 01:50:00.431
<v Speaker 4>It was nuts,</v>

4122
01:50:00.431 --> 01:50:01.030
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4123
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.391
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

4124
01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy sport.</v>

4125
01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:04.600
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe that.</v>

4126
01:50:04.601 --> 01:50:07.840
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't get the press that it deserves because like maybe it's not as good as</v>

4127
01:50:07.841 --> 01:50:08.590
<v Speaker 4>MMA,</v>

4128
01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:12.280
<v Speaker 4>but God damn if it ain't a close second and it's not being promoted,</v>

4129
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:13.203
<v Speaker 4>someone's,</v>

4130
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:15.970
<v Speaker 4>someone's completely dropped the ball,</v>

4131
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:16.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4132
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:19.300
<v Speaker 4>they owe the people own k one they owe a lot of money,</v>

4133
01:50:19.301 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4134
01:50:19.630 --> 01:50:20.860
<v Speaker 4>They want to start fights,</v>

4135
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:25.210
<v Speaker 4>but they want to not have to pay all the fighters that they owe money to and</v>

4136
01:50:25.211 --> 01:50:25.331
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4137
01:50:25.331 --> 01:50:25.720
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4138
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.290
<v Speaker 4>just fucking untold millions of dollars to fighters if they haven't paid.</v>

4139
01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.200
<v Speaker 4>So they're in a bad financial situation,</v>

4140
01:50:32.201 --> 01:50:33.460
<v Speaker 4>but it's because they're just,</v>

4141
01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:35.380
<v Speaker 4>they've didn't promote it correctly.</v>

4142
01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:37.000
<v Speaker 4>If somebody liked the UFC,</v>

4143
01:50:37.001 --> 01:50:37.571
<v Speaker 4>came along,</v>

4144
01:50:37.571 --> 01:50:39.850
<v Speaker 4>if zoo for came along and picked up k one,</v>

4145
01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:40.951
<v Speaker 4>they're not interested in it.</v>

4146
01:50:40.951 --> 01:50:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to them about it.</v>

4147
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:43.660
<v Speaker 4>But if someone like that did,</v>

4148
01:50:43.661 --> 01:50:46.270
<v Speaker 4>if Mark Cuban did or someone with balls and a lot of money,</v>

4149
01:50:46.271 --> 01:50:47.140
<v Speaker 4>who loves the sport?</v>

4150
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.981
<v Speaker 4>God Damn,</v>

4151
01:50:47.981 --> 01:50:48.814
<v Speaker 4>that's a gold mine.</v>

4152
01:50:48.850 --> 01:50:50.170
<v Speaker 4>It's a Goddamn gold mine.</v>

4153
01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:51.461
<v Speaker 4>Mark Cuban.</v>

4154
01:50:51.461 --> 01:50:51.881
<v Speaker 4>Go do it.</v>

4155
01:50:51.881 --> 01:50:53.560
<v Speaker 4>You already got Michael Chavela working for you.</v>

4156
01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:54.321
<v Speaker 4>Michael Chevelle,</v>

4157
01:50:54.321 --> 01:50:55.480
<v Speaker 4>the Australian guy and my buddy.</v>

4158
01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:56.860
<v Speaker 4>You've toned out.</v>

4159
01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:57.790
<v Speaker 4>You've completely zoned out.</v>

4160
01:50:57.791 --> 01:50:58.624
<v Speaker 4>Which talking about finding,</v>

4161
01:50:58.900 --> 01:50:59.321
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

4162
01:50:59.321 --> 01:50:59.831
<v Speaker 4>You're online.</v>

4163
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:00.790
<v Speaker 4>You're checking your Facebook.</v>

4164
01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:01.081
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4165
01:51:01.081 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at trying to find something on Monday to talk about,</v>

4166
01:51:03.570 --> 01:51:04.170
<v Speaker 3>but I can't find it.</v>

4167
01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:05.003
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>

4168
01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.053
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4169
01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:07.793
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4170
01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:09.293
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to talk about it.</v>

4171
01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:10.590
<v Speaker 3>You don't want it because I want to find it.</v>

4172
01:51:10.591 --> 01:51:12.300
<v Speaker 3>If I talk about it cause it's kind of pointless.</v>

4173
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:13.651
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4174

<v Speaker 4>why don't you help me tell me and I'll help you.</v>

4175
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4176
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:17.223

4177
01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:18.970
<v Speaker 3>something about the anonymous,</v>

4178

4180
01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.040
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:43.510
<v Speaker 4>the ice house podcast studios confirmed,</v>

4196
01:51:43.511 --> 01:51:43.790
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4197
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4198
01:51:44.210 --> 01:51:46.040
<v Speaker 3>I live in the next week or two.</v>

4199
01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.720
<v Speaker 3>So I'm leaving all deaf squad over there and then we're still going to do a</v>

4200
01:51:50.721 --> 01:51:53.060
<v Speaker 3>podcast tomorrow though with Duncan Trussell.</v>

4201
01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

4202
01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.350
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>

4203
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4204
01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:55.460
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

4205
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:59.270
<v Speaker 4>you're going to do a podcast from the ice house and are you going to have it set</v>

4206
01:51:59.271 --> 01:51:59.801
<v Speaker 4>up with Mike?</v>

4207
01:51:59.801 --> 01:52:00.980
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to do it like old school,</v>

4208
01:52:00.981 --> 01:52:03.870
<v Speaker 4>like we did hold still and then once we get the studio there,</v>

4209
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:06.470
<v Speaker 4>then we're probably going to make that a whole like night at the ice house or</v>

4210
01:52:06.471 --> 01:52:07.040
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

4211
01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:07.141
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4212
01:52:07.141 --> 01:52:08.990
<v Speaker 4>people were saying that the last one was good,</v>

4213
01:52:08.991 --> 01:52:10.910
<v Speaker 4>but it felt like I was pocket calling everybody.</v>

4214
01:52:10.911 --> 01:52:11.810
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what it was like.</v>

4215
01:52:11.811 --> 01:52:14.560
<v Speaker 4>It was like they're tuned into a conversation that you can barely hear.</v>

4216
01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:17.960
<v Speaker 4>You could hear everything else in the background and people really liked the</v>

4217
01:52:17.961 --> 01:52:21.170
<v Speaker 4>fact that we were sitting there at a desk right in front of the door to the</v>

4218
01:52:21.171 --> 01:52:21.800
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>

4219
01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:22.910
<v Speaker 4>People were getting a kick out of that,</v>

4220
01:52:22.911 --> 01:52:24.440
<v Speaker 4>like as the show was going on,</v>

4221
01:52:24.650 --> 01:52:26.630
<v Speaker 4>like people who are podcast fans like holy shit,</v>

4222
01:52:26.631 --> 01:52:27.980
<v Speaker 4>they're podcasting right there.</v>

4223
01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:29.540
<v Speaker 4>And it was really kind of cool,</v>

4224
01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:30.010
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4225
01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:30.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4226
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:31.970
<v Speaker 4>If we had that area,</v>

4227
01:52:32.150 --> 01:52:34.520
<v Speaker 4>I would like to have eventually a,</v>

4228
01:52:34.530 --> 01:52:39.230
<v Speaker 4>an area set up where we could do it like maybe before the shows and in between</v>

4229
01:52:39.231 --> 01:52:42.380
<v Speaker 4>shows and doing the back room and the while the show's going on.</v>

4230
01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.060
<v Speaker 4>We could do it right there,</v>

4231
01:52:44.370 --> 01:52:45.140
<v Speaker 4>do it right there,</v>

4232
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 4>that table.</v>

4233
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 4>But we</v>

4234
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.690
<v Speaker 1>would have to have it a little more soundproof than it is just a wee bit,</v>

4235
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:51.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4236
01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>just like a curtain or something like that.</v>

4237
01:52:53.230 --> 01:52:55.010
<v Speaker 1>It would be cool if people knew we were right there.</v>

4238
01:52:55.011 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

4239
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:56.480
<v Speaker 1>if you hear it,</v>

4240
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.761
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4241
01:52:56.761 --> 01:52:58.220
<v Speaker 1>it's all the talking and shit.</v>

4242
01:52:58.221 --> 01:53:00.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like a really bleeds into the microphone.</v>

4243
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:01.250
<v Speaker 1>It makes it hard to listen to.</v>

4244
01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.600
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about eventually I,</v>

4245
01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:07.490
<v Speaker 1>there's another office that depending on how all this goes,</v>

4246
01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 1>how they were thinking about building a like a window so we could actually watch</v>

4247
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:17.590
<v Speaker 1>who's on stage while we're podcasting behind the audience and then we can have</v>

4248
01:53:17.970 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 1>like little inner if so we can hear it would be amazing.</v>

4249
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:23.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know what else we can do that I think we should probably fuck around</v>

4250
01:53:23.451 --> 01:53:27.290
<v Speaker 1>with a little bit is occasionally have shows live on stage,</v>

4251
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:28.370
<v Speaker 1>have a podcast,</v>

4252
01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 1>live on stage a Jim Norton.</v>

4253
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4254
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.980
<v Speaker 1>because it's a small room because it's only 85 seats.</v>

4255
01:53:33.981 --> 01:53:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It's so intimate that it doesn't feel like the conversation is completely out of</v>

4256
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:38.540
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

4257
01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:39.341
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it,</v>

4258
01:53:39.341 --> 01:53:42.230
<v Speaker 1>exactly how it felt last time and though even if there's like a couple of</v>

4259
01:53:42.231 --> 01:53:43.220
<v Speaker 1>strangers in the room,</v>

4260
01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:45.050
<v Speaker 1>we were kind of not being ourself.</v>

4261
01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.940
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of almost playing,</v>

4262
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:47.910
<v Speaker 1>playing it up.</v>

4263
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I remember feeling that like,</v>

4264
01:53:49.210 --> 01:53:49.450
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4265
01:53:49.450 --> 01:53:51.590
<v Speaker 1>like it felt like we were doing bits almost or at least,</v>

4266
01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4267
01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:52.190
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

4268
01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:52.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4269
01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Well Norton is such a great performer.</v>

4270
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.820
<v Speaker 1>We know we did it with him,</v>

4271
01:53:55.821 --> 01:53:58.370
<v Speaker 1>was the perfect guy to do it with in front of an audience cause he's just</v>

4272
01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:02.090
<v Speaker 1>immediately went into attack mode and it was just killing like right off the</v>

4273
01:54:02.091 --> 01:54:02.750
<v Speaker 1>bat.</v>

4274
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

4275
01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:03.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4276
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4277
01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's settled in after a while and it became intimate when I became</v>

4278
01:54:07.641 --> 01:54:10.700
<v Speaker 1>intimate also was when it was real obvious that everybody in the show in the</v>

4279
01:54:10.701 --> 01:54:12.050
<v Speaker 1>audience was a podcast fan.</v>

4280
01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:14.870
<v Speaker 1>And so that was fun for them to be able to sit in and watch it.</v>

4281
01:54:14.871 --> 01:54:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And even though we only did it once,</v>

4282
01:54:16.041 --> 01:54:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be adverse to doing it again.</v>

4283
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:21.740
<v Speaker 1>And I also liked the idea that we could hand out the microphone and we hung out,</v>

4284
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:25.220
<v Speaker 1>pass out microphones to the crowd and then the crowd would ask questions.</v>

4285
01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:26.700
<v Speaker 1>That was a fun thing that,</v>

4286
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:30.410
<v Speaker 1>that little kind of a more relaxed question and answer cause I kind of stopped</v>

4287
01:54:30.411 --> 01:54:30.780
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

4288
01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:30.861
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4289
01:54:30.861 --> 01:54:31.970
<v Speaker 1>rarely do that.</v>

4290
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4291
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.991
<v Speaker 1>with an audience.</v>

4292
01:54:32.991 --> 01:54:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I think I did at one time last week.</v>

4293
01:54:34.611 --> 01:54:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

4294
01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4295
01:54:35.130 --> 01:54:35.691
<v Speaker 1>you do the Q and.</v>

4296
01:54:35.691 --> 01:54:35.901
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

4297
01:54:35.901 --> 01:54:36.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4298
01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.950
<v Speaker 1>cause I haven't been really doing it because it leads to like a weird ending for</v>

4299
01:54:39.951 --> 01:54:40.371
<v Speaker 1>a show.</v>

4300
01:54:40.371 --> 01:54:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes it's kind of like you're going up,</v>

4301
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:45.470
<v Speaker 1>this is like a great finale of an ending.</v>

4302
01:54:45.471 --> 01:54:45.951
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

4303
01:54:45.951 --> 01:54:46.281
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4304
01:54:46.281 --> 01:54:48.850
<v Speaker 1>now let's go backwards and just kind of talk continental.</v>

4305
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4306
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.821
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda weird.</v>

4307
01:54:49.821 --> 01:54:50.390
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

4308
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And then people would always ask me questions that weren't,</v>

4309
01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:57.120
<v Speaker 1>that really didn't lead themselves into being funny to me about Margaret Court</v>

4310
01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:58.860
<v Speaker 1>are know fighters.</v>

4311
01:54:58.900 --> 01:54:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4312
01:54:59.300 --> 01:54:59.840
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be,</v>

4313
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:03.680
<v Speaker 1>there was a random fighter thing and then there was always like it.</v>

4314
01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally people would,</v>

4315
01:55:04.821 --> 01:55:05.780
<v Speaker 1>well not occasionally,</v>

4316
01:55:05.781 --> 01:55:07.640
<v Speaker 1>every time people would want to talk about drugs,</v>

4317
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.930
<v Speaker 1>somebody would always yell a damn dude too,</v>

4318
01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4319
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:12.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking to me.</v>

4320
01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:12.893
<v Speaker 1>But mushrooms,</v>

4321
01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:18.500
<v Speaker 1>it's at a certain point in time you can only explain psychedelic experiences so</v>

4322
01:55:19.371 --> 01:55:21.900
<v Speaker 1>many times before you start becoming a character of your shelf.</v>

4323
01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:22.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4324
01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:23.091
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

4325
01:55:23.091 --> 01:55:23.361
<v Speaker 1>what am I,</v>

4326
01:55:23.361 --> 01:55:24.680
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to explain DMT?</v>

4327
01:55:24.681 --> 01:55:25.640
<v Speaker 1>The thousandth time?</v>

4328
01:55:25.641 --> 01:55:25.971
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

4329
01:55:25.971 --> 01:55:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you some and you to smoke it.</v>

4330
01:55:27.471 --> 01:55:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way it's going to work.</v>

4331
01:55:28.851 --> 01:55:29.541
<v Speaker 1>And I don't have any,</v>

4332
01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:30.374
<v Speaker 1>so good luck.</v>

4333
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:32.383
<v Speaker 1>It's like go.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You could be anybody.</v>

4347
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:48.960
<v Speaker 4>It could be some fucking Weirdo.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You'd be a cop.</v>

4349
01:55:49.681 --> 01:55:50.790
<v Speaker 4>You can be crazy person.</v>

4350
01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:52.690
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to talk to me about DMT,</v>

4351
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:54.330
<v Speaker 4>right when it comes to legal.</v>

4352
01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4353
01:55:55.210 --> 01:55:55.921
<v Speaker 4>it becomes league.</v>

4354
01:55:55.921 --> 01:55:56.701
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk to everybody.</v>

4355
01:55:56.701 --> 01:55:56.881
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

4356
01:55:56.881 --> 01:55:57.120
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

4357
01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:58.860
<v Speaker 4>I'll hold a seminar on the fucking White House.</v>

4358
01:55:58.861 --> 01:55:59.694
<v Speaker 4>Front steps.</v>

4359
01:55:59.910 --> 01:56:00.870
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell people about it.</v>

4360
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4361
01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Speaker 4>Tell you how to take three deep hits until that time.</v>

4362
01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying shit.</v>

4363
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.250
<v Speaker 4>That's the next war.</v>

4364
01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:09.810
<v Speaker 4>The war for consciousness.</v>

4365
01:56:10.170 --> 01:56:12.850
<v Speaker 4>The warfare control of he should be legal.</v>

4366
01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4367
01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:14.581
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4368
01:56:14.581 --> 01:56:16.080
<v Speaker 4>and I've said this many times before,</v>

4369
01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:20.190
<v Speaker 4>that we need schamens that if you're going to have something like mushrooms,</v>

4370
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:22.020
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to have something like pay Payoti,</v>

4371
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:23.800
<v Speaker 4>what you need is a,</v>

4372
01:56:23.801 --> 01:56:24.690
<v Speaker 4>a very,</v>

4373
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:25.583
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4374
01:56:25.770 --> 01:56:26.790
<v Speaker 4>rigorous,</v>

4375
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.880
<v Speaker 4>sort of a ritual and a path to follow in order to have these experiences.</v>

4376
01:56:32.970 --> 01:56:35.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they should just be open for recreation.</v>

4377
01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:38.490
<v Speaker 4>I think too many people doom and fuck their head up and don't know what they're</v>

4378
01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:40.470
<v Speaker 4>doing and they can be so beneficial.</v>

4379
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.060
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying that if you're a grown man,</v>

4380
01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:42.660
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't.</v>

4381
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 4>Once you have experienced in these realms,</v>

4382
01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:46.950
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't be able to get together with your friends and have a few mushrooms</v>

4383
01:56:46.951 --> 01:56:48.600
<v Speaker 4>and hang out and be silly and laugh.</v>

4384
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:50.340
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely think you should be able to,</v>

4385
01:56:50.341 --> 01:56:51.174
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to,</v>

4386
01:56:51.210 --> 01:56:51.361
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4387
01:56:51.361 --> 01:56:53.520
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that are like real serious about it and so you should</v>

4388
01:56:53.521 --> 01:56:56.670
<v Speaker 4>only do it for shamonic rituals and never do it or for recreation.</v>

4389
01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.301
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

4390
01:56:57.301 --> 01:56:57.990
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

4391
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.381
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

4392
01:56:58.381 --> 01:57:00.570
<v Speaker 4>when it can be fun to do it for recreation.</v>

4393
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:00.901
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

4394
01:57:00.901 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 4>don't say you have to do it one way or another or that it's disrespectful.</v>

4395
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.041
<v Speaker 4>Guess what?</v>

4396
01:57:05.041 --> 01:57:08.310
<v Speaker 4>The mushroom doesn't give a fuck about your respect in this world.</v>

4397
01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:08.521
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4398
01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:08.681
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4399
01:57:08.681 --> 01:57:09.530
<v Speaker 4>the mushroom is,</v>

4400
01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:09.731
<v Speaker 4>is a,</v>

4401
01:57:09.731 --> 01:57:11.250
<v Speaker 4>is whatever it is,</v>

4402
01:57:11.251 --> 01:57:12.450
<v Speaker 4>whatever that experience is,</v>

4403
01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:15.270
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be about forgiveness and love and fun.</v>

4404
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.871
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4405
01:57:15.871 --> 01:57:18.930
<v Speaker 4>that's what it seems to be about reality and truth and forgiveness and love and</v>

4406
01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:19.340
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>

4407
01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.180
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think it minds if you use a casually,</v>

4408
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:24.930
<v Speaker 4>but I think we need to have some sort of a setup where,</v>

4409
01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:25.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4410
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.120
<v Speaker 4>people are educated on it.</v>

4411
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:30.450
<v Speaker 4>People like you don't just dive into it not knowing what the fuck it is.</v>

4412
01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:34.170
<v Speaker 4>You W we could easily have a service where,</v>

4413
01:57:34.171 --> 01:57:34.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4414
01:57:34.411 --> 01:57:35.280
<v Speaker 4>if it was legal,</v>

4415
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:39.560
<v Speaker 4>you could set up these shamonic places where someone could go and you,</v>

4416
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:42.810
<v Speaker 4>this is Tom and Tom's going to guide you through the program.</v>

4417
01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Today's going to be the first day and today,</v>

4418
01:57:45.121 --> 01:57:46.920
<v Speaker 4>essentially what we're going to do is we're gonna sit down,</v>

4419
01:57:46.921 --> 01:57:48.060
<v Speaker 4>we're going to watch a documentary.</v>

4420
01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:49.200
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have a question to answer.</v>

4421
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:51.990
<v Speaker 4>We're going to watch a documentary about the history of use of mushrooms in the</v>

4422
01:57:51.991 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

4423
01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:55.920
<v Speaker 4>And then you'll fucking see this documentary on Gordon Wasson and all these</v>

4424
01:57:55.921 --> 01:57:59.490
<v Speaker 4>other people that took mushrooms and what these tribes learned about it and how</v>

4425
01:57:59.491 --> 01:58:00.630
<v Speaker 4>this was suppressed by,</v>

4426
01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:01.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4427
01:58:01.210 --> 01:58:03.600
<v Speaker 4>the various fucking dictators and kings.</v>

4428
01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.340
<v Speaker 4>And it'll go through the history of it.</v>

4429
01:58:05.490 --> 01:58:07.620
<v Speaker 4>And then the next day you go through the history of,</v>

4430
01:58:07.621 --> 01:58:07.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4431
01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:08.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4432
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:10.110
<v Speaker 4>other psychedelic drugs and you know,</v>

4433
01:58:10.111 --> 01:58:13.110
<v Speaker 4>what's the benefit of them and what's the dangers of them and how does it</v>

4434
01:58:13.111 --> 01:58:16.530
<v Speaker 4>interact with your body and how can we find out if you know you're,</v>

4435
01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:17.130
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4436
01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:17.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4437
01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:19.080
<v Speaker 4>especially vulnerable,</v>

4438
01:58:19.410 --> 01:58:19.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4439
01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:23.340
<v Speaker 4>and then slowly but surely you introduce someone into those,</v>

4440
01:58:23.341 --> 01:58:24.174
<v Speaker 4>those realms.</v>

4441
01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.940
<v Speaker 4>And I suggest starting them off really lightly.</v>

4442
01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 4>I think that the first mushroom experience you should have,</v>

4443
01:58:29.311 --> 01:58:30.600
<v Speaker 4>it should be fairly high.</v>

4444
01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:32.310
<v Speaker 4>You should just just get a little bit of it.</v>

4445
01:58:32.311 --> 01:58:35.250
<v Speaker 4>So you just kind of get a feel of it and a little giggle and yourself system</v>

4446
01:58:35.251 --> 01:58:36.240
<v Speaker 4>where you don't feel scared,</v>

4447
01:58:36.241 --> 01:58:37.021
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel nervous,</v>

4448
01:58:37.021 --> 01:58:37.351
<v Speaker 4>you just go,</v>

4449
01:58:37.351 --> 01:58:37.441
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4450
01:58:37.441 --> 01:58:38.131
<v Speaker 4>this is all right.</v>

4451
01:58:38.131 --> 01:58:38.720
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

4452
01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:40.140
<v Speaker 4>this is this crazy experience.</v>

4453
01:58:40.141 --> 01:58:40.960
<v Speaker 4>This is just weird.</v>

4454
01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.261
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

4455
01:58:41.261 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 4>this is wild.</v>

4456
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:45.490
<v Speaker 4>What a weird way of looking at the world I have now and then eventually slowly</v>

4457
01:58:45.491 --> 01:58:49.670
<v Speaker 4>but surely you should be introduced into the deeper and deeper dimensions into</v>

4458
01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:54.680
<v Speaker 4>the ideas that there is no real solid line between this world and the others.</v>

4459
01:58:55.151 --> 01:58:57.040
<v Speaker 4>It's just that this is all that we can detect.</v>

4460
01:58:57.070 --> 01:59:01.240
<v Speaker 4>This is all that we have the equipment to see and that what what mushrooms do,</v>

4461
01:59:01.241 --> 01:59:05.680
<v Speaker 4>any of these psychedelic drugs do is chemically alter the way your frequency or</v>

4462
01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 4>the way your brain interacts with the universe and allows you to see some shit</v>

4463
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:11.140
<v Speaker 4>that might just be there all the time.</v>

4464
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:13.450
<v Speaker 4>He just might not have the ability to see it.</v>

4465
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:15.310
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

4466
01:59:15.311 --> 01:59:17.110
<v Speaker 4>I think all of it should be legal.</v>

4467
01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:20.650
<v Speaker 4>There's no way one person should be keeping you from these experiences.</v>

4468
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:24.730
<v Speaker 4>What should be illegal and especially illegal to sell as anything that you think</v>

4469
01:59:24.731 --> 01:59:28.300
<v Speaker 4>to damage people or harm people or cause addiction and that shit already is</v>

4470
01:59:28.301 --> 01:59:28.930
<v Speaker 4>legal.</v>

4471
01:59:28.930 --> 01:59:31.180
<v Speaker 4>That shit has already been sold by pharmaceutical companies.</v>

4472
01:59:31.181 --> 01:59:31.901
<v Speaker 4>Things that are far,</v>

4473
01:59:31.901 --> 01:59:32.171
<v Speaker 4>far,</v>

4474
01:59:32.171 --> 01:59:33.280
<v Speaker 4>far more dangerous.</v>

4475
01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:33.731
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4476
01:59:33.731 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 4>even when you come into like drugs that are dangerous,</v>

4477
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:36.964
<v Speaker 4>like heroin,</v>

4478
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:39.700
<v Speaker 4>you know what the fucking cure for heroin is or what they give you and you're</v>

4479
01:59:39.701 --> 01:59:40.271
<v Speaker 4>hooked on heroin.</v>

4480
01:59:40.271 --> 01:59:41.260
<v Speaker 4>They give you methadone,</v>

4481
01:59:41.261 --> 01:59:41.800
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4482
01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:44.770
<v Speaker 4>which in many people's eyes is way worse than heroin itself.</v>

4483
01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:46.480
<v Speaker 4>More addictive than heroin itself.</v>

4484
01:59:46.481 --> 01:59:47.410
<v Speaker 4>Hard to get off.</v>

4485
01:59:47.411 --> 01:59:48.700
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking dangerous shit.</v>

4486
01:59:48.701 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 4>It's all gross,</v>

4487
01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:50.261
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4488
01:59:50.261 --> 01:59:54.130
<v Speaker 4>So I think that stuff that's bad for you as a society,</v>

4489
01:59:54.131 --> 01:59:56.920
<v Speaker 4>we should shun and that's what smart people would do.</v>

4490
01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.630
<v Speaker 4>That's what educated people would do.</v>

4491
01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:03.250
<v Speaker 4>What people that are in just this fucking whirlwind of momentum and hysteria,</v>

4492
02:00:03.251 --> 02:00:07.390
<v Speaker 4>that's not based on anything logical or rational or or realistic.</v>

4493
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:10.570
<v Speaker 4>That's when the world is like that.</v>

4494
02:00:10.571 --> 02:00:12.640
<v Speaker 4>That's when you get drug laws like we have right now.</v>

4495
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:15.670
<v Speaker 4>Nutty ones don't make any sense or not based on logic.</v>

4496
02:00:15.671 --> 02:00:16.900
<v Speaker 4>They're not based on knowledge.</v>

4497
02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:20.800
<v Speaker 4>They're based on some bullshit that was taught in the 1930s there based on some</v>

4498
02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:22.780
<v Speaker 4>sweeping drug addicts,</v>

4499
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:27.250
<v Speaker 4>drug acts that which included things that weren't even psychoactive in humans in</v>

4500
02:00:27.251 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 4>1970 so that's what I think.</v>

4501
02:00:29.381 --> 02:00:30.610
<v Speaker 4>We're fucking being oppressed.</v>

4502
02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.720
<v Speaker 4>No question about it.</v>

4503
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:35.710
<v Speaker 4>We have a system that's old as fuck and you're seeing it right now with his</v>

4504
02:00:35.711 --> 02:00:36.540
<v Speaker 4>craziest,</v>

4505
02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 4>there's these demonstration and the occupy Wall Street movement.</v>

4506
02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:40.630
<v Speaker 4>That's the financial system.</v>

4507
02:00:40.631 --> 02:00:42.190
<v Speaker 4>That system is old as fuck.</v>

4508
02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:45.010
<v Speaker 4>We also have a legal system that's old as fuck.</v>

4509
02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:49.120
<v Speaker 4>It's stupid and that gets ridiculous and thinks that it's above the humans,</v>

4510
02:00:49.121 --> 02:00:52.510
<v Speaker 4>that it's supposed to be there to help and aid and assist and instead of</v>

4511
02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:53.980
<v Speaker 4>assisting the humans that it's that,</v>

4512
02:00:54.010 --> 02:00:54.731
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>

4513
02:00:54.731 --> 02:00:55.990
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be there to protect.</v>

4514
02:00:55.991 --> 02:01:00.310
<v Speaker 4>Instead they act as a fucking bully unit for big businesses that seek to push</v>

4515
02:01:00.311 --> 02:01:02.350
<v Speaker 4>things in one way or another in order to make more money.</v>

4516
02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:02.720
<v Speaker 4>W,</v>

4517
02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:07.720
<v Speaker 4>w the whole thing is just filled with clients across the board with the legal</v>

4518
02:01:08.021 --> 02:01:08.441
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

4519
02:01:08.441 --> 02:01:09.520
<v Speaker 4>the financial system,</v>

4520
02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that things like marijuana and mushrooms,</v>

4521
02:01:13.031 --> 02:01:17.740
<v Speaker 4>things that probably aided in people's perception and the evolution of people's</v>

4522
02:01:17.741 --> 02:01:21.130
<v Speaker 4>perception since there were people from the very beginning.</v>

4523
02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:24.910
<v Speaker 4>I know for a fact that those things have helped me and I know for a fact they've</v>

4524
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:29.050
<v Speaker 4>helped you and everybody that we know that's had psychedelic experiences has</v>

4525
02:01:29.051 --> 02:01:30.010
<v Speaker 4>been helped by them.</v>

4526
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:30.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4527
02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:32.350
<v Speaker 4>we know people that have had bad ones.</v>

4528
02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 4>We know people that have bet scary ones,</v>

4529
02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:36.520
<v Speaker 4>but when you sit down with them and say,</v>

4530
02:01:36.521 --> 02:01:37.510
<v Speaker 4>what did you learn?</v>

4531
02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:38.680
<v Speaker 4>What did you get out of that?</v>

4532
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.300
<v Speaker 4>They almost all say humility.</v>

4533
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:44.060
<v Speaker 4>They almost all say a feeling of connectedness.</v>

4534
02:01:44.150 --> 02:01:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Member Ari.</v>

4535
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Ari was like an angry dude for a while until Ari started tripping and when Ari</v>

4536
02:01:49.551 --> 02:01:50.240
<v Speaker 4>started tripping,</v>

4537
02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:50.421
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4538
02:01:50.421 --> 02:01:52.610
<v Speaker 4>he started doing mushrooms like fairly regularly.</v>

4539
02:01:52.611 --> 02:01:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Every few months or so are you became a way nicer guy,</v>

4540
02:01:56.210 --> 02:02:00.350
<v Speaker 4>a way more aware of the fact that he should be a nice guy there.</v>

4541
02:02:00.351 --> 02:02:00.861
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>

4542

<v Speaker 4>you man,</v>

4543
02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.460
<v Speaker 4>this message brought to you by mushrooms and the marijuana shrunk to things that</v>

4544
02:02:07.461 --> 02:02:09.150
<v Speaker 4>are illegal to things early on.</v>

4565
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.811
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

4566
02:02:50.811 --> 02:02:51.644
<v Speaker 3>I mean usually that,</v>

4567
02:02:51.650 --> 02:02:53.440
<v Speaker 3>that would be just one of those guys too.</v>

4568
02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are headliners.</v>

4569
02:02:54.810 --> 02:02:56.870
<v Speaker 3>That would be like a $30 show usually.</v>

4570
02:02:56.871 --> 02:02:57.210
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

4571
02:02:57.210 --> 02:02:57.421
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4572
02:02:57.421 --> 02:02:58.160
<v Speaker 4>that's a great shot.</v>

4573
02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:59.760
<v Speaker 4>It's a great show with a bunch of great guys.</v>

4574
02:02:59.790 --> 02:03:04.350
<v Speaker 4>And if you never seen Tripoli or nursing Dunkin or any of those guys that's top</v>

4575
02:03:04.351 --> 02:03:04.740
<v Speaker 4>notch,</v>

4576
02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:06.690
<v Speaker 4>stand up in La and it's only like 15 bucks,</v>

4577
02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:08.130
<v Speaker 4>15 bucks,</v>

4578
02:03:08.130 --> 02:03:09.990
<v Speaker 4>and they're going to be doing podcasts there.</v>

4579
02:03:09.991 --> 02:03:12.420
<v Speaker 4>So if you fucking get in on that,</v>

4580
02:03:12.421 --> 02:03:13.470
<v Speaker 4>they might let you go.</v>

4581
02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:14.333
<v Speaker 4>Hi Mom.</v>

4582
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:15.373
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say no,</v>

4583
02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:16.533
<v Speaker 4>no</v>

4584
02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:20.490
<v Speaker 4>that have people come in and we won't tell them where the studio is.</v>

4585
02:03:20.491 --> 02:03:21.090
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

4586
02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Eventually the studio will have to be in glass,</v>

4587
02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:24.370
<v Speaker 4>so it'd be going to put,</v>

4588
02:03:24.370 --> 02:03:25.450
<v Speaker 4>put their boogers on it and shit,</v>

4589
02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.980
<v Speaker 4>but just get some really thick glass like plexiglass,</v>

4590
02:03:29.010 --> 02:03:30.060
<v Speaker 4>some bulletproof shit.</v>

4591
02:03:30.650 --> 02:03:32.400
<v Speaker 4>So we could do it right in front of people like the zoo.</v>

4592
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4593
02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:33.811
<v Speaker 4>that'd be awesome.</v>

4594
02:03:33.811 --> 02:03:36.930
<v Speaker 4>That'd be awesome to have it like right set up there were,</v>

4595
02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:37.591
<v Speaker 4>how about that,</v>

4596
02:03:37.591 --> 02:03:39.150
<v Speaker 4>you know that little door to the,</v>

4597
02:03:39.151 --> 02:03:41.070
<v Speaker 4>to the ice house when you go into that small room.</v>

4598
02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.240
<v Speaker 4>How about if that wall was just all plexiglass and you right where the ticket</v>

4599
02:03:45.241 --> 02:03:46.320
<v Speaker 4>booth is right next to it.</v>

4600
02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:48.290
<v Speaker 4>We had like microphone setup and we did it like,</v>

4601
02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:49.920
<v Speaker 4>so you could see right when you're on stage.</v>

4602
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4603
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.080
<v Speaker 3>And we have the,</v>

4604
02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:53.810
<v Speaker 3>there's a little change machines where you usually get the zoo where you could</v>

4605
02:03:53.811 --> 02:03:54.501
<v Speaker 3>feed the animals,</v>

4606
02:03:54.501 --> 02:03:56.750
<v Speaker 3>but it'd be like skittles and stuff and they can give us candy.</v>

4607
02:03:57.550 --> 02:03:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4608
02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they give you candy if you get laughs,</v>

4609
02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:00.650
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4610
02:04:00.650 --> 02:04:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if,</v>

4611
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:02.303
<v Speaker 3>if you see a little,</v>

4612
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:03.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4613
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:04.223
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

4614
02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:05.160
<v Speaker 4>it has to like the,</v>

4615
02:04:05.161 --> 02:04:09.480
<v Speaker 4>the decibel level of the laughter has to reach a certain level and then a green</v>

4616
02:04:09.481 --> 02:04:13.470
<v Speaker 4>light goes off in a little skittle and goes into a tray or joint or joint.</v>

4617
02:04:14.710 --> 02:04:17.610

<v Speaker 4>it's funny.</v>

4623
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:30.830
<v Speaker 4>It makes me take things less seriously because what are you looking for it?</v>

4630
02:04:41.161 --> 02:04:44.310
<v Speaker 4>good for us to be taken less seriously,</v>

<v Speaker 4>which is why you're here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I this no bullshit.</v>

4675
02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:56.793
<v Speaker 4>We all here,</v>

4676
02:05:57.140 --> 02:05:59.170
<v Speaker 3>they were saying that at the meeting I had at the Ice House,</v>

4677
02:05:59.171 --> 02:06:02.740
<v Speaker 3>how you guys are your fans all drink and tip and that it's huge.</v>

4678

<v Speaker 3>They're nice people.</v>

4679
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:04.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4680
02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I think you put that out there,</v>

4681
02:06:05.981 --> 02:06:06.580
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4682
02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:08.740
<v Speaker 3>You put that out there and people gravitate towards it.</v>

4683
02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:10.540
<v Speaker 3>And I think this podcast,</v>

4684
02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:10.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4685
02:06:10.901 --> 02:06:14.210
<v Speaker 3>reinforces that and we need people to think,</v>

4686
02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:16.630
<v Speaker 3>to hear that you're supposed to think a certain way that it's,</v>

4687
02:06:16.710 --> 02:06:17.740
<v Speaker 3>it's a good way to think.</v>

4688
02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:18.071
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4689
02:06:18.071 --> 02:06:20.410
<v Speaker 3>I heard that thing you did with Siri where you ask Siri that,</v>

4690
02:06:20.411 --> 02:06:21.730
<v Speaker 3>what is the meaning of life?</v>

4691
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the Brody Stevens thing?</v>

4692
02:06:23.621 --> 02:06:23.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4693
02:06:23.831 --> 02:06:24.760
<v Speaker 3>That was beautiful.</v>

4694
02:06:24.850 --> 02:06:25.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

02:06:30.070 --> 02:06:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Go for walks and what's good.</v>

4698
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:34.570
<v Speaker 3>What was crazy is your fellow man,</v>

4699
02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Brody was just like,</v>

4700
02:06:35.801 --> 02:06:36.760
<v Speaker 3>right before that happened.</v>

4701
02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:37.211
<v Speaker 3>Brody goes,</v>

4702
02:06:37.211 --> 02:06:37.481
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

4703
02:06:37.481 --> 02:06:37.991
<v Speaker 3>do you walk?</v>

4704
02:06:37.991 --> 02:06:38.201
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4705
02:06:38.201 --> 02:06:38.560
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4706
02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:38.951
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

4707
02:06:38.951 --> 02:06:39.850
<v Speaker 3>you need to go on walks.</v>

4708
02:06:39.851 --> 02:06:40.840
<v Speaker 3>You need to read books.</v>

4709
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:41.591
<v Speaker 3>He had a book.</v>

4710
02:06:41.591 --> 02:06:41.801
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4711
02:06:41.801 --> 02:06:42.611
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading the secrets.</v>

4712
02:06:42.611 --> 02:06:43.860
<v Speaker 3>I just make sure you read this.</v>

4713
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.291
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

4714
02:06:44.291 --> 02:06:45.370
<v Speaker 3>don't eat fat foods.</v>

4715
02:06:45.371 --> 02:06:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Like he was giving me this whole lecture and I'm like,</v>

4716
02:06:47.141 --> 02:06:49.000
<v Speaker 3>let's see what series it has to say about the meaning of life.</v>

4717
02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:49.480
<v Speaker 3>And I played,</v>

4718
02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:51.190
<v Speaker 3>it was exactly what Brody said.</v>

4719
02:06:51.191 --> 02:06:52.810
<v Speaker 3>It gave me shivers like in the video,</v>

4720
02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:54.370
<v Speaker 3>like you can watch the video on Vimeo.</v>

4721
02:06:54.490 --> 02:06:57.190
<v Speaker 3>I have like goosebumps and we're all freaking the fuck out.</v>

4722
02:06:57.220 --> 02:07:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Brody Stevens now these on heavy meds is tapping into the true meaning of</v>

4723
02:07:01.571 --> 02:07:02.404
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>

4724
02:07:02.650 --> 02:07:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's got the answers.</v>

4725
02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Do we need to have Brody Stevens on this podcast?</v>
