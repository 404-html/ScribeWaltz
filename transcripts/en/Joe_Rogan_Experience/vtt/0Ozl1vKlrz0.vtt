108
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I've got to start doing that.</v>

109
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a great thing if you send things frequently.</v>

111
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>

112
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>If you send thing frequency it frequently,</v>

113
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>it keeps you from having to do that thing where you go to the post office knew</v>

114
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Wayne Line,</v>

115
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.313
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

116
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>and there's 10 people like you in front of you and that lady does not want to</v>

117
00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:58.794
<v Speaker 1>have none of this.</v>

118
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>She's not pleasant.</v>

119
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

120
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm just waiting for politics to become con.</v>

121
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm just waiting for one candidate to get elected because he was able to do it</v>

122
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>through social media from his garage and not have to rely on the power structure</v>

123
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.544
<v Speaker 2>of fundraising,</v>

124
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably going to happen,</v>

125
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what the fuck that let's do@stamps.com why Jesus Christ.</v>

126
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 2>She just went crazy.</v>

127
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.600
<v Speaker 2>It's Fox News on May hats.</v>

128
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Dot Fox News.</v>

129
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 2>The opposite was Rt.</v>

130
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if our teas the opposite.</v>

131
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.091
<v Speaker 2>What's the opposite?</v>

132
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not CNBC,</v>

133
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

134
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I think Fox News is guilty of anybody as anybody else having an ideology and</v>

135
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 2>being unfair in the way they,</v>

136
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

137
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

138
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 2>couch things.</v>

140
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.140
<v Speaker 2>In my opinion,</v>

141
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 2>use the code word GRE.</v>

142
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>It's 110 bucks off stamps.com by the way,</v>

143
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 2>the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

144
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.740
<v Speaker 2>So if your phone son Joe Rogan experience podcast does not support nor indoors,</v>

145
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 2>the wacky ideas and Mr Kellen promotes stamps.com does not without a doubt,</v>

146
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 2>does not support nor acknowledge the wacky ideas.</v>

324
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I upgraded my Redskins tickets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I like to shout and get into their head.</v>

339
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.951
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

340
00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Like the one dude Cooper who's wide receivers started reddit.</v>

341
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

343
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.420
<v Speaker 3>And he goes around the country talking to colleges and basically saying to these</v>

344
00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:43.750
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

345
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.583
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

346
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 3>everything that you know,</v>

347
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:49.510
<v Speaker 3>like higher education and the way you're supposed to do shit,</v>

348
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.910
<v Speaker 3>it's no longer really relevant anymore.</v>

349
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.740
<v Speaker 3>All that matters is what you can do.</v>

350
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>And there's a whole wide open out there for you</v>

351
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 2>to think outside the box.</v>

352
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of like his mission,</v>

353
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

354
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 2>But he was talking about how he was on,</v>

355
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 2>he's this Guy Cooper who was at a Justin Bieber concert with saying some racial</v>

356
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:05.281
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

357
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:05.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

358
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 2>he's a white wide receiver saying racist stuff about black people.</v>

359
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 2>He gets behind the bench and he's basically shouting at Cooper going,</v>

360
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Cooper,</v>

361
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 2>do you still feel that way?</v>

362
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.790
<v Speaker 2>What's it like to be in the locker room with all these black people who are</v>

363
00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 2>around you?</v>

364
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

365
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.941
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

366
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

367
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 2>and his teammates were all laughing and making fun of them.</v>

368
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 2>They were kind of like snickering and stuff.</v>

369
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he does with his money.</v>

370
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Brian Cowen will be at the Houston Improv this weekend and buffalo the next</v>

384
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 2>but I've been asking you since I saw the prototype.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The guy.</v>

412
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 2>The artist is amazing.</v>

413
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 2>He does like special effects for movies and stuff like that is an artist that is</v>

414
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 2>really hard to do and steel.</v>

415
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think,</v>

416
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

417
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

418
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

419
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you started off in clay and then they just make a mold of it.</v>

420
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 2>But the mold,</v>

421
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 2>it came out like beyond our expectations for the side view.</v>

422
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

423
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

424
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a real piece of art.</v>

425
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a uh,</v>

426
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Speaker 2>a workout functional workout equipment too.</v>

427
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a real piece of function and workout equipment because we made sure they</v>

428
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 2>were all balanced.</v>

429
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about kettlebells is part of the exercising with them is</v>

430
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 2>swinging and catching them and you,</v>

431
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 2>you want a very predictable movement.</v>

432
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Meaning you want them sort of centered with their weight,</v>

433
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>so that when you swing it and catch it,</v>

435
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>there's no imbalance in the in the curve.</v>

436
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 2>And we worked hard to make sure that these primal kettle bells are completely</v>

437
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 2>balanced.</v>

438
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 2>They're not wacky in any way.</v>

439
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.940
<v Speaker 2>They're really like,</v>

440
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>you use them once you realize where the face is,</v>

441
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just like using a regular kettle,</v>

442
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 2>but right.</v>

443
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean you just,</v>

444
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.880
<v Speaker 2>you just adjust so that the face doesn't bang in your arm.</v>

445
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.813
<v Speaker 2>That's the only,</v>

446
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.510
<v Speaker 2>if they were the most imbalanced things in the world,</v>

447
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd still have them in my chat up cause they're so awesome.</v>

448
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 2>So I don't really care.</v>

<v Speaker 2>everybody about the fights.</v>

498

<v Speaker 2>That that submission that he hit mitre owned with.</v>

501
00:13:39.681 --> 00:13:40.230
<v Speaker 2>But cars,</v>

502
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.820

504
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:41.871
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

505
00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:46.730
<v Speaker 2>He did eight pull ups the other day with 125 pounds hanging from his waist.</v>

506
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.750
<v Speaker 2>A strict pull ups,</v>

507
00:13:47.751 --> 00:13:48.470
<v Speaker 2>not kipping.</v>

508
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.161
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

509
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:50.450
<v Speaker 2>He's a serious grappler.</v>

510
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.290
<v Speaker 2>That guy can,</v>

511
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.730
<v Speaker 2>he is strong and shit.</v>

512
00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:52.881
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

513
00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:54.470
<v Speaker 2>he took a lot of heat for that.</v>

514
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 2>A Gracie a match that metamorris match cause he basically just didn't engage for</v>

515
00:13:59.631 --> 00:13:59.990
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>

516
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.160
<v Speaker 2>But there were many moments in the fight where they were engaged.</v>

517
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.630
<v Speaker 2>There was many moments where that Cyborg guy had him in his guard and he's a</v>

518
00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:12.530
<v Speaker 2>dangerous mother fucker Cyborg and Brendan defended every single one of them</v>

519
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.200
<v Speaker 2>sticking his hand in his throat and just stop in that.</v>

520
00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:16.040
<v Speaker 2>That stopped it.</v>

521
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Everything perfect.</v>

522
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.620
<v Speaker 2>But that's a tricky game.</v>

523
00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:19.620
<v Speaker 2>You're playing with that guy.</v>

524
00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:19.940
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

525
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.140
<v Speaker 2>people don't respect that.</v>

526
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Like that Cyborg dude is a nasty motherfucker when it comes to Jujitsu,</v>

527
00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:26.661
<v Speaker 2>his Jujitsu,</v>

528
00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:27.321

529
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:27.711
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

530
00:14:27.711 --> 00:14:28.640
<v Speaker 2>really high level.</v>

531
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.980
<v Speaker 2>If there's anybody who's earned the nickname Cyborg,</v>

532
00:14:30.981 --> 00:14:32.360
<v Speaker 2>just by the way they look,</v>

533
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:33.440
<v Speaker 2>it's him.</v>

534
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.440

536
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.740
<v Speaker 2>about my fucking bone structure.</v>

537
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:39.921

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.550
<v Speaker 1>her husband was Ciba evangelists to a Cyborg and then there was this guy,</v>

549
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Roberto I brew,</v>

550

552
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.213
<v Speaker 1>I say his last name,</v>

553
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:02.581
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

554
00:15:02.581 --> 00:15:02.800
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

555
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.633
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

556
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.161
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn,</v>

557
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:04.994
<v Speaker 1>he's nasty.</v>

558
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 1>He's got a crazy guard.</v>

559
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>He goes under guys and then rips their legs apart.</v>

560
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Like ain't as bad as a take down her Steve.</v>

561
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a tank is a tank of a human.</v>

562
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

563
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>

564
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Brendan didn't,</v>

565
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 1>he did a lot of just keeping this guy off of him.</v>

566
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>It did a lot of that.</v>

567
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.600
<v Speaker 1>But there were many moments where he was in that guy's guard.</v>

568
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

569
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the eight times at Eight,</v>

570
00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:25.011
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

571
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>seven times went down.</v>

572
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

573
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.014
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of,</v>

574
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the fact that he was able to do that.</v>

575
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It's very impressive.</v>

576
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:31.070
<v Speaker 1>You're just grappling.</v>

577
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:31.221
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

578
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:32.031
<v Speaker 1>if they were striking,</v>

579
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Brendan would probably,</v>

580
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 1>there's so many positions you would get caught in cause you're smashing.</v>

581
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.290
<v Speaker 1>You guys are hitting him with a punch.</v>

582
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Cyber wouldn't get out of the first round and he would know that.</v>

583
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>

584
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.410
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

585
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.280
<v Speaker 1>that whole position changes entirely like the guard.</v>

586
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Everybody looks at the Guardian,</v>

587
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:45.970
<v Speaker 1>MMA and the garden MMA,</v>

588
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing because guys aren't hitting you or guys are hitting you.</v>

589
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Rather when you're in straight Jujitsu,</v>

590
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 1>the guard becomes infinitely more dangerous because you're not going to hit that</v>

591
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 1>guy in the bottom.</v>

592
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.730
<v Speaker 1>So he can grab a hold of you.</v>

593
00:15:56.731 --> 00:15:57.291
<v Speaker 1>He can do things,</v>

594
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.690
<v Speaker 1>he can be wide open and still control you.</v>

595
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you add punches,</v>

596
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.650
<v Speaker 1>it changes 90% of the Jujitsu cause that's when you,</v>

597
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.670
<v Speaker 1>you're getting you in the face and now you see a lot of guys,</v>

598
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:11.320
<v Speaker 1>very few guys now will close their legs in MMA because you're taking away two of</v>

599
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 1>your weapons.</v>

600
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

601
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

602
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:13.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:13.791
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

604
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:14.031
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

605
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

606
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>you the guys,</v>

607
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys will try to stand up immediately and stuff like that.</v>

608
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:17.871
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

609
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:18.501
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

610
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>very precarious position to be and really depends on your style.</v>

611
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

612
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.761
<v Speaker 1>there's still glass,</v>

613
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:23.594
<v Speaker 1>the attack,</v>

614
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:23.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

615
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:26.700
<v Speaker 1>off of their back in a full guard like Vinny Magallanes.</v>

616
00:16:26.701 --> 00:16:27.531
<v Speaker 1>I look what happened.</v>

617
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Look what liquid pedis did.</v>

618
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

619
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 1>that was a beautiful move,</v>

620
00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

621
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Perfect old school,</v>

622
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

623
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.730
<v Speaker 1>It's still relevant still.</v>

624
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.703
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

625
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.491
<v Speaker 1>There's openings.</v>

626
00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Just like a right hook is relevant.</v>

627
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:39.280
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>

628
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.861
<v Speaker 1>it goes away.</v>

629
00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:40.341
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

630
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

631
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.301
<v Speaker 1>They're all,</v>

632
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:41.840
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

633
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>all those techniques are there.</v>

634
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 1>When you've got Jake shields,</v>

635
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:44.864
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia,</v>

636
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.381
<v Speaker 1>what's your,</v>

637
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:46.170
<v Speaker 1>what's your calling?</v>

638
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I have a point of view.</v>

639
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

640
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what man.</v>

641
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia is a mother fucker at one 70 thank you.</v>

642
00:16:54.191 --> 00:16:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Look what he did to John Fitch.</v>

643
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.670
<v Speaker 1>What worries me about Jake going down to one 70 is a,</v>

644
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Jake looks unhealthy when he does it.</v>

645
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:01.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

646
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's got that back in order,</v>

647
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen him in the weigh ins where I'm like,</v>

648
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

649
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.130
<v Speaker 1>he walks a two o or something.</v>

650
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

651
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he said he's a big fella.</v>

652
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

653
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>he's very strong grappler,</v>

654
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but a one 85 he beat some dangerous guys.</v>

655
00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

656
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.970
<v Speaker 1>He put,</v>

657
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>he put Robbie Lawler,</v>

658
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 1>he tapped him.</v>

659
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 1>He fought a five round fight with Dan Henderson.</v>

660
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:26.670
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the greatest comebacks in the history of Dan Anderson's Calila</v>

661
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.790
<v Speaker 1>strong from an institution.</v>

662
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson tagged him in that first round.</v>

663
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean tagged him like there's not a whole lot of humans that could have</v>

664
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.493
<v Speaker 1>survived that.</v>

665
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 1>He got hit the first round.</v>

666
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:43.901
<v Speaker 1>Jake Shield showed like the rarest of rare Chin's because Henderson connected</v>

667
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:50.081
<v Speaker 1>flush on the Chin and he got out of that and started taking Henderson down.</v>

668
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I think Henderson like went into that fight with something wrong with them.</v>

669
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me that he,</v>

670
00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:56.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

671
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.851
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

672
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

673
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 1>back issues.</v>

674
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.340
<v Speaker 1>So it could have been,</v>

675
00:17:59.370 --> 00:17:59.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

676
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to make any excuses for Dan.</v>

677
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he wouldn't have made any either.</v>

678
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of times when you've seen a guy in a fight like that,</v>

679
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 1>like that's what you're dealing with.</v>

680
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:11.670
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a guy goes in there and he's got something wrong,</v>

681
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:12.181
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

683
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they throw strategy out the window and just go after a guy you got</v>

684
00:18:15.981 --> 00:18:16.741
<v Speaker 1>to your happy place.</v>

685
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

686
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know,</v>

687
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 1>you've got to play it safe.</v>

688
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.903
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

689
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia,</v>

690
00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:22.450
<v Speaker 3>when I drink,</v>

691
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.590
<v Speaker 3>when I saw Damien Maia,</v>

692
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.960
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about with Jake shields,</v>

693
00:18:25.961 --> 00:18:26.321
<v Speaker 3>when I saw it,</v>

694
00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia control,</v>

695
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

696
00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.930
<v Speaker 3>John Fitch for that long and get his back and just basically ride him like that.</v>

697
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.483
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

698
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I think that Damien Maia is striking from what I understand is really grown</v>

699
00:18:37.871 --> 00:18:39.790
<v Speaker 3>leaps and bounds and he's,</v>

700
00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.181
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

701
00:18:40.181 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 3>he can keep the fight on his feet and a lot of people say that he's,</v>

702
00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:43.750
<v Speaker 3>if he does that with Jake,</v>

703
00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:44.800
<v Speaker 3>he's going to tag Jake up.</v>

704
00:18:44.801 --> 00:18:46.240
<v Speaker 3>But then if he goes to the ground,</v>

705
00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:49.360
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing that suggests that Jake is going to be able to like,</v>

706
00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I think his take down rate,</v>

707
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia as a wrestler is like 90% or something like he's really effective on</v>

708
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:55.810
<v Speaker 3>takedowns as well.</v>

709
00:18:55.811 --> 00:18:56.644
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to be,</v>

710
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.490
<v Speaker 1>he's a very special grappler,</v>

711
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.050
<v Speaker 1>is a very special grappler.</v>

712
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.471
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

713
00:19:00.471 --> 00:19:05.471
<v Speaker 1>his area of improvement is all been his striking catching up to the point where</v>

714
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:09.140
<v Speaker 1>he could use his grappling more effective effectively.</v>

715
00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Like the Rick story fight was even more impressive than the Fitch fight to me.</v>

716
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Cause Rick story is fucking gorilla strong.</v>

717
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.170
<v Speaker 1>That kid is stupid strong.</v>

718
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And Maya got ahold of him and never let go.</v>

719
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was crazy.</v>

720
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.360
<v Speaker 1>It was the way he did it.</v>

721
00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:25.880
<v Speaker 1>He just is so relentless chasing them down,</v>

722
00:19:25.881 --> 00:19:26.870
<v Speaker 1>holding singles,</v>

723
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.681
<v Speaker 1>tripping them all.</v>

724
00:19:27.681 --> 00:19:28.700
<v Speaker 1>He's holding a single,</v>

725
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.810
<v Speaker 1>dragging them to the mat,</v>

726
00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:30.591
<v Speaker 1>drag up to the mat,</v>

727
00:19:30.591 --> 00:19:31.341
<v Speaker 1>dragged them to the mat,</v>

728
00:19:31.341 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 1>dragged them to that.</v>

729
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Then finally he's got his back.</v>

730
00:19:33.221 --> 00:19:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 1>And then once he's got you back Das,</v>

732
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.240
<v Speaker 3>when you got your back and you know what they do,</v>

733
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.260
<v Speaker 3>you know what they're finding.</v>

734
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.370
<v Speaker 3>And this leads this book,</v>

735
00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:40.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

736
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.740
<v Speaker 3>called the sports gene I'm obsessed with right now.</v>

737
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:43.851
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a lot of people.</v>

738
00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:44.641
<v Speaker 3>He's a sports illustrated,</v>

739
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:44.701
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

740
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I think Mark Epstein or David Epstein,</v>

741
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm a science writer and they,</v>

742
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:48.850
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

743
00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:49.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

744
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.251
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

745
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 3>why is it that say,</v>

746
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.551
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

747
00:19:50.551 --> 00:19:53.890
<v Speaker 3>what they were trying to figure out why a chess master,</v>

748
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:54.531
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

749
00:19:54.531 --> 00:19:55.250
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

750
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.860
<v Speaker 3>what they found is anybody who's going to be really good at chess,</v>

751
00:19:57.861 --> 00:20:00.500
<v Speaker 3>at grand master or a great athlete,</v>

752
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.890
<v Speaker 3>you can almost always tell by the time they're 12 years old.</v>

753
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.150
<v Speaker 3>And there are a few outliers,</v>

754
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.510
<v Speaker 3>but just by the way they behave and the way they work and stuff like that,</v>

755
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:09.651
<v Speaker 3>and it's not,</v>

756
00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:13.160
<v Speaker 3>the 10,000 hour rule actually is a very shotty rule because some people can take</v>

757
00:20:13.161 --> 00:20:14.000
<v Speaker 3>four out thousand hours,</v>

758
00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:14.834
<v Speaker 3>other people can take,</v>

759
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.120
<v Speaker 3>25,000 hours.</v>

761
00:20:17.121 --> 00:20:17.661
<v Speaker 3>It all depends.</v>

762
00:20:17.661 --> 00:20:18.440
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

763
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.680
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that they found about people who master something like great</v>

764
00:20:21.681 --> 00:20:22.041
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers,</v>

765
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:22.701
<v Speaker 3>great judo guys,</v>

766
00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:25.670
<v Speaker 3>great boxers like Floyd Mayweather is,</v>

767
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:30.730
<v Speaker 3>isn't even so much that they are faster or stronger experience.</v>

768
00:20:30.741 --> 00:20:32.060
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a certain hardware,</v>

769
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:32.841
<v Speaker 3>what they call a hardware,</v>

770
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:33.920
<v Speaker 3>like a genetic hardware.</v>

771
00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:34.400
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be,</v>

772
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

773
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.690
<v Speaker 3>but experience when you look at Damien Maia,</v>

774
00:20:38.691 --> 00:20:38.931
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

775
00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:43.910
<v Speaker 3>when he rolls experience allows the human mind to be able to chunk information.</v>

776
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.630
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

777
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.380
<v Speaker 3>he's able to chunk shit in larger quantity.</v>

778
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 3>So what he's</v>

779
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 2>doing is he's reading signals s way before he's reading signals that you're</v>

780
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 2>giving him even tendencies and he's able to make assumptions.</v>

781
00:20:58.421 --> 00:20:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Even if he's not aware of it,</v>

782
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.040
<v Speaker 2>he's may able to jump three moves ahead because he's making an assumption.</v>

783
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 2>He's already predicting what you're going to do.</v>

784
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 2>You're thinking about it,</v>

785
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 2>and he can tell by the way,</v>

786
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 2>you're shifting your weight from years of experience.</v>

787
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:09.971
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

788
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I've been here before and he compensates much faster than you do and that's the</v>

789
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:15.950
<v Speaker 2>difference when when,</v>

790
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

791
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:16.900
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

792
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

793
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 2>that's a mind blower.</v>

794
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.983
<v Speaker 2>It's a mindblower.</v>

795
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:23.160
<v Speaker 2>When when they have these recognize your patterns before people make specific,</v>

796
00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:24.220
<v Speaker 2>he's memorized the board.</v>

797
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 2>He's memorized every conceivable position on that chess board.</v>

798
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.040
<v Speaker 2>As a Jujitsu player,</v>

799
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what great chess masters are able to do.</v>

800
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:35.710
<v Speaker 2>They can show a great chess master,</v>

801
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:40.711
<v Speaker 2>obscure games with obscure things for three seconds and then they can read.</v>

802
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 2>They can tell you what exactly,</v>

803
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 2>what the where everything was.</v>

804
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It's really terrifying when you're rolling with a guy who's really,</v>

805
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 2>really fucking good because one of the things is you feel the progressions.</v>

806
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.300
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you're lucky.</v>

807
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.650
<v Speaker 2>You're trapped in his full guard.</v>

808
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

809
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And I was got my arm.</v>

810
00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.081
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

811
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Now he's locked in the shoulder.</v>

812
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.241
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

813
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Now it's tighter.</v>

814
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit,</v>

815
00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:04.090
<v Speaker 2>now I'm in trouble.</v>

816
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm in fucking real trouble.</v>

817
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a real progression.</v>

818
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a wild scramble where you know someone catches a gay teen.</v>

819
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a real,</v>

820
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.490
<v Speaker 2>you are dictating to an extent whether you know it or not,</v>

821
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 2>what he's going to do next in the sense that when he,</v>

822
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 2>when he moves,</v>

823
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.540
<v Speaker 2>you have a compensation as you compensate,</v>

824
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 2>he's already ahead of you.</v>

825
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.370
<v Speaker 2>He's pulling,</v>

826
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.550
<v Speaker 2>never understand that if they've never played chess or if they've never done</v>

827
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu angst or whatever,</v>

828
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.790
<v Speaker 2>but the box is,</v>

829
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I think there's less dimensions to it just because the fact that it's just</v>

830
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:35.980
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>

831
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.780
<v Speaker 2>but then clearly you see a guy like Floyd Mayweather who can keep boxing against</v>

832
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 2>the best guys in the world and barely get hit and the reason is exactly what</v>

833
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:46.870
<v Speaker 2>they were saying is that phlegm in where she's still,</v>

834
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:47.351
<v Speaker 2>when you box,</v>

835
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 2>you'd learn all the different patterns,</v>

836
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:48.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

837
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.970
<v Speaker 2>There are different patterns that you learned footwork here that what he's able</v>

838
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 2>to do is he knows that if he will,</v>

839
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:55.960
<v Speaker 2>based on this pattern,</v>

840
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 2>he learned how,</v>

841
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:57.931
<v Speaker 2>okay you,</v>

842
00:22:57.931 --> 00:22:59.300
<v Speaker 2>you create this opening,</v>

843
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.000
<v Speaker 2>then you step to the side and you do this.</v>

844
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>What he'll do is jump to to pattern three.</v>

845
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 2>He'll literally anticipate,</v>

846
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.610
<v Speaker 2>he can see that you're moving over here and he's so far ahead of you and that's</v>

847
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 2>why it's impossible to touch the guy he's seeing before you throw the punch what</v>

848
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 2>based on your body language and based on where your eyes are,</v>

849
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 2>he's able to chunk all that information so quickly that he is,</v>

850
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.250
<v Speaker 2>the minute you think about it,</v>

851
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 2>the second you think,</v>

852
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:25.661
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

853
00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this.</v>

854
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.190
<v Speaker 2>He's already headed.</v>

855
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.371
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

856
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:27.491
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

857
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:29.520
<v Speaker 2>he's going to do this and now his hands up before.</v>

858
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Well that's sort of interesting because it's,</v>

859
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to explain.</v>

860
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 2>It's sparring I think to someone who's never spartan before and to a lot of</v>

861
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 2>folks when you look at it,</v>

862
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:41.430
<v Speaker 2>it looks like one guy is trying to hit the God.</v>

863
00:23:41.431 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 2>The other guy was trying to hit the guy and they kind of meet in the middle and</v>

864
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 2>figure out who hits who when.</v>

865
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of weirdness to sparring.</v>

866
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>There's a rhythm to it is,</v>

867
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strange thing.</v>

868
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Getting him to think something and then capitalizing on,</v>

869
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.890
<v Speaker 2>getting used to being hit too.</v>

871
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:58.700
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>

872
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to keep your,</v>

873
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.221
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

874
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:01.580
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

875
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.060
<v Speaker 2>your shit about you while things are flying at your face.</v>

876
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:05.981
<v Speaker 2>Some people just,</v>

877
00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:07.580
<v Speaker 2>they see things fly at their faces.</v>

878
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:08.683
<v Speaker 2>Well your heart,</v>

879
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.390
<v Speaker 2>your head goes down and it takes a long time.</v>

880
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I've worked at instinct out of your body,</v>

881
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:13.994
<v Speaker 2>being able to look,</v>

882
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:14.601
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

883
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:16.340
<v Speaker 2>see a punch into your face basically.</v>

884
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 2>We'll do it a lot of,</v>

885
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately a lot of people's instincts is definitely look for the punch.</v>

886
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 2>It's tried to like to have their heads straight up in the air.</v>

887
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's going on?</v>

888
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Try and see things more clearly so they're sticking their neck up and getting</v>

889
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:28.760
<v Speaker 2>cracked.</v>

890
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 2>That happens in a panic mode.</v>

891
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 2>You see a lot of guys in a panic mode,</v>

892
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 2>like they'll drop their hands down.</v>

893
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.281
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget.</v>

894
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

895
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 2>there was a fight in front of the comedy store one night and I don't know who</v>

896
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:39.291
<v Speaker 2>started what.</v>

897
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what was going on.</v>

898
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:44.180
<v Speaker 2>All I just knew it was that these two guys were in this really heated exchange</v>

899
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 2>and one guy was a white guy and one guy was a black guy and uh,</v>

900
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:53.350
<v Speaker 2>the white guy went into full slap panic standing square and it just literally</v>

901
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:56.240
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>

902
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.350
<v Speaker 2>it was so crazy.</v>

903
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:58.401
<v Speaker 2>It was so crazy.</v>

904
00:24:58.401 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 2>He was just,</v>

905
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 2>he had a full meltdown.</v>

906
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:00.771
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

907
00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe that he was about to have a fist fight with this guy who</v>

908
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 2>clearly look more physically strong,</v>

909
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 2>much larger.</v>

910
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Looked like a,</v>

911
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 2>like an athlete,</v>

912
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.281
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

913
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:12.770
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't know what happens.</v>

914
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I saw the slapping and the freaking and then a bus drove in front of,</v>

915
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:18.110
<v Speaker 2>or no,</v>

916
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.790
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't see anything for like,</v>

917
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 2>15 seconds or whatever it was until the bus was gone and then boom,</v>

919
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.970
<v Speaker 2>the white guys down flat.</v>

920
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 2>So some in between him flailing,</v>

921
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:29.811
<v Speaker 2>he got caught,</v>

922
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:30.644
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>

923
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 2>he got smashed.</v>

924
00:25:31.521 --> 00:25:35.510
<v Speaker 2>He was completely unconscious on the concrete in the street at all.</v>

925
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 2>You have to do is get in a ring.</v>

926
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Just chuck playing around with a guy who can actually,</v>

927
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I always say that people like if you think you're talking about getting a ring</v>

928
00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 2>with any cruiserweight who's even an amateur,</v>

929
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I been boxing a long time.</v>

930
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 2>You won't touch him and he'll hit you once in your whole life will change.</v>

931
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:48.351
<v Speaker 2>You'll be like,</v>

932
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to ever do this again,</v>

933
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.970
<v Speaker 2>and guys that are really good with footwork,</v>

934
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.800
<v Speaker 2>they always make you feel so stupid because if you're a person who's never,</v>

935
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 2>you're going to move off balance.</v>

936
00:25:56.751 --> 00:25:59.450
<v Speaker 2>This guy is going to be moving on and you're going to be like,</v>

937
00:25:59.480 --> 00:25:59.691
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

938
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:00.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not even there.</v>

939
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

940
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.843
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus.</v>

941
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.601
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

942
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:06.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a language that they had an amazing spirit experiment in this book where</v>

943
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Major League baseball players,</v>

944
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 2>almost all of them are off the charts visually.</v>

945
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>They have 2010 2017 visuals.</v>

946
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 2>There's almost no really great hitters there.</v>

947
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there are any who have even 2020 vision.</v>

948
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>They almost all without a doubt have vision that is off the charts there in the</v>

949
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 2>one percentile.</v>

950
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about all major league hitters.</v>

951
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

952
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:26.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

953
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.430
<v Speaker 2>and the book is very eloquent and about this.</v>

954
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:33.490
<v Speaker 2>And so they took Albert Poo hosts and who and Alex Rodriguez and some incredible</v>

955
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.513
<v Speaker 2>hitters,</v>

956
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.410
<v Speaker 2>like the best of all time of their generation.</v>

957
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.800
<v Speaker 2>And they had um,</v>

958
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things they found is that when a baseball,</v>

959
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 2>it comes at you at 95 miles an hour from 60 feet away,</v>

960
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you have to guess where it's going.</v>

961
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>You're</v>

962
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 3>not going to see it.</v>

963
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 3>The human eye cannot register in time to actually see and hit the ball.</v>

964
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 3>So what great hitters do is they're able to actually see the seams on the ball.</v>

965
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 3>They're able to see the seams on the ball and through years and years of how</v>

966
00:26:56.731 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 3>those scenes are rolling and how that pitcher throws the ball,</v>

967
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 3>they're able,</v>

968
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.910
<v Speaker 3>if they're very good,</v>

969
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.080
<v Speaker 3>if they're very good,</v>

970
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:09.140
<v Speaker 3>30% of the time they are able to predict and start swinging basically when he</v>

971
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:11.850
<v Speaker 3>lets go of the ball.</v>

972
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's where why curve balls and shit work.</v>

973
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

974
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 3>they can change where the ball's going to be changed direction.</v>

975
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:21.430
<v Speaker 3>But also the way you hit a curve off you're really great is you have,</v>

976
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you can see the way these guys can literally cause they have such good eyes can</v>

977
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:28.470
<v Speaker 3>see the pattern of the red strings coming at you at 95 miles an hour.</v>

978
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 3>They can chunk all that information quickly enough and start swinging low as</v>

979
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 3>opposed to hi and connect to you have to guess now they take the greatest</v>

980
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 3>hitters in major league baseball and they take out female Olympic softball</v>

981
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:42.560
<v Speaker 3>pitcher who pitches underhand.</v>

982
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Now the distance is about 40 feet,</v>

983
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.990
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more than 40 feet.</v>

984
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 3>The ball's coming over at about 60 miles an hour,</v>

985
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.940
<v Speaker 3>not 95 miles an hour and she pitches underhand.</v>

986
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Now these are the best pitchers and they hit a much smaller ball at 95 miles an</v>

987
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:55.620
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>

988
00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.620
<v Speaker 3>She struck out every single picture over and over and over again because guess</v>

989
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:02.641
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

990
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 3>There are novices cause you know why they couldn't guess.</v>

991
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Speaker 3>They were looking at a very different ball.</v>

992
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have the strings and she was pitching underhand so they,</v>

993
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Speaker 3>there was no way for them to predict anything.</v>

994
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.680
<v Speaker 3>They were swinging blind and they were as bad as you and I.</v>

995
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.233
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

996
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.291
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

997
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

998
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.030
<v Speaker 3>So the more you learn,</v>

999
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:21.721
<v Speaker 3>the more we learn.</v>

1000
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Not only about you have to have a certain hardware.</v>

1001
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 3>We know as an athlete you are never going to be,</v>

1002
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you and I are never going to be sprinters.</v>

1003
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.301
<v Speaker 3>It ain't happening.</v>

1004
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:30.841
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1005
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

1006
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.860
<v Speaker 3>You don't come from west Africa.</v>

1007
00:28:33.861 --> 00:28:35.140
<v Speaker 3>It was never very fast runner.</v>

1008
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 3>There were European dude short legs.</v>

1009
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.123
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to happen.</v>

1010
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 3>You have much longer legs than me though.</v>

1011
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.591
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

1012
00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I got the long torso.</v>

1013
00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 3>It's very unfortunate and mess.</v>

1014
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:43.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mess.</v>

1015
00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.400
<v Speaker 3>This why?</v>

1016
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Why we go to Montana.</v>

1017
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I got seven layers on a can't stay warm and you're all toasty cause you're but</v>

1018
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.373
<v Speaker 3>like an Inuit.</v>

1019
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm built like a fucking tulip.</v>

1020
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Why I just dressed right and cashmere.</v>

1021
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.393
<v Speaker 3>That's true too.</v>

1022
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Cause I have Hama a very classic cashmere.</v>

1023
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:00.220
<v Speaker 3>I was three layers.</v>

1024
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I was worried.</v>

1025
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Real hunting gear.</v>

1026
00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:02.940
<v Speaker 3>I was wearing Ryan Callahan.</v>

1027
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I brought three expensive layers of cashmere wool.</v>

1028
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.980
<v Speaker 3>It's all about wool,</v>

1029
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 3>wolves,</v>

1030
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:07.981
<v Speaker 3>wolves.</v>

1031
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:08.461
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1032
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.241
<v Speaker 3>Was amazing.</v>

1034
00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:10.800
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that in this day and age,</v>

1035
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:12.120
<v Speaker 3>like that's the best shit as well.</v>

1036
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Like a wool blend.</v>

1037
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

1038
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Even after all these years,</v>

1039
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:15.390
<v Speaker 3>if it gets wet,</v>

1040
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 3>you want to be in wool,</v>

1041
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.310
<v Speaker 3>they say cotton kills,</v>

1042
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:17.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1043
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes it does.</v>

1044
00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1045
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 3>You can get sweaty in the cotton and it sticks to you and cools your body down</v>

1046
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:25.200
<v Speaker 3>to the point where it gets dangerous.</v>

1047
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:26.190
<v Speaker 3>You can get hypothermia.</v>

1048
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.970
<v Speaker 3>It's just like being wet and it's not like you're going to take the clothes off,</v>

1049
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1050
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:32.880
<v Speaker 3>you're f you're outside frozen so you're fucked.</v>

1051
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:33.510
<v Speaker 3>No thanks.</v>

1052
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.141
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

1054
00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 3>don't want to die that way.</v>

1055
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.570
<v Speaker 3>We'll is what's up wools.</v>

1056
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1057
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.240
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1058
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 3>and they've,</v>

1059
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.281
<v Speaker 3>and they also,</v>

1060
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:38.791
<v Speaker 3>in this book,</v>

1061
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:41.100
<v Speaker 3>they also talk about the idea rod in different cultures of how,</v>

1062
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>like when you're</v>

1063
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 2>closer to the equator,</v>

1064
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you want longer limbs.</v>

1065
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:45.251
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1066
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a larger area of space for you to get rid of heat.</v>

1067
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1068
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at,</v>

1069
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1070
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.380
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>

1071
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:55.730
<v Speaker 2>people from Africa who,</v>

1072
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Kenya for example,</v>

1073
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.250
<v Speaker 2>they have a very different structure.</v>

1074
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Their bodies are structured differently than I was a born in a much higher</v>

1075
00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:03.041
<v Speaker 2>altitude.</v>

1076
00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 2>You're not beating a Kenyan in a long distance rate.</v>

1077
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Grace,</v>

1078
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 2>it ain't happening.</v>

1079
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't they run down animals until they die?</v>

1080
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Persistence.</v>

1081
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And that certainly was the,</v>

1082
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:12.401
<v Speaker 2>if you read,</v>

1083
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:12.941
<v Speaker 2>born to run,</v>

1084
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly what what our ancestors did.</v>

1085
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's why human beings are the best long distance runners of any animal,</v>

1086
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1087
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:19.930
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

1088
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.120
<v Speaker 2>we can run longer than any animal,</v>

1089
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 2>any antelope,</v>

1090
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:23.621
<v Speaker 2>any horse.</v>

1091
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.690
<v Speaker 2>We can run for a day.</v>

1092
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 2>If you train for it and no animal can do that.</v>

1093
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Tell me this,</v>

1094
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.660
<v Speaker 2>why don't cowboys ride people?</v>

1095
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1096
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I shit you going to ask me a question?</v>

1097
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Ride horses and horses and walk all day.</v>

1098
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:38.674
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

1099
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 2>You and your parables.</v>

1100
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Fucking stupid bullshit.</v>

1101
00:30:41.831 --> 00:30:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Sensei Joe.</v>

1102
00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.271
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

1103
00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 2>A person have worn Dorrance in a horse.</v>

1104
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.450
<v Speaker 2>That might be one of the dumbest things I've ever heard in my life.</v>

1105
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you have me as a guest?</v>

1106
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't buy that in any way.</v>

1107
00:30:51.731 --> 00:30:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Straight through for people ride bucking horses,</v>

1108
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1109
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Not only can a person ride a horse all day,</v>

1110
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.060
<v Speaker 2>but they're on the horse.</v>

1111
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 2>The horse is running with a person on them.</v>

1112
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true.</v>

1113
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Saddle if you're a fucking real man,</v>

1114
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:07.620
<v Speaker 2>if you traveled with rifles like Clint Eastwood in life,</v>

1115
00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:09.820
<v Speaker 2>we're given and my trench coat,</v>

1116
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I can't buy that sun and less.</v>

1117
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:12.761
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1118
00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:13.541
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a fact.</v>

1119
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a fact that human beings have the best long distance runners of</v>

1120
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:17.950
<v Speaker 2>any animal park.</v>

1121
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.370
<v Speaker 2>It'd be better than a horse because a horse actually cannot run after.</v>

1122
00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:23.260
<v Speaker 2>If you had a horse run for 26 miles,</v>

1123
00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 2>you can have a horse walk.</v>

1124
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.220
<v Speaker 2>If you had a horse run for 26 miles or 30 miles or whatever,</v>

1125
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 2>it would start to break down.</v>

1126
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1127
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.730
<v Speaker 2>And it will not do that well.</v>

1128
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:31.840
<v Speaker 2>It would even get a tail.</v>

1129
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Even a wild horse.</v>

1130
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 2>They never run long distances ever.</v>

1131
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.520
<v Speaker 2>So they're just running away from Cheetahs.</v>

1132
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1133
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.890
<v Speaker 2>they run stop cheetahs.</v>

1134
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Cheetahs like in a wild horse.</v>

1135
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Cause we have a lot of,</v>

1136
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.060
<v Speaker 2>you know why you can never domesticate a zebra.</v>

1137
00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:47.170
<v Speaker 2>They've tried a thousand times.</v>

1138
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Their dicks are two big nope.</v>

1139
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.563
<v Speaker 2>That's good question.</v>

1140
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1141
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Good answer.</v>

1142
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.351
<v Speaker 2>Good answer sir.</v>

1143
00:31:51.351 --> 00:31:52.184
<v Speaker 2>But you're wrong.</v>

1144
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why?</v>

1145
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Why they cannot they?</v>

1146
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Because a zebra will bite you.</v>

1147
00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:58.511
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing.</v>

1148
00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.321
<v Speaker 2>Horses will bite you.</v>

1149
00:31:59.321 --> 00:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Wild horses.</v>

1150
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.081
<v Speaker 2>It bites you.</v>

1151
00:32:00.081 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 2>It gets what is Ebro do.</v>

1152
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.073
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

1153
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:02.980
<v Speaker 2>And it won't let go.</v>

1154
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1155
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:04.211
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1156
00:32:04.211 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 2>No Zebra hold on you and start twisting it.</v>

1157
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.990
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>

1158
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1159
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.010
<v Speaker 2>So by two clamps onto like a pit bull,</v>

1160
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.590
<v Speaker 2>whether it's super long,</v>

1161
00:32:11.591 --> 00:32:12.281
<v Speaker 2>gigantic,</v>

1162
00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>powerful jaw.</v>

1163
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1164
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>You are never domesticating a cheetah.</v>

1165
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean a,</v>

1166
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1167
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1168
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.180
<v Speaker 2>never domesticating a zebra.</v>

1169
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 2>You're never riding a zebra and they've tried even crossbreeding it with other</v>

1170
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 2>animals ain't happening.</v>

1171
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 2>They fucking hate you.</v>

1172
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.410
<v Speaker 2>They're nasty striped motherfuckers.</v>

1173
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:28.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1174
00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine they would be Kentucky.</v>

1175
00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:31.271
<v Speaker 2>They have to be,</v>

1176
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 2>you're out there living with fucking crocodiles to left you and lines to the</v>

1177
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1178
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:36.911
<v Speaker 2>Sucks.</v>

1179
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Life is a zebra.</v>

1180
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.350
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be the worst life.</v>

1181
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 2>And you can't afford an ACL tear cause you don't have a year.</v>

1182
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:42.960
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1183
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.671
<v Speaker 2>we can say that.</v>

1184
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I was in Colorado recently and I saw a deer with a broken leg.</v>

1185
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 2>It was so sad.</v>

1186
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:49.470
<v Speaker 2>It was a dealer,</v>

1187
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.950
<v Speaker 2>a female deer with a mouthwatering.</v>

1188
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.680
<v Speaker 2>When you say that and then keep going because you got high before.</v>

1189
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I know I just love venison.</v>

1190
00:32:57.051 --> 00:32:57.884
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1191
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:01.731
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1192
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:05.630
<v Speaker 2>the poor dears bone was actually sticking out the bottom of its leg and it just</v>

1193
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:09.570
<v Speaker 2>made me think like instantly about medical care and about it,</v>

1194
00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1195
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 2>being a human and how much we take for granted,</v>

1196
00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>the ability to repair ourselves and the ability that doctors have,</v>

1197
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1198
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:17.181
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1199
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:22.181
<v Speaker 2>the ability that they have today of fixing so many ailments with the human body.</v>

1200
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 2>When I went to Springfield,</v>

1201
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Lincoln Museum.</v>

1202
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln lost three of his children,</v>

1203
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.080
<v Speaker 2>but a tad at for Willie at 11.</v>

1204
00:33:30.081 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And in his other son at 17 on both to typhus,</v>

1205
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:33.590
<v Speaker 2>fever.</v>

1206
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 2>And I thought to myself,</v>

1207
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 2>the present United States lost three of his kids to disease back then.</v>

1208
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.220
<v Speaker 2>That was so commonplace.</v>

1209
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And he had one child left by the time he died.</v>

1210
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I believe in and think about you and I have kids.</v>

1211
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Think about the misery of a four year old losing a four year old,</v>

1212
00:33:46.801 --> 00:33:47.210
<v Speaker 2>11 year old.</v>

1213
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 2>We can't imagine it.</v>

1214
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.700
<v Speaker 2>That was the norm back then.</v>

1215
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Bearing a child,</v>

1216
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 2>why didn't have vaccines,</v>

1217
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.030
<v Speaker 2>didn't have antibiotics,</v>

1218
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.210
<v Speaker 2>didn't have anesthesia,</v>

1219
00:33:54.211 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 2>it didn't have medical care the way we do now and didn't even know really what</v>

1220
00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:58.161
<v Speaker 2>pathogens were.</v>

1221
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:01.130
<v Speaker 2>So when dip theory and typhus fever and things like that rolled through,</v>

1222
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1223
00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 2>this is why I get so mad at the anti vaccine movement.</v>

1224
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Pick up a history book,</v>

1225
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 2>pick up a history book and see what happened before we had that kind of</v>

1226
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>

1227
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.170
<v Speaker 2>We owe a great deal to people like you on a sock and the inventors of things</v>

1228
00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:16.430
<v Speaker 2>like the smallpox vaccine,</v>

1229
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.390
<v Speaker 2>those are horrible.</v>

1230
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Not just diseases but also surgery.</v>

1231
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:20.870
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1232
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.340
<v Speaker 2>what they're able to do today.</v>

1233
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:27.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's the first ever FDA approved bionic eye is ready for commercial</v>

1234
00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:30.340
<v Speaker 2>launch in the U s yeah.</v>

1235
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Pull that up on my,</v>

1236
00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:31.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1237
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.090
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1238
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:32.923
<v Speaker 2>Pulled it up on my,</v>

1239
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.280
<v Speaker 2>it's on my Twitter feed.</v>

1240
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I put it on there this morning.</v>

1241
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:36.360
<v Speaker 2>It's on Cnet,</v>

1242
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:36.681
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1243
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 2>We are bashing with machines now.</v>

1244
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.180
<v Speaker 2>There's a little commercial that plays before,</v>

1245
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's incredible.</v>

1246
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:42.291
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1247
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1248
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.040
<v Speaker 2>they've been working on this bionic eye and,</v>

1249
00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:46.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1250
00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:49.140
<v Speaker 2>the first ever FDA approved bionic,</v>

1251
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 2>I will soon be launching commercially in the United States device device.</v>

1252
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Could help tens of thousands of people suffer from a rare degenerative eye</v>

1253
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:57.074
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

1254
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.900
<v Speaker 2>So is it an actual eyeball or something or,</v>

1255
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.823
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1256
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:01.783
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1257
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 2>But it's allowing people to see,</v>

1258
00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's something you wear like glasses.</v>

1259
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.690
<v Speaker 2>It attaches to the optic nerve or something.</v>

1260
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:07.971
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1261
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

1262
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1263
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 2>This is some Super Cyborg Shit.</v>

1264
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

1265
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:13.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:15.310
<v Speaker 2>This guy was a blind guy.</v>

1267
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Now he's moving around.</v>

1268
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:19.000
<v Speaker 2>This is insane.</v>

1269
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:19.791
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1270
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:20.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1271
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 2>he's got these glasses on and he,</v>

1272
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:23.683
<v Speaker 2>he's uh,</v>

1273
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.460
<v Speaker 2>doing all kinds of different shit.</v>

1274
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.650
<v Speaker 2>This is really kind of naughty.</v>

1275
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.493
<v Speaker 2>Let's hear this.</v>

1276
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.040
<v Speaker 5>Tony Dean Lloyd suffers from retinitis Pigmentosa,</v>

1277
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Speaker 5>a degenerative eye disease,</v>

1278
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 5>which destroys photo receptors,</v>

1279
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:35.300
<v Speaker 5>cells,</v>

1280
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>and impedes a person's ability to detect light.</v>

1281
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 5>I saw nothing I slept.</v>

1282
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:43.500
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I could ascertain daytime from nighttime.</v>

1283
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 5>That was the only thing I could be say for 17 years.</v>

1284
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:47.551
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

1285
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:51.720
<v Speaker 5>A device at 20 years in the making that will soon be commercially available in</v>

1286
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:56.520
<v Speaker 5>the US is helping patients like Lloyd I perception was sort of like a flash of</v>

1287
00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 5>light or a star that you might see in the sky.</v>

1288
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.911
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1289
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1290
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 5>I can see boundaries and borders.</v>

1291
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.770
<v Speaker 5>The artists to buy second site was FDA approved earlier this year and patients</v>

1292
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:11.931
<v Speaker 5>are being screened at the 12 major US hospitals chosen as implant centers and</v>

1293
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 5>you can hear it beeping away.</v>

1294
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.330
<v Speaker 5>The device includes a chip with an array of electrodes that's implanted on the</v>

1295
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:23.331
<v Speaker 5>retina and glasses with a video camera that wirelessly transmits images.</v>

1296
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:29.060
<v Speaker 5>It converts that video into a 60 pixel image that then delivers electronic</v>

1297
00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:34.851
<v Speaker 5>impulses to the 60 little electrodes in the chip that then stimulate the retina</v>

1298
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.030
<v Speaker 5>to generate,</v>

1299
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1300
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.991
<v Speaker 5>perception.</v>

1301
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 5>Our message that the brain can then interpret and understand.</v>

1302
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:40.800
<v Speaker 5>They're just not credible.</v>

1303
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.720
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't restore vision,</v>

1304
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 5>but patients can detect light and dark.</v>

1305
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 5>Thus identifying an object location and movement or walk down the sidewalk.</v>

1306
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 5>My bus stop to my office on a daily basis and I can see where the grass comes up</v>

1307
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:59.520
<v Speaker 5>til I sidewalk this like concrete color.</v>

1308
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.170
<v Speaker 5>The device is not going to enable them to drive a car or you know,</v>

1309
00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:05.720
<v Speaker 5>read fine print on a newspaper,</v>

1310
00:37:05.721 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 5>but that it might help them enjoy a better quality of life.</v>

1311
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.610
<v Speaker 5>Some patients report that they can see the outline,</v>

1312
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.103
<v Speaker 2>but it's a start.</v>

1313
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:13.591
<v Speaker 2>It's a start.</v>

1314
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a start.</v>

1315
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.201
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

1317
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:16.831
<v Speaker 2>I know they have,</v>

1318
00:37:16.831 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1319
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 2>they have implants now too for certain,</v>

1320
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1321
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 2>certain things that go wrong with people's eyes.</v>

1322
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Like someone was talking about their,</v>

1323
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.710
<v Speaker 2>their grandmother.</v>

1324
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Was it Kathleen Madigan was talking about her grandmother driving all of her</v>

1325
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:31.530
<v Speaker 2>friends around because she had her eyes fixed.</v>

1326
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1327
00:37:32.401 --> 00:37:33.234
<v Speaker 2>you told me about that.</v>

1328
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:33.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1329
00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:34.524
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

1330
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it was Kathleen,</v>

1331
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1332
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.163
<v Speaker 2>whoever it was,</v>

1333
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1334
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 2>we're getting close to,</v>

1335
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:40.051
<v Speaker 2>I just can't,</v>

1336
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:40.890
<v Speaker 2>as I'm reading this book,</v>

1337
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.280
<v Speaker 2>this portion,</v>

1338
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:41.551
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

1339
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:43.410
<v Speaker 2>when are they going to come up with gene doping where I can,</v>

1340
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:46.090
<v Speaker 2>my whole body can be ridiculously fast.</v>

1341
00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Twitch.</v>

1342
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to be able to be a zebra one day.</v>

1343
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:49.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1344
00:37:49.221 --> 00:37:49.600
<v Speaker 2>that's big.</v>

1345
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.433
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be that crutch.</v>

1346
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Craig venter says,</v>

1347
00:37:51.421 --> 00:37:51.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1348
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a brain inside of zebras body.</v>

1349
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

1350
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you could do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

1351
00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:56.101
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

1352
00:37:56.101 --> 00:37:57.330
<v Speaker 2>This is what I blew my mind about,</v>

1353
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:57.901
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

1354
00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:58.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1355
00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.820
<v Speaker 2>so if you take a huge guy like,</v>

1356
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1357
00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I Allister over rain or you know,</v>

1358
00:38:01.561 --> 00:38:02.394
<v Speaker 2>Brendan Shop,</v>

1359
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 2>do you know how much more his skeleton ways than say mine?</v>

1360
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:06.361
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1361
00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm 170 pound guy,</v>

1362
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 2>but I probably a lot more,</v>

1363
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1364
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1365
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.840
<v Speaker 2>6.5 pounds more maybe.</v>

1366
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:13.861
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1367
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:14.251
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1368
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:15.084
<v Speaker 2>In that crazy.</v>

1369
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1370
00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:17.850
<v Speaker 2>because you have to look at it as a book bookshelf.</v>

1371
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Some people have a wider bookshelf,</v>

1372
00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.020
<v Speaker 2>but actually the bones themselves are our six,</v>

1373
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:23.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1374
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>they're a little bit wider.</v>

1375
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.050
<v Speaker 2>The structure of your skeletons,</v>

1376
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 2>a little bit like inches,</v>

1377
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:27.820
<v Speaker 2>like inches,</v>

1378
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.653
<v Speaker 2>like say three,</v>

1379
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.050
<v Speaker 2>three inches in leg bone is a lot.</v>

1380
00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:31.291
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1381
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 2>So now you're 65 or whatever.</v>

1382
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1383
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1384
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1385
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1386
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 1>actual scaffolding allows you to put on.</v>

1387
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:38.981
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1388
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1389
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:39.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1390
00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what the ratio is,</v>

1391
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:46.021
<v Speaker 1>but like 1.1 pounds of muscle can support 11 pounds of bone can support 11</v>

1392
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:47.240
<v Speaker 1>pounds of muscle.</v>

1393
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:47.610
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1394
00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 1>so just kind of like,</v>

1395
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:48.881
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1396
00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 1>but this is in the book,</v>

1397
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.000
<v Speaker 1>but I was amazed at that.</v>

1398
00:38:51.001 --> 00:38:51.761
<v Speaker 1>Like a huge guy.</v>

1399
00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Only his bone structure is only 6.5 pounds heavier.</v>

1400
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:55.031
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't get,</v>

1401
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:56.230
<v Speaker 1>he's an NFL Lineman,</v>

1402
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.450
<v Speaker 1>one of us,</v>

1403
00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.180
<v Speaker 1>like much,</v>

1404
00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:58.771
<v Speaker 1>much heavier.</v>

1405
00:38:58.771 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1406
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.000
<v Speaker 1>the rest is bones and,</v>

1407
00:39:00.001 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 1>and the rest is muscle and tendon tissue.</v>

1408
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:02.700
<v Speaker 1>It's quite some money.</v>

1409
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a lot of fucking weight and muscle and tendon smashing you down with</v>

1410
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:07.060
<v Speaker 1>the extra 60 pounds.</v>

1411
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1412
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:08.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1413
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1414
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 1>It's weird though that it's only six pounds.</v>

1415
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I was amazed at that.</v>

1416
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a wealth of information,</v>

1417
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:13.781
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1418
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I would have assumed it was way more than that.</v>

1419
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I would have assumed it was like 50 or something crazy.</v>

1420
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:18.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1421
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting him on my podcast.</v>

1422
00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>

1423
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1424
00:39:21.221 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 1>human body weight is a fascinating thing to me because I watch all these guys</v>

1425
00:39:25.421 --> 00:39:28.660
<v Speaker 1>cut weight for fighting and it's just really shocking.</v>

1426
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

1427
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.820
<v Speaker 1>what's possible like water,</v>

1428
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:31.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1429
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:32.130
<v Speaker 1>How much water you lose.</v>

1430
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Different guys do it a different way.</v>

1431
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Some guys lose,</v>

1432
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1433
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.020
<v Speaker 1>all their body fat first and then they dehydrate,</v>

1434
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.430
<v Speaker 1>the discipline that it takes to get to like your optimum weight.</v>

1436
00:39:42.431 --> 00:39:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Like Damien Maia is finally at one 70 for a long time.</v>

1437
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:49.810
<v Speaker 1>He fought at one 85 and he just couldn't overpower these guys like that.</v>

1438
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1439
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:52.930
<v Speaker 1>he's dealing with a lot of guys that were like really physically strong.</v>

1440
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Like to Anderson Anderson's very physically strong.</v>

1441
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.130
<v Speaker 1>So even if he could get ahold of Anderson that fight,</v>

1442
00:39:57.131 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 1>which he really had a hard to have you or you've talked to a fighters to talk</v>

1443
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>about strong.</v>

1444
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.431
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

1445
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Speaker 1>He's very physically strong and beans.</v>

1446
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.053
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1447
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1448
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Anderson's very physically strong.</v>

1449
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.550
<v Speaker 1>You can tell in the,</v>

1450
00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:06.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1451
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:11.420
<v Speaker 1>the rich Franklin fights when Anderson locks a hold of him with the Thai camp.</v>

1452
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a nasty Thai clinch.</v>

1453
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really good and rich,</v>

1454
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.490
<v Speaker 1>rich Franklin is a very strong guy and rich Franklin up until that fight,</v>

1455
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:20.400
<v Speaker 1>it never really been dominated in a fight.</v>

1456
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.700
<v Speaker 1>He had some good fights,</v>

1457
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:22.210
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1458
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 1>some wins and some losses.</v>

1459
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:24.910
<v Speaker 1>He fought well,</v>

1460
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:25.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1461
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:26.680
<v Speaker 1>all throughout his career.</v>

1462
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.170
<v Speaker 1>But that was the first fight where it looked like he really just,</v>

1463
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.090
<v Speaker 1>he was on another level,</v>

1464
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was fighting just done a completely different league.</v>

1465
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 1>And a big part of that was Anderson controlling him and the Thai clinch</v>

1466
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 1>controlling him and just,</v>

1467
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and then with knees,</v>

1468
00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:39.790
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1469
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:40.640
<v Speaker 1>his Thai clinch,</v>

1470
00:40:40.641 --> 00:40:41.440
<v Speaker 1>his death.</v>

1471
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1472
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:42.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a strong guy.</v>

1473
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.201
<v Speaker 1>Plus he has one,</v>

1474
00:40:44.201 --> 00:40:44.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:47.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to have that kind of one punch knockout power,</v>

1476
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1477
00:40:48.161 --> 00:40:50.410
<v Speaker 1>and be able to submit guys with triangles as well,</v>

1478
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 1>unless you have some physical.</v>

1479
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.260
<v Speaker 1>How tall is Anderson?</v>

1480
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1481
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.011
<v Speaker 1>would you say?</v>

1482
00:40:54.011 --> 00:40:54.431
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1483
00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:54.671
<v Speaker 1>Six.</v>

1484
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

1485
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.540
<v Speaker 1>He's 60,</v>

1486
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:55.901
<v Speaker 1>not six.</v>

1487
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

1488
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe six to whatever it says.</v>

1489
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 1>How much shorter is he than Jon Jones?</v>

1490
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Jon is not just taller.</v>

1491
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:04.630
<v Speaker 1>John's just much bigger.</v>

1492
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:05.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1493
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.640
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a two inch thing,</v>

1494
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:07.781
<v Speaker 1>that two inches.</v>

1495
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:09.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a million miles.</v>

1496
00:41:09.191 --> 00:41:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.830
<v Speaker 1>John is a big dude with those long arms.</v>

1498
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1499
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.800
<v Speaker 1>John's a master at a distance.</v>

1500
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.070
<v Speaker 1>How about using the opposite?</v>

1501
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

1502
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.330
<v Speaker 1>so if you're a smaller guy and you're dealing with a guy like John,</v>

1503
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.840
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna fuck you up at a distance that you can't touch him.</v>

1504
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's the master at that.</v>

1505
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>If you watch his fight with Rashad Evans,</v>

1506
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you watch his fight with Quintin Jackson.</v>

1507
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.610
<v Speaker 1>He's the master at keeping guys and the end of his shots like,</v>

1508
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and they come at him.</v>

1509
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1510
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.071
<v Speaker 1>On the shoulders,</v>

1511
00:41:34.071 --> 00:41:35.000
<v Speaker 1>pushes him off,</v>

1512
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:35.931
<v Speaker 1>kick to the leg,</v>

1513
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 1>pushes him off,</v>

1514
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 1>back to my range,</v>

1515
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.751
<v Speaker 1>back to my range,</v>

1516
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 1>back to the range where only he can hit you.</v>

1517
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:40.731
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1518
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 1>So he's like sniping at you and then when you come out of him he just controls</v>

1519
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1520
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.180
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that he's got the great wrestling.</v>

1521
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if you actually do clinch up with them,</v>

1522
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

1523
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 1>He's ridiculously physically strong,</v>

1524
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:53.340
<v Speaker 1>very technical,</v>

1525
00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.560
<v Speaker 1>and he's a really good fucking wrestler.</v>

1526
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 1>He's got some real skills.</v>

1527
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Plus we'll do wild shit.</v>

1528
00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1529
00:41:59.151 --> 00:41:59.290
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1530
00:41:59.290 --> 00:41:59.841
<v Speaker 1>he'll like,</v>

1531
00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:00.720
<v Speaker 1>he'll throw dude.</v>

1532
00:42:00.721 --> 00:42:01.880
<v Speaker 1>So launch dudes for the hair.</v>

1533
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Like people forget about that.</v>

1534
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't been doing that,</v>

1535
00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1536
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:05.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1537
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 1>John was like smashing guys in the beginning of his career.</v>

1538
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look the [inaudible] fight,</v>

1539
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Speaker 1>like the first fight where Gustava Dante is when he was in the UFC,</v>

1540
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 1>he launched that dude.</v>

1541
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1542
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:16.641
<v Speaker 1>launched him.</v>

1543
00:42:16.641 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1544
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1545
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.480
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy to why stronger than people think it's not the right name.</v>

1546
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1547
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.441
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1548
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:22.520
<v Speaker 1>he's very strong.</v>

1549
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 1>He's very strong.</v>

1550
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1551
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.191
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1552
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:27.080
<v Speaker 1>that last fight was incredible.</v>

1553
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Him and Gustafson,</v>

1554
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the most amazing fights,</v>

1555
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I think the most amazing fight I've ever seen.</v>

1556
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:36.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's saying a lot because you've seen thousand fights.</v>

1557
00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:36.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1558
00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was.</v>

1559
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1560
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1561
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.430
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say like what's the most amazing,</v>

1562
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly in right?</v>

1563
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.401
<v Speaker 1>Shocking,</v>

1564
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:43.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1565
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1566
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.163
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1567
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1568
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.550
<v Speaker 1>it's right up there.</v>

1569
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1570
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how they're,</v>

1571
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:51.440
<v Speaker 1>how they're going to adjust their training for this next fight.</v>

1572
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:52.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1573
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:53.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1574
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1575
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I know that I,</v>

1576
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm really looking forward to the junior dos Santos,</v>

1577
00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:58.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1578
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Cain Velasquez fight because John Gray goose mouth.</v>

1579
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.910
<v Speaker 1>That's who it was.</v>

1580
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Gustavo Dante is cause it's Tom looked down to as a,</v>

1581
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.120
<v Speaker 1>as a Jujitsu guy.</v>

1582
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.461
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1583
00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:06.230
<v Speaker 1>my apologist,</v>

1584
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 1>it was Andre Goose Mallee farm.</v>

1585
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 1>That was when he first started launching people through the air spinning elbows.</v>

1586
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's just a few years ago,</v>

1587
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:14.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1588
00:43:14.481 --> 00:43:15.380
<v Speaker 1>which is really weird.</v>

1589
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:19.460
<v Speaker 1>That was the 2008 credit seems like last missing,</v>

1590
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.271
<v Speaker 1>it seems like three months.</v>

1591
00:43:20.271 --> 00:43:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1592
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:21.681
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you what,</v>

1593
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:22.514
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1594
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him in some tough fights.</v>

1595
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him in some really good fights.</v>

1596
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody get that close to him as as Gustafson did.</v>

1597
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:29.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1598
00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:32.780
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I was when they lined up and you and I were right there cage side,</v>

1599
00:43:32.781 --> 00:43:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I noticed was that he would,</v>

1600
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that goes Gustafson.</v>

1601
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:35.763
<v Speaker 1>It's taller.</v>

1602
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.160
<v Speaker 1>John is an inch taller.</v>

1603
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1604
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.790
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1605
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1606
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.203
<v Speaker 1>He's a big dude,</v>

1607
00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1608
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.270
<v Speaker 1>That kind of got a lot better.</v>

1609
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He got a little better.</v>

1610
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 1>3.5% of Americans are,</v>

1611
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that are our six three are over in that crazy.</v>

1612
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.180
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>

1613
00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.340
<v Speaker 1>an inside the UFC thing they're doing about Gustafson when they showed him</v>

1614
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 1>training a up for the fight and the attitude that this guy has,</v>

1615
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:00.044
<v Speaker 1>this guy's like,</v>

1616
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>he's straight viking,</v>

1617
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:02.560
<v Speaker 1>straight up fucking,</v>

1618
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.960
<v Speaker 1>it's all stoic is straight Vikki DNA.</v>

1619
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he said,</v>

1620
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.353
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1621
00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm never satisfied.</v>

1622
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.041
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1623
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:10.721
<v Speaker 1>the life of a,</v>

1624
00:44:10.721 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 1>an elite athlete is you're never satisfied.</v>

1625
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:16.010
<v Speaker 1>You can never be happy with what you did because then you're going to get fucked</v>

1626
00:44:16.011 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1627
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.761
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1628
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:17.091
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1629
00:44:17.091 --> 00:44:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that was his attitude every day,</v>

1630
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:20.540
<v Speaker 1>no matter how dominant he is.</v>

1631
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:20.721
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1632
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

1633
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.630
<v Speaker 1>that was like how he seemed like after his fight,</v>

1634
00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>like after his fight it was like,</v>

1635
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:25.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1636
00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:25.791
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1637
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:26.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1638
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:27.110
<v Speaker 1>it was what it was.</v>

1639
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:27.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1640
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 1>John's a good fighter and that's it.</v>

1641
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.051
<v Speaker 1>That's how me,</v>

1642
00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:31.680
<v Speaker 1>he let it go on moving on.</v>

1643
00:44:31.681 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

1644
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I think he realizes that this is the part of a trilogy that you know,</v>

1645
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 1>no time to relax.</v>

1646
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Well I wish they would just get right after it.</v>

1647
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

1648
00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1649
00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1650
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm torn because I really want to see Glover versus John.</v>

1651
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really interesting fight and Glover is a fucking killer.</v>

1652
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.260
<v Speaker 1>He's a killer.</v>

1653
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.450
<v Speaker 1>That guy's dangerous.</v>

1654
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Glover is very,</v>

1655
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:53.281
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1656
00:44:53.281 --> 00:44:53.701
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1657
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:55.230
<v Speaker 1>very highly on the wrestling team too.</v>

1658
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:57.030
<v Speaker 1>He's a wrestler as well as did you described,</v>

1659
00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:02.260
<v Speaker 1>could have easily been a world champion by now and in any other way class with</v>

1660
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 1>any other set of circumstances.</v>

1661
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 1>If he had been in the UFC earlier and had a chance to fight against higher</v>

1662
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:08.610
<v Speaker 1>levels of competition just six,</v>

1663
00:45:08.611 --> 00:45:09.570
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago,</v>

1664
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 1>he could have been a champion.</v>

1665
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 1>That's no bullshit.</v>

1666
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.171
<v Speaker 1>That's legit.</v>

1667
00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:15.300
<v Speaker 1>He had a v a big time visa issue.</v>

1668
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:16.700
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at like the,</v>

1669
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.790
<v Speaker 1>the highest level guys who knows who's going to win when they get in there,</v>

1670
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but you all know who the top guys are.</v>

1671
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 1>And on any given night in a lot of search circumstances,</v>

1672
00:45:26.581 --> 00:45:28.110
<v Speaker 1>like the hundred 70 pound division,</v>

1673
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 1>George dominates that division,</v>

1674
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:30.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1675
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Georgia has been beating everybody,</v>

1676
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:36.770
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is he's surrounded by a bunch of murderers everywhere he turns,</v>

1677
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and at any given day,</v>

1678
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys could get them.</v>

1679
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Carlos condit almost got him.</v>

1680
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:44.220
<v Speaker 1>He had kicked him and dropped him.</v>

1681
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Matt Serra got him.</v>

1682
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:47.430
<v Speaker 1>He was the only guy to ever really get them like that.</v>

1683
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

1684
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hughes got him,</v>

1685
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 1>caught him in an arm bar back early in his career.</v>

1686
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1687
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:55.950
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at like the amount of murderers in his division,</v>

1688
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it makes you realize how good he is.</v>

1689
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1690
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Carlos condit is as good as it gets.</v>

1691
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Even better now.</v>

1692
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I know it's even better now.</v>

1693
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He's even better now.</v>

1694
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 1>He got that loss,</v>

1695
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 1>made him take it to the next level.</v>

1696
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:08.670
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1697
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1698
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:10.320
<v Speaker 1>he's just phenomenal.</v>

1699
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.210
<v Speaker 1>That's his fucking last fight.</v>

1700
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

1701
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Martin Kampmann.</v>

1702
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a beautiful man.</v>

1703
00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:14.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1704
00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1705
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>

1706
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I watched this fight with Gis.</v>

1707
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I was rooting for DSG.</v>

1708
00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I Love des because Nick Diaz is my hero.</v>

1709
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I just love his attitude and,</v>

1710
00:46:21.331 --> 00:46:26.331
<v Speaker 1>and every single girl that is watching Carlos Condit faluting mine is literally</v>

1711
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.281
<v Speaker 1>go wide.</v>

1712
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:29.451
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1713
00:46:29.451 --> 00:46:30.010
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1714
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:30.231
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1715
00:46:30.231 --> 00:46:30.901
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

1716
00:46:30.901 --> 00:46:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad about myself and jealous and I was,</v>

1717
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I could have been rooting for content more.</v>

1718
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And then I watched them just keep turning that corner.</v>

1719
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1720
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 1>you got to give it to this guy.</v>

1721
00:46:37.081 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 1>He's like a bonafide new Mexican cowboy.</v>

1722
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 1>He sure has.</v>

1723
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Man Wash Stud.</v>

1724
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1725
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.081
<v Speaker 1>He's getting better.</v>

1726
00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1727
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Genetically he's got much longer legs than I do,</v>

1728
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

1729
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:45.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1730
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:46.644
<v Speaker 1>he's very tall.</v>

1731
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>He's very tall and he knows how to use it and he's,</v>

1732
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:50.850
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1733
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he has it a lot of people don't talk about is his</v>

1734
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:54.774
<v Speaker 1>fitness.</v>

1735
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 1>His fitness level is like very elite.</v>

1736
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 1>The pace that he could keep in a fight.</v>

1737
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.380
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that he,</v>

1738
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:02.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1739
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that always worked with Nick Diaz,</v>

1740
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1741
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:04.471
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1742
00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:06.180
<v Speaker 1>his ability to outpace guys.</v>

1743
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1744
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.580
<v Speaker 1>there's times in a fight and it's,</v>

1745
00:47:08.581 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 1>if you've never fought before,</v>

1746
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:11.070
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine.</v>

1747
00:47:11.071 --> 00:47:15.150
<v Speaker 1>But there's times in a fight where one guy is coasting or were you sort of</v>

1748
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:20.151
<v Speaker 1>almost agree to coast or where you know everybody relaxes the aggression a</v>

1749
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:21.061
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1750
00:47:21.061 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Like in a tough fight.</v>

1751
00:47:21.961 --> 00:47:23.960
<v Speaker 1>25 minute fight happens and yeah,</v>

1752
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:27.150
<v Speaker 1>because you don't go 100% you have to pace yourself.</v>

1753
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Well Nick Diaz can go just a little</v>

1754
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 2>bit faster,</v>

1755
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.560
<v Speaker 2>a little bit longer and he can go round after round of dry.</v>

1756
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 2>He could do 30 minutes of MMA.</v>

1757
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 2>It's called doing triathlons.</v>

1758
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1759
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.100
<v Speaker 2>It's called long training or overtraining.</v>

1760
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.300
<v Speaker 2>His masonic overtrading caught long training.</v>

1761
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.640
<v Speaker 2>His endurance is insane.</v>

1762
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's insane.</v>

1763
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 2>So he would just get on guys like a guy like Paul daily.</v>

1764
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Just get on him and stay on it.</v>

1765
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1766
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.630
<v Speaker 2>just go after him.</v>

1767
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:53.464
<v Speaker 2>Talk Shit.</v>

1768
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:54.543
<v Speaker 2>Boxers.</v>

1769
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 2>The coaches would have you run for an hour and a half slowly.</v>

1770
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:57.641
<v Speaker 2>Not Long.</v>

1771
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 2>They keep your heart rate up at a certain level.</v>

1772
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:00.700
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like triathlon training.</v>

1773
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Back in the day as a boxer,</v>

1774
00:48:02.771 --> 00:48:03.431
<v Speaker 2>they would make you,</v>

1775
00:48:03.431 --> 00:48:04.151
<v Speaker 2>if you're running a fighting,</v>

1776
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 2>a 15 round fight,</v>

1777
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:05.973
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

1778
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 2>They would make you literally run for an hour and a half to two hours and it</v>

1779
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be long running.</v>

1780
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be hard running but it would be running.</v>

1781
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:14.163
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>

1782
00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.190
<v Speaker 2>they never really found a substitute for that particular kind of training for</v>

1783
00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:18.251
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1784
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 2>for fighting because it puts you into a cardiovascular state,</v>

1785
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1786
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 2>where where you will,</v>

1787
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 2>you will be able to sustain for set for a long time and man,</v>

1788
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.320
<v Speaker 2>just having been arrested or six minutes is,</v>

1789
00:48:29.321 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 2>is an Aeon nine minutes in college freestyle is a nightmare.</v>

1790
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1791
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine 15,</v>

1792
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine 25 minutes.</v>

1793
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:37.360
<v Speaker 2>When you're mixing and punching,</v>

1794
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.240
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1795
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.750
<v Speaker 2>it's truly,</v>

1796
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 2>you truly have to be,</v>

1797
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:42.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1798
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:42.840
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1799
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.651
<v Speaker 2>a freak and,</v>

1800
00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 2>and even being able to your vo Max being some people just either have it or</v>

1801
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:47.981
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1802
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:52.981
<v Speaker 2>That's another genetic thing where you can either use oxygen more efficiently</v>

1803
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.330
<v Speaker 2>when you're boxing,</v>

1804
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.193
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>

1805
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:56.951
<v Speaker 2>cycling,</v>

1806
00:48:56.951 --> 00:48:57.784
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>

1807
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Some people just convert auction in a much more efficient manner into their red</v>

1808
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 2>blood cells.</v>

1809
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Then do other people.</v>

1810
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 2>So your vo Max can be worked on for sure.</v>

1811
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:07.931
<v Speaker 2>And you can,</v>

1812
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:09.650
<v Speaker 2>you can increase your cardiovascular risk.</v>

1813
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.410
<v Speaker 2>But some people just have a jump on it,</v>

1814
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1815
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.830
<v Speaker 2>like depending on what your genetic makeup,</v>

1816
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:14.771
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>

1817

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.750
<v Speaker 2>not that he even did drugs,</v>

1863
00:50:22.751 --> 00:50:26.550
<v Speaker 2>but that he destroyed other people who accused him of doing drugs and he got</v>

1864
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits and everything else.</v>

1865
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.160
<v Speaker 1>He used,</v>

1867
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 1>he was a bad influence and money to,</v>

1868
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:33.710
<v Speaker 1>to do harm to the bad guy.</v>

1869
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.200
<v Speaker 1>And people who were calling him out on it,</v>

1870
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Speaker 1>we're calling them out because they wanted everyone to be,</v>

1871
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1872
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Well there are also some point in time,</v>

1873
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 1>some of them were subpoenaed,</v>

1874
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.260
<v Speaker 1>some of them didn't have a choice.</v>

1875
00:50:42.261 --> 00:50:43.094
<v Speaker 1>They were brought up on,</v>

1876
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1877
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.061
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1878
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:45.230
<v Speaker 1>when the u s government's going,</v>

1879
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1880
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:46.311
<v Speaker 1>you better tell the truth.</v>

1881
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:46.971
<v Speaker 1>You're going to jail,</v>

1882
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:47.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to tell the truth.</v>

1883
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is what the,</v>

1884
00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:49.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1885
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 1>the argument against it or the personal freedom argument I don't think really</v>

1886
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 1>works in this one because I think you have to know exactly what's there,</v>

1887
00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 1>what everyone's doing to find out if it in fact it's safe.</v>

1888
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're dealing with this is an extraordinarily dirty sport,</v>

1889
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.050
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily dirty,</v>

1890
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:10.090
<v Speaker 1>like perhaps 90 plus percent of the top people and 100% of the winners are doing</v>

1891
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:11.630
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1892
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.920
<v Speaker 1>They're taking blood out of their body,</v>

1893
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 1>they're putting it back in their body.</v>

1894
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 1>That's super common.</v>

1895
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.150
<v Speaker 1>They like to do that one.</v>

1896
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:17.441
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1897
00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1898
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 1>they elect to use EPO,</v>

1899
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.750
<v Speaker 1>which does the same thing through a chemical.</v>

1900
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.280
<v Speaker 1>They're all on testosterone.</v>

1901
00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:22.881
<v Speaker 1>They're the,</v>

1902
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:27.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually been argued that it's safer to do the Tour de France.</v>

1903
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1904
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:29.263
<v Speaker 1>So I say France.</v>

1905
00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>

1906
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1907
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:32.223
<v Speaker 1>We're all done.</v>

1908
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:34.520
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing that you just did that.</v>

1909
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I never would have expected them to do that.</v>

1910
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:37.521
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

1911
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:38.860
<v Speaker 1>The Tour de France would it flows.</v>

1912
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.321
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1913
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:40.860
<v Speaker 1>no Chaddam one time and said no,</v>

1914
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:47.390
<v Speaker 1>this one doctor was saying that it actually might be safer to do it on the drugs</v>

1915
00:51:47.421 --> 00:51:50.360
<v Speaker 1>then to do it off it because it's such a strain on your body when you do it</v>

1916
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.400
<v Speaker 1>without the reserves.</v>

1917
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 1>So talking about like it's all about your ability to recover from what you're</v>

1918
00:51:55.701 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 1>putting out and how much can you put out and how much can you recover and how</v>

1919
00:51:58.731 --> 00:51:59.780
<v Speaker 1>well do you know your body?</v>

1920
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.070
<v Speaker 1>What a certain point points time.</v>

1921
00:52:01.071 --> 00:52:04.780
<v Speaker 1>These guys were in running a little late thirties and they were covering like he</v>

1922
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.930
<v Speaker 1>like young pups,</v>

1923
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.280
<v Speaker 1>like 18 year olds.</v>

1924
00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:08.720
<v Speaker 1>You ever see an 18 year old get a scratch?</v>

1925
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 1>It's gone tomorrow.</v>

1926
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.761
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

1927
00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:11.594
<v Speaker 1>he loved the,</v>

1928
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:12.580
<v Speaker 1>they're like the Wolverine.</v>

1929
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Other heal.</v>

1930
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1931
00:52:13.551 --> 00:52:14.660
<v Speaker 1>do you remember how your hard,</v>

1932
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 1>your Dick was always hard when you were 18 like those levels of hormones are</v>

1933
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>never reached again.</v>

1934
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:21.141
<v Speaker 1>I never forgot.</v>

1935
00:52:21.141 --> 00:52:21.974
<v Speaker 1>One time I was,</v>

1936
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this girl.</v>

1937
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:23.840
<v Speaker 1>There's like young lists.</v>

1938
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like 23.</v>

1939
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:25.641
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York,</v>

1940
00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I was on my way to theater class and I'm walking down like,</v>

1941
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 1>like Alexa,</v>

1942
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.070
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just thinking about this.</v>

1943
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:32.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1944
00:52:32.601 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 1>this girl.</v>

1945
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 1>And I start getting a fucking Chubby as I'm walking.</v>

1946
00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing these pants and I hear this big,</v>

1947
00:52:38.811 --> 00:52:40.850
<v Speaker 1>very gay black man go,</v>

1948
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1949
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:42.583
<v Speaker 1>he got,</v>

1950
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:50.540
<v Speaker 1>he started and he started walking along with me,</v>

1951
00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 1>looking at packages is handicapped,</v>

1952
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:53.920
<v Speaker 1>will look and go on.</v>

1953
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And he was just so into me and I was like,</v>

1954
00:52:56.661 --> 00:52:57.171
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get,</v>

1955
00:52:57.171 --> 00:53:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get this thing down right now and I got to get out of here.</v>

1956
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It was that he followed me for a block and gay guys would hit on,</v>

1957
00:53:03.861 --> 00:53:05.540
<v Speaker 1>and you just like guys will hit on girls.</v>

1958
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:10.200
<v Speaker 1>He got to know everybody who thinks that because someone's gay,</v>

1959
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1960
00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1961
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been talking about this on stage that they're automatically going</v>

1962
00:53:13.161 --> 00:53:13.994
<v Speaker 1>to be nice.</v>

1963
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.833
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

1964
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a person.</v>

1965
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:17.543
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Right.</v>

1966
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should get their first,</v>

1967
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:19.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1968

<v Speaker 1>blank slate.</v>

1970
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:22.243
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

1971
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.491
<v Speaker 1>Gay,</v>

1972

1981
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 2>The rest of it gets real freaky.</v>

1982
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Just cause you suck dicks doesn't mean you're awesome.</v>

1988
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are guys you know that look at you and go,</v>

1989
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you know there are probably,</v>

1990
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:47.840
<v Speaker 2>there are gay rapists,</v>

1991
00:53:47.841 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 2>like they are straight rapists.</v>

1992
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:49.791
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

1993
00:53:49.791 --> 00:53:50.011

<v Speaker 2>all the whole human spectrum exists within whatever you are.</v>

1995

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean if there's bad people,</v>

1997
00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:58.800
<v Speaker 2>there's bad people in every single walk of life.</v>

1998
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.431
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1999
00:53:59.431 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of possible combinations of people,</v>

2003
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Like I look back on that sometimes and I'm like,</v>

2004
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.500
<v Speaker 2>how was I ever expected to make decisions for myself?</v>

2005
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Back then I was just raised hormonal mess as was.</v>

2006
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was friends with the greatest,</v>

2007
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you have the greatest metaphor I've ever heard in my life.</v>

2008
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:28.440
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest bits I've ever actually in my life seen anywhere.</v>

2009
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.730
<v Speaker 2>To me that the eye,</v>

2010
00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:34.710
<v Speaker 2>what it's like for a guy to have a hard on these younger is like you're in the</v>

2011
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:39.240
<v Speaker 2>back of a boss and somebody else is driving that bus and that whole bit you did</v>

2012
00:54:39.241 --> 00:54:40.074
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2013
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.140
<v Speaker 2>top five greatest spits of all time.</v>

2014
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.401
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that on there.</v>

2015
00:54:44.401 --> 00:54:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Anything you don't,</v>

2016
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2017
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

2018
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a genius.</v>

2019
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:52.740
<v Speaker 2>But that's like that's a bit I got a lazy with and I sort of abandoned.</v>

2020
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I would have it and I'd let it go.</v>

2021
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.201
<v Speaker 2>I blew my mind.</v>

2022
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:56.830
<v Speaker 2>That was what I was literally like,</v>

2023
00:54:56.831 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 2>it was so inspiring.</v>

2024
00:54:57.691 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I went home and I started writing.</v>

2025
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

2026
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 2>It's funny cause that bit was a bit,</v>

2027
00:55:01.411 --> 00:55:04.650
<v Speaker 2>that would work really well or there was too many dance moves in it.</v>

2028
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what Tom Segura calls it.</v>

2029
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:07.140
<v Speaker 2>When you're jazzing up a bit,</v>

2030
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:07.690
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2031
00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2032
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 2>you got your physical.</v>

2033
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:09.351
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

2034
00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:09.721
<v Speaker 2>that thing,</v>

2035
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how many dance moves you're doing that anybody doesn't think that's</v>

2036
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:12.780
<v Speaker 2>genius.</v>

2037
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2038
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 2>it may just be that it's so good people that are actually just watching cause I</v>

2039
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even laughing.</v>

2040
00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Most of that was watching it so fascinated with the metaphor and how you were</v>

2041
00:55:22.321 --> 00:55:23.460
<v Speaker 2>doing it that I was just like,</v>

2042
00:55:23.461 --> 00:55:24.820
<v Speaker 2>this is the greatest thing I've ever seen him on.</v>

2043
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.650
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2044
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it on some,</v>

2045
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it on the next year.</v>

2046
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.620
<v Speaker 2>It's too late.</v>

2047
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:32.401
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

2048
00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 2>It'll be a baby it to me.</v>

2049
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I want to do it on my next special,</v>

2050
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 2>which I'm shooting in January.</v>

2051
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to shoot it.</v>

2052
00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2053
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:38.761
<v Speaker 2>I don't know yet,</v>

2054
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:41.700
<v Speaker 2>but I have an offer to do it down in Orange County.</v>

2055
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool.</v>

2056
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2057
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:43.890
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2058
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:44.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2059
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:44.880
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>

2060
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to,</v>

2061
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do way more comedy clubs then.</v>

2062
00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:49.201
<v Speaker 2>That's the greatest.</v>

2063
00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2064
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm been,</v>

2065
00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 2>the last couple of weeks I've been doing,</v>

2066
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I did a bunch of the Improv's.</v>

2067
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I did Braya Ontario,</v>

2068
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I did the comedy Magic Club and doing all these club dates and I'm having so</v>

2069
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:00.181
<v Speaker 2>much fun,</v>

2070
00:56:00.181 --> 00:56:00.541
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2071
00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:01.374
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2072
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.680
<v Speaker 2>it's really like the shows or the intimacy of the room is something I'm really</v>

2073
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:09.210
<v Speaker 2>like in love with.</v>

2074
00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2075
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 2>I was in Springfield,</v>

2076
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.661
<v Speaker 2>Illinois,</v>

2077
00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:13.050
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2078
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to everybody from Springfield.</v>

2079
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:17.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not a place you'd go for really anything.</v>

2080
00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:18.330
<v Speaker 2>How rude.</v>

2081
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:18.541
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2082
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.060
<v Speaker 2>it's but,</v>

2083
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.760
<v Speaker 2>but the people are great because they all grew up together.</v>

2084
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:22.050
<v Speaker 2>They all know each other since fifth grade,</v>

2085
00:56:22.051 --> 00:56:23.110
<v Speaker 2>so it's a really great community.</v>

2086
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Fucking great</v>

2087
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:24.890
<v Speaker 1>crowds.</v>

2088
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

2089
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2090
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2091
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Money around town is banging people that fucked up the high school and now</v>

2092
00:56:30.161 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you're married to somebody else,</v>

2093
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:32.200
<v Speaker 1>but you lived down the street.</v>

2094
00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 1>There's one drink,</v>

2095
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 1>walks a log.</v>

2096
00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:34.714
<v Speaker 1>What do you doing?</v>

2097
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:35.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2098
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:36.341
<v Speaker 1>they don't get,</v>

2099
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 1>the problem is they all complain about the fact that you can't get away with</v>

2100
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:40.030
<v Speaker 1>anything because everybody knows you,</v>

2101
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 1>so you have to be on your best behavior all the time.</v>

2102
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't be anonymous,</v>

2103
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.590
<v Speaker 1>which was really interesting.</v>

2104
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a small scale model of the future Internet.</v>

2105
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

2106
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like a giant Facebook,</v>

2107
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's bagging everybody.</v>

2108
00:56:53.441 --> 00:56:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows it.</v>

2109
00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is watching everything you do.</v>

2110
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:56.943
<v Speaker 1>But I was thinking,</v>

2111
00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I love going on the road like that because you had these intimate experiences</v>

2112
00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of strangers and,</v>

2113
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.550
<v Speaker 1>and because there's not a lot to do.</v>

2114
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there writing the whole time.</v>

2115
00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.810
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting too when you're talking about that,</v>

2116
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.960
<v Speaker 1>about this small town and everybody knowing everybody.</v>

2117
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 1>You know Dr Chris Ryan who've had on this podcast for the guy who wrote that</v>

2118
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 1>book sex at dawn,</v>

2119
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 1>when he talks about like promiscuity,</v>

2120
00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:22.120
<v Speaker 1>like he talks about promiscuity and primitive cultures,</v>

2121
00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:23.980
<v Speaker 1>which is basically fact,</v>

2122
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:25.083
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2123
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 1>What they're basing it on is almost the same thing as a small town.</v>

2124
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It's everybody knowing everybody there in these small groups,</v>

2125
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows everybody and everybody fucks everybody.</v>

2126
00:57:35.111 --> 00:57:35.620
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2127
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And it happens all the time.</v>

2128
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.031
<v Speaker 1>He does,</v>

2129
00:57:37.031 --> 00:57:37.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2130
00:57:37.271 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

2131
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time.</v>

2132
00:57:39.551 --> 00:57:42.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you get down to a group of 50 people.</v>

2133
00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And they found that even,</v>

2134
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.360
<v Speaker 1>even as crazy as this sounds,</v>

2135
00:57:46.361 --> 00:57:50.530
<v Speaker 1>that small groups of people that are involved in dangerous situations,</v>

2136
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:53.950
<v Speaker 1>they turned to wife swapping like fighter pilots.</v>

2137
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2138
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Fighter pilots on a regular basis.</v>

2139
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:56.681
<v Speaker 1>Wife swap,</v>

2140
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 1>cop's wife swap.</v>

2141
00:57:57.521 --> 00:57:58.061
<v Speaker 1>So really?</v>

2142
00:57:58.061 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2143
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Because they love their wife and if they're dead,</v>

2144
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:04.990
<v Speaker 1>they want someone else to love their wife too.</v>

2145
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 1>That makes total sense.</v>

2146
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And they want to be there while like almost while it's happening,</v>

2147
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Speaker 1>like you introduce someone to your wife.</v>

2148
00:58:11.501 --> 00:58:13.000
<v Speaker 1>She's really special person and like,</v>

2149
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 1>like he's like almost like accepted a new reality and that reality is my lights</v>

2150
00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:19.450
<v Speaker 1>are going to shut out any second now,</v>

2151
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:19.890
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2152
00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I'd way rather have you married my wife and raising my kids in anybody else.</v>

2153
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I know that feeling.</v>

2154
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:25.953
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about.</v>

2155
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:26.883
<v Speaker 1>That's that feeling,</v>

2156
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.860
<v Speaker 1>that feeling is that says to me,</v>

2157
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you would know that I could trust.</v>

2158
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.290
<v Speaker 1>You can trust me and you know,</v>

2159
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:33.300
<v Speaker 1>or vice versa.</v>

2160
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:34.134
<v Speaker 1>I can trust you.</v>

2161
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 1>That's life man.</v>

2162
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what people do when they get to small groups,</v>

2163
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:41.050
<v Speaker 1>they bond job and they breed with each other in order to form love bonds at.</v>

2164
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:44.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's more about love than it is about being a freak.</v>

2165
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.810
<v Speaker 1>And the weird thing about that word promiscuity is the original origin of the</v>

2166
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 1>word means mixed,</v>

2167
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.600
<v Speaker 1>mixed sex,</v>

2168
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:53.411
<v Speaker 1>sex with you,</v>

2169
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:54.310
<v Speaker 1>sex with her.</v>

2170
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking each other.</v>

2171
00:58:55.691 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 1>They're having gay sex,</v>

2172
00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people throughout history,</v>

2173
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:01.480
<v Speaker 1>we're having gay sex then that's absolutely fact.</v>

2174
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the interesting things about luck.</v>

2175
00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:04.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2176
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.380
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just talking here,</v>

2177
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not advocating gay sacks,</v>

2178
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:08.770
<v Speaker 1>but what I am saying is damn it,</v>

2179
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.480
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange that in groups of of men,</v>

2180
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:18.340
<v Speaker 1>when men were warring and when they were off like fighting and wars and</v>

2181
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:20.980
<v Speaker 1>disappearing together and through the woods for six months,</v>

2182
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 1>they were out</v>

2183
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.100
<v Speaker 2>banging each other and killing each other.</v>

2184
00:59:24.101 --> 00:59:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2185
00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were just killing each other.</v>

2186
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.430
<v Speaker 2>They were banging each other too.</v>

2187
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.881
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

2188
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I was the idea behind the Spartans are,</v>

2189
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:30.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2190
00:59:30.621 --> 00:59:33.020
<v Speaker 2>a lot of cultures that separated men and women for a long time.</v>

2191
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a great deal of,</v>

2192
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2193
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 2>because guys are fucking animals,</v>

2194
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:35.921
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2195
00:59:35.921 --> 00:59:38.550
<v Speaker 2>So as you see some due to smaller and kind of a feminine,</v>

2196
00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:38.930
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2197
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fuck that guy today.</v>

2198
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.151
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2199
00:59:41.151 --> 00:59:42.380
<v Speaker 2>they didn't just do that.</v>

2200
00:59:42.381 --> 00:59:45.730
<v Speaker 2>They also formed love bonds because they knew that they were most likely going</v>

2201
00:59:45.731 --> 00:59:46.190
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>

2202
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I think when your reality gets radically altered,</v>

2203
00:59:48.621 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 2>like you're in a situation like a fighter pilot is,</v>

2204
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.811
<v Speaker 2>or like a,</v>

2205
00:59:51.811 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 2>a person who is perhaps going off to war,</v>

2206
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.860
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a very real scenario of the end of your life.</v>

2207
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:58.550
<v Speaker 2>It's really funny.</v>

2208
00:59:58.550 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Speaker 2>My buddies,</v>

2209
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.080
<v Speaker 2>one of the CIA,</v>

2210
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:01.010
<v Speaker 2>paramilitary guys,</v>

2211
01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:03.110
<v Speaker 2>a real bad ass and he works with all the special forces guys,</v>

2212
01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:03.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2213
01:00:03.321 --> 01:00:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Like the Delta guys and the seal team,</v>

2214
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 2>six guys and the seals and they were all up in arms.</v>

2215
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:07.370
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

2216
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.350
<v Speaker 2>he was in their barracks and one,</v>

2217
01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 2>one of these groups to this state that what they call a,</v>

2218
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.181
<v Speaker 2>a Cag,</v>

2219
01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:12.410
<v Speaker 2>a combat action group,</v>

2220
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:12.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2221

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.153
<v Speaker 2>Cag.</v>

2223
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:17.540
<v Speaker 2>And these guys are like a real bad ass,</v>

2224
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:18.141
<v Speaker 2>like a triple,</v>

2225
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:18.771
<v Speaker 2>triple nickel,</v>

2226
01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:19.551

2227
01:00:19.551 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2228
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.020
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2229
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.870
<v Speaker 2>and they're all like the studs and they were all like complaining about the</v>

2230
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:24.321
<v Speaker 2>don't ask,</v>

2231

<v Speaker 2>don't tell like gays in the military,</v>

2234
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:28.430

2235
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:29.360
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>

2236

2240
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.951
<v Speaker 2>If you could,</v>

2241
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:38.240
<v Speaker 2>you would frost your hair,</v>

2242
01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 2>but there's no frosting area and by the way,</v>

2243
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you guys are literally spotting each other's hips as you're doing slow grinding.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Pullups oiling your muscles down.</v>

2254
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 2>50% about gay sex.</v>

2255
01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I know that if I was in a foxhole or a prisoner of war camp with you,</v>

2256
01:01:22.671 --> 01:01:23.990

2268
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Although it would have to be a radical changing of your,</v>

2269
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2270
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you start eating squirrels.</v>

2271
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:43.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2272

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Rats.</v>

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:49.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2277
01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>there are some parts of the world actually they eat squirrels on a regular</v>

2278
01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

2279
01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Squirrels are actually delicious though.</v>

2280
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:55.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2281
01:01:55.641 --> 01:01:58.790
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of like groups that stay pretty,</v>

2282
01:01:58.791 --> 01:01:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a lot of,</v>

2283

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:03.740
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty much not fucking each other.</v>

2286
01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:04.071
<v Speaker 2>Let's do,</v>

2287
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:04.940
<v Speaker 2>it's aren't fucking around.</v>

2288
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:05.691
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

2289
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>

2290
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say anything either.</v>

2291
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:07.941
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2292
01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2293
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:08.953
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to either.</v>

2294
01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2295
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:10.071
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2296
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2297
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I've always just joked around,</v>

2298
01:02:12.111 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>

2299
01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:18.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing that humans is more flack that they morph and they just</v>

2300
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:18.900
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

2301
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.141
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2302
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>now I'm gay.</v>

2303
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2304
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:20.491
<v Speaker 2>when men are,</v>

2305
01:02:20.491 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you haven't noticed men.</v>

2306
01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>When you get close to a guy,</v>

2307
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:24.480
<v Speaker 2>if you were on a wrestling team or you were on,</v>

2308
01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:24.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2309
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:25.231
<v Speaker 2>whatever you are,</v>

2310
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:27.690
<v Speaker 2>have you watched like an MMA guys in the back?</v>

2311
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>

2312
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.400
<v Speaker 2>when they're about to go to fight there,</v>

2313
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.890
<v Speaker 2>they're hugging and kissing each other.</v>

2314
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:32.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2315
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:32.620
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2316
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.271
<v Speaker 2>there's a deep,</v>

2317
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:35.540
<v Speaker 2>deep bond that's formed with training and,</v>

2318
01:02:35.541 --> 01:02:37.050
<v Speaker 2>and going to war together like that.</v>

2319
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:38.021
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

2320
01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:38.351
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2321
01:02:38.351 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 2>they're kissing each other,</v>

2322
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:40.370
<v Speaker 2>they're hugging each other.</v>

2323
01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:41.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2324
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:41.641
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

2325
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:45.930
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying that that develops it very deep kinship bond.</v>

2326
01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:47.580
<v Speaker 2>And if my dick falls in your mouth,</v>

2327
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>that in my opinion,</v>

2328
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 2>is getting ready for a fight.</v>

2329
01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>That does not mean well.</v>

2330
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 2>The idea would be that they would fight harder for their lover.</v>

2331
01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2332
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 2>that would be the idea.</v>

2333
01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.280
<v Speaker 2>The idea would be that they would fight.</v>

2334
01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Look Achilles from homer Kelly,</v>

2335
01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:03.450
<v Speaker 2>the greatest warrior of mythological times.</v>

2336
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.351
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

2337
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:05.430
<v Speaker 2>his lover's killed.</v>

2338
01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:06.031
<v Speaker 2>He had a lover.</v>

2339
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:08.690
<v Speaker 2>He had a male lover and Alexander the great had.</v>

2340
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Adam has his best friend and lover.</v>

2341
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.490
<v Speaker 2>He killed him apparently when he was drunk in a drunken rage.</v>

2342
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.580
<v Speaker 2>But that was his lover that a lot of the great fighters and warriors</v>

2343
01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:18.630
<v Speaker 2>traditionally were gay.</v>

2344
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.710
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2346
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2348
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Why did I Alexander lose his temper?</v>

2349
01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.371
<v Speaker 2>He's only,</v>

2350
01:03:23.371 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 2>he only killed a few thousand people before then.</v>

2351
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.070
<v Speaker 2>We're the de killed that guy fucking,</v>

2352
01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 2>I ain't know it conquered the world.</v>

2353
01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2354
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 2>how many people did he killed with his own hands?</v>

2355
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2356
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 2>does it,</v>

2357
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.200
<v Speaker 2>they don't have anything about that,</v>

2358
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:37.440
<v Speaker 2>but they do know that he was so strong he could be in a full suit of armor and</v>

2359
01:03:37.441 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 2>jump up on his horse.</v>

2360
01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 2>He was a short guy,</v>

2361
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.250
<v Speaker 2>but he was very powerfully built.</v>

2362
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>What you could jump up onto that he could literally launch himself on.</v>

2363
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:48.680
<v Speaker 2>It was worth a lot of legendary stories about [inaudible] shit.</v>

2364
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.680
<v Speaker 2>He was very strong.</v>

2365
01:03:49.681 --> 01:03:53.970
<v Speaker 2>He's very squat and think fuck they two small polarize type.</v>

2367
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.250
<v Speaker 2>that kind of builds.</v>

2368
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.083
<v Speaker 2>That's what I believe.</v>

2369
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Just short gorilla.</v>

2370

2374
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:05.910
<v Speaker 2>It looked like death warmed over,</v>

2375
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:09.540

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 2>pull up an image.</v>

2378
01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Paul Horez way in p a.</v>

2379
01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 2>L.</v>

2380
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 2>H.</v>

2381
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

2382
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 2>R.</v>

2383
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 2>E.</v>

2384
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 2>S.</v>

2385
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Paul horror is weighing that you see him at one 85 he looks like this giant</v>

2386
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Heman and now he's still really muscular.</v>

2387
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:23.910
<v Speaker 2>So my is my weight.</v>

2388
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking at one 70 right now.</v>

2389
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that he's shredded,</v>

2390
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:28.583
<v Speaker 2>shredded,</v>

2391
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>and then he's going to rehydrate.</v>

2392
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.600
<v Speaker 2>He'll probably be at least 10 pounds plus heavier tomorrow,</v>

2393
01:04:35.701 --> 01:04:36.534
<v Speaker 2>so he must've,</v>

2394
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:38.490
<v Speaker 2>you were saying that they,</v>

2395
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.050
<v Speaker 2>the way a lot of guys lose weight,</v>

2396
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.210
<v Speaker 2>they'll drink a lot of water and then that's how you lose the water weight.</v>

2397
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit that has to happen.</v>

2398
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 2>You have to get down to a certain target weight before you can lose the</v>

2399
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Waterweight.</v>

2400
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a like say if you're a big strong guy.</v>

2401
01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:52.501
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2402
01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Paul says there's a lot of extra muscle going on there and you,</v>

2403
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.780
<v Speaker 2>there's only one way to get rid of that extra muscle.</v>

2404
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:59.310
<v Speaker 2>The muscle,</v>

2405
01:04:59.310 --> 01:04:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

2406
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.620
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat,</v>

2407
01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>do it slowly,</v>

2408
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>or you have to make sure that when you're eating,</v>

2409
01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:06.960
<v Speaker 2>you're taking in less calories than you need.</v>

2410
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Or if you take in less calories that you need,</v>

2411
01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:09.960
<v Speaker 2>you buy starts to eat itself.</v>

2412
01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:10.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2413
01:05:10.231 --> 01:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>so you actually have to do,</v>

2414
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 2>you do have to restrict your calories that there's,</v>

2415
01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:15.180
<v Speaker 2>there are guys who have to do that.</v>

2416
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:17.860
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how big you are and how much you know.</v>

2417
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2418
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:18.933
<v Speaker 1>also like,</v>

2419
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>how'd you get that big like,</v>

2420
01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 1>and are you still doing whatever you were doing to get that big,</v>

2421
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:23.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2422
01:05:23.291 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>like what's,</v>

2423
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>what are your hormones?</v>

2424
01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Are they being manipulated or the natural?</v>

2425
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of variables because the assumption always is that someone is</v>

2426
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>innocent until proven guilty.</v>

2427
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>So the assumption is always that you're not doing anything unusual.</v>

2428
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:40.561
<v Speaker 1>But when you see like a fucking super strong muscular guy like that,</v>

2429
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you always have to remember that there have been people that have been caught</v>

2430
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:46.114
<v Speaker 1>doing drugs.</v>

2431
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>There have been many,</v>

2432
01:05:47.171 --> 01:05:47.501
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2433
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:47.801
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2434
01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:48.221
<v Speaker 1>many ones.</v>

2435
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:48.641
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

2436
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>one of them was Paul Harris.</v>

2437
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>He got caught with the elevated testosterone levels.</v>

2438
01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know who is,</v>

2439
01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and I dunno who isn't it?</v>

2440
01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like now.</v>

2441
01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.420
<v Speaker 1>God shredded.</v>

2442
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2443
01:05:58.841 --> 01:05:59.470
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2444
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:00.730
<v Speaker 1>but when he got onto this is like,</v>

2445
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:02.290
<v Speaker 1>he looks okay right there.</v>

2446
01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2447
01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that's before he had his,</v>

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>He beats the shit out of you and then takes you down a few times,</v>

2571
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:56.180
<v Speaker 1>beats the shit out of you some more,</v>

2572
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 1>but he can knock you out with one punch.</v>

2573
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 1>He's got one punch o power.</v>

2574
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal that,</v>

2575
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:00.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2576
01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.230
<v Speaker 1>so if Paul [inaudible] it's all like,</v>

2577
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of questions like how much did Paul Horez lose and getting down to</v>

2578
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:10.040
<v Speaker 1>one 70 how much does he have left in the tank?</v>

2579
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Because if you lose that much weight,</v>

2580
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:15.920
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible that you did it wrong or it's very possible that it wasn't</v>

2581
01:09:15.921 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 1>really an attainable goal within the time period.</v>

2582
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.070
<v Speaker 1>He tried to attain it in.</v>

2583
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 1>And so unless you get an expert like a Mike Dolce type guy to go over your</v>

2584
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 1>weight cut with you like body fat measurements,</v>

2585
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:26.534
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

2586
01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Mike Dolce is a guy who used to fight,</v>

2587
01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:29.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2588
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:34.220
<v Speaker 1>and he was in the ultimate fighter and then since then he's gone on to be like a</v>

2589
01:09:34.221 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 1>fitness consultant for fighters.</v>

2590
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:39.530
<v Speaker 1>But he's very knowledgeable and very knowledgeable about cutting weight like</v>

2591
01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:39.890
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2592
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:43.490
<v Speaker 1>the guys who he's trained with that have listened to them and have cut weight</v>

2593
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.260
<v Speaker 1>because of his methods of coming in in vastly better condition than they did</v>

2594
01:09:48.261 --> 01:09:49.280
<v Speaker 1>when they were doing it on their own.</v>

2595
01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.413
<v Speaker 1>He's just an expert,</v>

2596
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I would knows what he knows where your body's had knows how to give you the</v>

2597
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:55.101
<v Speaker 1>right nutrients,</v>

2598
01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:57.740
<v Speaker 1>knows how to give you cut the things out that are going to make your body</v>

2599
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.690
<v Speaker 1>naturally lose weight.</v>

2600
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And what are the guidelines?</v>

2601
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:03.853
<v Speaker 1>Dolce,</v>

2602
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2603
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I've actually think I've met him.</v>

2604
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:06.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2605
01:10:06.901 --> 01:10:07.251
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>

2606
01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:07.970
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>

2607
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>what are the guidelines for testosterone replacement therapy or hormone replace?</v>

2608
01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Very good question.</v>

2609
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:15.500
<v Speaker 1>It varies by commissioned.</v>

2610
01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 1>It varies by,</v>

2611
01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:16.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2612
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 1>by country.</v>

2613
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.811
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2614
01:10:17.811 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a certain number of nanograms per unit of blood.</v>

2615
01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:22.340
<v Speaker 1>It all,</v>

2616
01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.120
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

2617
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.640
<v Speaker 1>The problem is this is there's a bunch of problems,</v>

2618
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:28.970
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is first and foremost that it's very variable.</v>

2619
01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 1>B meaning that if you take it,</v>

2620
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 1>you are levels between today and tomorrow.</v>

2621
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Where they're going to be at depends entirely on when you inject it,</v>

2622
01:10:41.311 --> 01:10:42.144
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2623
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.330
<v Speaker 1>it depends entirely on,</v>

2624
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2625
01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>what kind of stuff you've put in your body,</v>

2626
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.100
<v Speaker 1>what kind of testosterone depends on entirely on whether or not you've,</v>

2627
01:10:50.101 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>you've injected it or whether you apply it to your skin.</v>

2628
01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.620
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just apply it to their skin.</v>

2629
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.540
<v Speaker 1>So with all those variables,</v>

2630
01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:58.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of room for fuckery.</v>

2631
01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.550
<v Speaker 1>So what you could do is you could start,</v>

2632
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you could start it out with,</v>

2633
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a way to cheat.</v>

2634
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Started out.</v>

2635
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.431
<v Speaker 1>We will,</v>

2636
01:11:05.431 --> 01:11:07.220
<v Speaker 1>you take the needle every week and you know,</v>

2637
01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>you're only allowed to get x amount per week,</v>

2638
01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.420
<v Speaker 1>but then every time they're going to test you,</v>

2639
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give you a certain of nowness.</v>

2640
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2641
01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:14.521
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2642
01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:14.651
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2643
01:11:14.651 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 2>they can't just show up.</v>

2644
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:20.930
<v Speaker 2>The only people that can just show up or Veda Veda testing or w a da or w a da</v>

2645
01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:23.881
<v Speaker 2>or v a,</v>

2646
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:24.121
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>

2647
01:11:24.121 --> 01:11:24.660
<v Speaker 2>a w,</v>

2648
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.310
<v Speaker 2>either one of those as two different organizations.</v>

2649
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:27.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think both of them do that,</v>

2650
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.810
<v Speaker 2>like random thing where they wake you up at eight o'clock in the morning and</v>

2651
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 2>tests you.</v>

2652
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2653
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:32.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2654
01:11:32.161 --> 01:11:35.780
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is if,</v>

2655
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.410
<v Speaker 2>if you're willing to gamble,</v>

2656
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:41.550
<v Speaker 2>the way you gamble is you shoot what you're supposed to shoot and then you rub</v>

2657
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:42.660
<v Speaker 2>cream on top of that.</v>

2658
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.820
<v Speaker 2>So you have the level that's like really a hard to drop,</v>

2659
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>which is the injectable level.</v>

2660
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 2>The injectable level stays that level for a very long time apparently.</v>

2661
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Like if you take it your,</v>

2662
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:55.223
<v Speaker 2>your level,</v>

2663
01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:56.460
<v Speaker 2>it'll be in your skin.</v>

2664
01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:59.100
<v Speaker 2>You'd be in your system at a certain level of testosterone,</v>

2665
01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:01.410
<v Speaker 2>testosterone if for,</v>

2666
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.273
<v Speaker 2>it's like a slide.</v>

2667
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2668
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.010
<v Speaker 2>For like five or six days.</v>

2669
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:07.020
<v Speaker 2>The cream only last 24 hours.</v>

2670
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2671
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.270
<v Speaker 2>so you put the cream on,</v>

2672
01:12:09.271 --> 01:12:10.110
<v Speaker 2>your body absorbs it,</v>

2673
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:10.944
<v Speaker 2>and that's a wrap.</v>

2674
01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:12.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2675
01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 2>so in other words you would put,</v>

2676
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 2>if you were injected,</v>

2677
01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:17.610
<v Speaker 2>why would the cream on top of that,</v>

2678
01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:20.280
<v Speaker 2>when that spike your testosterone to do more hands on whether or not you're</v>

2679
01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:21.150
<v Speaker 2>going to get tested,</v>

2680
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:21.691
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

2681
01:12:21.691 --> 01:12:23.040
<v Speaker 2>if you can get tested that day,</v>

2682
01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:26.520
<v Speaker 2>like say if you wake up in the morning and you know for a fact there's no one</v>

2683
01:12:26.521 --> 01:12:27.660
<v Speaker 2>who's going to test you today,</v>

2684
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:31.920
<v Speaker 2>you could rub that cream on your body workout and then probably the next day</v>

2685
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:32.641
<v Speaker 2>you're back down to,</v>

2686
01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:34.290
<v Speaker 2>even when you show up at the gym,</v>

2687
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.490
<v Speaker 2>they come in and test you.</v>

2688
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.473
<v Speaker 2>You're okay.</v>

2689
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.920
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile you have more than the prescribed amount of testosterone cycling</v>

2690
01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:44.310
<v Speaker 2>through your system and you're using that extra testosterone,</v>

2691
01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:48.480
<v Speaker 2>that extra human level of testosterone as a performance enhancer because you're</v>

2692
01:12:48.481 --> 01:12:49.950
<v Speaker 2>recovering in between fights.</v>

2693
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Even if when you fight you,</v>

2694
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you are fighting and that you get your pee after the fight at a level that's</v>

2695
01:12:55.741 --> 01:12:56.574
<v Speaker 2>acceptable.</v>

2696
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.710
<v Speaker 2>What was your level throughout the camp?</v>

2697
01:12:58.711 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2698
01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:01.140
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need to know and it's hard to tell.</v>

2699
01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.071
<v Speaker 2>You can see,</v>

2700
01:13:02.071 --> 01:13:05.850
<v Speaker 2>you know you can have like random ones is all going to be a such ancient history</v>

2701
01:13:05.851 --> 01:13:10.851
<v Speaker 2>and about 10 10 years anyway because with gene doping and when they can pinpoint</v>

2702
01:13:11.941 --> 01:13:15.960
<v Speaker 2>and they can kind of like block certain amount of Myostatin et cetera and things</v>

2703
01:13:15.961 --> 01:13:16.230
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>

2704
01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:19.980
<v Speaker 2>in your jeans and it's safe and it's safe.</v>

2705
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Now the question becomes why is it illegal like now it's just a question of who</v>

2706
01:13:24.241 --> 01:13:27.720
<v Speaker 2>has the best you can geneticist who has the best doctor to compete.</v>

2707
01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:30.630
<v Speaker 2>It's really an interesting thing what it says about competition.</v>

2708
01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:35.631
<v Speaker 2>Now as we learn more and more that that winners have to have a certain hardware</v>

2709
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:37.740
<v Speaker 2>and the software is training and stuff,</v>

2710
01:13:37.741 --> 01:13:39.240
<v Speaker 2>but without the hardware first,</v>

2711
01:13:39.241 --> 01:13:39.710
<v Speaker 2>without that,</v>

2712
01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:43.560
<v Speaker 2>the mainframe your fuck Jon Jones has a Ferrari bod.</v>

2713
01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2714
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 2>There's no getting past your stupid ass Volkswagen diesel that you have.</v>

2715
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.830
<v Speaker 2>There is never going to beat it for right.</v>

2716
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like this guy in the less the FarEye breaks down.</v>

2717
01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>This is true.</v>

2718
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.420
<v Speaker 2>That is just like in,</v>

2719
01:13:54.421 --> 01:13:55.160
<v Speaker 2>in the racing,</v>

2720
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.330
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Stefan home who is a,</v>

2721
01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.193
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest,</v>

2722
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.080
<v Speaker 2>greatest high jumper and he's five 11.</v>

2723
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Stefan home.</v>

2724
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:02.791
<v Speaker 2>He's a Swedish guy.</v>

2726
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:03.241
<v Speaker 2>Five 11.</v>

2727
01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:04.380
<v Speaker 2>He became obsessed with,</v>

2728
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:04.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2729
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:06.480
<v Speaker 2>high jumping but only was 11.</v>

2730
01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Most of the hydrogens are six,</v>

2731
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:08.544
<v Speaker 2>seven and stuff.</v>

2732
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.941
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2733
01:14:08.941 --> 01:14:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2734
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And he trained and train and train and train and</v>

2735
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.450
<v Speaker 3>he became so good and I think he's one,</v>

2736
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I look them up,</v>

2737
01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:18.670
<v Speaker 3>but I think you want to Olympic gold and several world championships.</v>

2738
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:22.540
<v Speaker 3>His Achilles tendon on his jumping foot is,</v>

2739
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.710
<v Speaker 3>can withstand,</v>

2740
01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 3>it would take 1.8 tons to pull it apart.</v>

2741
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:26.711
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

2742
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 3>it's literally the hardest.</v>

2743
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:30.650
<v Speaker 3>It's three times harder than a regular man's Dick.</v>

2744
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:31.623
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2745
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2746
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.530
<v Speaker 3>You can hang it.</v>

2747
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Telephone.</v>

2748
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Just be it.</v>

2749
01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.003
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2750
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:37.770
<v Speaker 3>And so he's trans and he's,</v>

2751
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

2752
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.640
<v Speaker 3>when he jumps in a,</v>

2753
01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:39.881
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2754
01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:40.270
<v Speaker 3>that's him.</v>

2755
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>Now when he jumps,</v>

2756
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:42.940
<v Speaker 3>his head almost touches,</v>

2757
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 3>almost touches his,</v>

2758
01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:44.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2759
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:45.423
<v Speaker 3>his heels.</v>

2760
01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:46.420
<v Speaker 3>That's how flexibly is.</v>

2761
01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2762
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:47.351
<v Speaker 3>How long has he,</v>

2763
01:14:47.351 --> 01:14:47.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2764
01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.170
<v Speaker 3>w w w and he does this.</v>

2765
01:14:49.171 --> 01:14:50.004
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't see you see,</v>

2766
01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.000
<v Speaker 3>you see the city do this record.</v>

2767
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2768
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2769
01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:53.051
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2770
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:53.371
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2771
01:14:53.371 --> 01:14:54.990
<v Speaker 3>But you see how he touches his face like that.</v>

2772
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:55.833
<v Speaker 3>He has a ritual.</v>

2773
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 3>He puts his shoes on the same way.</v>

2774
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Everything,</v>

2775
01:14:57.970 --> 01:14:58.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2776
01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2777
01:14:58.570 --> 01:14:59.403
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

2778
01:14:59.490 --> 01:14:59.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2779
01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.440
<v Speaker 3>And he jumps high jobs.</v>

2780
01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2781
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.673
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

2782
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:03.341
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

2783
01:15:03.341 --> 01:15:08.341
<v Speaker 3>Like a Cheetah now that came from years and years of training and everything</v>

2784
01:15:09.131 --> 01:15:10.320
<v Speaker 3>else should show that again.</v>

2785
01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 3>And he's jumped more.</v>

2786
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:14.140
<v Speaker 3>He's jumped more than anybody in the history of high jumping.</v>

2787
01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:15.940
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>

2788
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Look how he flies.</v>

2789
01:15:17.731 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2790
01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 3>And you see how flexible he is.</v>

2791
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 3>The thing is tall man,</v>

01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.921
<v Speaker 3>you've got to,</v>

2855
01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 3>you got to delineate the character's man.</v>

2856
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing.</v>

2857
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:32.880
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2858
01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.180
<v Speaker 3>I just not possible rockets.</v>

2859
01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

2860
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.680
<v Speaker 3>That's not way.</v>

2861
01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.053
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2862
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2863
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.070
<v Speaker 3>he goes out there and sure enough,</v>

2864
01:16:39.071 --> 01:16:42.550
<v Speaker 3>this guy jumps I think in eight months of practice and this guy,</v>

2865
01:16:42.551 --> 01:16:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Stephen homes,</v>

2866
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:45.100
<v Speaker 3>been practicing his whole life in eight months of practice.</v>

2867
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:45.881
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2868
01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:47.860
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't practice much because he didn't really want to.</v>

2869
01:16:47.861 --> 01:16:48.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like whatever.</v>

2870
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:48.941
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2871
01:16:48.941 --> 01:16:50.050
<v Speaker 3>he won the world championships.</v>

2872
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.340
<v Speaker 3>He jumped s eight feet already cleared eight feet or something crazy.</v>

2873
01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.030
<v Speaker 3>It's eight.</v>

2874
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2875
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Something insane.</v>

2876
01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:55.983
<v Speaker 3>Never been done.</v>

2877
01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:56.973
<v Speaker 3>Eight months.</v>

2878
01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.251
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2879
01:16:57.251 --> 01:16:58.210
<v Speaker 3>actually plateaued.</v>

2880
01:16:58.211 --> 01:17:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Never got better because he just didn't really want to train much,</v>

2881
01:17:00.671 --> 01:17:01.504
<v Speaker 3>but his,</v>

2882
01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.520
<v Speaker 3>but he had an achilles tendon apparently that was like two times longer than the</v>

2883
01:17:06.611 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 3>average person just born with a certain symmetry.</v>

2884
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2885
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.301
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

2886
01:17:11.301 --> 01:17:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2887
01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.530
<v Speaker 1>just certain mechanics.</v>

2888
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2889
01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>And where he was able to jump.</v>

2890
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:15.650
<v Speaker 1>And so no matter how much you trained,</v>

2891
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>some people are going to jump and run faster.</v>

2892
01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2893
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>swim panics are gigantic.</v>

2894
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the really gigantic,</v>

2895
01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>once his punching power,</v>

2896
01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>the mechanics of punching power,</v>

2897
01:17:25.071 --> 01:17:26.690
<v Speaker 1>like the natural born punching power.</v>

2898
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.240
<v Speaker 1>There's certain guys that,</v>

2899
01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.840
<v Speaker 1>or are great,</v>

2900
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:31.040
<v Speaker 1>great fighters,</v>

2901
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.180
<v Speaker 1>but they just,</v>

2902
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:33.531
<v Speaker 1>perfect example,</v>

2903
01:17:33.531 --> 01:17:34.364
<v Speaker 1>Wayne McCullough,</v>

2904
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Wayne McCullough is a great fighter,</v>

2905
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:40.440
<v Speaker 1>multiple time champion and a really cool guy on top of that.</v>

2906
01:17:40.441 --> 01:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And he's a,</v>

2907
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I met him a million times,</v>

2908
01:17:42.321 --> 01:17:44.120
<v Speaker 1>hang out in Vegas and he's a super,</v>

2909
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:44.954
<v Speaker 1>super good guy.</v>

2910
01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Wayne McCullough was a bad motherfucker.</v>

2911
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:48.140
<v Speaker 1>He's calling the pocket rocket.</v>

2912
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>

2913
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:54.520
<v Speaker 1>his number one issue was that he couldn't like knock guys out with one punch.</v>

2914
01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:56.630
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

2915
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2916
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:57.111
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2917
01:17:57.111 --> 01:17:57.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2918
01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:57.860
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2919
01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.770
<v Speaker 1>a volume combination,</v>

2920
01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 1>very technical fighter,</v>

2921
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.240
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

2922
01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:02.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2923
01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 1>just relentless,</v>

2924
01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 1>relentless boxer,</v>

2925
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2926
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>just really excellent.</v>

2927
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Like if you wanted to learn how to box could watch one of his,</v>

2928
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.180
<v Speaker 1>his bouts of Waco,</v>

2929
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Wayne McCullough was,</v>

2930
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.850
<v Speaker 1>is a style that you could emulate and be like incredibly successful.</v>

2931
01:18:16.851 --> 01:18:19.370
<v Speaker 1>He was a beautiful fighter and,</v>

2932
01:18:19.371 --> 01:18:20.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2933
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2934
01:18:20.481 --> 01:18:21.770
<v Speaker 1>that kind of a guy.</v>

2935
01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:26.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no way they're going to have that sort of Tommy Hearns power.</v>

2936
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Like Tommy Hearns had this insane whip power in his right hand that you cannot</v>

2937
01:18:33.411 --> 01:18:35.750
<v Speaker 1>teach a guy and you either have that or you don't.</v>

2938
01:18:35.751 --> 01:18:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Wayne McCullough was a brilliant,</v>

2939
01:18:37.731 --> 01:18:38.570
<v Speaker 1>brilliant fighter,</v>

2940
01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but the difference between what he could do with one punch and with Tommy Hearns</v>

2941
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:43.214
<v Speaker 1>could do with one punch.</v>

2942
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:46.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like the difference between getting hit with a pebble and getting hit with</v>

2943
01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:47.600
<v Speaker 1>a fucking nuclear weapon.</v>

2944
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2945
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 1>getting hit.</v>

2946
01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:51.740
<v Speaker 1>A better example is that Macola right there.</v>

2947
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that Macola?</v>

2948
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2949
01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:54.820
<v Speaker 1>though that's waned.</v>

2950
01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Dominating this dude.</v>

2951
01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 1>He was an animal man who's an amazing fighter that shows show some of this.</v>

2952
01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.400
<v Speaker 1>We got such shitty resolution.</v>

2953
01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:04.010
<v Speaker 1>What's with the gross music behind that?</v>

2954
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Is there a soundtrack to this thing and way McCall was an animal.</v>

2955
01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.200
<v Speaker 1>He would just get on top of dudes.</v>

2956
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.030
<v Speaker 1>These fucking Irish fighters.</v>

2957
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2958
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.170
<v Speaker 1>savages.</v>

2959
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Barry McGuigan.</v>

2960
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 1>He was a savage to savages.</v>

2961
01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:16.791
<v Speaker 1>So tough,</v>

2962
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:18.770
<v Speaker 1>tough fucking guys moving his head.</v>

2963
01:19:18.771 --> 01:19:19.391
<v Speaker 1>Always stands,</v>

2964
01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:20.224
<v Speaker 1>tends to happen.</v>

2965
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no breaks for you that never stops moving.</v>

2966
01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 1>No breaks for you son.</v>

2967
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Every round was him punching you in the face.</v>

2968
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.940
<v Speaker 1>He would just wear on motherfuckers.</v>

2969
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:29.691
<v Speaker 1>Tiny guy too,</v>

2970
01:19:29.691 --> 01:19:30.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2971
01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:30.651
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

2972
01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:31.131
<v Speaker 1>He's not very,</v>

2973
01:19:31.131 --> 01:19:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2974
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.181
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a very,</v>

2975
01:19:32.181 --> 01:19:33.014
<v Speaker 1>have a large frame.</v>

2976
01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:34.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2977
01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:35.211
<v Speaker 1>like those,</v>

2978
01:19:35.211 --> 01:19:35.931
<v Speaker 1>those kind of guys.</v>

2979
01:19:35.931 --> 01:19:36.111
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2980
01:19:36.111 --> 01:19:37.730
<v Speaker 1>he'll hit you a bunch of times,</v>

2981
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:39.290
<v Speaker 1>but he'll just continue to hit you at,</v>

2982
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.161
<v Speaker 1>you know that.</v>

2983
01:19:40.161 --> 01:19:40.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2984
01:19:40.371 --> 01:19:41.630
<v Speaker 1>he could certainly knock me out,</v>

2985
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2986
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:43.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're punching in the face clean,</v>

2987
01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that.</v>

2988
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:46.460
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is the difference between what he can do and it got like</v>

2989
01:19:46.461 --> 01:19:47.291
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson could do it.</v>

2990
01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2991
01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you can't teach that Mike Tyson could murder people.</v>

2992
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2993
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:57.050
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to when Mike Tyson beat Michael Spinks and he fucking hit him</v>

2994
01:19:57.051 --> 01:19:58.490
<v Speaker 1>with that hook to the body and dropped him.</v>

2995
01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:59.331
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2996
01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:00.170
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what happened.</v>

2997
01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Spanx got up and then he uppercutted him through the ropes and it was just boom</v>

2998
01:20:03.531 --> 01:20:04.100
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

2999
01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody at like,</v>

3000
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:06.740
<v Speaker 1>it was ruthless man.</v>

3001
01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:07.574
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

3002
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 1>he could just smash you with one shot.</v>

3003
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Some guys can do that.</v>

3004
01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Some guys just can't.</v>

3005
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:13.261
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

3006
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:14.550
<v Speaker 1>they never will be able to.</v>

3007
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:18.780
<v Speaker 1>They just do not have the ability to knock a guy out with one shot.</v>

3008
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 1>And if you speed to his ability to turn his body like that,</v>

3009
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>it's just so ridiculous.</v>

3010
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 1>The fights that I would have loved to have seen.</v>

3011
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 1>If you could get,</v>

3012
01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:29.970
<v Speaker 1>give me a machine that allow me to watch fights,</v>

3013
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.240
<v Speaker 1>who throughout history and see who would beat who I would take the Prime Mike</v>

3014
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Tyson versus everyone.</v>

3015
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:38.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would take.</v>

3016
01:20:38.341 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I would take the Tyson package please.</v>

3017
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 1>He'd go back and see Tyson fight.</v>

3018
01:20:41.761 --> 01:20:42.594
<v Speaker 1>Jack Johnson.</v>

3019
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Tyson fight.</v>

3020
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dempsey on cm Tyson fight.</v>

3021
01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes in his frame.</v>

3022
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:47.161
<v Speaker 1>Frasier.</v>

3023
01:20:47.161 --> 01:20:47.461
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

3024
01:20:47.461 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I think homes would have beaten him.</v>

3025
01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:49.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3026
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:49.921
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3027
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:50.130
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3028
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Got That Jab jab he had.</v>

3029
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.730
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3030
01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:56.490
<v Speaker 1>he was still pretty fucking good when Mike Tyson put them to sleep after two</v>

3031
01:20:56.491 --> 01:20:57.324
<v Speaker 1>rounds.</v>

3032
01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes is still pretty fucking good.</v>

3033
01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Back then Tyson was something special and Larry Holmes had a,</v>

3034
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it was a great,</v>

3035
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:02.731
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

3036
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:03.550
<v Speaker 1>great boxer.</v>

3037
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:04.351
<v Speaker 1>It's no doubt about it.</v>

3038
01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:06.000
<v Speaker 1>It was certainly been much more competitive.</v>

3039
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:06.721
<v Speaker 1>If you've got the,</v>

3040
01:21:06.721 --> 01:21:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes had fucked up Gerry Cooney,</v>

3041
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 1>if you put that Larry Holmes in with Mike Tyson,</v>

3042
01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:11.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a different Larry Holmes.</v>

3043
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:12.721
<v Speaker 1>By the time they fought,</v>

3044
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Larry was 36 years old.</v>

3045
01:21:14.011 --> 01:21:14.844
<v Speaker 1>He started to,</v>

3046
01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:15.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3047
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.410
<v Speaker 1>hit a long structure.</v>

3048
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:16.981
<v Speaker 1>Good fighter.</v>

3049
01:21:16.981 --> 01:21:17.211
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3050
01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:18.780
<v Speaker 1>he's in the Pantheon of great fighters.</v>

3051
01:21:18.781 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes without question,</v>

3052
01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:21.450
<v Speaker 1>who his boxing is,</v>

3053
01:21:21.451 --> 01:21:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3054
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:22.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3055
01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:23.510
<v Speaker 1>some of the best heavyweight divisions,</v>

3056
01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Molly's sparring partner,</v>

3057
01:21:24.901 --> 01:21:25.081
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3058
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:26.610
<v Speaker 1>if you watch that movie when we were kings,</v>

3059
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes is his,</v>

3060
01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.000
<v Speaker 1>is his number one sparring partner you ever seen?</v>

3061
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3062
01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:30.811
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3063
01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:30.991
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3064
01:21:30.991 --> 01:21:31.711
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways.</v>

3065
01:21:31.711 --> 01:21:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Larry Holmes in history doesn't get the respect that he's due because he came</v>

3066
01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:35.971
<v Speaker 1>after Ali.</v>

3067
01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3068
01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:39.360
<v Speaker 1>And he was the guy who beat up Ali when he beat up,</v>

3069
01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:39.751
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave.</v>

3070
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:41.940
<v Speaker 1>People never forgave him for that and he didn't.</v>

3071
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

3072
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:43.410
<v Speaker 1>he knew all these so well they had been,</v>

3073
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:43.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3074
01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.470
<v Speaker 1>they'd been sparring partners and yeah,</v>

3075
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:46.350
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

3076
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:48.240
<v Speaker 1>those last days of Ali,</v>

3077
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:52.140
<v Speaker 1>those should be the last days of Ali's career should be followed by every boxer</v>

3078
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.940
<v Speaker 1>very close with a fine tooth comb.</v>

3079
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.980
<v Speaker 1>So this is Larry when he had already,</v>

3080
01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.481
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

3081
01:21:57.481 --> 01:21:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's another thing.</v>

3082
01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Here's the real deal.</v>

3083
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Larry did not face the kind of opposition that Mike Tyson did.</v>

3084
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.313
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't,</v>

3085
01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.513
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't,</v>

3086
01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:05.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3087
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:10.911
<v Speaker 1>Larry fought a lot of good guys but his division was particularly weak and when</v>

3088
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Tyson came along it was like pink land,</v>

3089
01:22:12.711 --> 01:22:13.201
<v Speaker 1>Thomas,</v>

3090
01:22:13.201 --> 01:22:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Tony Tubs,</v>

3091
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:16.120
<v Speaker 1>all these guys that they were just,</v>

3092
01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:20.090
<v Speaker 1>they were very good fighters but they just weren't like this motherfucker.</v>

3093
01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Look at how,</v>

3094
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 1>look at how fast Tyson was.</v>

3095
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>He was scared and his ship work was amazing to look at us and he just had to hit</v>

3096
01:22:25.711 --> 01:22:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you once and he was so good at that bobbing and weaving style.</v>

3097
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:33.820
<v Speaker 1>He got a lazier as he got further away from the custom auto training from</v>

3098
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:34.740
<v Speaker 1>testimony I,</v>

3099
01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:38.280
<v Speaker 1>they said that was the beginning of the end for him also left Rooney when he</v>

3100
01:22:38.281 --> 01:22:39.420
<v Speaker 1>rapped left Rooney,</v>

3101
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:40.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3102
01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:42.080
<v Speaker 1>those guys had a falling out and then we'll,</v>

3103
01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:46.470
<v Speaker 1>that Pico was down from chat style and he also got away from someone who's not</v>

3104
01:22:46.471 --> 01:22:47.304
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting him.</v>

3105
01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened.</v>

3106
01:22:48.481 --> 01:22:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's where he went from being the greatest in the world to like slowly but</v>

3107
01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:54.270
<v Speaker 1>surely getting beaten by guys.</v>

3108
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And then the buster Douglas fight,</v>

3109
01:22:55.951 --> 01:22:57.210
<v Speaker 1>which is like the perfect storm.</v>

3110
01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Douglas comes in and Douglass,</v>

3111
01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:04.550
<v Speaker 1>his mother just died and he did not give a fuck and he wasn't scared at all.</v>

3112
01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:05.740
<v Speaker 1>He lost his mother,</v>

3113
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:07.790
<v Speaker 1>so she just came in and boxed it.</v>

3114
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.311
<v Speaker 1>Huge man,</v>

3115
01:23:09.311 --> 01:23:10.140
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3116
01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:12.420
<v Speaker 1>like I was watching him Jad Tyson and Tyson,</v>

3117
01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:13.780
<v Speaker 1>his head go back like that.</v>

3118
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.840
<v Speaker 1>You see Tyson's head snap back as as busted,</v>

3119
01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:19.560
<v Speaker 1>busted.</v>

3120
01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just throwing those amazing jabs.</v>

3121
01:23:21.821 --> 01:23:26.821
<v Speaker 1>Who Buster Douglas in that like when he went in that fight put on one of the</v>

3122
01:23:27.101 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 1>greatest performances in boxing history.</v>

3123
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:29.913
<v Speaker 1>It was brilliant.</v>

3124
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just brilliant because he was fighting Mike Tyson.</v>

3125
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:33.521
<v Speaker 1>It was brilliant,</v>

3126
01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:34.150
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

3127
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a tremendous fight.</v>

3128
01:23:35.231 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 1>He finally fought up to his potential.</v>

3129
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Buster Douglas was always a talented guy.</v>

3130
01:23:39.071 --> 01:23:40.870
<v Speaker 1>That was a little kind of a little lazy,</v>

3131
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>but not in this fight and this fight.</v>

3132
01:23:42.521 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 1>He fought like a fucking king.</v>

3133
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:50.000
<v Speaker 1>He hooked off the jab better than anybody I've ever seen heavyweight divisions</v>

3134
01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:52.180
<v Speaker 1>to the way he hooked off the jab though,</v>

3135
01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:52.511
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3136
01:23:52.511 --> 01:23:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like really like Ali ask.</v>

3137
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3138
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:56.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was beautiful.</v>

3139
01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:01.710
<v Speaker 1>He was firing the Jab and hooking off it and the fucking power bomb left hook</v>

3140
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:02.710
<v Speaker 1>that starts this off.</v>

3141
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:03.603
<v Speaker 1>Watch this shit.</v>

3142
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Look at this jabbing,</v>

3143
01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.650
<v Speaker 1>just tagging them.</v>

3144
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Tagging.</v>

3145
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Scanning is fixed that look at that left.</v>

3146
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3147
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 1>he catches him with that right upper cut first and then that power left.</v>

3148
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a fucking beautiful combination man and heavyweight boxing.</v>

3149
01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:25.960
<v Speaker 1>There've been very few combinations that were that gorgeous to watch on the</v>

3150
01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:26.794
<v Speaker 1>watch that again,</v>

3151
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.080
<v Speaker 1>put that lievable.</v>

3152
01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Just the way he fires in the jabs,</v>

3153
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.580
<v Speaker 1>he's firing jabs in on Tyson's face,</v>

3154
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:36.140
<v Speaker 1>sets him up for the uppercut lays.</v>

3155
01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:39.220
<v Speaker 1>A trap for him was fires in these jabs on them,</v>

3156
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:42.160
<v Speaker 1>lays the trap for them and then sends the upper cut up the middle.</v>

3157
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:44.950
<v Speaker 1>What's his top when he finally fires this off?</v>

3158
01:24:44.951 --> 01:24:45.784
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3159
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.660
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3160
01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:48.450
<v Speaker 1>that's like it's,</v>

3161
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.080
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the great performances,</v>

3162
01:24:50.081 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3163
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:50.621
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3164
01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:50.891
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

3165
01:24:50.891 --> 01:24:51.131
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

3166
01:24:51.131 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

3167
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:51.701
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

3168
01:24:51.701 --> 01:24:52.001
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

3169
01:24:52.001 --> 01:24:52.271
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

3170
01:24:52.271 --> 01:24:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

3171
01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.353
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3172
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:54.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3173
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a hook trap for him.</v>

3174
01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.220
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3175
01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.140
<v Speaker 1>he set a trap for him with that upper cut.</v>

3176
01:24:59.160 --> 01:24:59.993
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3177
01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:04.360
<v Speaker 1>That was a beautiful combination and that's just an example of a guy.</v>

3178
01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:04.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3179
01:25:04.811 --> 01:25:06.910
<v Speaker 1>he might not have been able to maintain that.</v>

3180
01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.920
<v Speaker 1>He might not have maintained it after he made so much money off of it.</v>

3181
01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:12.640
<v Speaker 1>This fight and after the Holyfield fight,</v>

3182
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.970
<v Speaker 1>they had lost at the moment and yet at the moment of greatness,</v>

3183
01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean he made a tremendous amount of money and maybe he just,</v>

3184
01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:18.460
<v Speaker 1>after his mom died,</v>

3185
01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:19.570
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to do it anymore.</v>

3186
01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the Tyson fight was just such a high water mark that he was done,</v>

3187
01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 1>but no one can take this away from buster Douglas that this night.</v>

3188
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that he was fighting and undertrained Tyson.</v>

3189
01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that he was fighting a guy who underestimated him.</v>

3190
01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It was that he came to give zero fucks.</v>

3191
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:41.200
<v Speaker 1>He came to give zero fucks and show what he's capable of and he trained like a</v>

3192
01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:42.580
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker for this fight.</v>

3193
01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:45.760
<v Speaker 1>He came in in incredible shape throwing bombs here.</v>

3194
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the 10th with these stop them in the 10th round.</v>

3195
01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.580
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys that came in against Tyson that we're already a beat too.</v>

3196
01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:51.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3197
01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:52.301
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways.</v>

3198
01:25:52.301 --> 01:25:54.160
<v Speaker 1>They were just so afraid of his punching power.</v>

3199
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was the 10th I believe it was late in the fight and was also,</v>

3200
01:25:57.281 --> 01:25:57.821
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3201
01:25:57.821 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 1>after buster Douglas had been knocked down.</v>

3202
01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:00.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3203
01:26:00.131 --> 01:26:02.410
<v Speaker 1>it was the 10th I remember I was so knocked down,</v>

3204
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I think in the eighth of the night.</v>

3205
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

3206
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:04.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3207
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you got dropped twice and clipped him with an upper cut and had him hurt.</v>

3208
01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:08.181
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3209
01:26:08.181 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3210
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>that was a fucking master full performance and it wasn't the right Tyson.</v>

3211
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:13.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3212
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I would've loved to see that buster Douglas again said Tyson had fought Marvis</v>

3213
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Davis,</v>

3214
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:17.160
<v Speaker 1>marvelous phrase.</v>

3215
01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.310
<v Speaker 1>She said that he wasn't training as much as he should have then,</v>

3216
01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 1>and that was when he was starting to get called the scariest all time.</v>

3217
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Tyson was the Tyson that was still trying to prove himself.</v>

3218
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 1>If you look for Tyson versus Marvis Frasier,</v>

3219
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the mother fucker.</v>

3220
01:26:28.731 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the man.</v>

3221
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the boogeyman.</v>

3222
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3223
01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Because you watch Tyson and you've for,</v>

3224
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:36.620
<v Speaker 1>you see Marvins Frazier across the ring from him and you see Tyson warming up</v>

3225
01:26:36.621 --> 01:26:36.950
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

3226
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to witness an execution.</v>

3227
01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And you see Joe Frazier trying to pump it sun up,</v>

3228
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>tell us on the box,</v>

3229
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:46.850
<v Speaker 1>and that guy walks in there and he can barely breathe because he knows what's</v>

3230
01:26:46.851 --> 01:26:47.351
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>

3231
01:26:47.351 --> 01:26:47.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3232
01:26:47.451 --> 01:26:48.201
<v Speaker 1>he's so nervous.</v>

3233
01:26:48.201 --> 01:26:50.510
<v Speaker 1>He's in the ring with the peak Tyson,</v>

3234
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:51.770
<v Speaker 1>the peak ferocity,</v>

3235
01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:55.550
<v Speaker 1>because the peak really wasn't even after he had become the champion.</v>

3236
01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.410
<v Speaker 1>The peak was on its way up.</v>

3237
01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.273
<v Speaker 1>Aw,</v>

3238
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.760
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>

3239
01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.593
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

3240
01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>They're going to build on him.</v>

3241
01:27:00.991 --> 01:27:02.000
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

3242
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to know how you think he'd do an MMA against guys like John Jones.</v>

3243
01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 1>This was before he fought for the title.</v>

3244
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:07.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3245
01:27:07.401 --> 01:27:07.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3246
01:27:07.531 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure,</v>

3247
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:08.871
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

3248
01:27:08.871 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3249
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:09.500
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

3250
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.333
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>

3251
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was when he was on his way up and everybody was shitting their</v>

3252
01:27:14.601 --> 01:27:17.480
<v Speaker 1>pants because he was on like ABC.</v>

3253
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I think this was,</v>

3254
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:19.461
<v Speaker 1>look at Joe Frazier.</v>

3255
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

3256
01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 1>If they're like twins,</v>

3257
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.831
<v Speaker 1>they're like twins,</v>

3258
01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:22.071
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3259
01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:22.904
<v Speaker 1>He and his dad.</v>

3260
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Joe Frazier was a great fighter.</v>

3261
01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Look at his dad and his dad right behind him.</v>

3262
01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:27.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3263
01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:28.671
<v Speaker 1>it looks just like them,</v>

3264
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but Marvis was like more slight in frame.</v>

3265
01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not that slight.</v>

3266
01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Well more slight than him.</v>

3267
01:27:33.441 --> 01:27:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Not like compared to you.</v>

3268
01:27:34.701 --> 01:27:35.534
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

3269
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

3270
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.711
<v Speaker 1>Look at Tyson.</v>

3271
01:27:36.711 --> 01:27:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Tyson has just built to administer an ass kicking.</v>

3272
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

3273
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:41.211
<v Speaker 1>Look at,</v>

3274
01:27:41.211 --> 01:27:41.631
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3275
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:42.080
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3276
01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like a joke.</v>

3277
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:44.330
<v Speaker 1>He's like a cartoon character.</v>

3278
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:47.930
<v Speaker 1>He actually fought twice after that before you won the title.</v>

3279
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.420
<v Speaker 1>So you're dealing with a guy who was 20 years old here.</v>

3280
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

3281
01:27:51.930 --> 01:27:52.461
<v Speaker 1>this is up.</v>

3282
01:27:52.461 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Jumped the boogeyman.</v>

3283
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the look on [inaudible] face was Fraser box.</v>

3284
01:27:56.961 --> 01:27:57.794
<v Speaker 1>Not Long.</v>

3285
01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:58.040
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3286
01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I think this was it for him.</v>

3287
01:27:59.151 --> 01:28:02.240
<v Speaker 1>He might've fought one or two times two wealthy or something.</v>

3288
01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:02.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3289
01:28:02.601 --> 01:28:03.950
<v Speaker 1>this is a terrible beating.</v>

3290
01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 1>This is my growing up too wealthy.</v>

3291
01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3292
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3293
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3294
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he was going to be this guy.</v>

3295
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 1>This is a look at this.</v>

3296
01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 1>This was two completely different types of human beings here.</v>

3297
01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:16.003
<v Speaker 1>Look at this fight,</v>

3298
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:17.540
<v Speaker 1>and this is an assault.</v>

3299
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:19.430
<v Speaker 1>This is not a boxing match.</v>

3300
01:28:19.431 --> 01:28:22.400
<v Speaker 1>This is a boxing match between the son of one of the greatest fighters of all</v>

3301
01:28:22.401 --> 01:28:24.300
<v Speaker 1>time and a murder,</v>

3302
01:28:24.301 --> 01:28:24.631
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3303
01:28:24.631 --> 01:28:25.310
<v Speaker 1>up to a scene.</v>

3304
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Frasier and his private fight him.</v>

3305
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3306
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 1>but could you imagine the horror of being a guy like Frasier and seeing your son</v>

3307
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.270
<v Speaker 1>just get destroyed?</v>

3308
01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Look at the movement of Tyson as he sets himself up for those punches.</v>

3309
01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.553
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

3310
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:37.191
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at that.</v>

3311
01:28:37.191 --> 01:28:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3312
01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:41.780
<v Speaker 1>back got up just the last combination when he cracks him just to watch the feet</v>

3313
01:28:41.781 --> 01:28:43.760
<v Speaker 1>of Tyson as he's throwing these shots,</v>

3314
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:46.880
<v Speaker 1>he's adjusting constantly as he's throwing these bombs,</v>

3315
01:28:46.881 --> 01:28:47.420
<v Speaker 1>look at this,</v>

3316
01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

3317
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

3318
01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

3319
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Move backwards,</v>

3320
01:28:49.761 --> 01:28:50.181
<v Speaker 1>backwards,</v>

3321
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:50.601
<v Speaker 1>backwards,</v>

3322
01:28:50.601 --> 01:28:50.961
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

3323
01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:51.380
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3324
01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's little subtle movements to get her stuff into perfect position.</v>

3325
01:28:55.731 --> 01:28:59.390
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the genius at Tyson that a lot of people don't notice when a</v>

3326
01:28:59.391 --> 01:29:01.250
<v Speaker 1>lot of people watch guys punch,</v>

3327
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.070
<v Speaker 1>they assume that he's just standing there punching the guy.</v>

3328
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:04.200
<v Speaker 1>No chance,</v>

3329
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:04.471
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3330
01:29:04.471 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly moving.</v>

3331
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 1>He's just always in the absolute perfect position to punch.</v>

3332
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 1>So as he's unloading these combinations,</v>

3333
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:14.070
<v Speaker 1>he's moving back slightly back in.</v>

3334
01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a genius and a brilliance to Tyson's destruction of Marvis Frazier and a</v>

3335
01:29:18.601 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>lot of other people that a lot of other fighters that people don't respect or</v>

3336
01:29:22.711 --> 01:29:26.670
<v Speaker 1>understand because they don't know how difficult it is to just just a punch.</v>

3337
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 1>A guy standing in front of you this many times and the way Tyson is doing it</v>

3338
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:31.980
<v Speaker 1>with movement is ridiculous.</v>

3339
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3340
01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

3341
01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:33.930
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3342
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Now Watch his feet,</v>

3343
01:29:34.951 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3344
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Watch he slides back and then perfect position paying perfect position and then</v>

3345
01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:41.611
<v Speaker 1>he looks at my offices.</v>

3346
01:29:41.611 --> 01:29:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Heads swings again,</v>

3347
01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:43.710
<v Speaker 1>sets them up,</v>

3348
01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Bang right hand.</v>

3349
01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.570
<v Speaker 1>It's almost the left is measuring the right being left hand.</v>

3350
01:29:48.571 --> 01:29:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Everything is perfect.</v>

3351
01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.840
<v Speaker 1>The the accuracy of both the hands and the feet is stunning.</v>

3352
01:29:54.841 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a masterful there.</v>

3353
01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

3354
01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:57.850
<v Speaker 1>United.</v>

3355
01:29:57.850 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Just excellent.</v>

3356
01:29:58.771 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 1>He was very technical.</v>

3357
01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:00.850
<v Speaker 1>He's an excellent technical bug.</v>

3358
01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what they said,</v>

3359
01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:05.220
<v Speaker 1>how hard he worked at at footwork and there was a perfect execution or he was a</v>

3360
01:30:05.221 --> 01:30:06.021
<v Speaker 1>perfect issue.</v>

3361
01:30:06.021 --> 01:30:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Schnur is perfect.</v>

3362
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 1>It looks more muscular there then.</v>

3363
01:30:09.241 --> 01:30:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Then anytime in his career that's up jumped the boogie man,</v>

3364
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:13.224
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson.</v>

3365
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That's when Mike Tyson was the scariest motherfucker ever,</v>

3366
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:18.590
<v Speaker 1>ever forget about Sonny Liston.</v>

3367
01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Forget about Jack Dempsey.</v>

3368
01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Forget about Jack Johnson.</v>

3369
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.133
<v Speaker 1>They were all great,</v>

3370
01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 1>but that Mike Tyson was the scariest motherfucker of all time.</v>

3371
01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:28.620
<v Speaker 1>That was the boogeyman.</v>

3372
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that.</v>

3373
01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I actually never saw it.</v>

3374
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:33.420
<v Speaker 1>He almost died.</v>

3375
01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:35.600
<v Speaker 1>He was a destroyer man.</v>

3376
01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.210
<v Speaker 6>Tomorrow you would you agree with them at this point?</v>

3377
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:39.051
<v Speaker 6>Most definitely.</v>

3378
01:30:39.051 --> 01:30:39.680
<v Speaker 6>Anytime.</v>

3379
01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.230
<v Speaker 6>If my manager and my train and filled out,</v>

3380
01:30:41.231 --> 01:30:44.090
<v Speaker 6>I'm confident and they're willing to put me in a title and I show I could beat</v>

3381
01:30:44.091 --> 01:30:44.511
<v Speaker 6>the champion.</v>

3382
01:30:44.511 --> 01:30:45.690
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure I could beat him off though.</v>

3383
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:46.880
<v Speaker 6>Of the three champions,</v>

3384
01:30:46.881 --> 01:30:47.780
<v Speaker 6>who would you like to fight?</v>

3385
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:50.380
<v Speaker 6>Anybody my trainer put me in with because I'm coughing now.</v>

3386
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:51.650
<v Speaker 6>Could be any fight in the world.</v>

3387
01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:53.120
<v Speaker 6>What do you think of the three champions?</v>

3388
01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:55.400
<v Speaker 6>Don't have good fight it because there have to be a good fight.</v>

3389
01:30:55.401 --> 01:30:57.260
<v Speaker 6>He can't take nothing away from it to become the champion,</v>

3390
01:30:57.530 --> 01:31:00.970
<v Speaker 6>but I'm confident I'm ready and I'm ready with my trainer tells me what am I</v>

3391
01:31:00.971 --> 01:31:01.090
<v Speaker 6>going?</v>

3392
01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:01.970
<v Speaker 6>Let's take a look at the green.</v>

3393
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:02.951
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>

3394
01:31:02.951 --> 01:31:03.221
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

3395
01:31:03.221 --> 01:31:05.530
<v Speaker 1>that guy does not get all the respect that he deserves.</v>

3396
01:31:05.531 --> 01:31:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the greatest boxer of all time.</v>

3397
01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I think in that time period,</v>

3398
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I think Mike Tyson is the greatest boxer of all time because he's not just,</v>

3399
01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:16.600
<v Speaker 1>he's not just a great destroyer.</v>

3400
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:20.020
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching how he's landing these combinations and how he can force his</v>

3401
01:31:20.021 --> 01:31:20.950
<v Speaker 1>will on fighters.</v>

3402
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.031
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>

3403
01:31:22.031 --> 01:31:25.930
<v Speaker 1>he's the most devastating boxer period that's ever existed,</v>

3404
01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:26.441
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>

3405
01:31:26.441 --> 01:31:28.870
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't continue it for a long time.</v>

3406
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3407
01:31:29.230 --> 01:31:32.590
<v Speaker 1>You gotta like put it in perspective of what he was capable of doing just</v>

3408
01:31:32.591 --> 01:31:34.870
<v Speaker 1>because he was only capable of doing it for a few years.</v>

3409
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:39.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean he didn't do it like people try to judge people all overall on</v>

3410
01:31:39.691 --> 01:31:40.840
<v Speaker 1>their overall career.</v>

3411
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't because I as a person who's had some competition in my life,</v>

3412
01:31:44.741 --> 01:31:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I know how difficult it is to maintain even the mediocre level of performances</v>

3413
01:31:49.211 --> 01:31:52.510
<v Speaker 1>that I achieved and I know that to be a world champion like Mike Tyson,</v>

3414
01:31:52.570 --> 01:31:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the training alone is sole nominee.</v>

3415
01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.080
<v Speaker 1>It requires madness wires.</v>

3416
01:31:56.081 --> 01:31:56.381
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

3417
01:31:56.381 --> 01:31:57.280
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of that?</v>

3418
01:31:57.281 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Tyson with someone like crushes everybody.</v>

3419
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:00.641
<v Speaker 1>What about well,</v>

3420

<v Speaker 1>right today a um,</v>

3421
01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.633
<v Speaker 1>what's</v>

3422
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>crushes him?</v>

3423
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>You think so rush,</v>

3424
01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 1>crush the Mike Tyson of up up jumped the boogie man.</v>

3425
01:32:08.951 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson runs through Klitschko like a wolf through a pack.</v>

3426
01:32:12.641 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 1>A sheep really?</v>

3427
01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I think he crushes all of them.</v>

3428
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Even lending flu.</v>

3429
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I just think there was a time period where he could not be beat Max Lewis as</v>

3430
01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:19.450
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3431
01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:20.500
<v Speaker 1>For one I've seen,</v>

3432
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody go through people like he went through Frank Bruno,</v>

3433
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.800
<v Speaker 1>like he went through last and razor Reddick was a giant.</v>

3434
01:32:26.801 --> 01:32:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Never put razor radical away.</v>

3435
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:28.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3436
01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:30.840
<v Speaker 1>but he knocked them across the literally knock them across.</v>

3437
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You know who put him away?</v>

3438
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.333
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Morrison.</v>

3439
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Toni Morrison,</v>

3440
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Mars last.</v>

3441
01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Odom.</v>

3442
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:36.693
<v Speaker 1>He left hooked them.</v>

3443
01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Questionable Stockbridge.</v>

3444
01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:38.531
<v Speaker 1>A bit of a question.</v>

3445
01:32:38.531 --> 01:32:38.930
<v Speaker 1>We'll stop it.</v>

3446
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3447
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:41.740
<v Speaker 1>He unloaded a combination that I didn't think he could have.</v>

3448
01:32:41.741 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Let it go on a little bit.</v>

3449
01:32:42.851 --> 01:32:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe they want to tell you to win a little bit.</v>

3450
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Little bit.</v>

3451
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.031
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

3452
01:32:46.031 --> 01:32:47.290
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy looked okay.</v>

3453
01:32:47.291 --> 01:32:48.190
<v Speaker 1>He looked okay to me.</v>

3454
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I've seen latest stoppages is all I'm saying.</v>

3455
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:53.340
<v Speaker 1>So all I'm saying fix could have been in,</v>

3456
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I think Mike Tyson,</v>

3457
01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 1>if you put them in,</v>

3458
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:59.410
<v Speaker 1>like if you had a time machine and you could get all the money from 1926 or</v>

3459
01:32:59.411 --> 01:33:02.590
<v Speaker 1>whatever the Fuck Jack Dempsey was the champ and put them in with Mike Tyson.</v>

3460
01:33:02.591 --> 01:33:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Just bring bikes like Mike Tyson would run through him.</v>

3461
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about,</v>

3462
01:33:07.451 --> 01:33:07.961
<v Speaker 1>I would never been,</v>

3463
01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:08.381
<v Speaker 1>Kate said,</v>

3464
01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody from with my eyes hit harder than Mike Tyson.</v>

3465
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:12.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not just hitting,</v>

3466
01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:16.160
<v Speaker 1>well I think guys probably hit harder like Earnie shavers.</v>

3467
01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Earnie Shavers was a far,</v>

3468
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:20.470
<v Speaker 1>is built different,</v>

3469
01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:24.100
<v Speaker 1>couldn't move as fast and it wasn't just the fact that Tyson could hit you so</v>

3470
01:33:24.101 --> 01:33:28.210
<v Speaker 1>hard and we see he was so accurate and that's what people don't understand.</v>

3471
01:33:28.210 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a brilliance to his movement.</v>

3472
01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not just punching power.</v>

3473
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 1>There's been guys that have ridiculous punching power or any shavers is one.</v>

3474
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:36.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3475
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:38.560
<v Speaker 1>people always bring up Tommy Hearns is another one.</v>

3476
01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous punching power in the heavyweight division.</v>

3477
01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:41.770
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few guys.</v>

3478
01:33:41.771 --> 01:33:42.431
<v Speaker 1>George Foreman,</v>

3479
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:43.264
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3480
01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:43.691
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3481
01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:45.520
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest punching power guys of all time.</v>

3482
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:47.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not just punching power.</v>

3483
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Tyson says the brilliance of his movement mechanics,</v>

3484
01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.060
<v Speaker 1>an accuracy of that combination that's just spectacular.</v>

3485
01:33:55.061 --> 01:33:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to watch.</v>

3486
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It's real artwork too.</v>

3487
01:33:58.331 --> 01:34:01.660
<v Speaker 1>For a guy who knows how difficult it is to land shots like that on a moving</v>

3488
01:34:01.661 --> 01:34:02.350
<v Speaker 1>opponent.</v>

3489
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Having seen so many different fights in my life,</v>

3490
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I never seen a striker that could fuck with Prime Mike Tyson.</v>

3491
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the perfect combination of emotions and this massive desire to be</v>

3492
01:34:12.011 --> 01:34:15.130
<v Speaker 1>loved and needed and perfect athleticism,</v>

3493
01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:20.340
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous genetics and genetics will willpower and the perfect trainer in the</v>

3494
01:34:21.491 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 1>perfect moment of his life,</v>

3495
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:24.070
<v Speaker 1>like a movie man,</v>

3496
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:26.860
<v Speaker 1>custom model was a boxing genius.</v>

3497
01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.030
<v Speaker 1>A guy would been around the sport his whole life and he saw this kid and he was</v>

3498
01:34:31.031 --> 01:34:31.241
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3499
01:34:31.241 --> 01:34:33.070

3500
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take this kid in.</v>

3501
01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he hasn't had anybody like that for a long period of time.</v>

3502
01:34:38.290 --> 01:34:39.090

<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson,</v>

3537
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:11.150
<v Speaker 1>when he's talking after,</v>

3538
01:35:11.151 --> 01:35:11.720

3542
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 1>He's not eat your babies yet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and can we get starved?</v>

3548
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I each a chilled drink that Mike Tyson,</v>

3549
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:26.810
<v Speaker 1>that was a different Mike Tyson that was in Mike Tyson who was already red</v>

3550
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:27.470
<v Speaker 1>lined.</v>

3551
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:28.700
<v Speaker 1>He'd already seen too much.</v>

3552
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 1>He'd already been through too much.</v>

3553
01:35:29.931 --> 01:35:31.610
<v Speaker 1>You'd already partied too hard.</v>

3554
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:32.271
<v Speaker 1>He'd already,</v>

3555
01:35:32.271 --> 01:35:33.830
<v Speaker 1>he'd already lost $300 million.</v>

3556
01:35:33.831 --> 01:35:36.650
<v Speaker 1>So there was already two months losing that much money by the crazy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how do you lose?</v>

3561
01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like when you see him there,</v>

3562
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.351
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>

3563
01:35:42.351 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 1>in that image and then up jumped the boogie man.</v>

3564
01:35:44.301 --> 01:35:45.410
<v Speaker 1>He's a young man,</v>

3565
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:50.530
<v Speaker 1>he's living in the Catskills in New York in an old man's house and he's being</v>

3566
01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:52.240
<v Speaker 1>taken care of like a,</v>

3567
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.940
<v Speaker 1>a plot,</v>

3568
01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.830
<v Speaker 1>a prime like at like the best prodigy of,</v>

3569
01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.300
<v Speaker 1>of master could ever have in his last days of life.</v>

3570
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like an incredible story that's out of a movie.</v>

3571
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:04.820
<v Speaker 1>You have a boxing master who's not just the boxing master,</v>

3572
01:36:04.821 --> 01:36:08.750
<v Speaker 1>but a master of psychology and the psychology of combat sports.</v>

3573
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:13.040
<v Speaker 1>And he has stories to go along with every one of his lessons and he puts this</v>

3574
01:36:13.041 --> 01:36:16.880
<v Speaker 1>kid in harm's danger in harm's way over and over again,</v>

3575
01:36:16.881 --> 01:36:21.550
<v Speaker 1>slowly but surely an amateur boxing competitions while teaching him all these</v>

3576
01:36:21.551 --> 01:36:22.850
<v Speaker 1>psychological principles.</v>

3577
01:36:22.851 --> 01:36:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And this kid can recite them back and forth with you.</v>

3578
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And as long as he's under the tutelage of this great master,</v>

3579
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:29.360
<v Speaker 1>he's almost invincible.</v>

3580
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 1>And then right after his master dies,</v>

3581
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 1>that's when shit starts getting crazy.</v>

3582
01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:34.670
<v Speaker 1>That's when he loses himself.</v>

3583
01:36:34.671 --> 01:36:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's when he's not,</v>

3584
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:39.450
<v Speaker 1>he's not that same guy after years and years of not being around cussing</v>

3585
01:36:39.451 --> 01:36:39.950
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

3586
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Not having that sort of relationship or figure,</v>

3587
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:43.760
<v Speaker 1>not just a father figure,</v>

3588
01:36:43.761 --> 01:36:44.031
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3589
01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3590
01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:49.420
<v Speaker 1>the masterful mentor that every young athlete wishes he came across when he was</v>

3591
01:36:49.761 --> 01:36:50.594
<v Speaker 1>an orphan.</v>

3592
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:51.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3593
01:36:51.051 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3594
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.200
<v Speaker 1>his story is so incredibly unique,</v>

3595
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3596
01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:56.430
<v Speaker 1>and I think they did a good job of,</v>

3597
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:58.550
<v Speaker 1>of touching on certain aspects of it.</v>

3598
01:36:58.551 --> 01:37:00.080
<v Speaker 1>And that movie with Michael Jai White,</v>

3599
01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:00.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3600
01:37:00.261 --> 01:37:01.094

01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I could drive.</v>

3602
01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:02.571
<v Speaker 1>Why did a great job,</v>

3603
01:37:02.571 --> 01:37:03.404
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3604
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:04.011
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3605
01:37:04.011 --> 01:37:04.641
<v Speaker 1>you believe in,</v>

3606
01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:06.260
<v Speaker 1>when you look at him that he's a beast.</v>

3607
01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:06.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3608
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Michael J.</v>

3609
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:07.400
<v Speaker 1>White,</v>

3610
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a really talented striker.</v>

3611
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:09.711
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

3612
01:37:09.711 --> 01:37:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3613
01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you've ever seen that guy work out before?</v>

3614
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the actor.</v>

3615
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3616
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Tyson.</v>

3617
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh really sad.</v>

3618
01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:15.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of coke or Christian fights.</v>

3619
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:15.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

3620
01:37:15.991 --> 01:37:16.521
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them.</v>

3621
01:37:16.521 --> 01:37:16.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3622
01:37:16.791 --> 01:37:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

3623
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:20.570
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit black belt and be like several different,</v>

3624
01:37:20.571 --> 01:37:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I think more than one different martial art.</v>

3625
01:37:22.671 --> 01:37:23.790
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit blackbelt.</v>

3626
01:37:23.850 --> 01:37:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3627
01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:24.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3628
01:37:24.441 --> 01:37:25.274
<v Speaker 1>There's also,</v>

3629
01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you seem like you've ever watched those videos where he's done a bunch of</v>

3630
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:29.241
<v Speaker 1>martial arts movies.</v>

3631
01:37:29.241 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 1>You see Michael Jai white throat kicks like that.</v>

3632
01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker's got perfect technique with everything he does.</v>

3633
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:37.340
<v Speaker 1>He's like a really high level black belt and striking.</v>

3634
01:37:37.341 --> 01:37:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

3635
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.650
<v Speaker 1>so his movements when he walked,</v>

3636
01:37:39.651 --> 01:37:40.460
<v Speaker 1>you watched him play tight.</v>

3637
01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't offensive,</v>

3638
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:44.780
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they captured the madness.</v>

3639
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:48.170
<v Speaker 1>That was his childhood and how it led to beat him.</v>

3640
01:37:48.171 --> 01:37:48.831
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>

3641
01:37:48.831 --> 01:37:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I went back again and I would say that it just forgot about it because</v>

3642
01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I remember the box can,</v>

3643
01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a two hour movie will can capture what</v>

3644
01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.240
<v Speaker 2>what forges someone like a phenomenon like Mike Tyson.</v>

3645
01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:02.730
<v Speaker 2>The movies never going to capture the real thing.</v>

3646
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would have thing that we just watched.</v>

3647
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:09.330
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing about it is not just the fact that we were watching a Guy Punch a</v>

3648
01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:10.164
<v Speaker 2>guy and do all this.</v>

3649
01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.940
<v Speaker 2>There's the fact that it actually happened.</v>

3650
01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:17.150
<v Speaker 2>That is a video of reality that took place that's undeniable and we saw</v>

3651
01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:19.140
<v Speaker 2>something incredibly special happened.</v>

3652
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 2>I think what's even just as amazing in some ways to fish from an American like</v>

3653
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:24.570
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>

3654
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:25.470
<v Speaker 2>you know as a,</v>

3655
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:25.711
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

3656
01:38:25.711 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 2>as a figure of the 20th century is the fact that he has a one man show that</v>

3657
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:32.160
<v Speaker 2>sells out all over the world in theaters.</v>

3658
01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3659
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I have a picture with him is like one of the happiest moments in my life.</v>

3660
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Me like first of all,</v>

3661
01:38:37.171 --> 01:38:38.100
<v Speaker 2>if you go to that show,</v>

3662
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:38.431
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3663
01:38:38.431 --> 01:38:41.640
<v Speaker 2>he was at the UFC and the UFC many times I've got a picture of him.</v>

3664
01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I put it on the Instagram and it was like,</v>

3665
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.350
<v Speaker 2>I've never been more proud.</v>

3666
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.310
<v Speaker 2>He knows who you are</v>

3667
01:38:49.770 --> 01:38:50.910
<v Speaker 2>and that's the same kind of,</v>

3668
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:53.280
<v Speaker 2>that's the same thing as where Laurence Fishburne came up to me and he goes,</v>

3669
01:38:53.281 --> 01:38:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to meet Joe Rogan man.</v>

3712
01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.210

01:40:00.211 --> 01:40:01.044
<v Speaker 2>17 years ago.</v>

01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:04.710
<v Speaker 2>And you were not only were you on the internet or something,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3717
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.760
<v Speaker 2>you literally went to get a more memory for your computer and you came out with</v>

3718
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:12.090
<v Speaker 2>a switchboard.</v>

3719
01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this.</v>

3720
01:40:12.961 --> 01:40:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3721
01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.400
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3722
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.140
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a genius.</v>

3723
01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:17.730
<v Speaker 2>He must be a scientist.</v>

3724
01:40:17.731 --> 01:40:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like more memory for here.</v>

3725
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know what the fuck you were talking about.</v>

3726
01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:25.770
<v Speaker 2>And you bought like a switchboard that you were going to put into your computer.</v>

3727
01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:25.951
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3728
01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:26.940
<v Speaker 2>it's just memory sticks.</v>

3729
01:40:26.941 --> 01:40:27.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not difficult.</v>

3730
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:28.980
<v Speaker 2>That's strange to me.</v>

3731
01:40:28.981 --> 01:40:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I remember just clip it in place and it's not hard.</v>

3732
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Memory is one of the easiest things to ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you were on line five years before I even had an email.</v>

3735
01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:37.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3736

<v Speaker 2>Robbie Printz,</v>

3738
01:40:40.531 --> 01:40:44.100
<v Speaker 2>a hilarious comedian from Boston that I came up with and Robbie was a,</v>

<v Speaker 3>award winning historians like Charles Mann of just,</v>

3796
01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:56.461
<v Speaker 3>I just did a pockets.</v>

3798
01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:02.100

3799
01:42:02.101 --> 01:42:07.101
<v Speaker 3>just like basically things like why in the south black they use black labor as</v>

3800
01:42:07.621 --> 01:42:11.430
<v Speaker 3>opposed to white indentured servants was because they were resistant to malaria.</v>

3801
01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:15.950
<v Speaker 3>They were just able to add a genetic like resistance or the fact that that uh,</v>

3802
01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.760
<v Speaker 3>tomatoes and potatoes,</v>

3803
01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:21.180
<v Speaker 3>you know where they come from South America and Europe,</v>

3804
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Italian food for 500 years is basically fusion cuisine.</v>

3805
01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:28.470
<v Speaker 3>The Italian didn't grow tomatoes until they got them from South America.</v>

3806
01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3808
01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.530
<v Speaker 3>when did they get the tomato?</v>

3809
01:42:34.531 --> 01:42:37.740
<v Speaker 3>The Colombian exchange in the 1,402 when,</v>

3810
01:42:37.741 --> 01:42:38.250
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

3811
01:42:38.250 --> 01:42:38.581
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3814

<v Speaker 3>and the French and w work coming into South America and this area and they,</v>

3815
01:42:45.721 --> 01:42:47.910
<v Speaker 3>and they would bring pigs with them so they could eat him on board.</v>

3816
01:42:47.911 --> 01:42:49.950
<v Speaker 3>The pigs would get off with escape into the forest.</v>

3817
01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.170
<v Speaker 3>They carry a lot of communicable diseases to humans.</v>

3818
01:42:52.290 --> 01:42:53.011
<v Speaker 3>That's how they think.</v>

3819
01:42:53.011 --> 01:42:54.960
<v Speaker 3>A lot of a lot of these communities,</v>

3820
01:42:55.110 --> 01:42:59.460
<v Speaker 3>these vast communities of Indians and Charles c man said that there may have</v>

3821
01:42:59.461 --> 01:43:04.461
<v Speaker 3>been up to 50 to 80 million inhabitants of the United States when white people</v>

3822
01:43:06.031 --> 01:43:06.960
<v Speaker 3>first came here.</v>

3823
01:43:06.961 --> 01:43:07.860
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

3824
01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what most,</v>

3825
01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.070
<v Speaker 3>this is the kind of shit I'm talking about.</v>

3826
01:43:11.071 --> 01:43:11.220
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3827
01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:11.820
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3828
01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:12.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3829
01:43:12.031 --> 01:43:15.240
<v Speaker 3>you hear about this stuff and they were all decimated by,</v>

3830
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.810
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

3831
01:43:15.810 --> 01:43:16.441
<v Speaker 3>by disease.</v>

3832
01:43:16.441 --> 01:43:19.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally it could have been as easy as when they were coming up the</v>

3833
01:43:19.981 --> 01:43:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi Delta with their pigs.</v>

3834
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:25.980
<v Speaker 3>It could have been 60 people brought diseases that no one had any,</v>

3835
01:43:25.981 --> 01:43:27.870
<v Speaker 3>no one had any fucking,</v>

3836
01:43:27.871 --> 01:43:28.704
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3837
01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:29.700
<v Speaker 3>a resistance to,</v>

3838
01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:30.421
<v Speaker 3>they all died.</v>

3839
01:43:30.421 --> 01:43:31.440
<v Speaker 3>So when they came back,</v>

3840
01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.480
<v Speaker 3>the entire area was abandoned.</v>

3841
01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.990
<v Speaker 3>It was just clay pottery and stone and nothing was there</v>

3842
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:43.520
<v Speaker 1>crazy because you know we were always taught that there was nobody here.</v>

3843
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3844
01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.170
<v Speaker 1>just a few Indians,</v>

3845
01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:49.840
<v Speaker 3>50 to 80 million according to the latest estimates by historians now and</v>

3846
01:43:49.841 --> 01:43:51.280
<v Speaker 3>archeologists paleontologist.</v>

3847
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3848
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:56.030
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are vastly larger than we thought and that,</v>

3849
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean a good percentage of it was straight genocide.</v>

3850
01:43:59.000 --> 01:43:59.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3851
01:43:59.241 --> 01:43:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was,</v>

3852
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of genocide involved as well,</v>

3853
01:44:01.671 --> 01:44:02.131
<v Speaker 2>but my brand,</v>

3854
01:44:02.131 --> 01:44:04.090
<v Speaker 2>that trail of tears and all the,</v>

3855
01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean even long before that they still have reservations to this day.</v>

3856
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Long before that though was disease.</v>

3857
01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:13.730
<v Speaker 2>What they think is that disease really truly decimated 90% of the population.</v>

3858
01:44:13.731 --> 01:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

3859
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's even important to differentiate.</v>

3860
01:44:16.281 --> 01:44:18.890
<v Speaker 2>What we don't actually know long before was disease.</v>

3861
01:44:18.891 --> 01:44:20.630
<v Speaker 2>But we do know two things took place.</v>

3862
01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.351
<v Speaker 2>Hideous histories,</v>

3863
01:44:21.351 --> 01:44:22.790
<v Speaker 2>way too muddy I think to do that.</v>

3864
01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.470
<v Speaker 2>But I think we do know two things.</v>

3865
01:44:24.471 --> 01:44:28.040
<v Speaker 2>We know they definitely got a lot of diseases from Europeans and they definitely</v>

3866
01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:29.110
<v Speaker 2>were murdered by Europeans.</v>

3867
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.350
<v Speaker 2>We know both.</v>

3868
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:31.590
<v Speaker 2>So I think when you say,</v>

3869
01:44:31.591 --> 01:44:31.731
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3870
01:44:31.731 --> 01:44:32.541
<v Speaker 2>this happened first,</v>

3871
01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:36.200
<v Speaker 2>and that happens second boy that gets squirrely when you're talking about 1492</v>

3872
01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.610
<v Speaker 2>that it gets real squirrely,</v>

3873
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:39.680
<v Speaker 2>very warlike with each other.</v>

3874
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.513
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

3875
01:44:40.590 --> 01:44:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3876
01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 2>they were savages,</v>

3877
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Columbus and those people were all fucking savage.</v>

3878
01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:47.391
<v Speaker 2>It's so straight.</v>

3879
01:44:47.391 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Slavery was the order of the day.</v>

3880
01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:52.450
<v Speaker 2>One of the great turning points in history was the abolitionist.</v>

3881
01:44:52.451 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 2>A worldwide abolition is moving the worldwide movement to end slavery was done.</v>

3882
01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.660
<v Speaker 2>So like nobody thought these were like fanatical.</v>

3883
01:44:59.661 --> 01:45:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Usually religious people at the most part.</v>

3884
01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:02.451
<v Speaker 2>Slavery,</v>

3885
01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:03.231
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

3886
01:45:03.231 --> 01:45:06.470
<v Speaker 2>throughout the history of human was the order of things.</v>

3887
01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:07.850
<v Speaker 2>It was just the birth.</v>

3888
01:45:07.851 --> 01:45:09.860
<v Speaker 2>You took everyone from Aristotle,</v>

3889
01:45:09.861 --> 01:45:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Socrates,</v>

3890
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:11.510
<v Speaker 2>they all had slaves.</v>

3891
01:45:11.511 --> 01:45:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3892
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:16.930
<v Speaker 2>it went all the way up until the idea that you could actually change the,</v>

3893
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.841
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3894
01:45:17.841 --> 01:45:21.140
<v Speaker 2>the how we look at human humanity as you're not channeled.</v>

3895
01:45:21.150 --> 01:45:21.530
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

3896
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:23.120
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't belong to somebody.</v>

3897
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't was so not in people's Pantheon.</v>

3898
01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:27.560
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3899
01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 2>when you were conquered by another army,</v>

3900
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you were simply sold into slavery.</v>

3901
01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:31.941
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3902
01:45:31.941 --> 01:45:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Constantinople,</v>

3903
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:34.280
<v Speaker 2>which was a society,</v>

3904
01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:37.820
<v Speaker 2>a civilization stand that stood for a thousand years.</v>

3905
01:45:37.821 --> 01:45:38.570
<v Speaker 2>It was the,</v>

3906
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:43.570
<v Speaker 2>the heart of Christianity when it fell in the 14 hundreds feet entire,</v>

3907
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:45.260
<v Speaker 2>those that weren't put to the sword,</v>

3908
01:45:45.261 --> 01:45:46.100
<v Speaker 2>the rest of them,</v>

3909
01:45:46.101 --> 01:45:47.390
<v Speaker 2>probably 50 to a hundred thousand,</v>

3910
01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 2>which is sold into slavery.</v>

3911
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.990
<v Speaker 2>And that was the order.</v>

3912
01:45:50.991 --> 01:45:52.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what you did.</v>

3913
01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:52.731
<v Speaker 2>So sorry.</v>

3914
01:45:52.731 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I know you've got a family and stuff were taking your kids stop it,</v>

3915
01:45:54.921 --> 01:45:55.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3916
01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.050
<v Speaker 2>and you just,</v>

3917
01:45:56.050 --> 01:45:57.680
<v Speaker 2>the brutality is beyond what,</v>

3918
01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:57.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3919
01:45:57.951 --> 01:45:58.970
<v Speaker 2>people come in and again,</v>

3920
01:45:58.971 --> 01:46:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to do with what people are used to,</v>

3921
01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.250
<v Speaker 2>that that was what they grew up with.</v>

3922
01:46:04.251 --> 01:46:05.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what they saw.</v>

3923
01:46:05.211 --> 01:46:06.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what they were used to.</v>

3924
01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.410
<v Speaker 2>There was when you were talking about Lincoln's kids dying and that was even</v>

3925
01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:10.220
<v Speaker 2>worse back then.</v>

3926
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:10.791
<v Speaker 2>Short way,</v>

3927
01:46:10.791 --> 01:46:13.220
<v Speaker 2>we're sure there was a wellspring of misery.</v>

3928
01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:13.521
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3929
01:46:13.521 --> 01:46:13.841
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

3930
01:46:13.841 --> 01:46:17.600
<v Speaker 2>where if you had an abscess in your tooth or rheumatoid arthritis in bitch,</v>

3931
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a wrap.</v>

3932
01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:19.160
<v Speaker 2>You Die.</v>

3933
01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:19.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3934
01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:20.360
<v Speaker 2>You get staph infection,</v>

3935
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 2>take care of and he scratch.</v>

3936
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:26.090
<v Speaker 2>You get from hammering nails to try to build the house to keep your children,</v>

3937
01:46:26.110 --> 01:46:27.140
<v Speaker 2>but you might lose your hand.</v>

3938
01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:28.003
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3939
01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Soon as possible.</v>

3940
01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:29.601
<v Speaker 2>And that was it.</v>

3941
01:46:29.601 --> 01:46:29.801
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3942
01:46:29.801 --> 01:46:30.321
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

3943
01:46:30.321 --> 01:46:34.340
<v Speaker 2>what the other side of it was that kind of contact with humanity was a great</v>

3944
01:46:34.341 --> 01:46:35.650
<v Speaker 2>deal of trade and,</v>

3945
01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.680
<v Speaker 2>and so potatoes kept Europeans alive for it because you grow on the ground,</v>

3946
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:41.990
<v Speaker 2>they're not as vulnerable as wheat.</v>

3947
01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Wheat in the wind will answer.</v>

3948
01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:44.520
<v Speaker 2>You get a hailstorm,</v>

3949
01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:45.620
<v Speaker 2>potato Stan to the ground.</v>

3950
01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.470
<v Speaker 2>When a marauding army comes in to take all your shit.</v>

3951
01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:48.760
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3952
01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 2>they're not looking at the ground.</v>

3953
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

3954
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.660
<v Speaker 3>got all your food and a sweet potato,</v>

3955
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:53.170
<v Speaker 3>a and even a potato.</v>

3956
01:46:53.190 --> 01:46:53.941
<v Speaker 3>But you can,</v>

3957
01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:57.660
<v Speaker 3>you can basically with a sweet potato and with milk,</v>

3958
01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 3>with milk products,</v>

3959
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 3>you can live,</v>

3960
01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.170
<v Speaker 3>you could thrive.</v>

3961
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:06.350
<v Speaker 3>So you had entire communities in Europe who were building and the Europe was</v>

3962
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:09.270
<v Speaker 3>built essentially all of Europe was built not just on bread,</v>

3963
01:47:09.271 --> 01:47:10.140
<v Speaker 3>but on potatoes.</v>

3964
01:47:10.141 --> 01:47:13.020
<v Speaker 3>When potatoes came in and tomatoes and,</v>

3965
01:47:13.021 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 3>and you had milk products like cheese,</v>

3966
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:15.990
<v Speaker 3>you're basically fine.</v>

3967
01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:16.381
<v Speaker 3>You will,</v>

3968
01:47:16.381 --> 01:47:17.011
<v Speaker 3>you will be fine.</v>

3969
01:47:17.011 --> 01:47:18.120
<v Speaker 3>You'll grow into a big strong boy.</v>

3970
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:18.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3971
01:47:18.491 --> 01:47:23.491
<v Speaker 1>nutrition is such an underrated aspect of like why people succeed and why they</v>

3972
01:47:24.251 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 1>failed.</v>

3973
01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:26.560
<v Speaker 1>And not just in,</v>

3974
01:47:26.561 --> 01:47:28.120
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like nations,</v>

3975
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of human beings that,</v>

3976
01:47:30.011 --> 01:47:30.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3977
01:47:30.970 --> 01:47:34.380
<v Speaker 1>like the people that take care of their nutrition and,</v>

3978
01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:35.830
<v Speaker 1>and give their body nutrients,</v>

3979
01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.270
<v Speaker 1>their bodies work better,</v>

3980
01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.650
<v Speaker 1>their brain works better,</v>

3981
01:47:38.890 --> 01:47:40.000
<v Speaker 1>they make more sense.</v>

3982
01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>

3983
01:47:41.610 --> 01:47:44.820
<v Speaker 3>One of the turning points in American history was when we got rid of oak warm,</v>

3984
01:47:44.821 --> 01:47:47.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a scorge of hookworm in the south after the,</v>

3985
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:48.863
<v Speaker 3>after the civil.</v>

3986
01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that they're trying to give people hookworm to cure asthma.</v>

3987
01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Really did.</v>

3988
01:47:53.291 --> 01:47:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3989
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Cause it makes you worry me make,</v>

3990
01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.870
<v Speaker 1>there's something that happens with hookworm.</v>

3991
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:59.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a quorum stops asthma.</v>

3992
01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.160
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a doctor that was trying to inject hookworm into a chronic</v>

3993
01:48:06.081 --> 01:48:08.270
<v Speaker 1>asthmatic cause they get into your feet.</v>

3994
01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Dr Infects himself with Hookworm for health experiments.</v>

3995
01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3996
01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.660
<v Speaker 1>this guy had,</v>

3997
01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:16.130
<v Speaker 1>so he swallowed,</v>

3998
01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.930
<v Speaker 1>he swallowed,</v>

3999
01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:18.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4000
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:20.310
<v Speaker 1>a camera to,</v>

4001
01:48:20.311 --> 01:48:20.501
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

4002
01:48:20.501 --> 01:48:22.760
<v Speaker 1>to film the action in his stomach.</v>

4003
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:24.020
<v Speaker 1>He infected himself.</v>

4004
01:48:24.021 --> 01:48:25.220
<v Speaker 1>His name is Dr. James Logan.</v>

4005
01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:29.510
<v Speaker 1>In fact it himself with these hookworms and then swallowed a pill,</v>

4006
01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:33.740
<v Speaker 1>a little tiny pill camera to find the action in his gut.</v>

4007
01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:36.590
<v Speaker 1>That's how that guy's bad ass dude.</v>

4008
01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:37.580
<v Speaker 1>That guy's gangster.</v>

4009
01:48:37.581 --> 01:48:38.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a doctor that did that.</v>

4010
01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Quorums make you anemic.</v>

4011
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.271
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

4012
01:48:40.271 --> 01:48:40.471
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4013
01:48:40.471 --> 01:48:43.300
<v Speaker 3>they rob your body of iron and you have no energy.</v>

4014
01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So say straight dope.</v>

4015
01:48:45.201 --> 01:48:46.640
<v Speaker 1>We'll hook worms.</v>

4016
01:48:46.730 --> 01:48:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Relieved my asthma.</v>

4017
01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:48.711
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4018
01:48:48.711 --> 01:48:49.370
<v Speaker 1>What's it say?</v>

4019
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:50.203
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

4020
01:48:51.150 --> 01:48:51.340
<v Speaker 7>Let me,</v>

4021
01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:54.390
<v Speaker 7>the body don't took Quinten [inaudible] and his team.</v>

4022
01:48:54.391 --> 01:48:58.440
<v Speaker 7>I've lined up a spatial scanner which can see through the top layers of Dr.</v>

4023
01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.320
<v Speaker 7>Logan skin before placing a water droplet containing 50 hookworm larvae onto his</v>

4024
01:49:03.321 --> 01:49:04.154
<v Speaker 7>own.</v>

4025
01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Cause I have a right to your arm.</v>

4026
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:07.783
<v Speaker 3>Into my skin,</v>

4027
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:11.000
<v Speaker 3>like straight away or is it going to take well thanks.</v>

4028
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:11.851
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know.</v>

4029
01:49:11.851 --> 01:49:12.960
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>

4030
01:49:12.961 --> 01:49:13.390
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>

4031
01:49:13.390 --> 01:49:13.810
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4032
01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Apparently whether or not this has nothing to do with whether or not hookworm</v>

4033
01:49:16.961 --> 01:49:17.651
<v Speaker 1>cures asthma.</v>

4034
01:49:17.651 --> 01:49:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately just hookworm it's in this guy's body that they can see what the</v>

4035
01:49:21.701 --> 01:49:22.534
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>

4036
01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.320
<v Speaker 3>they were a real score and once they created outhouses,</v>

4037
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:29.010
<v Speaker 3>when people aren't going to the bathroom and the great outdoors,</v>

4038
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:30.780
<v Speaker 3>cause everybody walked around in bare feet,</v>

4039
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:31.361
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

4040
01:49:31.361 --> 01:49:35.460
<v Speaker 3>it changed the entire landscape of the south and changed their entire economy.</v>

4041
01:49:35.461 --> 01:49:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Because you had communities where 90% of the people who are anemic and had no</v>

4042
01:49:39.061 --> 01:49:40.950
<v Speaker 3>energy to work from hookworm.</v>

4043
01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:41.893
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

4044
01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.680
<v Speaker 3>That changes your whole changed everything.</v>

4045
01:49:43.681 --> 01:49:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Everything you human being as a machine,</v>

4046
01:49:45.391 --> 01:49:45.561
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4047
01:49:45.561 --> 01:49:45.691
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4048
01:49:45.691 --> 01:49:45.990
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

4049
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 3>if you're not gonna be able to take care of the pathogens,</v>

4050
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.510
<v Speaker 1>the diseases and stuff,</v>

4051
01:49:49.511 --> 01:49:50.620
<v Speaker 1>and people don't feel good,</v>

4052
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be able to do anything.</v>

4053
01:49:52.410 --> 01:49:53.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like the importance of sleep.</v>

4054
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a sleep expert on the podcasts because sleep is way more important</v>

4055
01:49:57.461 --> 01:49:57.541
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

4056
01:49:57.541 --> 01:49:58.151
<v Speaker 1>than they thought.</v>

4057
01:49:58.151 --> 01:49:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Way more important too.</v>

4058
01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:00.890
<v Speaker 1>We are all chronically understaffed.</v>

4059
01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 1>If you're not sleeping and hydrated,</v>

4060
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.410
<v Speaker 1>then everything else falls out that you can everything else,</v>

4061
01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4062
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:07.300
<v Speaker 1>and I encourage people this and I can't stop saying it.</v>

4063
01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it again if you can.</v>

4064
01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>If you have access to an isolation tank,</v>

4065
01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>please do it.</v>

4066
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

4067
01:50:14.230 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 1>The relaxation that you get from one hour of a sensory deprivation tank is like</v>

4068
01:50:18.491 --> 01:50:20.740
<v Speaker 1>sleeping the best eight hours of your life.</v>

4069
01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I got to get your body feels so loose and good when they get out of there.</v>

4070
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:25.061
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

4071
01:50:25.061 --> 01:50:26.920
<v Speaker 1>And you've never had to change the water because nothing,</v>

4072
01:50:26.921 --> 01:50:28.300
<v Speaker 1>she just changed the water.</v>

4073
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:29.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4074
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:29.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4075
01:50:29.801 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It only lasts like a couple of years and you have to swap it out.</v>

4076
01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:33.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4077
01:50:33.431 --> 01:50:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I've had it,</v>

4078
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I've had it for five years the most I think I've ever had,</v>

4079
01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 1>but crash the guy who runs the float labs a heel,</v>

4080
01:50:39.131 --> 01:50:39.941
<v Speaker 1>he services that.</v>

4081
01:50:39.941 --> 01:50:41.620
<v Speaker 1>If you have a unit in your house,</v>

4082
01:50:41.621 --> 01:50:43.100
<v Speaker 1>he comes to my house and get services.</v>

4083
01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.060
<v Speaker 1>The place to go though is near you.</v>

4084
01:50:46.061 --> 01:50:46.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4085
01:50:46.301 --> 01:50:48.910
<v Speaker 1>you can go to float lab.com it's in Venice.</v>

4086

01:50:50.190 --> 01:50:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And by the lock and incredible thought I'd be there like I thought I could only</v>

4090
01:50:52.961 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 1>stay there for a half hour.</v>

4091
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:54.281
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

4092
01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:55.114
<v Speaker 1>I'd get bored.</v>

4093
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:56.261
<v Speaker 1>Two hours went by.</v>

4094
01:50:56.261 --> 01:50:57.094
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know.</v>

4102
01:51:04.930 --> 01:51:07.180
<v Speaker 1>You really should just one of the greatest things you could ever have.</v>

4103
01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:07.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4104
01:51:07.511 --> 01:51:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I have access to the most incredible environment on earth in my house on a</v>

4105
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:12.820
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>

4106
01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:14.170
<v Speaker 1>It's changed who I am as a human being.</v>

4107
01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And when I,</v>

4108
01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.840
<v Speaker 1>when I get away from it and I don't do it for a while,</v>

4109
01:51:16.841 --> 01:51:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I start getting squirrelly.</v>

4110
01:51:19.110 --> 01:51:19.861
<v Speaker 1>It's like a need.</v>

4111
01:51:19.861 --> 01:51:20.410

4112
01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like I need to get back in there.</v>

4113
01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:22.660
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4114

01:51:38.770 --> 01:51:39.603
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4127
01:51:39.970 --> 01:51:40.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4128
01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:40.570
<v Speaker 1>William hurt.</v>

4129
01:51:40.570 --> 01:51:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

4130
01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:41.853
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4131
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:42.341
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4132
01:51:42.341 --> 01:51:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It's William Hart.</v>

4133
01:51:42.970 --> 01:51:43.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4134
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:44.100
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

4135
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4136
01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible movie by the way.</v>

4137
01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:47.403
<v Speaker 1>I try watching it now.</v>

4138
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:47.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4139
01:51:47.591 --> 01:51:49.240
<v Speaker 1>God doesn't hold up at all.</v>

4140
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:50.440
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

4141
01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.101
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4142
01:51:51.101 --> 01:51:52.120
<v Speaker 1>how did I think this was good?</v>

4143
01:51:52.121 --> 01:51:53.320
<v Speaker 1>What was I retarded back then?</v>

4144
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.651
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4145
01:51:53.651 --> 01:51:54.320
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like I'm,</v>

4146
01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4147
01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:54.671
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4148
01:51:54.671 --> 01:51:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm a emerging from my own ea idiotic shell.</v>

4149
01:51:58.180 --> 01:51:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause I,</v>

4150
01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4151
01:51:59.170 --> 01:52:04.170
<v Speaker 1>there's weird things about these movies that we just accepted a few years ago.</v>

4152
01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:05.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a him,</v>

4153
01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it's based on the work of a great man,</v>

4154
01:52:08.561 --> 01:52:09.930
<v Speaker 1>a fascinating man name.</v>

4155
01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:10.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4156
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:11.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4157
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:13.743
<v Speaker 1>just the fuck's his name,</v>

4158
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:15.160
<v Speaker 1>John Lilly,</v>

4159
01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:15.993
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

4160
01:52:16.170 --> 01:52:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4161
01:52:16.650 --> 01:52:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and John Lilly,</v>

4162
01:52:17.491 --> 01:52:17.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4163
01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:18.880
<v Speaker 1>wrote the deep self,</v>

4164
01:52:18.881 --> 01:52:20.620
<v Speaker 1>which is a fascinating,</v>

4165
01:52:20.730 --> 01:52:20.920
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4166
01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I have took on,</v>

4167
01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:23.950
<v Speaker 1>on floating and uh,</v>

4168
01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.500
<v Speaker 1>he also invented the sensory deprivation tank and Lilly,</v>

4169
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4170
01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:31.090
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of weird shit like interspecies communication work with dolphins where</v>

4171
01:52:31.091 --> 01:52:32.180
<v Speaker 1>he'd take acid and,</v>

4172
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.890
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4173
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:36.730
<v Speaker 1>put himself in a sensory depth tank near a were dolphins live.</v>

4174
01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:38.980
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of freaky shit.</v>

4175
01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

4176
01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.980
<v Speaker 1>his work was,</v>

4177
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4178
01:52:42.431 --> 01:52:47.431
<v Speaker 1>he was known to be like one of the most daring of the psychedelic adventures.</v>

4179
01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Lilly was thought to be like a true madman.</v>

4180
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Like he would shoot ketamine and get into the sensory depth tank.</v>

4181
01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:55.640
<v Speaker 1>That was the big thing with them.</v>

4182
01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:58.550
<v Speaker 1>My friend Todd actually has Lily's tank.</v>

4183
01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:00.320
<v Speaker 1>He actually owns Lily's tank.</v>

4184
01:53:00.321 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Lily gave it to him and the first time he ever went into a tank,</v>

4185
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:04.880
<v Speaker 1>lily put him in his tank.</v>

4186
01:53:04.881 --> 01:53:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Lily had two tanks side by side and they would do ketamine together.</v>

4187
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Ketamine is,</v>

4188
01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:11.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking cat tranquilizer.</v>

4189
01:53:12.110 --> 01:53:12.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

4190
01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a psychedelic apparently,</v>

4191
01:53:14.211 --> 01:53:15.500
<v Speaker 1>but a very dangerous one.</v>

4192
01:53:15.501 --> 01:53:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Very hardcore,</v>

4193
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:17.780
<v Speaker 1>very addictive one,</v>

4194
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:18.350
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

4195
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Not just psychologically,</v>

4196
01:53:19.461 --> 01:53:20.510
<v Speaker 1>but physically addictive.</v>

4197
01:53:20.511 --> 01:53:21.171
<v Speaker 1>One of the rare,</v>

4198
01:53:21.171 --> 01:53:22.670
<v Speaker 1>physically addictive psychedelics.</v>

4199
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.863
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

4200
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.030
<v Speaker 1>apparently Lilly loved it.</v>

4201
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And the way it's described by Mckenna,</v>

4202
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced a ketamine,</v>

4203
01:53:30.861 --> 01:53:32.840
<v Speaker 1>but Wade Mckenna describes it,</v>

4204
01:53:32.841 --> 01:53:37.841
<v Speaker 1>is he believes that one of the things you get in a psychedelic,</v>

4205
01:53:38.391 --> 01:53:39.224
<v Speaker 1>like a mushroom,</v>

4206
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:43.190
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not just getting a substance interacting with your brain.</v>

4207
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:45.680
<v Speaker 1>You're actually getting a database of experiences.</v>

4208
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:47.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why when you take Iowasca,</v>

4209
01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you see Jaguars and black people and snakes is because that's what they see in</v>

4210
01:53:51.681 --> 01:53:52.510
<v Speaker 1>the forest.</v>

4211
01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:53.121
<v Speaker 1>In the forest.</v>

4212
01:53:53.121 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 1>They see Jaguars,</v>

4213
01:53:54.021 --> 01:53:55.550
<v Speaker 1>they see black people and they see snakes.</v>

4214
01:53:55.551 --> 01:53:56.780
<v Speaker 1>That's who lives in the forest.</v>

4215
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:57.860
<v Speaker 1>So when you take it,</v>

4216
01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:01.490
<v Speaker 1>you're literally not just taking this substance and interact with your brain.</v>

4217
01:54:01.491 --> 01:54:04.220
<v Speaker 1>You're also taking this incredible database of experiences,</v>

4218
01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:09.020
<v Speaker 1>which is why so many people have extremely similar accounts of the trip.</v>

4219
01:54:09.021 --> 01:54:14.021
<v Speaker 1>The trip reports are very similar when it comes to Iowasca and the idea is</v>

4220
01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:15.403
<v Speaker 1>ketamine.</v>

4221
01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.900
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that ketamine is a very recent drug,</v>

4222
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:20.240
<v Speaker 1>so the amount of trips are very small.</v>

4223
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So when you do the ketamine trip,</v>

4224
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:27.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not this overwhelming rush of Mondalez and patterns in geometry and,</v>

4225
01:54:29.070 --> 01:54:32.630
<v Speaker 1>and information and Egypt and iconography and you don't get that.</v>

4226
01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:33.171
<v Speaker 1>And Ketamine,</v>

4227
01:54:33.171 --> 01:54:34.700
<v Speaker 1>you can't like an empty building,</v>

4228
01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:36.013
<v Speaker 1>like you're in some,</v>

4229
01:54:36.110 --> 01:54:37.100
<v Speaker 1>some strange place,</v>

4230
01:54:37.101 --> 01:54:38.000
<v Speaker 1>but you're the only one.</v>

4231
01:54:38.001 --> 01:54:38.810
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4232
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going through these giant empty and occasionally someone's watching you.</v>

4233
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally you'll see like a lurker who's re looking behind walls and there</v>

4234
01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:46.970
<v Speaker 1>they're paying attention to you,</v>

4235
01:54:46.971 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you're in this freaky psychedelic journey where very few people</v>

4236
01:54:51.381 --> 01:54:52.041
<v Speaker 1>have gone before.</v>

4237
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:55.370
<v Speaker 1>So you might not even encounter other experiences or travelers,</v>

4238
01:54:55.610 --> 01:55:00.610
<v Speaker 1>but if you do it together with someone apparently can go somewhere together.</v>

4239
01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:02.780
<v Speaker 1>And this is what lily used to do.</v>

4240
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Little used to like he,</v>

4241
01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:05.600
<v Speaker 1>he asked my friend,</v>

4242
01:55:05.601 --> 01:55:05.931
<v Speaker 1>he goes like,</v>

4243
01:55:05.931 --> 01:55:06.380
<v Speaker 1>do you want to,</v>

4244
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you want to do ketamine with this?</v>

4245
01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Cause it was the first time they'd ever done,</v>

4246
01:55:09.230 --> 01:55:09.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4247
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:10.573
<v Speaker 1>isolation tank.</v>

4248
01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:11.241
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4249
01:55:11.241 --> 01:55:11.890
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

4250
01:55:11.890 --> 01:55:12.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4251
01:55:12.161 --> 01:55:12.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4252
01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:12.711
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

4253
01:55:12.711 --> 01:55:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say no to John Lilly who's holding a fucking syringe full of</v>

4254
01:55:15.861 --> 01:55:16.310
<v Speaker 1>ketamine.</v>

4255
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:17.990
<v Speaker 1>He had a prep for him and he's like,</v>

4256
01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:18.531
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

4257
01:55:18.531 --> 01:55:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I would have hit some intramuscularly.</v>

4258
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:21.283
<v Speaker 1>And then just,</v>

4259
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and then apparently my friend was like yelling some shit out.</v>

4260
01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4261
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Todd McCormick is,</v>

4262
01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:28.160
<v Speaker 1>he's much better at telling the story than I am.</v>

4263
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:33.400
<v Speaker 1>But he apparently had yelled out and so lily went to go like rescue him.</v>

4264
01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.380
<v Speaker 1>So Lilly banged himself with the ketamine,</v>

4265
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.000
<v Speaker 1>gets in the tank next to him,</v>

4266
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:43.070
<v Speaker 1>his two tanks Hopsin the second tank and meets them on whatever fucking channel</v>

4267
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>he's on.</v>

4268
01:55:43.590 --> 01:55:44.423
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4269
01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:44.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4270
01:55:44.881 --> 01:55:49.710
<v Speaker 1>And he like literally has a physical memory of Lilly coming and communicating</v>

4271
01:55:49.711 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>with him in this ketamine world.</v>

4272
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4273
01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.790
<v Speaker 1>That's also been established of certain tryptamines like um,</v>

4274
01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca.</v>

4275
01:55:58.140 --> 01:55:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4276
01:55:58.650 --> 01:55:58.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4277
01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:01.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the elements in Iowasca is this,</v>

4278
01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:02.700
<v Speaker 1>this plant,</v>

4279
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:04.290
<v Speaker 1>this chemical called harming.</v>

4280
01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And when they first identified it,</v>

4281
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:11.180
<v Speaker 1>they were going to call it telepathy scene because it didn't,</v>

4282
01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:11.730
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4283
01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:12.960
<v Speaker 1>when they took it together,</v>

4284
01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:14.550
<v Speaker 1>they encountered this group,</v>

4285
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:17.580
<v Speaker 1>state of telepathy that they all recounted.</v>

4286
01:56:17.730 --> 01:56:21.390
<v Speaker 1>They all recounted the same experiences while they were taking this Iowasca,</v>

4287
01:56:21.391 --> 01:56:25.200
<v Speaker 1>these early p or similar enough in their description because there are so</v>

4288
01:56:25.201 --> 01:56:26.130
<v Speaker 1>fantastical.</v>

4289
01:56:26.250 --> 01:56:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to really wrap your head around exactly what you saw.</v>

4290
01:56:29.730 --> 01:56:33.690
<v Speaker 1>But it was similar enough that they were convinced that they were having some</v>

4291
01:56:33.691 --> 01:56:35.700
<v Speaker 1>sort of a group psychedelic experience.</v>

4292
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And it supports the idea that when you take a psychedelic drug,</v>

4293
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:42.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not simply that you are,</v>

4294
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 1>your brain is interacting with a chemical because in reality that's all your</v>

4295
01:56:46.621 --> 01:56:47.670
<v Speaker 1>brain does all day.</v>

4296
01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.110
<v Speaker 1>It reacts to Stimuli.</v>

4297
01:56:49.111 --> 01:56:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Relapse reacts to love,</v>

4298
01:56:50.491 --> 01:56:51.390
<v Speaker 1>reacts to hate,</v>

4299
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:52.440
<v Speaker 1>reacts to stress,</v>

4300
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol levels,</v>

4301
01:56:53.401 --> 01:56:54.120
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline.</v>

4302
01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:58.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a constant soup of chemicals that are influencing whether or not you</v>

4303
01:56:58.321 --> 01:56:59.760
<v Speaker 1>think one way or another,</v>

4304
01:56:59.761 --> 01:57:01.080
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you get excited,</v>

4305
01:57:01.081 --> 01:57:02.340
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you stay calm.</v>

4306
01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that this one chemical,</v>

4307
01:57:05.671 --> 01:57:10.671
<v Speaker 1>which is produced by the human brain and is so closely replicated by DMT,</v>

4308
01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:14.220
<v Speaker 1>by a Iowasca buy mushrooms,</v>

4309
01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:19.260
<v Speaker 1>like mushrooms are really similar in like their chemical structure to DMT.</v>

4310
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:19.951
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

4311
01:57:19.951 --> 01:57:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the fact that mushrooms are really similar to natural human neurochemistry is</v>

4312
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.320
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking freaky.</v>

4313
01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that when you take these things,</v>

4314
01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you have these uh,</v>

4315
01:57:28.610 --> 01:57:33.610
<v Speaker 1>these weird interdimensional hallucinations where you feel like you'd go</v>

4316
01:57:33.631 --> 01:57:34.170
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

4317
01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:34.591
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

4318
01:57:34.591 --> 01:57:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I had the weirdest thing when I took mushrooms.</v>

4319
01:57:36.571 --> 01:57:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I took a three hour shower and I,</v>

4320
01:57:39.071 --> 01:57:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I kept seeing myself from the side.</v>

4321
01:57:41.131 --> 01:57:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Like I kept seeing my profile,</v>

4322
01:57:42.361 --> 01:57:43.230
<v Speaker 3>which was terrible.</v>

4323
01:57:43.231 --> 01:57:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4324
01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:46.650
<v Speaker 3>it was a terrible profile has to do is think about that and it's disastrous</v>

4325
01:57:46.651 --> 01:57:47.131
<v Speaker 3>profile.</v>

4326
01:57:47.131 --> 01:57:47.410
<v Speaker 3>But I have,</v>

4327
01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

4328
01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.050
<v Speaker 3>my chest is going in,</v>

4329
01:57:49.051 --> 01:57:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I got a barrel it out.</v>

4330
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of bench to do a,</v>

4331
01:57:52.441 --> 01:57:55.680
<v Speaker 3>and then I kept seeing somebody in the corner with a whip,</v>

4332
01:57:56.250 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 3>like who was kind of telling me to tell the truth.</v>

4333
01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:00.091
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4334
01:58:00.091 --> 01:58:00.990
<v Speaker 3>what wasn't whipping me.</v>

4335
01:58:00.991 --> 01:58:02.090
<v Speaker 3>But [inaudible] is like this.</v>

4336
01:58:02.130 --> 01:58:04.560
<v Speaker 3>I kept feeling this presence of,</v>

4337
01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:05.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4338
01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:07.440
<v Speaker 3>this person with a whip saying,</v>

4339
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4340
01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:08.600
<v Speaker 3>I think it was my,</v>

4341
01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:08.980
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

4342
01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:09.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4343
01:58:09.170 --> 01:58:12.450
<v Speaker 3>the side of me that was the truth and not lying.</v>

4344
01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:12.631
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4345
01:58:12.631 --> 01:58:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I realize that a lot of my life was a lie.</v>

4346
01:58:14.730 --> 01:58:15.563
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4347
01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:16.470
<v Speaker 3>cause I was young,</v>

4348
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I was young trying to do,</v>

4349
01:58:17.521 --> 01:58:18.540
<v Speaker 3>I was living other people's lives.</v>

4350
01:58:18.541 --> 01:58:18.790
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

4351
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:19.440
<v Speaker 3>I was doing,</v>

4352
01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.300
<v Speaker 3>listening to other people and it was a very,</v>

4353
01:58:21.301 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 3>very profound trip in a sense.</v>

4354
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:24.743
<v Speaker 3>And I actually,</v>

4355
01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4356
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:28.230
<v Speaker 3>af after I got back to normal,</v>

4357
01:58:28.231 --> 01:58:29.550
<v Speaker 3>the next day I had a,</v>

4358
01:58:29.850 --> 01:58:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I kind of did a real reassessment of my life.</v>

4359
01:58:31.831 --> 01:58:32.371
<v Speaker 3>I have to say,</v>

4360
01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:32.501
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4361
01:58:32.501 --> 01:58:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I kind of was like,</v>

4362
01:58:33.361 --> 01:58:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be,</v>

4363
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do what I want to do and listen to my own inner compass.</v>

4364
01:58:36.811 --> 01:58:37.830
<v Speaker 3>And I haven't been doing that.</v>

4365
01:58:37.831 --> 01:58:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4366
01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Well you're very different than when you were,</v>

4367
01:58:39.851 --> 01:58:40.720
<v Speaker 1>when I first met you.</v>

4368
01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 1>You very different.</v>

4369
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 1>You're very different in your good.</v>

4370
01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:44.681
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4371
01:58:44.681 --> 01:58:45.071
<v Speaker 1>Much,</v>

4372
01:58:45.071 --> 01:58:45.401
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

4373
01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>

4374
01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And not that there's anything wrong with you.</v>

4375
01:58:47.321 --> 01:58:47.771
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

4376
01:58:47.771 --> 01:58:48.370
<v Speaker 1>you were awesome.</v>

4377
01:58:48.370 --> 01:58:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd so if I met you in 1994 today,</v>

4378
01:58:51.521 --> 01:58:53.770
<v Speaker 1>if I met the 1994 cal and I would still be your best friend.</v>

4379
01:58:54.010 --> 01:58:55.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you were no,</v>

4380
01:58:55.391 --> 01:58:57.790
<v Speaker 1>but I know you were way more,</v>

4381
01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:58.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4382
01:58:58.690 --> 01:59:00.550
<v Speaker 1>under the control of other people that are directed.</v>

4383
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4384
01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:02.013
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>

4385
01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4386
01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:03.210
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

4387
01:59:03.210 --> 01:59:04.043
<v Speaker 1>I've always been</v>

4388
01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:05.830
<v Speaker 3>that I had that luxury.</v>

4389
01:59:05.831 --> 01:59:06.664
<v Speaker 3>You didn't,</v>

4390
01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:07.010
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4391
01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:08.470
<v Speaker 3>so the world was a dangerous place for you.</v>

4392
01:59:08.471 --> 01:59:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of fall backs and I think it allows you the luxury of not having to</v>

4393
01:59:11.771 --> 01:59:12.491
<v Speaker 3>think for yourself.</v>

4394
01:59:12.491 --> 01:59:13.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the,</v>

4395
01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:13.901
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

4396
01:59:13.901 --> 01:59:14.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4397
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 3>one of the fallbacks of having,</v>

4398
01:59:16.811 --> 01:59:17.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4399
01:59:17.021 --> 01:59:19.400
<v Speaker 3>a supportive home structure is,</v>

4400
01:59:19.570 --> 01:59:20.470
<v Speaker 3>which is a good thing,</v>

4401
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:22.330
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4402
01:59:22.331 --> 01:59:24.760
<v Speaker 3>when you have to fend for yourself in a lot of ways.</v>

4403
01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:26.020
<v Speaker 3>And I did to an extent,</v>

4404
01:59:26.021 --> 01:59:26.181
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4405
01:59:26.181 --> 01:59:27.014
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4406
01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 3>I always say to young people,</v>

4407
01:59:29.231 --> 01:59:33.670
<v Speaker 3>it's normal when you're young to be overwhelmed by forces,</v>

4408
01:59:33.671 --> 01:59:34.510
<v Speaker 3>you can't explain.</v>

4409
01:59:34.511 --> 01:59:38.830
<v Speaker 3>It is a lot of mystery in the world and you will be directed other other ways.</v>

4410
01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:44.070
<v Speaker 3>And your job as you get older is to find out who you are and what you're</v>

4411
01:59:44.621 --> 01:59:48.100
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do and where you're supposed to place your energy on your own terms.</v>

4412
01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:50.380
<v Speaker 3>That is the communion you have with yourself,</v>

4413
01:59:50.410 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 3>that that is the,</v>

4414
01:59:51.371 --> 01:59:52.300
<v Speaker 3>that is the idea.</v>

4415
01:59:52.301 --> 01:59:53.134
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

4416
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:53.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4417
01:59:53.981 --> 01:59:55.240
<v Speaker 3>for me now at this age,</v>

4418
01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:55.590
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

4419
01:59:55.590 --> 01:59:56.130
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to,</v>

4420
01:59:56.130 --> 01:59:56.831
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to fool me.</v>

4421
01:59:56.831 --> 01:59:57.461
<v Speaker 3>There's no mystery.</v>

4422
01:59:57.461 --> 01:59:57.941
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

4423
01:59:57.941 --> 01:59:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I know to an extent,</v>

4424
01:59:59.231 --> 02:00:00.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot to learn,</v>

4425
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:02.710
<v Speaker 3>but I know who I am.</v>

4426
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.500
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm supposed to do and I know why.</v>

4427
02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:07.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's a nice place to come to that.</v>

4428
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:09.730
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons I love standup so much,</v>

4429
02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:10.300
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

4430
02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:12.400
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of one of the things that I think is wonderful.</v>

4431
02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:13.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a privilege I feel,</v>

4432
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:17.140
<v Speaker 3>cause I get to express myself in an original way.</v>

4433
02:00:17.290 --> 02:00:18.370
<v Speaker 3>And that never,</v>

4434
02:00:18.371 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 3>that challenge never goes away and it's always changing.</v>

4435
02:00:22.241 --> 02:00:25.390
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that you know is fun like you and I go do the road.</v>

4436
02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:27.040
<v Speaker 3>One of the bonding experience.</v>

4437
02:00:27.041 --> 02:00:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I know you feel the same way as when you want your friend growing as an artist</v>

4438
02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:35.580
<v Speaker 3>growing in his self expression and constantly changing and having to change and,</v>

4439
02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:35.841
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4440
02:00:35.841 --> 02:00:39.760
<v Speaker 3>and being relevant to whatever's going on it with you at the time</v>

4441
02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>and having the ability to be a generous,</v>

4442
02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>loving,</v>

4443
02:00:45.690 --> 02:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>open pals.</v>

4444
02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Were you not worried about the other people getting success competition?</v>

4445
02:00:52.171 --> 02:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that in the artistic communities and whether it's music or</v>

4446
02:00:55.981 --> 02:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>whether it's comedy,</v>

4447
02:00:56.851 --> 02:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that and I think one of the best things that we've ever done is</v>

4448
02:01:00.481 --> 02:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>sort of eliminate that from our entire group of people.</v>

4449
02:01:03.330 --> 02:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Like we have an amazing group of people,</v>

4450
02:01:05.401 --> 02:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>whether it's already or Joey or Dunkin or red band or all these people that were</v>

4451
02:01:09.781 --> 02:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>hanging around with that are up there and they're there.</v>

4452
02:01:13.191 --> 02:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>They're doing things like we are all having fun together,</v>

4453
02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:16.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4454
02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4455
02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>no one is like,</v>

4456
02:01:18.331 --> 02:01:18.650

4457
02:01:18.650 --> 02:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>he brings their own talent to the stage.</v>

4458
02:01:20.221 --> 02:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Thompson Thompson girl was brilliant man.</v>

4459
02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:22.651

4464
02:01:28.291 --> 02:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I worked with him Sunday night at uh,</v>

4465
02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:30.811
<v Speaker 1>Ontario.</v>

4466
02:01:30.811 --> 02:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking hilarious.</v>

4467
02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly working to,</v>

4468
02:01:33.811 --> 02:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>these guys are constantly working with growing and when you have like a group</v>

4469
02:01:38.431 --> 02:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

4470
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4471
02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>like everybody inside</v>

4472
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:41.570
<v Speaker 2>grows everybody.</v>

4473
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's at Synnex city.</v>

4474
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:44.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's a pie.</v>

4475
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>You have the bigger piece.</v>

4476
02:01:45.891 --> 02:01:46.880
<v Speaker 2>There's no scarcity.</v>

4477
02:01:46.881 --> 02:01:48.310
<v Speaker 2>That's where people I think fallen the,</v>

4478
02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.480
<v Speaker 2>into trouble where they think of the,</v>

4479
02:01:50.481 --> 02:01:52.720
<v Speaker 2>of the world as a Pi and he's got this much,</v>

4480
02:01:52.721 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 2>that means I don't have as much.</v>

4481
02:01:53.690 --> 02:01:54.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not true at all.</v>

4482
02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a great point.</v>

4483
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a great point.</v>

4484
02:01:56.661 --> 02:01:56.961
<v Speaker 2>And that you're,</v>

4485
02:01:56.961 --> 02:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>that you're one of the best at describing that,</v>

4486
02:01:59.150 --> 02:01:59.450
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4487
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4488
02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:02.780
<v Speaker 2>that mindset and you've never had that mindset.</v>

4489
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:03.970
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why B,</v>

4490
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.020
<v Speaker 2>we've been good friends from the moment that we met.</v>

4491
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

4492
02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:07.341
<v Speaker 2>I knew there's,</v>

4493
02:02:07.341 --> 02:02:08.290
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any Duchenne.</v>

4494
02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:08.640
<v Speaker 2>You No,</v>

4495
02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:08.711
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4496
02:02:08.711 --> 02:02:08.870
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4497
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Because I look at it as an inspiration.</v>

4498
02:02:11.010 --> 02:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>So if I see a friend of mine,</v>

4499
02:02:11.961 --> 02:02:13.070
<v Speaker 2>it becomes very successful.</v>

4500
02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:13.761
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4501
02:02:13.761 --> 02:02:14.410
<v Speaker 2>when I watch,</v>

4502
02:02:14.410 --> 02:02:15.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4503
02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>what the success you've,</v>

4504
02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>you've created for yourself.</v>

4505
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:19.400
<v Speaker 2>To me it's very inspirational.</v>

4506
02:02:19.401 --> 02:02:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I that jealousy doesn't ever play a role in it and jealousy is in fact is a</v>

4507
02:02:23.481 --> 02:02:24.350
<v Speaker 2>false emotion.</v>

4508
02:02:24.351 --> 02:02:24.890
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

4509
02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:25.701
<v Speaker 2>you can have it.</v>

4510
02:02:25.701 --> 02:02:26.331
<v Speaker 2>We all have,</v>

4511
02:02:26.331 --> 02:02:29.990
<v Speaker 2>we all want something that you would get worried about your own accomplishment.</v>

4512
02:02:29.991 --> 02:02:31.400
<v Speaker 2>When you see somebody being really good,</v>

4513
02:02:31.401 --> 02:02:31.611
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4514
02:02:31.611 --> 02:02:31.761
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4515
02:02:31.761 --> 02:02:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm being lazy.</v>

4516
02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:35.570
<v Speaker 2>But just you got to approach that energy in a different way,</v>

4517
02:02:35.571 --> 02:02:35.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4518
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:37.850
<v Speaker 2>That energy is going to be there no problem.</v>

4519
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:39.770
<v Speaker 2>And you could also be,</v>

4520
02:02:39.771 --> 02:02:40.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing.</v>

4521
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4522
02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:41.450
<v Speaker 2>it is a good thing.</v>

4523
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:43.400
<v Speaker 2>You could look at yourself unfavorably,</v>

4524
02:02:43.401 --> 02:02:43.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4525
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:44.480
<v Speaker 2>and that's where the gel is.</v>

4526
02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Don't let the energy,</v>

4527
02:02:45.591 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 2>don't let that energy.</v>

4528
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Don't let that energy say fuck that guy.</v>

4529
02:02:48.651 --> 02:02:49.221
<v Speaker 2>He's just lucky.</v>

4530
02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 2>He's just good at playing politics.</v>

4531
02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Never helps you.</v>

4532
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.341
<v Speaker 2>And it's a lot.</v>

4533
02:02:52.341 --> 02:02:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4534
02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 2>it is a lie.</v>

4535
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:54.470
<v Speaker 2>And even if it isn't a lie,</v>

4536
02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.050
<v Speaker 2>who cares what Catherine to do with you?</v>

4537
02:02:56.090 --> 02:02:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

4538
02:02:56.630 --> 02:03:00.560
<v Speaker 2>If you see a guy and that guy hit the lottery and got on a TV show and you know</v>

4539
02:03:00.561 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 2>it was like friends or something like that,</v>

4540
02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:02.811
<v Speaker 2>not friends,</v>

4541
02:03:02.811 --> 02:03:05.810
<v Speaker 2>but you know one of those kind of shows and then all of a sudden he's doing</v>

4542
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:08.210
<v Speaker 2>headlining clubs and he really shouldn't be on stage at all.</v>

4543
02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:09.570
<v Speaker 2>What do you give a fuck cares?</v>

4544
02:03:09.571 --> 02:03:10.131
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

4545
02:03:10.131 --> 02:03:10.430
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4546
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

4547
02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:13.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what happens to me if I see somebody who's really good?</v>

4548
02:03:13.221 --> 02:03:13.521
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4549
02:03:13.521 --> 02:03:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I spend my time with people that are good and I watched my friend kicking ass</v>

4550
02:03:16.911 --> 02:03:17.091
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4551
02:03:17.091 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>you are sick or something like that.</v>

4552
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:20.510
<v Speaker 2>I get so pumped.</v>

4553
02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:21.560
<v Speaker 2>It just says,</v>

4554
02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:22.430
<v Speaker 2>it says to me,</v>

4555
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm in the right company.</v>

4556
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:27.110
<v Speaker 2>These people are inspiring me to move forward and keep.</v>

4557
02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what I'm capable of.</v>

4558
02:03:29.630 --> 02:03:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Discovery and invention is what separates human beings from animals.</v>

4559
02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.840
<v Speaker 2>As a creator,</v>

4560
02:03:35.890 --> 02:03:36.620
<v Speaker 2>you know you are.</v>

4561
02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:39.080
<v Speaker 2>The beautiful thing about your act is that you're creating something.</v>

4562
02:03:39.081 --> 02:03:40.850
<v Speaker 2>What I always said to you when I first met you,</v>

4563
02:03:40.851 --> 02:03:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4564
02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>why are you not like putting more emphasis into your standing?</v>

4565
02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4566
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:45.141
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4567
02:03:45.141 --> 02:03:47.120
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to do what these guys want you to do.</v>

4568
02:03:47.121 --> 02:03:48.650
<v Speaker 2>You're doing this weird alternative thing.</v>

4569
02:03:48.651 --> 02:03:51.000
<v Speaker 2>We were being like real like unthreatening on stage.</v>

4570
02:03:51.370 --> 02:03:52.430
<v Speaker 2>You weren't being yourself.</v>

4571
02:03:52.431 --> 02:03:52.761
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

4572
02:03:52.761 --> 02:03:53.594
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>

4573
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:58.630
<v Speaker 2>And then you're always constantly politicking for your next Gig and your primary</v>

4574
02:03:58.761 --> 02:03:59.031
<v Speaker 2>Gig.</v>

4575
02:03:59.031 --> 02:04:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Like you were looking for the primary Gig and I was like,</v>

4576
02:04:00.891 --> 02:04:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

4577
02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 2>your primary gigs right here,</v>

4578
02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:03.800
<v Speaker 2>standing on the acting.</v>

4579
02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:05.780
<v Speaker 2>You didn't do comedy for a long time.</v>

4580
02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.673
<v Speaker 2>Eight years.</v>

4581
02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:08.630
<v Speaker 2>That is so fucking crazy to me.</v>

4582
02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:09.650
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

4583
02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:10.770
<v Speaker 2>We were friends during that time.</v>

4584
02:04:10.771 --> 02:04:11.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4585
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I never did standup.</v>

4586
02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't just do it.</v>

4587
02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:13.251
<v Speaker 2>Send them again.</v>

4588
02:04:13.251 --> 02:04:14.450
<v Speaker 2>So it was like 36 or so.</v>

4589
02:04:14.451 --> 02:04:15.860
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird to me,</v>

4590
02:04:15.861 --> 02:04:16.250
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4591
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:17.750
<v Speaker 2>because you were always so funny.</v>

02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:18.651
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4593
02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Now what I see,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4595
02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:21.110
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm just,</v>

4596
02:04:21.190 --> 02:04:21.310

4601
02:04:24.831 --> 02:04:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I spent so much time not doing it and can't imagine my life.</v>

4602
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:30.050
<v Speaker 2>You need to listen to me more bitch.</v>

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.520
<v Speaker 1>you're doing some really funny,</v>

4618
02:04:44.521 --> 02:04:46.050
<v Speaker 1>weird shit on stage right now.</v>

4619
02:04:46.051 --> 02:04:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Mass party.</v>

4620
02:04:46.710 --> 02:04:47.970
<v Speaker 1>You're hitting your stride,</v>

4621
02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:48.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4622
02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>If you can tell you've been doing all these sets,</v>

4623
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:51.450
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it's all about.</v>

4624
02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4625
02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about um,</v>

4626
02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:55.290
<v Speaker 1>doing clubs as opposed to doing theaters.</v>

4627
02:04:55.650 --> 02:04:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm liking doing five sets in a weekend.</v>

4628
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:59.383
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

4629
02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Once you get in comedy shaped though,</v>

4630
02:05:02.011 --> 02:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>you got to get in comedy shape.</v>

4631
02:05:03.331 --> 02:05:08.331
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get used to doing those long sets in because it's so crucial.</v>

4632
02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4633
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Because you've got to be really like,</v>

4634
02:05:10.531 --> 02:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>especially with second shows like second show,</v>

4635
02:05:12.391 --> 02:05:13.224
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night,</v>

4636
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be real careful on your set list because you can get lost in what</v>

4637
02:05:16.981 --> 02:05:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you've done and haven't done cause it shows start merging together.</v>

4638
02:05:19.951 --> 02:05:22.710
<v Speaker 1>They start like they start becoming one show.</v>

4639
02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:23.640
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>

4640
02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4641
02:05:24.330 --> 02:05:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I have got to run to go do the fighter and the kid podcast.</v>

4642
02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do another podcast.</v>

4643
02:05:28.831 --> 02:05:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And if I don't,</v>

4644
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:32.280
<v Speaker 1>that's granite shop will take a big warm hand in my face and I don't want to</v>

4645
02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:32.730
<v Speaker 1>deal with that.</v>

4646
02:05:32.730 --> 02:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Don't let them do that because I have to be there by three 30.</v>

4647
02:05:35.071 --> 02:05:36.450
<v Speaker 1>You'll forgive me quite large hands.</v>

4648
02:05:36.451 --> 02:05:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
