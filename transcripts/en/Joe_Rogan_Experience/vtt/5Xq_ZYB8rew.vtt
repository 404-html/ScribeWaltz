00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.780
Hey,
what's up everybody?

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.750
This episode of the Joe Rogan is parents is brought to you by lumosity.com this

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.520
is the time of the year.
We're all looking for ways to build good habits.

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.180
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's new years.
It's a,
it's not really new year's.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.640
It's bullshit time doesn't give a fuck about you.
How about that?

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.920
How about a time?
Doesn't care about the universe,

7
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:21.660
doesn't care about solar systems.

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.400
Living and dying time is infinite and it only exists,
but for us,

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.880
you need a clock and a calendar,
so get your shit together.
You're lazy bitch.

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.060
Stop using the fact that time isn't real as an excuse and go to lumosity.com

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.410
Lumosity is essentially,

12
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.800
it's like a website gym for your brain.

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.850
They have brain games that are designed by top scientists to train mental

14
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:48.420
processes.
I say that because there's a Canadian guest on my podcast.

15
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:53.070
They like to say processes,
processes.
The Americans will say processes,

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.320
uh,
best parts.
They're fun,
challenging,

17
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.730
and they only take a few minutes every day.

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.090
One time you can track your progress online and can be over time.

19
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.270
Rather,
you can track your progress on time and compare yourself to other people,

20
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.920
which is a dick thing to do.
You know,
really just worry about yourself.
Stop.

21
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.840
I mean,
maybe be inspired by other people,
but don't be like,
Hey Bob,

22
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
what was your score?
Lumosity Myrna was better.
Uh,

23
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.040
I play it.
Uh,
you can play it on an iPad.
It's pretty cool just sitting around.

24
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.630
You can design these games,
uh,

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.930
based on the things that you're looking to acquire,

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.030
whether you're looking to acquire a better memory or you're looking to acquire.

27
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.880
You know,
there's,
if you go to the website itself,

28
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.230
there's a bunch of different options like memory you can put recalling the

29
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:44.070
location of objects,
remembering names after the first introduction,

30
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.780
learning new subjects quickly and accurately.

31
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.850
And the beautiful thing about it is it feels like a game.

32
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.420
It's just something fun that you can do that is actually good for your brain.
Uh,

33
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.840
go to lumosity.com/joe,

34
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:59.841
that's lumosity.com/joe and go check it out.

35
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.660
You freaks.
It's an awesome way to do something productive.

36
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.290
It's actually fun in your spare time.
And it's healthy for your brain.
I'm for,

37
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:11.970
I firmly believe in it.
I use them.
I think that playing chess,
playing games,

38
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.660
doing things that makes your brain think steps ahead,

39
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.210
it uses your brain the same way.

40
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:22.980
We use our muscles the same way we use our cardiovascular system.

41
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.920
We we exercise and we get stronger because of it.

42
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.370
I think the same works with your mind.
So read a book bitch.
All right.

43
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.680
We're also brought to you by Squarespace.

44
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.390
Squarespace is one of my favorite podcast sponsors because we know so many

45
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:40.620
people that have,
am I too loud here?
Yeah,
it's all of them.

46
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.050
Is it right here?
Is that better?
That's great.

47
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.410
Think Squarespace is an all in one platform to design your own website.

48
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:52.350
That's super easy.
Click,
drag,
drop.

49
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.250
It's an super simple interface.
They offer 24 seven support.

50
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.280
Every design automatically includes a unique mobile experience that matches the

51
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:05.260
overall style of your website,
so your content will look great on every device,

52
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:09.430
every time.
That's like iPads,
android tablets,

53
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.080
laptops,
windows,
the whole deal.
It's,
he was super easy and you know,

54
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.740
this is something that a long time ago it was virtually impossible a long time

55
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:17.831
ago.

56
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.650
One of the big things about websites is like you would get a website that would

57
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.800
work really well and internet explorer,
but then we tried to use it on Firefox.

58
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.180
It was shit.
It was a real issue for web coders,
not any more.

59
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.710
This is the easiest time in the history of the universe for making a website for

We are also brought to you by on it o n n I.
T.

76
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.960
What is on it?
If you've heard this website,

77
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.480
have you heard this podcast and you heard me talk about this website,

78
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:46.450
you probably totally tired of hearing about it at this point in time.
Uh,

79
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:51.451
it's a human optimization website and what we tried to do it on it is offer you

80
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.990
the best things that we can find as far as strength and conditioning equipment

81
00:04:55.991 --> 00:05:00.991
like kettle bells as far as protein supplements like hemp force and different

82
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:06.781
foods that we sell that are like we have like buffalo bars and organic coconut

83
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.600
oil.
Just things that I believe are good for your health.

84
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.910
And supplements that I believe benefit cognitive function benefits your ability

85
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:20.170
to perform a athletic tasks and it gives you a bit more endurance.

86
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.440
There's a lot of science out there that's been done into the,
the,

87
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:27.970
the science of athletics supplementation.
And you know,

88
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.710
there's not a lot that really work.
It's,

89
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.950
it's hard to find something that really works significantly.

90
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.370
One of them that works significantly is called cordyceps mushrooms.

91
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:40.090
The fascinating one that was the first figured out by the Chinese Olympic team.

92
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.210
It's based on a mushroom that they noticed these,

93
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.890
these cattle eating these mushrooms in high altitudes and they became more

94
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:51.970
active when they saw the meanness.
And so they were trying to figure out like,

95
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.670
why are they more active when they,
when they're eating this mushroom,

96
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.010
will they figured out that it actually enhances your body's ability to process

97
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.820
oxygen?
It's all fascinating shit.
Um,

98
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.190
all the supplements that on ana.com all of them have a 90 day 30 pill,

99
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.630
100% money back guarantee.
So if you're confused or if you're like,
man,

100
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:14.990
I don't know if this stuff really works.
Like new mood was a five HTP supplement,

101
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:18.170
which actually is a natural way of boosting serotonin.

102
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.590
And what's interesting about it is that doctors who were putting people on

103
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:25.790
antidepressants oftentimes tell them to not take five HTP because then you'll

104
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.560
have too much that good shit in your brain,

105
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.580
which seems to me maybe it's just strict to fire rich trip for,

106
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:36.470
you know what I'm saying?
But what am I,
what am I a doctor?
No,
I'm not even close.

107
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.950
All right,

108
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.950
go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t use the code name Rogan and save 10%.

109
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.960
A lot of new stuff if you haven't been there before or if you haven't been there

110
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:49.880
in wild digestive enzymes and um,
the new primal kettle bells,

111
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:53.270
which are all chimpanzees and Zombie kettlebells.
Lots of fun stuff.

112
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.430
O n n I t use the Codeword Rogan.
All right.
Stefan Molyneux is here.

113
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.320
Let's not waste any more time and cue the music.
Young Jamie

114
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.883
<v 1>jail.</v>

115
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.040
<v 2>Well,
good experience Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

116
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.980
I've been looking forward to doing this podcast with you again for awhile and
uh,

117
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.490
<v 0>I knew exactly what was going to happen.
Unfortunately,
when you got here,</v>

118
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:20.280
as soon as you sit down,

119
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.780
we start talking about so much cool stuff before the podcast even starts.

120
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:27.610
We needed a prequel.
Yeah,
man,
we're already into temperatures and uh,

121
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.840
there's a lot of different things,
but no,

122
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.030
no need to go back over all that stuff again.

123
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.210
I'm very excited to talk to you because there's been a lot of things that,
um,

124
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.270
first of all,
I've really enjoyed our first podcast,

125
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.630
really fun conversation in Toronto,
but there's a lot of things that I,
uh,

126
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.620
I read online and I say,
hmm,
I wonder how Stephanie would deal with this.

127
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.610
I wonder what your take on this is because you've got some very strong opinions

128
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:52.340
on where taxes should go and you know,

129
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:55.520
what money should be spent on that benefits the community.

130
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.620
And I agree with a lot of them.
I think they're very fascinating.

131
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.931
The France thing,

132
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:02.630
have you seen this France thing where they're jacking up the tax,
the 75%

133
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.550
<v 1>yeah.
I mean talk about killing the goose that lays the golden egg.
You know,
we,</v>

134
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:08.340
we,
and it's,

135
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.660
it's sad because everybody's seriously thinks that it's going to be somebody

136
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:15.510
else who's taxed.
Exactly.
They keep creeping it down.
It's like,

137
00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:17.400
let's go get those rich people and tax them.

138
00:08:17.401 --> 00:08:20.400
And then it's like you get a mirror and it's like,
what me?
No,
no,
no.

139
00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.091
The rich people.

140
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:24.690
But now it's getting to the point like they could tax all of the rich people in

141
00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:27.870
America and it would pay the government for like three days.
I mean,

142
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:31.410
it's all complete nonsense.
It's just the way of setting us against each other.

143
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.810
So we missed the whole reality of what's going on.

144
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.060
It's a piss poor management solution to,

145
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.840
it's a terrible idea to take the people that are earning the most and take a

146
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:41.670
massively disproportionate amount of out of

147
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.300
<v 0>money from them.
And so,
you know,</v>

148
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:46.420
they're talking about like pro athletes and clubs,

149
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.620
soccer clubs and corporations and you know,
the very highest of the high,

150
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:54.220
but still 75% is fucking ridiculous.

151
00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:56.010
No one deserves to give

152
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.060
<v 3>you 75% of what they've earned yet,
maybe a little bit more.
You know,</v>

153
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:03.750
I agree that as a person who's made a good amount of money in my life,

154
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.760
I agree that I should pay a lot of taxes.
I don't mind paying a lot of taxes.

155
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.520
I don't mind,
but I'm not going to give you more than half.

156
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.970
That's fucking ridiculous.
You can't get more than half.

157
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.570
You're not doing it right.
You're not spending the money right.
We can,
you,

158
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.070
you can get more than half when you give me a fucking complete analysis of every

159
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.450
penny where it went,
what it benefited,
I want,
Oh,
we actually living in paradise.

160
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.850
You know,

161
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.950
like if we're floating on clouds and we get like we shit rainbows and all that,

162
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.840
then you can get all my tax money.

163
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:37.350
And when there's no poverty and the children are all living peacefully and the

164
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:41.400
schools are gorgeous and glowing temples of knowledge,
then maybe,

165
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:43.290
but at the moment,
you know,
it's like,
oh,
sorry.

166
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.650
Do you need more money for this war in Iraq?
I have a slight problem with that.

167
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.550
Yeah,
I'm all out of money for you,
dude.
Same Way.
The guy with the sign,

168
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:54.390
the homeless sign in the corner that like smile and he flips it over it like

169
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:57.090
it's bent.
You know,
could you spare a dollar?

170
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.120
And then he flips it over like you've got this crafty sign.
Use that,

171
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.540
that mind that made that crafty sign.
Go get a fucking job.
You crazy.

172
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:06.870
Fuck you know,
Jesus Christ.
If it's possible for you,
you can get a job.

173
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.850
And if it's not possible for you to get a job,

174
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.300
we as a society should take those people off the street and put them in mental

175
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:16.440
institutions.
Give them help.
Well,
okay.
Okay.
So if,
go ahead,
drum,

176
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.750
drag corn at the topic if you dare,
but I dare,

177
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.650
there is this interesting thing around

178
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.190
<v 1>poverty,
right?
Poverty.
A lot of times people really feel like,
oh,
you know,</v>

179
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.060
they just had some bad luck.
It's a real shame,
you know,
they're just,

180
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.860
things didn't go quite the right way.
But you know,

181
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:33.230
statistically that the majority of people,

182
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:36.890
like if you take the average of how much people work in a household below the

183
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:40.580
poverty line,
you got two people in a household below the poverty line.

184
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.440
On average,
they work 16 hours a week between the two of them.
Whoa.

185
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.630
Now that is it to some degree,
poverty by choice.
And I don't mind,
hey,

186
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.520
wouldn't it be great to only work 60 hours a week?

187
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:54.620
Especially if your options are jobs that are kind of crappy,

188
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:59.210
which we all generally start with those jobs that are crappy.
But to me that's a,

189
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.670
and that doesn't change whether the economy is good or bad.

190
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.040
So it's not like where they'd like to work more with the can't find the work.

191
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.860
And that's just one of those uncomfortable truths.

192
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.460
A lot of poverty is voluntary and it's nice to be poor because it's a whole lot

193
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:14.930
less work and people get all the benefits out of not working or which are

194
00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:16.280
considerable,
you know?
I mean,

195
00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:20.870
I guess daytime TV is good for a lot of people and uh,
uh,
so,
but,

196
00:11:20.871 --> 00:11:22.850
but then what happens is then they need money for something.

197
00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:25.370
They get sick and suddenly poverty becomes this huge problem.

198
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.120
But a lot of poverty,
it's like monks,
you know,
amongst the poor,
but you know,

199
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.640
they don't need charity cause they're kind of choosing that lifestyle and it's

200
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:34.800
not true of all of the poor.
But on average,
a lot of people who are poor,

201
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.910
they don't particularly like to work.
And you know,
again,
I don't mind that,

202
00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:39.410
but except the consequences of that,

203
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.200
<v 3>don't you think that it's really difficult to break out of a cycle?</v>

204
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.440
That's the real issue that I've always had with people shitting on people who

205
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:49.440
are poor or people who live in poor neighborhoods for not getting out.

206
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.980
It's very difficult to break a cycle.
And if you're born into a of

207
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.810
<v 0>poverty and of neglect and of laziness and a lack of ambition,</v>

208
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.940
it's very hard to break out of that cycle.

209
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.470
And then also you're dealing with a really down economy where it's difficult to

210
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:07.660
get a job that pays good money,
they're all taken,

211
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.040
there's more people looking for jobs and there are jobs.
And a,

212
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.420
it's a real issue for a lot of people that,
you know,

213
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:15.950
don't really have an education or don't have a particular sentence

214
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.120
<v 1>or even if you do,
I got,</v>

215
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.410
I did a colon show while I was here in California and the guy called in and he

216
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:24.820
said,
you know,
I just graduated as a pharmacist,
like illegal pusher.

217
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.600
And for me it's like,
okay,
pharmacist in America,

218
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.970
if there's one thing that's recession proof,
because you know,

219
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:33.160
when people are down,
they get,
they take even more pills.

220
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.620
And it took him 10 months to find a job,

221
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:39.580
but he ended up having to take a job on the night shift.
Uh,
and,

222
00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:43.660
and that's a pharmacist.
Lawyers can't find work,
uh,
in America.

223
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:47.500
So even professionals are having a huge amount of problems.
Absolutely.

224
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:48.280
It's terrible.

225
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.760
But it's one of these things I worry about the degree to which when we tell

226
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:55.350
people stuff is really hard,
does it become a self fulfilling prophecy?
You know,

227
00:12:55.351 --> 00:12:58.120
like if you keep telling kids growing up in poor neighborhoods,

228
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.010
and I was a kid who grew up in a poor neighborhood,

229
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:04.480
so I have some sympathy with this.
But it's,
you know,
if you keep telling people,

230
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:07.510
well you know,
it's really,
really tough.
It's really hard to get out.

231
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:09.910
I wonder if partly oh well,
you know,
it's really tough.
So you know,

232
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:10.720
whatever it is.
Right.

233
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.660
<v 0>I don't think there's an either or,
but I think there's definitely a bit of that.</v>

234
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.261
But you know,

235
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:17.740
you kind of disproved it with your example of a pharmacist is looking for 10

236
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.560
months for a job in a very lucrative industry.
Yeah.

237
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.420
So that's sort of disproves it a little bit.

238
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.980
I think you and I are very fortunate in that we can make our money
independently.

239
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:30.910
We can make a living by doing things on the Internet,
providing content.

240
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:34.750
And for me doing comedy shows and UFC stuff,
it's,

241
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.740
I don't have to be in the regular job market.
I'm very fortunate because of that.

242
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:41.980
But for all I ever been in the record and I just drove limos.

243
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.490
I did construction and a lot of things while I was a struggling comedian.
Right,

244
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:45.970
right.
Okay.

245
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.390
I decided I wanted to be a standup comic at 21 and I sort of abandoned

246
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:53.800
everything else I was doing and I did a lot of shitty jobs then for a couple of

247
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.760
years.
But before that I taught martial arts.
So I've always had a weird life.

248
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.320
I've always been,
I just knew somehow or another,
um,

249
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.431
I probably,

250
00:14:04.431 --> 00:14:06.760
I probably could have been very different if my life is very different,

251
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:08.690
but my life wasn't very happy,
you know,

252
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.550
with my parents being divorced and moving across the country and always being

253
00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:16.390
forced,
moved around a lot and always making new friends.
I didn't enjoy school.

254
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.400
I didn't enjoy the experience of going,
I didn't,

255
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.860
I didn't have a desire to learn and I knew that whatever I was going to do it

256
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.640
when it's going to have to be something completely outside of the system,

257
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.290
there was no options for me.
Like the idea of going to like,
some people say,

258
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:32.860
well you know I really wanted to be a standup comic but you know I'm going to do

259
00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:36.120
it after I passed the bar.
There was none of that.
There's none of that.

260
00:14:36.121 --> 00:14:38.320
It was like this is a job that I actually could do.

261
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:42.810
Just go and try to do that because a job like be a lawyer,
be a,
you know,

262
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.210
fill in the blank insurance salesman,
whatever the fuck it's going to be.

263
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.130
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I'll go crazy.

264
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.010
<v 1>Well,
screw plan B,
you know,
Plan B,
everyone says plan B,</v>

265
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:56.240
but plan B is always going to end up going by the wayside because everything you

266
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:59.540
do in life,
you strengthen that muscle.
You weaken your other muscles.
So you know,

267
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:02.600
I will,
I'm a big fan of if you're going to do it,
you know,
do it hard,

268
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.060
do it to do it full on tilt,
Boogie,
you know,

269
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:08.780
150% and then if you fail at least you won't say,
well I could have done more,

270
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.810
you know,
but,
but just go full.
But then then you can always pick up the pieces,

271
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.380
start something else later.
But Plan B is usually a real disaster.
Like okay,

272
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.280
you can go be an actor.

273
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:20.300
But the important thing is also you've got that safety net is a news,

274
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.223
a safety net,
isn't it?

275
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.700
<v 0>I completely agree with you.</v>

276
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.130
And we're going to get attacked for this by people who are unhappy with their

277
00:15:27.131 --> 00:15:30.050
choices in life.
And that's a fact.
You know,
there's,

278
00:15:30.051 --> 00:15:33.710
there's a bunch of people that will say your why family,
she'll,
you know,
Jill,

279
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.260
great idea for you to just go out there and go crazy off people to support you

280
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.720
need to listen.
Stop saying that.
Stop saying any of those things.

281
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.810
Every single person who has ever done anything worthwhile or exceptional or

282
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.250
difficult or extraordinary,
anyone,

283
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:57.251
whether it's great artists or authors or mathematicians or whatever the fuck it

284
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:02.330
is.
Everyone encounters difficulties.

285
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:06.710
There is no easy road.
It does not exist.
It is impossible.

286
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.330
Everyone has issues.
If you have time to pursue a hobby,

287
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.110
if you have time to do anything in your life,
you can better yourself.

288
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:17.870
And here's one way you never better yourself.

289
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.770
When you come up with excuses for why other people are successful and you're
not,

290
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.760
that shit is fucking dangerous.
When you give yourself an escape.
Yeah,

291
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:28.920
well that's easy for you to say.
You know you do this,
you do to do it,

292
00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:32.780
and trust me,
every buddy has a hard road.

293
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.380
I wanted to jump out a window several times during my young life.

294
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:38.720
I wanted to jump in front of a fucking train.

295
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:41.240
Just end it because it's too much pressure.
Not really,

296
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.410
but you know what I'm saying.
Theoretically,
we all go through hard times.

297
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:47.090
We all go through depression.
We all do it.

298
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:52.091
Go through doubt and moments in your life where it's really fucking difficult

299
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:55.250
and you're trying to figure out what the fuck your path is going to be.

300
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:56.360
It's hard as shit.

301
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.900
But Stefan and I were talking about this before the podcast starts,

302
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:04.790
that fat is what makes you a person and those difficult moments are what build

303
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:05.624
your character.

304
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.280
Show me a great man who's the son of a great man and that's what we're saying.

305
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:14.990
These kids that are born billionaires,
you're fucked,
you're fucked.

306
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.750
You're never going to be a self made person.

307
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.570
You have a backup trust for your backup,

308
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:25.010
trust for your trust and your fucked man.
I met a guy like this.

309
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:30.100
His parents own this gigantic chain of high end stores and they're unbelievably

310
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:31.514
wealthy.

311
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:36.560
Billionaire beach in Malibu is this massive community of,
you know,

312
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:38.840
1520 $30 million homes.

313
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.550
They bought the next door neighbor's homes on both sides and overpaid for them

314
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.370
cause they didn't want anybody staying next to them.

315
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.910
They just bought the homes like $30 million,
$25 million.

316
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.990
They literally own like a hundred houses.
They own homes everywhere.

317
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.790
I'm talking estates in Denver,
in the mountains and you know,
Wyoming,

318
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:03.510
it's some great ranch.
I mean they just have fucking,
and the guy is a mess.

319
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:06.750
You could just slap him in the face.
You could just take his pants off.

320
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.290
He would just panic.
He has no confidence.
He's,
he's literally not,
uh,

321
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.070
not a person.
He's like a cat.

322
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.960
He's like a cat and you have to feed or a dog.
It's just,
he's a sad,
sad person.

323
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.360
Resists

324
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.980
<v 1>since breeds strength.
They muscles and character in,
in,
in mind and on muscles.</v>

325
00:18:23.981 --> 00:18:24.820
Hate to exercise.

326
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.700
<v 0>That's [inaudible] dot com is an excellent sponsor.</v>

327
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.350
<v 1>It is,
you know,
that which does not kill us,
makes us stronger.</v>

328
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:33.981
You know what I mean?

329
00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:38.620
Sort of radiation poisoning is really not good at sort of metaphorically they

330
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.730
out of the pure bio chemistry,
but that,
which is,

331
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:44.600
it's hard for you is what all the stuff we hate at the time.

332
00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:47.780
It's just stuff that,
that we love later.
You know,
you go like,
wow,

333
00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:50.150
that really did give me an appreciation for this or whatever.

334
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.510
And the Trustafarians,
you know,
like the kids whose parents are really rich.

335
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.750
It is a huge problem among rich parents.
How do you raise your kids?

336
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.310
Because when you're poor or even middle class you,
your kid says,
I want x.

337
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.060
And you said,
what are you saying?
We can't afford it.
Well,
but you have a,

338
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.401
you know,

339
00:19:04.401 --> 00:19:08.300
if your kids looking around and seeing like gold fountains in the living room

340
00:19:08.301 --> 00:19:10.640
and you know,
chocolate bar that's upstairs and so on,

341
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.360
then clearly you can't afford it.
And what do you say to your kids?
It's really,

342
00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:17.120
really tough.
We have to provide limits because of x,
Y and zed.
I mean,

343
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.510
a lot of people like to duck out in the,
we can't afford it excuse,

344
00:19:20.511 --> 00:19:23.630
but rich parents don't have that.
And it's really tough for them to set limits.

345
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.380
<v 0>It's very hard.
And it's also very hard when a child grows up with no doubt,</v>

346
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.500
if you have no doubt as to what your future is going to be,

347
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.540
you don't have ambition.
The,
a lot of ambition comes from fear.
And,
uh,

348
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.530
as a comic,

349
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.770
some of my best sets ever in standup have come after I bombed.

350
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.770
Like I bombed.
Oh yeah,
look at this.
I've got no career.

351
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.270
We'll also,
it's a terrible feeling.
You don't want to,

352
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.470
you don't want that feeling to,
to reoccur.

353
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.940
So you have these bad sets and then you just get really super motivated to work

354
00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:59.720
on everything that's wrong or recognize what went wrong in that night and never

355
00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:00.620
let it happen again.

356
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.970
And one of the worst traits that a comedian could ever have is to be easily

357
00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:07.760
satisfied with yourself.
It's one of the worst.

358
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.850
If you think you're better than you are or you're really satisfied where

359
00:20:10.851 --> 00:20:14.240
everything,
hey,
it's perfect.
No need to work on it.
It's it.
That's poison.

360
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.100
That's like a terrible,
terrible,

361
00:20:16.101 --> 00:20:19.550
terrible mindset for a standup comedian for that very same reason.

362
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.320
Like it has to be a struggle.

363
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.770
<v 1>But we always this way,
aren't we?</v>

364
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:24.870
Like we always dissatisfied with something we achieve,

365
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:28.470
say shitty and then we're immediately dissatisfied again.
And I,
you know,

366
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.620
there's a lot of people who will promise you piece of mind and Zan and this and

367
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:34.800
then I actually think that's completely an illusion and I think it actually

368
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:38.400
contributes to more dissatisfaction.
Dissatisfaction is the nature of the beast.

369
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.500
It's why we're doing this and not going,
Oh God.

370
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:43.410
Booga Booga in some caves cause we were dissatisfied with the cave.

371
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:46.320
So we built some hats.
We were dissatisfied with the hats.
We built some condos,

372
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.310
we're always dissatisfied and

373
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.800
<v 4>therefore we will continue to want to improve things.</v>

374
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:53.770
That's how things get better at the moment.
We're satisfied with something.

375
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.160
We immediately set a new challenge and remain unsatisfied in the achievement of

376
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:59.020
that and people who try to end that process.

377
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:02.010
I think it just trying to end being alive fundamentally.
Mr Manya,

378
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.270
you're talking too much sense here,
sir.

379
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.850
You're confused and we have to break for commercial now free.
We,

380
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.500
I wish we could just to reprogram people's minds back to consumerism.

381
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.340
You're 100% right.
There's,
look,

382
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:19.140
I think everyone looks forward to this utopian time where whatever motivates

383
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:22.720
them,
drives them,
freaks them out right now.
Can Be set aside,

384
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:26.650
the work is done and you can just sort of like watch the sunset over the pond.

385
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.990
And the the,

386
00:21:27.991 --> 00:21:32.800
the problem is this youtube Utopian vision of the future that we have is

387
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:37.420
probably a carrot that's on a stick that will just never reach and we keep

388
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.310
working hard to improve our society,

389
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.800
our life and ourselves and our families and our relationships.

390
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.280
Hoping that one day we'll achieve this ultimate piece that will never come.

391
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.950
I know.
And,
and this is how people get exploited.

392
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.290
If they can dangle that carrot right and they can say,

393
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:54.100
well you see the communist into communist utopia,
you won't need to work.

394
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:58.500
And in the communist utopia or the fascist utopia or you know that Peter Joseph,

395
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.690
robot,
Mommy cities,
you won't have to work and everything will be fine.

396
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.770
Or in the religious view a you'll get to go to heaven or you all achieved

397
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:08.080
transcendental bliss or you know enough yoga,

398
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:10.330
you're a button will be firm and your soul,
it would be at peace.

399
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.330
They will get you to give up freedoms and money and so on,

400
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.260
in hopes of buying a piece of mind that is fundamentally anti-human in the long

401
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:17.740
run.

402
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.660
At the restlessness of our species is the diamond that we get crushed into for

403
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:27.070
the existence that we currently provide for ourselves in.
Yes,
I agree.

404
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:27.904
100%.

405
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:33.030
I think the whole idea about all this is engineering a utopia like Peter Joseph,

406
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:37.270
who I think is a very smart guy and I like him.
I had him on the podcast.

407
00:22:37.271 --> 00:22:39.430
I enjoy communicating with him.
I think he's very bright.

408
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.880
But what I think is hilarious is that he makes his money as a stockbroker.

409
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.480
I mean he's talking about this utopian world and he's drawing very blood that

410
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:56.290
keeps him alive from a vampire system.
And this crazy fucking vampire system.

411
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.080
I no,
no,
no,
but he's a,
he's a fan power on the inside.

412
00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:04.060
He's working the inside a system.
So I know he's an inside pamper.

413
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:07.390
You guys had some serious debates,
didn't you listen to them?

414
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:11.860
And a couple of flybys,
like I did some reviews of the zeitgeist movies a and um,

415
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.700
and then we actually had a debate.
We have fairly Cordela,
you know,

416
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:18.880
definitely butted heads.
So which is natural.
This is what kind of what you want.

417
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.910
And then,
um,
yeah,
he did go a little bit,

418
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:25.900
I thought ballistic and some of the post debate,
uh,
let's say analysis,
uh,

419
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:29.140
where I think he veered off a little bit into ad hominems.
But you know,

420
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:33.100
my basic point is I don't,
as long as people do two things,
you know,

421
00:23:33.101 --> 00:23:36.760
do two things and you know,
we have friends till the end,
right?
Uh,
respect,

422
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:40.570
self ownership and you know,
property rights and do not initiate force.

423
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.680
And so look,
if this,

424
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:46.040
if these cities built by Jack Fresco and his merry of Elvin robots,

425
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.520
<v 1>if this is human paradise on earth,
I say,
go for it.
Have Fun.</v>

426
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.610
Just don't force people to participate and let people leave as they want.

427
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:55.700
That's the only thing that matters.
Everything has to be voluntary.

428
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.960
You cannot violate the nonaggression principle.
Everything outside of that is,

429
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.930
you know,
well,
what color drapes do you want?
I don't care.
Just don't steal them.

430
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.440
<v 0>The Ad Hominems are very disappointing,
aren't they?
You know,</v>

431
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.450
especially when it's just,

432
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:11.510
you could easily have just disagreed and been fine with that and debated your

433
00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:14.700
points and look,
you and I probably don't agree on everything.

434
00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:17.570
That's probably quite a few things come up that a,

435
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.820
we have different points of view on and that's because we're different human

436
00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:24.870
beings and it's also because there's not a black and white with these ideas of

437
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.080
engineering society.
There's,
it's not a,
there's not a black and white,

438
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.220
it's a very look,
if it was very easy and straight forward,

439
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:35.190
it would have been done already.
Okay.
It's not,
it's complicated.

440
00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:37.470
There's a lot to being a person.

441
00:24:37.471 --> 00:24:40.890
There's a lot to being a person that contributes to society and there's a lot to

442
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.550
what,

443
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.590
what about society is feeding itself and just feeding more society and more.

444
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.680
What about corporations are just feeding corporations and what about them is

445
00:24:49.681 --> 00:24:53.520
benefiting humanity and if it wouldn't sway it towards benefiting humanity,

446
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.170
it's always the best choice.

447
00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:00.120
But the idea of engineering it and one foolproof way that makes everyone happy.

448
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.050
That's silly that people that want to remove capitalism as a whole.

449
00:25:04.051 --> 00:25:08.040
Like I've met people that have jobs that tell me that people with money are a

450
00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:11.010
problem and I'll go bug.
They can be,

451
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.530
but you know how much money bill gates gives the charities.

452
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.620
Do you know much like charity work that guy does,

453
00:25:16.621 --> 00:25:20.070
how much money he donates to causes that he feels are excellent,

454
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.110
millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars.

455
00:25:23.111 --> 00:25:26.820
There's a great benefit from having that.
That guy being wealthy.

456
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.470
Some people who are rich do a good job with it.
Some people,
but you work to,

457
00:25:31.471 --> 00:25:33.600
everybody works like the person telling me that money's a problem.

458
00:25:33.601 --> 00:25:35.910
Like don't you have a job?
What do you get paid at your job?

459
00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:37.650
They give you free coconuts.
What do they do?

460
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.590
They give you a use of a shower and a place to sleep at night.

461
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.170
Now they give you fucking money,
man.
They give you money.
You just,

462
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.040
you're a capitalist.
You're just not as good a capitalist as that guy is.

463
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.920
It doesn't mean that the system is completely fucked.

464
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.350
It doesn't mean that the idea of this system is completely fucked.

465
00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:56.730
It means it can be fucked.
Yeah,
but it also can be.

466
00:25:56.731 --> 00:25:58.440
It's the choice of the people that control it.

467
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.490
If all of the world bankers got together today and did acid and they realize,

468
00:26:02.491 --> 00:26:06.090
oh my God,
guys,
we are fucking up.
We're D,
we're creating all this drunk,

469
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.950
we're going to die anyway.
Listen,

470
00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:12.660
if we just pooled our money together into these massive charities to re
engineer,

471
00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:17.661
says societies and put money into poor communities and stop causing war and stop

472
00:26:18.331 --> 00:26:22.880
extracting natural resources out of these places for massive profit and and

473
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.830
massive loss of human life,
if that just happened,

474
00:26:25.831 --> 00:26:28.620
the entire world would change instantly and they'd literally have the power to

475
00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:31.440
do that.
They would just have to all come to some sort of an agreement.

476
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.050
<v 1>But there's no,
yeah.
And look,
charity is important,
and I'm not a Republican,</v>

477
00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:38.380
but one thing that is statistically true is that Republicans give a lot more to

478
00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:39.610
charity than Democrats do,

479
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.970
which is why Democrats believe that welfare programs that are needed because

480
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.150
fundamentally stingy bastards who don't give anything,

481
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.490
they feel everybody needs to be forced to do it.

482
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.810
<v 0>Is it that they're have less money?
Is it per capita?</v>

483
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.800
Like if you look at the Democrats per capita versus Republicans per capita?

484
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:56.741
<v 1>I don't know about that,</v>

485
00:26:56.741 --> 00:27:01.741
but I do know that the Democrat donations tend to be far larger to the Democrat

486
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.020
Party.
I mean,
Democrats,
uh,
get their money from,
you know,
celebrities from,

487
00:27:05.021 --> 00:27:08.980
they have these,
you know,
$5 billion plate dinners,
whatever for Barack Obama.

488
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.180
And whereas the average donation to the Republican Party is like 20 bucks.

489
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.120
But the real,
the Democrats get their money from unions.
Uh,

490
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.680
and I'd like to talk a little bit about unions and mixed martial arts,

491
00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:22.960
but we'll get back.
Sure.
Okay.
I think that's a really interesting topic.

492
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.060
Fascinating topic.
So yeah,
Democrats get their money from,

493
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:30.550
from forced union dues and from celebrities and from the entertainment business

494
00:27:30.551 --> 00:27:32.870
and so on.
And uh,
they,

495
00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:36.280
they're just generally not very generous with regards to local charity has a lot

496
00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:38.080
to do with their secularism,
right?

497
00:27:38.081 --> 00:27:41.530
Because a lot of the charitable donations come out of religiosity,

498
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.840
but there's no guarantee that charity is the solution.

499
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.260
There's lots of economists who think that Bill Gates would be doing much better,

500
00:27:47.261 --> 00:27:51.850
good for the world if we'd stayed on at Microsoft and built that a company to be

501
00:27:51.851 --> 00:27:54.730
even more successful and bigger with more employees and so on,

502
00:27:54.731 --> 00:27:59.380
that that would be generating more value to society than giving money.
You know,

503
00:27:59.381 --> 00:28:02.680
if you look at India and China,
just over the last 20 years,

504
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.950
it has been the biggest poverty reduction in the history of the known universe.

505
00:28:08.051 --> 00:28:09.730
I mean,
it really can't be overemphasized.

506
00:28:09.731 --> 00:28:12.970
Literally hundreds of millions of people have come out of poverty in India.

507
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.660
It's 50,000 families a month are getting into the middle class out of,

508
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.260
out of poverty because they just got rid of socialist policies and let people

509
00:28:20.261 --> 00:28:22.810
actually trade and make money and start their businesses.

510
00:28:22.811 --> 00:28:25.600
They cut the red tape and all the licensing requirements and so on.

511
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.280
And of course in,
in China,

512
00:28:27.281 --> 00:28:30.700
they were less totalitarian communist assholes and actually became some

513
00:28:30.701 --> 00:28:34.690
reasonable free trade guys.
And out of that process,

514
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.620
more people that come out of poverty in the 20 years that they've stopped

515
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.910
interfering with people's trading abilities than an entire century of western

516
00:28:42.911 --> 00:28:44.830
aid to,
to third world countries.

517
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:48.160
So I don't know whether it's getting out of people's way,
uh,

518
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:51.910
in terms of letting them do what they want to do and build their businesses or

519
00:28:51.911 --> 00:28:54.160
whether it's giving them lots of money.
It's a balance between the two.

520
00:28:54.161 --> 00:28:55.630
But I don't know if charity is always the answer.

521
00:28:55.631 --> 00:28:59.260
I think just getting out of people's way is a great way to let them,
uh,

522
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.550
like what is it in California?

523
00:29:00.551 --> 00:29:03.700
Do you need like 27 permits to open a lemonade stand or something like that?

524
00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:07.750
I mean if you stop doing that kind of stuff or you don't need 300 hours to

525
00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:10.600
become a hair braider on a beach of training to get a license,

526
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.950
just let people do their own thing and let the customer be a decider about

527
00:29:14.951 --> 00:29:17.140
what's valuable,
what's safe,
what's right,
what's wrong.

528
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.770
Then I think you do a lot more for poverty in many ways.

529
00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.100
There are some people who need charity,

530
00:29:21.101 --> 00:29:24.340
but I think most times people just need people out of the way so that they can

531
00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:26.380
go and create their own opportunities.

532
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.350
<v 0>That's true for the most part in a lot of ways,</v>

533
00:29:29.351 --> 00:29:33.520
but I think that it's hard to undermine what Bill Gates has done for people that

534
00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:34.720
can't afford things.

535
00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.580
You know what he's done as far as providing funds for education and a lot of the

536
00:29:39.581 --> 00:29:42.130
charitable work that they've done.
I know if that

537
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.790
<v 1>would all get,</v>

538
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.870
have get gotten done if he stayed on at Microsoft and made it bigger and better

539
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:49.000
and no,
that wasn't it.
But other things would have,

540
00:29:49.001 --> 00:29:50.410
like Microsoft would have grown,

541
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:53.170
would've have added shareholder value to people who then would have donated some

542
00:29:53.171 --> 00:29:55.600
of that to charity.
He wouldn't created more jobs.

543
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:59.380
He also would have opened up more uh,
overseas offices in African,

544
00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.230
so much with a hired people.
And so that would have been more sustaining.

545
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:04.960
And again,
it's not to say there's no place for charity at all,
but the,

546
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.310
the balance between charity and opportunity on how to deal with poverty.

547
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.550
You know,
you had charity all through the dark ages,
all through the Middle Ages.

548
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:15.010
People gave money to the church and the church had a,
you know,

549
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:16.330
indigent houses for the poor.

550
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.420
It didn't solve the problem of poverty and that was solved by,
you know,

551
00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:22.600
free markets and property rights and free trade and all that kind of stuff that

552
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:24.700
solve the problem of poverty through that wealth.

553
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.240
You get a charitable opportunities that weren't there before.

554
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:32.470
But fundamentally I think charity is a nice side dish to opportunity.

555
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.341
It's important,

556
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:35.830
but I think if we think the charity is going to create that wealth,

557
00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:38.590
all it does is transfer.
And usually it's to a onetime use.

558
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:40.000
The nice thing with the entrepreneurial stuff,

559
00:30:40.001 --> 00:30:43.390
it creates self sustaining and self growing economic opportunities.

560
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:45.220
You know the old thing,
give them an official,
you know,

561
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.560
he'll vote for you forever or teach a man to fish and uh,

562
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.550
he'll become a republican.

563
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.640
I don't exactly know how that car stayed teaching people in that sense though,

564
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:52.690
they providing a,

565
00:30:52.691 --> 00:30:56.710
a possibility for education that maybe wouldn't have existed for a lot of poor

566
00:30:56.711 --> 00:31:00.880
people.
So in that sense they are teaching people that education is important,

567
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:04.360
but education when you don't have a lot of economic opportunities.

568
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:08.560
Like if you look at Africa,
Africa is one of the few places in the 20th century,

569
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.390
like over the last 50 years,
it's declined in,
in net standard of living.

570
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.320
I mean it's wretched.

571
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.680
I mean South African and how thick the rape capital of the world,

572
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.190
which you won't see on a lot of brochures.
Yeah.
Oh,
it's just unbelievable.

573
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.910
The crime rates and so on like a,
if you rent a car in South Africa,

574
00:31:24.911 --> 00:31:29.320
they actually have a fire that comes out the side to declare a carriage accurate

575
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:32.200
so you can push a button and have like little jets of flame to come out to push

576
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:33.034
carjackers back.

577
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.570
And the amount of charity that's been applied in Africa is absolutely huge.

578
00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:39.490
But generally it goes government to government,
right?

579
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:43.720
So you give a bunch of money to a bunch of corrupt South African dictators and

580
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:47.110
then you sell them a whole bunch of arms and then you wonder why there's not a

581
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:50.590
lot of freedom for the general population.
I think if you can scale back that,

582
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:53.440
I mean Africans would do fine as well as everyone else if they had the same

583
00:31:53.441 --> 00:31:54.490
economic opportunities,

584
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.220
give people a bunch of education and you still have a very corrupt and fascistic

585
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.070
style of government.

586
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.710
I'm not sure what they can really do with that education other than joined the

587
00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:04.600
civil service,
which seems to happen quite a bit.

588
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:07.750
So I'm a big one for like scale back interference in the market.

589
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:11.380
People will create their own opportunities.
Uh,
you know,
the last say fair,

590
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:13.390
let them alone,
let them trade,

591
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:16.540
let them build their own wealth and all that kind of stuff that really is

592
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.110
inhibited.

593
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:21.490
Charity will help people stuck in the sort of hardening amber of fascist,

594
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:25.120
monstrous governments.
And that's needed for the people who are stuck there.

595
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:27.970
But I think the longterm solution has to be to try and find a way to try it.

596
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:32.000
Like let me give you one other hopefully not too boring example,
which is a,
uh,

597
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.250
subsidies for agriculture,
AH,
ratchet for the third world.

598
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.980
Unbelievably disruptive for the Third World because you know,

599
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.010
you give all these subsidies

600
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.850
<v 4>to farmers and the farmers then grow too much crap.
Uh,
and then what did they do?</v>

601
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:47.270
They dump it in the third world,
which destroys the market for local farmers.

602
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.400
And you give all this food to the government,

603
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:52.040
the government then hands it out to people they like and don't hand it out to

604
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:54.770
people they don't like.
That's reinforcing their power.

605
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.690
And then there's no local farming left cause you,

606
00:32:56.691 --> 00:33:01.030
so just one of these kinds of examples.
If we stop screwing up their economies,

607
00:33:01.031 --> 00:33:05.360
uh,
by selling arms,
by dumping,
uh,
food,
uh,
on their markets and all that.

608
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:08.150
And even the foreign aid happens with that too.
I think they do fine,

609
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:11.810
but it's a lot easier to throw money at a problem than to actually try and deal

610
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:14.210
with these immensely corrupt governments.

611
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:19.540
That's a really unknown but creepy aspect of the United States agriculture

612
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.100
system is this,

613
00:33:22.101 --> 00:33:26.330
this subsidies which causes people to grow food that they're not even gonna use

614
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:30.480
causes people to like to,
to,
to profit from corn and,
and to,

615
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:34.190
to put a lot of effort and emphasis into things that they know that they're

616
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:38.990
going to get subsidies from.
It's a real strange sort of power circle.
It goes on.

617
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.360
What it does to people's health is wretched.
Like,
yeah,

618
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.550
there's this tiny sugar industry in the United States,

619
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.590
very concentrated economic force.

620
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:48.500
They get millions and millions and millions of dollars in subsidies and they

621
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.420
been trying to cut this for years,
but everybody,
you know,

622
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.820
lobby and focus their efforts.
Right?
And so what happened is when the subsidies,

623
00:33:55.821 --> 00:34:00.170
when,
uh,
when the tariffs,
the taxes on imports or sugar went way up in the 70s,

624
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.730
what did people,
it's not doing,
they said,
wow,

625
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:04.220
sugar in America is really expensive.
What are we going to switch to?

626
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.550
High Fructose Corn Syrup.
And yeah,
again,
I'm no nutritionists,

627
00:34:07.551 --> 00:34:10.010
but that seemed to be quite a lot of people out there who think that high

628
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:13.090
fructose corn syrup has a lot to do with,
uh,
the,

629
00:34:13.091 --> 00:34:17.060
the growing weight problem in the United States.
A along with,
of course,

630
00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:20.300
the fact that you've got,
you know,
dairy farmers and wheat farmers and so on,

631
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:24.320
lobbying the government to create these horrible food pyramids where they say,

632
00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:26.960
well,
low fat is really important.
And then what do they do?

633
00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:29.270
Because if you take fat out of stuff and sure,
Grad staff,

634
00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:30.140
it takes like cardboard.

635
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:32.930
They take the fat out of the stuff that's in the grocery store and they put

636
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.650
sugar or high fructose corn syrup in instead.
And then people are like,
wow,

637
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:38.900
I guess this does taste good.
Like I was at breakfast this morning.

638
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:40.970
I picked up a yogurt.
It says low fat,
right,

639
00:34:40.971 --> 00:34:43.910
and what's the second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup.
It's like,

640
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.590
that is not going to be,
I don't give me the fat.
I'll take,
I'll eat a salad,

641
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.270
shove a whole stick of butter up my nose rather than put that stuff into my

642
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.110
systems.
Some fat is actually important.
Yeah,
you need it for your brain.

643
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:57.350
You need it for like lots of good stuff.
Essential fatty acids.

644
00:34:57.351 --> 00:35:00.950
They're very important for your life.
Where are you going to store your LSD?

645
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.910
Exactly.
If you don't have the fat,
then you're in a business meeting.

646
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.610
How attending goal is going to come out of people's eyeballs 20 years from now.

647
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.890
You need to play it.
You need a suitcase for that state.

648
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:12.990
I think that's a fat myth.
I don't know.
We're just,

649
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:16.490
you agree for excuse to get out of work and I saw an octopus.
It's right.

650
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:19.970
I'm having a flashback,
man.
That's why I was so creative the last quarter.

651
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.650
When you start talking about economics and you start talking about giving

652
00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:25.970
businesses more freedom,

653
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:30.350
people get real nervous because people think of businesses as being these

654
00:35:30.351 --> 00:35:34.790
monsters that they get power and then they just start trampling and stealing

655
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:37.200
things.
It's like,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What are you growing over there?

656
00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.034
What are you growing?

657
00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.280
<v 0>I've grown with a robot.
Monster is going to eat the world.
Oh,
come on man,</v>

658
00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:43.930
you gotta jump through government hoops and loops.

659
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.410
<v 1>Seen a futuristic,
scientific,</v>

660
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.710
a science fiction movie with a negative portrayal of a corporation.

661
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.360
Come on the nebulance.
So wonderful.
So then awesome corporation,

662
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.110
maybe big corporations.
Okay.
Oh God.

663
00:35:58.111 --> 00:36:00.150
I'm going to bore your listeners with econ one on one,
but okay.

664
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:04.350
Cooperations are state created.
Horrible semi fascistic stick monstrous.

665
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.880
They do not exist in the free market.

666
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.910
Cooperation has nothing to do with the free market.
You know,

667
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:11.670
we may start a business together and all that in the free market.
It's like,
okay,

668
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:14.310
you started a business,
you don't get this legal shield.

669
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.670
You don't get to take profits out of the corporation when it makes money.

670
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.490
And then if it loses money,
you don't ever have to put anything back.

671
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.340
You don't have this thing where if the corporation or if you do something

672
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:26.850
illegal,
the corporation can,
can get sued or I can get fined and so on.

673
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:31.430
It's a shield that is created to protect the people in charge of the

674
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:35.040
corporations because they give a lot of money to a,
to politicians.

675
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:38.940
Barack Obama's the only reason he's in power as he took huge amounts of money

676
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.450
from the financial sector.
Uh,
more so than anyone else.

677
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:44.370
Cause you don't really see this really talked about.

678
00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:47.180
But this is why the bailout and all of this happened,
uh,

679
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.410
particularly under his watch,
the tarp and all of that stuff,

680
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:52.020
which was started under Bush,
but it's expanded under Obama.

681
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.490
Cooperation's did not exist until quite recently.
And in the past,

682
00:36:56.491 --> 00:36:58.310
if you were the head of a,
uh,

683
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.200
a trading company and you're trading company lost money,

684
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.450
you could lose your house.
You could,
like,
you could,

685
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:05.550
that people could come after your personal assets.

686
00:37:05.551 --> 00:37:08.930
So these guys were really careful about their investments one day.

687
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.980
So they got this legal shield,
you know,
hey,

688
00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:12.300
the corporation makes 1 billion bucks.

689
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.640
I can take that money out of the corporation and now it's mine.

690
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.850
And if I then do something wrong in the corporation,
loses 1 billion bucks,

691
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.270
too bad shareholders and employees pay the price.
I mean,
it's a wretched,

692
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.900
unfair system that has nothing to do with the free market.
Of course,

693
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.440
the government over say the corporations of the problem to deflect,
uh,
you know,

694
00:37:28.441 --> 00:37:29.370
what's really going on,

695
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:33.030
which is the corporate shield and the reasons why they gave this was a,

696
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:35.760
to get the money from the corporate owners and B,

697
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.950
because then they get to tax corporations.

698
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:40.650
And then everyone somehow thinks that there's this thing called the corporation,

699
00:37:40.651 --> 00:37:43.920
like this blimp floating around the universe that you can tax for free.

700
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.520
Like they did this fine recently,
$900 million,
uh,

701
00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:51.540
on some financial entity for Ritz,
wrong wrongdoings or whatever.

702
00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:53.880
When people are like,
yeah,
you know,
they find that cooperation.

703
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:56.700
Like somehow the corporation is paying,
there's no corporation.

704
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.050
What happens is the shareholders end up paying,
the employees don't get raises.

705
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:04.650
The customers end up with service fees.
I mean there was no cooperation to tax.

706
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:08.460
It's only people.
So anyway,
minor rant.
But the corporations,
they're just,

707
00:38:08.461 --> 00:38:09.261
they're part of,

708
00:38:09.261 --> 00:38:13.770
of the state a state capitalism or what's sometimes called crap adultism,

709
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.950
which is just the government and,
and corporations working together.

710
00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:18.150
Technically that's fascism,

711
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.160
but it doesn't have anything to do with the free market.

712
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:22.800
It's just the modern bloated monstrosity that's been created.

713
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.150
<v 0>And it's just people figuring out a way to extract money and manipulating the</v>

714
00:38:26.151 --> 00:38:28.980
system to make it easier for them to extract money.
You Heather,

715
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:32.120
it's extracting money from taxes or whether it's extracting money in the form of

716
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:34.850
political donations,
however,
the finger on a way to do it.

717
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.830
And what gets crazy about it is that there's a bunch of human beings that are a

718
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:42.000
part of this thing that really isn't looking out for human beings.
I mean,

719
00:38:42.001 --> 00:38:44.800
it's some people profit,
you get money from it.

720
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:47.110
But if you look at the ultimate destruction of these things,

721
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:50.080
like very often they're not looking out for people.

722
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.360
<v 1>And outlook.
I say this as a an insider.
I mean I,</v>

723
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:57.970
I started a company with my brother in the 90s.
We grew this company,

724
00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.870
we'd sold it to them.
We went public.

725
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.200
And the process of going public is like having cocaine injected into your dick

726
00:39:05.991 --> 00:39:10.450
being lashed into a barrel full of psychotic monkeys and thrown off a cliff.
Uh,

727
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.180
it's,
it's completely insane.
You,
you go mental,

728
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.180
you focused on the stock price rather than building longterm value.

729
00:39:17.181 --> 00:39:20.660
And you can make a fortune from tiny upticks and down ticks in the stock price

730
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.500
rather than focusing on satisfying your co,
it really draws your attention away.

731
00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:25.280
You know,
it's like you're,

732
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.550
you're chatting with your wife and some incredibly stacked woman in a bikini

733
00:39:28.551 --> 00:39:31.400
goes by and you don't have your sunglasses on to pretend that you're still

734
00:39:31.401 --> 00:39:34.610
staring at her.
Even if you do,
they'll lift your sunglasses.
That's right.

735
00:39:34.611 --> 00:39:38.330
And it's like mad dog docs are like continually having these incredible looking

736
00:39:38.331 --> 00:39:41.180
women go by while you're trying to focus on the love of your life.
And it's like,

737
00:39:41.181 --> 00:39:43.220
you know,
your hormones are going one way and your,
you know,

738
00:39:43.221 --> 00:39:46.250
your heart is going another.
It's completely insane.

739
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.900
It really warps your thinking.

740
00:39:47.901 --> 00:39:51.400
And this is why corporations have given up on r and d have,

741
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.370
can focus entirely on marketing and stock pitches because the amount of money

742
00:39:55.371 --> 00:39:57.020
you can make is insane.

743
00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:02.150
And it's because so many people's money is being forced into the stock market.

744
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.760
I mean,
it's like herding a bunch of sheep off a cliff and saying,
well,

745
00:40:04.761 --> 00:40:07.580
those sheep seem to be kind of suicidal now,
don't they?
It's like,
no,

746
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.250
it's because like you got to your 401k plan.

747
00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:13.160
What happens if you don't put money in your four one k government takes it,

748
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.630
right?
What happens if you don't invest in various institutes?
Like if,
if,

749
00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:18.350
if your money gets taken from a union,

750
00:40:18.351 --> 00:40:21.310
the union has to invest it in your pension plans and all of that.

751
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.080
Unions have a huge amount of say in what happens in the stock market.

752
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.320
Who wants to be in the stock market?
I don't want to be in the stock market.

753
00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:29.990
Maybe you do because you were,
you thrilled junkie and all that.

754
00:40:29.991 --> 00:40:34.340
But I don't want to be,
I don't want to be in the stock market.
I really,
really,

755
00:40:34.341 --> 00:40:36.470
the stock market is for people who know what they're doing.

756
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.120
I don't want to be in the stock market.

757
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.100
Nobody I know wants to be in the stock market,

758
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.650
but we all have to be in the stock market because it's like,

759
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.430
it's like that old joke where in Scotland,
right?
Scotland,

760
00:40:46.431 --> 00:40:48.860
Scottish people are supposed to be cheap.
That's a stereotype when I grew up.

761
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:53.170
And so,
you know,
an English men and a Scotsman and walking down and uh,
you know,

762
00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:55.880
a,
a,
a thief comes up and says,
I'm going to rob you of everything.

763
00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:58.040
You've got this to tie some intensive English guy and says,
Hey,

764
00:40:58.041 --> 00:41:00.140
he is that 20 quid that I oh yeah.
You know,

765
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.060
cause it's like you're going to lose the money so you give it,
you know,

766
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:03.860
give it to the,

767
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.980
so the government's going to take your money by force or you give it to a bunch

768
00:41:06.981 --> 00:41:11.000
of parasitical three I'd wrote faced stockbrokers.
Right.
It's,
it's like,
okay,

769
00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:13.520
give it to the stockbrokers.
You know,
if the guy's gonna steal my money,

770
00:41:13.521 --> 00:41:16.580
I'll put it on red 22 and that's how the stock market works.

771
00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:18.590
So there's way too much money in the stock market.

772
00:41:18.591 --> 00:41:21.590
There should be like 1% of the money that's in the stock market that's there
now.

773
00:41:21.591 --> 00:41:25.610
So you've got these massive tsunamis of cash rolling back and forth.

774
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.910
You gave me a good coffee here.
I just want to mention that caveman coffee,

775
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.480
how to my friend tape.
So I'm going to do three more rants and then faceplant

776
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.550
<v 3>April,
you're going to hang in there because that's got MCT oil and butter.</v>

777
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.260
So it's going to,
you're going to hang in there.

778
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:40.300
It's going to have a lot more than that.

779
00:41:40.301 --> 00:41:43.390
You going to have a really strange shit in the morning.
Maybe that'll help me.

780
00:41:43.391 --> 00:41:45.840
Something nice and s shaped.
It's going to be like the subtitle.

781
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.340
It's going to be the subtitles to some Japanese movie that's going to be in the

782
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:49.620
day.

783
00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.230
It's going to be like if you stuck mud in a musket and then just pull that pin

784
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:57.710
back and boom.
Where'd it go?
All right,
well,
so yeah,
I mean just,

785
00:41:57.711 --> 00:42:00.430
just way too much money of the stock market and corporations are,
are,

786
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.460
are taking moral and financial and legal responsibility away from it.

787
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:07.850
So executive,
so this is just natural.
You know,
you,
you know,
you,
you,

788
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:10.980
you drug a ballerina,
you get a weird show,
but it's not the ballerina.

789
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.840
It's just what happens,
right?
That's a very fun expression.
You drug a ballerina,

790
00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:18.200
you get a weird show.
That should be,

791
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:23.590
there should be a photo of you like this Internet meme and it just says you drug

792
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:27.290
a ballerina.
You get a weird show,
Stefan.
Molyneux that's so true.

793
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:28.270
It's a great way of putting it.

794
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.830
And I think what a lot of what you're bitching about and we're,
we're,

795
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:34.280
we're both bitching about is,
um,
it comes down to a couple of things.

796
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:39.281
It comes down to a human beings being born into a system that's already fucked

797
00:42:40.221 --> 00:42:45.050
up and comes down to managing your own thinking as well.
Figure out how to a way,

798
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:49.160
you as an individual who has allegedly,
and it's another debate,

799
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.700
has free will.
That's a huge debate.
The freewill debate,

800
00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:56.450
which is very esoteric and strange.
I don't know.
I can't,
I'm not qualified.

801
00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.650
I would,
I would like to have you and Sam Harris discuss the,
the freewill debate.

802
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:05.150
I agree and disagree with,
with both sides.
So I don't know,
uh,

803
00:43:05.151 --> 00:43:07.580
I don't know what's correct and what's not when it comes to,
I would do that,

804
00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:12.110
but only if you would call it like a,
um,
mixed martial arts fight.

805
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:16.820
That would be the LGBT thing.
And if the chilkat there'll be very distracting.

806
00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:18.651
I thought,
you know,

807
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:22.040
this debate would go way better if we had a choke out option because at the end

808
00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:22.251
of it,

809
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:25.400
you can just press a button and both of you get down to your shorts and just

810
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:28.250
start duking it out.
Yeah.
That's great.
Yeah.

811
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.170
That's just the threat of that is what keeps people gentlemen,
Lee actually,

812
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:35.720
you know,
when,
when people know that there will be no physical violence,

813
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.620
they can get very squirrely.
You know,
people can get very mouthy.
Again,

814
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.270
I don't want to keep harping on rich kids,

815
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:45.200
but have you ever been around like a really spoiled rich kid that likes to yell

816
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:48.470
at people that are working,
yell at security or yell?

817
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:52.550
I have a friend who does security and a,
there's a,
a famous person I won't name,

818
00:43:52.551 --> 00:43:57.350
but her name rhymes with Paris Hilton and she was out and she got shitty with my

819
00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:02.290
friend who is essentially,
he's a killer.
He's a,
I mean he's,

820
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:04.370
he's not working security cause he's a cutie pie.

821
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.000
He's working security cause he understands how to keep people secure so he knows

822
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:11.210
how to deal with threats.
He knows how to deal with violence.
Okay.

823
00:44:11.211 --> 00:44:15.860
And you guys disassembling people and some person is just shitting on them.

824
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:19.600
That's remarkably similar to Paris.
Hilton might not have been Paris,
Hilton,

825
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.680
whatever,
whatever.
But I mean why would she get away with that?
Why would anybody,

826
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.090
why would anybody think they can get away with,

827
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.610
it's because they know the threat of violence doesn't exist.

828
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.160
And you know as well Joe,
that there's a huge tendency that

829
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.880
<v 1>people have to mistake accidents of birth for personal virtues.
Yes.</v>

830
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.800
They're all saying like you think that you hit a triple but you were born on

831
00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:43.350
third base.
So people who are rich,
they think,
well I'm,

832
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.760
I'm better than above the born rich.
You didn't earn that.

833
00:44:45.761 --> 00:44:46.980
And like this guy in my high school,

834
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.100
his father I think was running the Toronto Stock Exchange or whatever.

835
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:50.990
And you know,
I was Linda,

836
00:44:50.991 --> 00:44:54.240
this little tiny apartment with my mom and my brother and you know,

837
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:55.460
it's like the matriarchal manners.

838
00:44:55.470 --> 00:45:00.470
It was all like that to do the fallout from like the 60s and seventies feminist

839
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:01.201
revolution.

840
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:04.370
Divorce rate was through the roof and it was all the single Manville like the,

841
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.470
the girlfriend farm for the fatigue industry.

842
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.630
And we went over to this guy's place to rehearse and play.
We were working on it.

843
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.780
It was just,
it went on forever.
And you know,
these are the kids,
16,
you know,

844
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:16.910
they get their a,

845
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.250
they get their sports car and that they show up in school and everyone is like

846
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.040
oohing and aahing and these guys are printing and I get it.
There are 16,

847
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:23.641
what did they know?
Right?

848
00:45:23.641 --> 00:45:26.970
What did I know when I was 16 but that's just an accident.
You know,

849
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:29.490
he just happened to be born there,
you know,
like it wasn't like you,

850
00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:33.390
you laser targeted from the stalk army and decided to go to that house rather

851
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:37.540
than some other places,
you know,
like you're not a guided missile of wise,

852
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.880
a pre prenatal aiming.
And so I,
we all have that,
you know,

853
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.970
and it's true people who are born pretty or people who are born rich or you
know,

854
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:49.620
people guys,
sometimes we'll just born tall or flags or,
or you know,

855
00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:53.550
like I was told when I was a kid,
uh,
if effort,
manageability,
you'd be an a plus,

856
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:56.910
you know,
like I just wasn't trying hard enough.
It wasn't the school's fault.

857
00:45:56.911 --> 00:45:57.960
It wasn't my family's fault.

858
00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:00.270
It wasn't a chaotic or crazy situation where it's growing up.

859
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:03.240
And we weren't poor.
We did,
I didn't have to have three jobs.

860
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.870
I just needed to work a little harder like the other kids did who had good homes

861
00:46:06.871 --> 00:46:08.820
and all that.
It's natural and,

862
00:46:08.821 --> 00:46:13.821
and we have a very tough time really getting how much our environment has to do

863
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:18.930
with who we become.
Absolutely.
Because that gives you a lot of humility.
Like,

864
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.260
okay,
I was born with a fairly good brain and you know,

865
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:25.050
fairly good language center.
I try to use that for as much good as I can.

866
00:46:25.051 --> 00:46:28.350
But with all the humility of knowing that,
you know,
I mean if,

867
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.780
if I'd been hit the wrong way with a ball when I was a kid,

868
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:34.200
I'd be a whole different person.
Uh,
if I'd been born,
as you said,
you know,

869
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:37.950
different race,
a different country,
different culture.
I mean,
you know,

870
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:41.490
not a lot of female playwrights in Iran,
you know,
because it's just bad luck.

871
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:43.680
Sorry.
You know,
you really drew the short Straw.

872
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:48.960
We have a very tough time and I think that basic humanity that we have is,

873
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:53.220
is diminishing and it's catastrophic and it's diminishing largely because of

874
00:46:53.221 --> 00:46:55.310
single moms because wow.
The,

875
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:59.450
the statistic is that by far the best predictor waving this pennant.

876
00:46:59.451 --> 00:47:01.560
You like trying to talk about empathy.
Let me just do my thing.

877
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.060
The best predictor of for the growth of empathy and a human being is the close

878
00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:09.270
presence of a father.
Uh,
and this is something that's kind of a no,

879
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:12.060
cause we all think that moms are about the um,
uh,

880
00:47:12.061 --> 00:47:15.810
the nurturing and the emotional development someone.
But statistically,
you know,

881
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:16.380
uh,

882
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.760
an outside unstructured play plus the presence of a dad is the biggest thing of

883
00:47:20.761 --> 00:47:23.970
developing empathy.
You take father's out of the equation and society,

884
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.060
this is rice.
Sociopathy has doubled over the last 15 years.

885
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.010
This is basically why we have a welfare is the destruction of

886
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.380
<v 4>the family.
There's not a welfare state.
It's a single mother state.</v>

887
00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.840
It's all making up for not having a provider.
Well,

888
00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:38.260
the problem with phrasing it like that though is you say that the issue is

889
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:38.951
single mothers,

890
00:47:38.951 --> 00:47:42.160
but the issue is really that the father isn't around whether or not it was the

891
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:43.540
mother's fault of the father's fault,

892
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:45.940
whoever's fault it was at that relationship didn't work out.

893
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:49.630
Whether it's mutual or one person has the majority of the blame,

894
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.800
it's that the family's broken up.
It's not that the single mom,

895
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:55.680
it's just that family's broken.
Maybe it's like,

896
00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.250
so I think we're about the same age.
Is that right?
46.
I'm 47 so,

897
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:05.170
uh,
we got a younger person in the room.
Yeah,
Jamie's 21 Jamie.

898
00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.520
I didn't know some Italian kids who had that kind of growth phase where the

899
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.100
weird ones.
Yeah.
The ones who have to shave the back of their knuckles.

900
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.840
Like after they turned 10.
That's my Rachel,
Here's your,

901
00:48:14.841 --> 00:48:18.280
and here's your finger shaver.
Now that you're 10.
Yeah.
Okay.

902
00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:22.210
So in your general,
how old are you?
31.
I just turned yesterday.
Okay,

903
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:26.330
so have your birthday,
sweetie.
You're really happy birthday.
Um,

904
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.950
who asks who out?
It's a women ask men out.
Is it mutual man ask.

905
00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:34.951
This is a completely broad ended question and it depends entirely on the game of

906
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:40.060
set individuals.
I know,
but generally,
I mean in general,
generally guys,

907
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.790
that's the girls ask Ben out.
They don't have to.
Okay.
But okay,

908
00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:46.750
so,
so,
so,

909
00:48:46.751 --> 00:48:50.920
so then we can't say that single moms is equally shared because the single mom,

910
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.630
like men proposed women dispose,
right?

911
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:55.180
I mean men say I want to update you or have sex with you.

912
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:58.580
It sounds like something Al Sharpton would say.
It does rhyme.
Yeah.

913
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:03.300
I'm afraid I don't have that to Atlanta.
We propose women dispose.
Yeah.

914
00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.880
You mean by that?
Well,
so men say,
I want to date you are on at Saks with you.

915
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:09.390
I want to go out with you.
And the women say yes or no.
Well,

916
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.240
men are generally more aggressive and women are generally more desirable.

917
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.160
So that makes us have to go after them.

918
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.780
May possibly figure that out.
Right.

919
00:49:18.781 --> 00:49:21.790
I mean of course women are more desirable to us,
but you know,
two lesbians,

920
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.930
no wait,
that doesn't maybe show more than even to them.
They just,

921
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:29.260
they just whatever reason,
can't figure out what women see in us at all.

922
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.351
Like I just,
I,

923
00:49:30.351 --> 00:49:33.520
I fundamentally like intellectually maybe I think that that men have a lot of

924
00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:37.480
value in relationships,
but you know,
we are 40 were smelly.
Uh,

925
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:41.020
we sit at odd angles,
we don't cross her legs.
So we,
you know,

926
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:42.630
we rarely use Napkins and I,
I,

927
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:48.150
I cannot understand why we need like 10 times more pillows then people on the

928
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:50.800
bed I like during the day when it's,
anyway,

929
00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:52.820
these are things that confusing to me,
but,
but,

930
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.230
but fundamentally women say yes or no to,
to relationships.

931
00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:00.280
So they do get to choose who the man is a lot more than the man gets to choose

932
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:04.630
who the woman is.
Oh,
I don't know about that.
I don't agree with that.

933
00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:09.010
I think that ultimately it boils down to once you finally meet each other,

934
00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.380
do you like each other?
And if the woman likes a man,

935
00:50:11.381 --> 00:50:13.900
as much as the man likes a woman,
it works out.
And if they don't,

936
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:18.250
then it becomes this weird balance of power,
this weird shifting sort of a thing.

937
00:50:18.251 --> 00:50:21.820
But I think there's a lot of men that don't want in a relationship and they end

938
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:25.540
it or you know,
they pursue and they ended.
I think it's probably,

939
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.070
I don't want to be a 50,
50,
I don't want to give

940
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.910
<v 0>you a statistic,</v>

941
00:50:28.911 --> 00:50:32.360
but I would say there's a good number of men who ate and relationships and a

942
00:50:32.361 --> 00:50:35.150
good number of women who are in relationships to put all the power and the

943
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:39.140
women's side is,
I think not all of course say we disagree on stuff.
We found one,

944
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.470
but we have facts to,
to mediate.
So statistically,
uh,
it's,

945
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.700
it depends on how you measure it,

946
00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:47.900
but that 70 to 80% of marriages are ended by women.
Is that true?

947
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:51.710
Or is it the men are so fucking Douchey that the women have no choice,

948
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.280
that the men have given up a long time ago and they just don't want to fucking

949
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:57.860
bother going to the court.
So just to shut the fuck up,

950
00:50:57.861 --> 00:51:00.740
I'm going to go out and they shut the door and then the woman calls the lawyer

951
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:04.280
and while the woman ended that relationship,
did she or was it mutual?

952
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.010
Just one person decided to make the call to the lawyer.

953
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:10.070
But did they guy already give up to the point where he was just treating her

954
00:51:10.071 --> 00:51:11.720
like shit,
hoping she would leave?

955
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.650
It's like the old Sam Kinison joke about marriage.
He goes,
you know,
he goes,

956
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.800
he goes,
uh,
I don't like to bring up women.

957
00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:22.610
So what I do is I just stay up all night,
do kg for four or five days.

958
00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:27.611
I come home drunk and smelling like pussy until you get to a point where she

959
00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:31.160
leaves you right,
she leaves you cause you're falling apart.
And he goes,
hey,

960
00:51:31.161 --> 00:51:33.930
here's the best part.
She feels like shit.
She left.

961
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.600
I was at my lowest ebb honey.
And then you just,
it could have been there for me.

962
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:46.370
We keep it a successful team together.
Pitches on both sides.

963
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.750
I agree with that,
but I don't see any behavior.
I don't think that we give,

964
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.980
I don't think we give women enough responsibility in this area.

965
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.400
I think that men generally wanting to protect women.
I think that men generally,

966
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:00.710
oh,
that's crazy.
And I don't agree with that at all.

967
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:01.860
You don't think men want to call them?

968
00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.890
They want to protect the ones that they love.

969
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:07.010
But the reason why so many women get sexually assaulted isn't because so many

970
00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:09.650
men want to protect them.
Men want to fuck,
you know,

971
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:11.870
and they want to then when they get a girl that they like to fuck,

972
00:52:11.871 --> 00:52:14.720
they want to hold onto and make sure nobody else hurts her.
You know?

973
00:52:14.721 --> 00:52:18.740
I mean that's the ape shit,
you know,
that's the worst aspects of people.

974
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:23.780
But the idea that men want to generally protect women sure is less than they

975
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:25.880
want to generally protect themselves though,
you know,

976
00:52:25.881 --> 00:52:29.930
and I think less than less than really would be ideal.

977
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:32.300
If you look at the balance of power between men and women,

978
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.300
the real issue is the physical strength.

979
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:38.790
The real issue is that men can physically do things to women.
Like where,

980
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.750
where does rape come from?
Where does the violence against women comes from?

981
00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:42.770
It comes from people that are,

982
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:47.060
that are capable of committing violence against women and rape.
You know,

983
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.880
like a woman like Rhonda Rousey,
UFC champion,

984
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.060
it doesn't have to worry about some hundred pound due to smoke cigarettes.

985
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:55.180
You know what I'm saying?
She literally doesn't have to,

986
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.410
she'd be in the room with him and you know,
he'd be like,
Bitch,

987
00:52:57.411 --> 00:53:00.530
I'm gonna rape you.
Oh really?
Well,
boom.
Drop him on his head.

988
00:53:00.531 --> 00:53:03.860
And He'd be unconscious.
I mean,
she'd break his arm off.
That's,

989
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.340
that's a physical situation that women have to deal with that men don't.

990
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:12.320
And I think for sure we could do a way better job of addressing that.

991
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.670
And I think,
you know,
like this one,
the Steubenville rape case,
you know,

992
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:19.040
this case in Ohio,
you know,
this case remind bunches,

993
00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:21.970
football players got to get her high school football players got some underage

994
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.400
girl drunk,
raped her,
and then the guys went to jail and they just got out.
Um,

995
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.850
why is that?
Why is it so horrible?
Well,
here's what's so horrible about it.

996
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.980
It was a girl.
It was men that did it to a girl.

997
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.170
If it was a bunch of women who raped a guy,

998
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.120
they got him drunk and sucked his dick for an hour and a half,

999
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:38.340
everyone would be laughing about it.
Okay.

1000
00:53:38.341 --> 00:53:42.450
It's a sexual act that happens to a woman who can't control himself,

1001
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.150
and then you find out that it's a football player group,

1002
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.860
a group of giant athletes,

1003
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.340
a group of superstrong men who obviously could have physically dominated her as

1004
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:54.130
well.
It becomes a horrific act if you simply reverse the sexist,

1005
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:55.080
it becomes a comedy.

1006
00:53:55.350 --> 00:54:00.180
If it's some nerd who gets too drunk in a sorority and they all fuck him for

1007
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:03.150
three or four hours and take pictures of his penis.
It's a comedy.

1008
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.640
But because it's a woman,
it's a tragedy.

1009
00:54:05.641 --> 00:54:08.280
And the reason why it's a tragedies because men are physically stronger.

1010
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:09.360
It's really that simple.

1011
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:13.860
So the idea that I think that men want to physically protect women,
man,

1012
00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:16.680
there's a lot of evidence that they don't.
You know,
I think it's a giant,

1013
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:20.490
broad generalization.
I think the nicest men certainly do.

1014
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:21.870
I think I would certainly,

1015
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:24.150
if I was seeing a woman that was being physically assaulted or something,

1016
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:26.100
I would absolutely risk my health to help her.

1017
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.260
I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't,

1018
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:29.610
especially if I cared about her.
Right.

1019
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:32.950
<v 1>Some people get on your training too,
right?
I mean,
you,
you know how to do this.</v>

1020
00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:33.800
<v 0>Yeah.
Well that's,</v>

1021
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.800
that's also part of it is I know that I have some preparation in that area,

1022
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.120
which is a very terrifying thing for people who don't,
you know,

1023
00:54:41.121 --> 00:54:44.540
I've seen people involved in physical altercations who don't know how to defend

1024
00:54:44.541 --> 00:54:47.780
themselves.
And it becomes like you're facing a werewolf.

1025
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:50.120
It becomes like the most horrific thing in the world.

1026
00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:51.410
Cause you're going to get slaughtered and you know,

1027
00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:54.020
you're going to get slaughtered and people hyperventilate.

1028
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:55.880
They don't know how to deal with the stress.
That's,

1029
00:54:55.881 --> 00:54:59.120
I think you're doing yourself a disservice as a human being if you don't know

1030
00:54:59.121 --> 00:55:00.890
how to defend yourself a little bit.
And you're a man.

1031
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:05.770
<v 1>Yeah.
Uh,
okay.
So a lot of points,
maybe,</v>

1032
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:09.710
perhaps two minutes,
you know,
uh,
who gets raped for more men or women in America?

1033
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.480
<v 0>Men Do.
But here's the problem.
That statistic,
they're getting raped by men.</v>

1034
00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.930
So even though men get raped more,
they're getting raped by men.

1035
00:55:16.931 --> 00:55:19.420
So men are still the fucking problem.
Men are just raping.

1036
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:22.210
They're raping men and they're raping women.
Yeah,
they raped men more.

1037
00:55:22.211 --> 00:55:24.820
But that's just because we keep them pinned up with men.

1038
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:28.810
If we had no prisons and everyone ran free and we just fucking slaughtered

1039
00:55:28.811 --> 00:55:32.260
people that,
that we are absolutely sure don't contribute to society,

1040
00:55:32.261 --> 00:55:34.900
whether they're murderers or rapists,
we just slaughtered them.

1041
00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.510
We would have the rape stuff would pretty much die off.

1042
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:42.430
It's keeping men together,
locked in a box and making them fuck each other.
Yeah.

1043
00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:47.740
Yeah.
But it's a man doing the real problem with that.
You know,
that's the,

1044
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.520
the MRA argument against feminism is that men actually get rate more than women,

1045
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.610
but by men.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's still a shitty argument.

1046
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:57.320
<v 1>Well,
it's not,
I think it's not an argument against feminism.</v>

1047
00:55:57.321 --> 00:56:01.190
I think what it is is not something that people generally know and like for

1048
00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:05.210
instance,
like pretty common knowledge.
Most of you know,
I was surprised.
Again,

1049
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.860
certainly no gauge of everyone.
Also,
as you probably know,
like 96 97,

1050
00:56:09.861 --> 00:56:14.690
98% of workplace deaths are male and all that kind of stuff.
Right?
Or so I think,

1051
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:18.680
or the fact that 50% of domestic violence,
um,

1052
00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.700
recipients a are men,
right?
And men being battered and they're actually,

1053
00:56:22.701 --> 00:56:23.980
you get that

1054
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.700
<v 0>no men's battered shelters you actually can't get,
you can't get security.</v>

1055
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:30.490
You can't get this American son.
We don't defend pussies.

1056
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:33.600
Chicks are kicking your ass.
I say that not just a,

1057
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:37.600
one of my favorite people ever was murdered by his wife,
Phil Hartman.
Oh yeah.

1058
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:41.490
Fellow.
A Toronto native,
brilliant,
brilliant comedian.
And a,

1059
00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:43.240
I knew both of them very well.

1060
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:48.100
I knew him and I knew her and it was a horrific scene and very,

1061
00:56:48.101 --> 00:56:52.330
very tragic.
And if you,
you know,
if you know someone like that,

1062
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:55.510
you know that it is possible for a woman to do it to a man just like it's

1063
00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:58.480
possible for a man to do it with a woman.
There's weapons,
ladies and gentlemen,

1064
00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:02.230
there's knives and there's guns and ever sleep sometimes.
And by the way,

1065
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:05.680
you know that that's there.
There's good and bad in that.

1066
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:08.890
The good in that is that you can defend yourself against a man.
If someone is,

1067
00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.770
if you're a woman and you're physically weak,
but you have a gun,
you can say,

1068
00:57:11.771 --> 00:57:14.260
get the fuck out of my house and the guy has to run away because you have a gun.

1069
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:17.310
There's good in that.
But there's also,
you know,
people,
you know,

1070
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.400
people do horrible things.

1071
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.160
They get angry at each other and it happens with both sexes,

1072
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:25.300
with men and with women.
It's,
there's,
there's no need to generalize.
It's,

1073
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.740
it's all just shitty people.

1074
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.540
It's all just shitty people and shitty circumstances and a gigantic past of

1075
00:57:31.541 --> 00:57:36.110
momentum,
of terrible decision making.
It's led you to this really unstable state,

1076
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:37.990
current state that you find yourself in.

1077
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:41.860
And then you add drugs and you add antidepressants.
You know,

1078
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:45.190
I mean I believe you and I discussed this the last time we talked,

1079
00:57:45.191 --> 00:57:49.780
but the amount of fucking school shooters that are on antidepressants like

1080
00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:51.820
causation does not real.
You know,

1081
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:54.940
people want to pretend there's not like a relation between those two.

1082
00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:56.520
The FDA disagree.

1083
00:57:56.550 --> 00:58:00.010
The FDA has black wanting the strongest warning labels on this stuff.

1084
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:05.290
Causes suicidal ideation,
causes homicidal rage courses.
I mean on some people.

1085
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:07.330
Yeah,
some people,
that's what we have to realize.

1086
00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.980
It's like it's not a black and white thing.

1087
00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:11.920
It's some people die from fucking peanuts.
Okay.

1088
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:16.270
Some people can't pet a dog or they go into a hyper ventilating shock.

1089
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.240
I mean some people literally around dogs,
their,

1090
00:58:18.241 --> 00:58:20.740
their throat will constrict and they can't breathe.

1091
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:24.100
Massively allergic to Dander cat,
same thing.

1092
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.380
People are all people are different.

1093
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:31.410
A lot of people are allergic to weird shit and but a lot of people also could

1094
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:33.830
benefit from being healthier.
We,

1095
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:35.710
this is one of the things we discussed before the podcast started.

1096
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:40.750
How many people that take an antidepressant could have fixed their problem just

1097
00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:43.570
with a little exercise and diet change with a little,

1098
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:46.990
just getting around better people,
having a better relationship,

1099
00:58:46.991 --> 00:58:49.210
being a friendlier person,

1100
00:58:49.211 --> 00:58:53.950
trying to exercise the stress out of your life,
both mentally and physically.

1101
00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.860
And then let's see what kind of emotional and psychological state you're in

1102
00:58:56.861 --> 00:58:57.960
because the idea that this,

1103
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:02.470
we need a holistic approach to the human organism and that holistic approach

1104
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:07.500
should really have a big impact in what kind of medication we subscribe to

1105
00:59:08.351 --> 00:59:10.390
people.
I think it should have a massive impact.

1106
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:14.740
And if you find someone and the person is eating fucking donuts all day and you

1107
00:59:14.741 --> 00:59:16.000
know they sleep four hours a night,

1108
00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:19.750
the constantly drinking red bulls and the depressed,
Huh,
okay,

1109
00:59:19.751 --> 00:59:22.430
we've got to fix this first.
Do they're a smart person,

1110
00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:25.940
<v 1>underachieving in some dead end job and they don't have people around them</v>

1111
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:28.040
saying,
listen man,
you've got more to offer the world.

1112
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:31.070
Let's just find a way to get you out of the hamster wheel and get Johnson some

1113
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:31.820
flat track.

1114
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.610
<v 0>The dead end job,
dead end lives,
dead end relationships.</v>

1115
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:38.240
Almost just as bad as some physical amma ailment.

1116
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:41.120
You mean the literally do suck the fucking life out of you?

1117
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:43.820
We've all experienced it to some degree if we've,

1118
00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:48.140
if we're lucky because it makes us appreciate the good times when you do a

1119
00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:50.960
experience,
something along those lines,
but I think that man,

1120
00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:54.590
you got to really deal with that first before anything else and there's too many

1121
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:58.040
people in this world that want a pill.
They just want to fix things.

1122
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:59.900
And I've said this before,

1123
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:01.910
but I'd have to say it again just in the interest of clarity.

1124
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.380
This is coming from a person who I know several people who have benefited

1125
01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:09.950
tremendously from antidepressants is not a black and white thing.

1126
01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:11.690
It's not either or.

1127
01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.410
There is a lot of variables when it comes to antidepressants,

1128
01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.360
when it comes to medication,
when it comes to mental health,

1129
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:20.450
there's a lot of variables and we've done some amazing things to help a lot of

1130
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.550
people that have really had real issues,

1131
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.490
but we've got to figure out who the fuck actually has issues and who doesn't.

1132
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:30.680
And what the statistic that you brought up before the podcast was over 41 out of

1133
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:32.420
four women on antidepressants.

1134
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.040
<v 1>Yeah.
In America I think.
Yes,</v>

1135
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.620
the 35 or 40 and over one out of four women on antidepressants and those that

1136
01:00:37.621 --> 01:00:41.220
just the people who've gone and gotten diagnosed.
Right.
Lots of other,
yeah.

1137
01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.810
I mean there is,

1138
01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.110
there's a lot of good things that are happening I think in the world with

1139
01:00:46.111 --> 01:00:49.140
regards to human relationships.
I think that we are getting smarter.

1140
01:00:49.141 --> 01:00:51.960
I think we are getting more positive.
I think that we are getting,

1141
01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.600
dare I use the hackneyed Victorian term,

1142
01:00:54.601 --> 01:00:57.120
more virtuous bedroom in our relationships.
You know,

1143
01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:59.760
there's an awareness of of beating and emotional abuse and all.

1144
01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:02.810
I think that the standards are kind of raising right.
You know,

1145
01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.980
Dr Phil is like the number one daytime show and he talks a lot about,
you know,

1146
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.330
how to be reasonably decent human beings in relationships,

1147
01:01:09.331 --> 01:01:11.160
which is sad that he has to keep saying that,
you know,

1148
01:01:11.161 --> 01:01:13.810
like stop screaming at each other and stuff,
hitting each other stuff,

1149
01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:17.910
doing trunk stuff,
you know,
the jail Doctor Phil to figure out your fucking life.

1150
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:22.260
You're you're way behind the ball.
There's a lot of other shit you need to cover.

1151
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.100
Right.
But so I think a lot of that stuff has been going really well,

1152
01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:29.550
but I think there's a lot of stuff that is not,
not going so well.
So.
Well,

1153
01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.520
I mean a lot of,
you know,
just basic things.

1154
01:01:32.521 --> 01:01:34.480
You were talking the other day about breastfeeding,
I remember you,

1155
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:37.760
you were looking up on the uh,
look,
looking up on the website.
No,

1156
01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:40.230
I just take the first website and that's,
that's how it works.
That's true.

1157
01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:41.550
That's true.
That's the way it works.

1158
01:01:41.551 --> 01:01:44.260
That's how you do anything that disagrees with us.
I mean,

1159
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:47.100
it's just overkill to go to the second one.
That makes so much work.

1160
01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:50.700
Wouldn't it be first if it wasn't right,
that's,
that's the key thing.
But so yeah,

1161
01:01:50.701 --> 01:01:51.511
I mean like 30%.

1162
01:01:51.511 --> 01:01:54.900
She was saying 30% of women still are only breastfeeding for the minimum minimum

1163
01:01:54.901 --> 01:01:59.220
amount of time,
six minutes,
six months.
Um,
I was,
uh,
this guy,

1164
01:01:59.221 --> 01:02:02.280
Steven pinker I think would be,
if you can get him on,
he's a really smart guy,

1165
01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:05.010
great to talk to 'em but uh,
he's a,
he's a,

1166
01:02:05.011 --> 01:02:09.410
I think he's a neurobiologist neuroscientist.
He's um,
uh,
and,

1167
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:10.310
and he basically was,

1168
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.380
there's a lot of studies out there that say that they are sort of personality

1169
01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:18.381
traits go like 50% genetic and maybe they can get zero to 10% is the parents and

1170
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:22.590
the rest of it is kind of cultural and so on.
Right.
And you know,

1171
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:24.900
I'm not going to argue with the science,
I'm not a scientist,

1172
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:29.901
but I will say that I think that parents don't have really that much involvement

1173
01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:35.520
in kids' lives from a guidance standpoint that much anymore.

1174
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:37.200
I read this statistic the other day that said,

1175
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.730
the average dad has like 20 minutes of conversation with his children every
week.

1176
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.890
Whoa.
Average.
Right.
And so,
and,
and that,
and that just,

1177
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:48.810
that's of the people who are present.
That doesn't count.
The dads were absent.

1178
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:52.380
And someone,
because you know,
the typical,
you know,
two family working,
I mean,

1179
01:02:52.381 --> 01:02:53.940
what's their day like?
I mean,
I've seen it,

1180
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.090
I've seen it up close and this is one of the reasons I kept wanting to have kids

1181
01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:59.970
because I saw what happened.
You know,
you get up at six o'clock in the morning,

1182
01:02:59.971 --> 01:03:02.490
you've got to get your kids up breakfast,
get them out of the school bus,

1183
01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:05.780
you go to your work all day,
you're sweating bullets to get pick 'em up,
uh,

1184
01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:09.210
the day after school daycare or wherever they are,
get them home,
feed them,

1185
01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:10.920
do homework,
you're bathe them,
you know,

1186
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.930
get them to bed and then you start the whole thing again.

1187
01:03:12.931 --> 01:03:16.570
It's all just her management.
It's all just keep them going through the,
the,

1188
01:03:16.571 --> 01:03:20.940
the maze and all that.
And I think that,
um,
like I've been a stay at home dad,

1189
01:03:20.941 --> 01:03:24.630
my daughter is five now and there's a lot of little guidance things that

1190
01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:27.180
happened during the week about how to modify,
you know,

1191
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:30.300
where they're going to help to help them understand sharing or empathy or

1192
01:03:30.301 --> 01:03:31.490
understanding how to do when,

1193
01:03:31.491 --> 01:03:34.110
when negotiations rather than just focus on what they want,

1194
01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:35.490
which is natural for little kids,

1195
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.030
but it's all these tiny little corrections that are scattered throughout the

1196
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.130
week.
You can,
you don't know when they're going to be a,

1197
01:03:41.131 --> 01:03:42.720
but you have to kind of be around for them.

1198
01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:47.721
And I think that we don't really have much opportunity for Martin parents to

1199
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.890
really stay involved.

1200
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:53.730
Like we kind of designed as a species to be around our parents.
You know,

1201
01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:55.710
they were there when the fields,
the dads would take them,

1202
01:03:55.711 --> 01:03:58.740
you went hunting recently,
dads would take them out hunting and stuff like that.

1203
01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.530
And that's when you have your conversations and you teach the kids the values

1204
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:06.420
and all that kind of stuff.
It's really been supplanted by government,
by daycare,

1205
01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:09.120
government schools and all of that.
That's who we kind of binding,

1206
01:04:09.121 --> 01:04:11.840
but that's who we're kind of letting raise our kids.
And,

1207
01:04:11.841 --> 01:04:15.900
and I can understand why there's very little influence of parents over

1208
01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:17.520
children's behavior.
I don't think that's natural.

1209
01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:21.990
I think that's just the way society has been structured or rather the society

1210
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:25.290
we've kind of inherited.
And I really would like to see,
um,

1211
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:28.020
I said this on my show all the time to people who call in.
It's like,
wow,

1212
01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:31.440
we're going to have kids,
but I got to work.
It's like you don't,
you know,
I mean,

1213
01:04:31.441 --> 01:04:34.170
you went into debt to go to school.
I mean,
this is important.

1214
01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:35.880
Just at least for the first couple of years,
you know,

1215
01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:39.900
my daughter's and her brain is like 90% done now.
There are five.
Yeah,
I mean,

1216
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.800
it's unfortunately going to be crazy.

1217
01:04:42.801 --> 01:04:45.180
So now you're really stuck on that train train,
right?
We

1218
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:48.410
<v 0>were,
we were at a hotel this weekend and uh,</v>

1219
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:52.620
we went skiing and the three year old,
uh,
zipped up her,
uh,
her luggage,

1220
01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:57.210
but she forgot something.
And so my wife says,
honey,
you're not going to fit that.

1221
01:04:57.211 --> 01:05:00.450
You have to put your boots in there and she goes,
ah,
Shit.

1222
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.750
And there's something about seeing a three year old go ah shit.

1223
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.710
And you only realize,
Ooh,
okay,
that is the human condition.
First of all,

1224
01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:12.960
that's obviously me.
Okay.

1225
01:05:12.961 --> 01:05:17.961
I need to either stop saying that or embrace the idea of a three year old

1226
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.450
<v 4>saying it.
It's one of those,</v>

1227
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.910
cause I don't think there's anything wrong with saying,
oh shit.

1228
01:05:21.911 --> 01:05:22.390
When you leave say,

1229
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:25.720
but if you do it in certain circumstances and school and work,

1230
01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:26.501
it's going to be a problem.

1231
01:05:26.501 --> 01:05:30.570
So I have to figure out what my daughter Loves Bible stories.
Really.
I'm,

1232
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.490
I'm an atheist.
You say once upon a time before you tell them.
Oh,

1233
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:36.700
I know she knows that stories.
Okay.
Yeah,
we call him the big invisible guy.

1234
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:41.250
Do you go old school,
Old Testament or do you go,
we'd do the whole thing.
Oh,

1235
01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.150
I've told her the story yet.
You know,

1236
01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:46.240
I'm the guy who's going to kill his son because the big invisible guy,

1237
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:49.240
I say making them in an ice cream.
Like bake him in a pie with whipped cream.

1238
01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:51.910
Because,
you know,
it's,
that's how you say,
I don't have a knife to the throat.

1239
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:54.970
I mean,
she's,
she was four,
but she loves the big visible Guy Stories.

1240
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.260
She loves the NOAA wine.

1241
01:05:56.261 --> 01:05:59.200
She loves to Adam and Eve one with the snake and the apple.
It's all,
I mean,

1242
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.690
these stories that they've,
they've stood the test of time.

1243
01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.380
There's really some of the best stories around who was going to kill his,

1244
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:08.590
his son was Cain enabled know Cain and Abel where the son of Adam and eve,

1245
01:06:08.591 --> 01:06:11.950
they were brothers and they killed each other.
Right.
I said,
Isaac and Abraham,

1246
01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:16.540
I think,
I know Isaac.
And I go,
okay,
did we have a web?
Abraham?

1247
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:20.080
Abraham has a son,
right?
Yeah.
So I think God,

1248
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:23.990
who's asking him to kill us on forum.
Yeah.
It's a lab test.
Yeah.

1249
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:27.880
Just because you know,
that's how,
you know,
if someone really loves you,
like,

1250
01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:31.090
you know,
this is why,
you know,
you give this,
um,
you give this to your,

1251
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:34.030
to your wife,
you know,
like,
I would,
I would murder our offspring for you.

1252
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:37.270
And that's the hallmark card that really helps your wife understand how much you

1253
01:06:37.271 --> 01:06:40.230
love her.
I'm just an ex boyfriend murdering our ex boyfriend.

1254
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:43.120
I would find that way.
Your next boyfriend,
the beat you up.
I'll murder him.

1255
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:47.890
And so,
but,
and I'm trying to tell the stories in a neutral way,
right?
Like it's,

1256
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:50.410
I again,
I had my,
my opinions on all these stories and all that,

1257
01:06:50.411 --> 01:06:55.360
but she really likes the stories and she's a huge fan of Lucifer.
Whoa.
I mean,

1258
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.690
Lucifer is the guy,
he is like her superhero,
you know,

1259
01:06:58.691 --> 01:07:00.610
like he is her mighty morphin power rangers.

1260
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:03.920
She thinks he is just the coolest cause he's always standing up to big invisible

1261
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:07.660
guy.
Right.
And,
um,
because she,
for her prayer is,
you know,

1262
01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:10.360
everyone's standing around and say,
Oh,
you have the best.
Oh,
you're the best.
Oh,

1263
01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:13.060
you're the greatest.
I love you so much.
Oh,
you're the best.
You know.
And so,

1264
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:13.601
you know,

1265
01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:16.930
Lucifer gets kind of tired of that and leads the rebellion and all that.
Cause,

1266
01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:18.880
you know,
I said,
you know,
just keep saying it.
And she said,

1267
01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:20.220
I'm getting tired of it.
It's like,
well,
no,
no,
no,

1268
01:07:20.221 --> 01:07:22.990
it keep saying it because it's an eternity of saying that to the gate.
Right?

1269
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.810
And she's like,
Oh man,
I'm really tired.
I want to sit down.
It's like,
now,

1270
01:07:25.811 --> 01:07:29.650
you know how Lucifer,
none of it anyways,
so she's got this great,

1271
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:34.550
she's just great song,
which goes basically,
Lucifer was right,

1272
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:38.650
Lucifer was right.
You know,
wow.
The songs and I'm just waiting.
Cause you know,

1273
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:41.320
in Canada there's some homeschooling,
which is kind of what our schooling,

1274
01:07:41.321 --> 01:07:43.390
what we were doing,
but a lot of them are,
are Christians,
right?

1275
01:07:43.391 --> 01:07:46.480
So we're going to at some point be around a bunch of Christian kids and she's

1276
01:07:46.481 --> 01:07:50.540
going to break into this song.
And I just,
I'm looking forward to that moment of,

1277
01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:53.800
I've tried to explain that,
uh,
maybe she's referring to a Beatles song.

1278
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:55.930
I don't know.
I'll,
I completely bail on her at that point.

1279
01:07:55.931 --> 01:07:56.890
I don't know where she gets this.
Well,

1280
01:07:56.891 --> 01:07:59.770
the real issue is you're going to have to mingle with those Christian parents.

1281
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:03.250
The real issue when you have children,
uh,
besides raising the children,

1282
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:04.570
which is of course the primary one,

1283
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:08.950
teaching them and everything is dealing with these other parents and seeing
it's,

1284
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.700
it's really weird when I see people with their kids,
you know,

1285
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:16.310
see how little they interact with their kids.
See How like

1286
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.500
<v 0>not appreciative they are of their kids.
How they're always distracted or</v>

1287
01:08:21.570 --> 01:08:23.980
<v 1>oh,
it's a ring of cell phones around the playground.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

1288
01:08:23.981 --> 01:08:26.960
like throw your cell phone,
go play,
go into

1289
01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:29.880
<v 0>stupid Mcdonald's tubes and go play with your kids.</v>

1290
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:32.880
I know a woman who's a psychologist and she picks up her kid and she's on her

1291
01:08:32.881 --> 01:08:35.330
phone while she's picking the kid and the kid trying to talk to her about going,

1292
01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:40.020
she's like,
uh Huh.
Uh Huh.
Uh Huh.
And she's texting.
It's,
you know,

1293
01:08:40.021 --> 01:08:43.080
I mean you just,
the kid was gone for five hours and when you picking them up,

1294
01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:48.030
you're texting.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
so,
it's so attractive to us though.
So easy to do.

1295
01:08:48.031 --> 01:08:51.240
It's so easy to ignore.
We get so used to,
you know,

1296
01:08:51.241 --> 01:08:54.090
the kid being around and we get so used to our own free time.

1297
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:57.160
<v 1>Got It.
That it's hard to drive it and she's great cause you know,</v>

1298
01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:00.430
I'm trying to teach your eye contact,
right.
Because you know,
when she's a kid,

1299
01:09:00.431 --> 01:09:02.380
you know,
I don't know if they can't focus when they look at you,

1300
01:09:02.381 --> 01:09:05.890
but that tells stories like they're just watching the biggest disco light show

1301
01:09:05.891 --> 01:09:08.620
on the planet and you're just like some leaf or something.
Right.

1302
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.590
And so I tried to remind her,
you know,
eye contact when we're talking,

1303
01:09:11.591 --> 01:09:15.970
that kind of stuff.
Right?
So the other day of course,
and I,
you know,
I try,
Oh gel,

1304
01:09:15.971 --> 01:09:18.700
I try,
you know,
and I,
you know,
but every now and then like I get donations,

1305
01:09:18.701 --> 01:09:22.150
my whole show is just donations,
right.
No ads or anything.
And so,
you know,

1306
01:09:22.151 --> 01:09:24.400
when a donation comes in,
it's like,
Ooh,
kibble.
You know,
like I'm,

1307
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.910
I'm like the rat with the pellet,
you know,
that's on kibble,
what it again,

1308
01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.400
and I've got this silicon chip noise that comes in cause I'm for,
anyway.
So,

1309
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.310
you know,
I,
the kitchen noise come in.

1310
01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.050
My daughter was telling me something really important for her and all that.
And,

1311
01:09:35.051 --> 01:09:38.930
and yeah,
she's great.
She's like 40 she's like,
Daddy,
I contact.

1312
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:43.450
You're absolutely right.
I'm so sorry.
How rude that was of me.
I have.

1313
01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:47.520
<v 0>That's hilarious.
Yeah,
it's fascinating to watch their little brains develop,</v>

1314
01:09:47.521 --> 01:09:47.831
isn't it?

1315
01:09:47.831 --> 01:09:51.180
And then watch the way they interact with each other and how they see the world

1316
01:09:51.181 --> 01:09:53.760
and realize that this is how a person is shaped.

1317
01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.540
And this is the number one problem that we have as a race is that we don't

1318
01:09:57.541 --> 01:10:01.590
respect this process and that we also don't respect this process in strangers,

1319
01:10:01.591 --> 01:10:05.130
especially people that we know are fucked.
People in bad neighborhoods,

1320
01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:08.280
people in bad circumstances,
people in a abusive families.

1321
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.190
We know they're fucked and we don't,
we don't do anything to stop it.

1322
01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.300
One thing that I keep harping on is that if we have a resource,

1323
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:20.010
whether it's a oil or gold being,
we protect that resource and,

1324
01:10:20.011 --> 01:10:23.820
and you know we,
we set up laws and we attach a value to it,

1325
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.700
but our number one resource for sure is human beings.

1326
01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:30.930
We have created all that you see,
whether it's laptops or buildings or cars,

1327
01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:32.520
that's all from a human being.

1328
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:37.440
The best way to ensure that that continues to go on is to have less losers in

1329
01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:41.970
the world.
The best way to have less losers is help out kids,
educate kids,

1330
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.560
get on the ball with them very early and do something as a society to protect

1331
01:10:46.561 --> 01:10:49.520
them primary before we go into wars,

1332
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:54.330
before we go into all this stupid shit that we do to spying on people's fucking

1333
01:10:54.331 --> 01:10:57.780
emails and looking into their cell phone record.
Before you do any of that,

1334
01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:59.520
how about you protect kids first?

1335
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:02.580
That should be of primary importance and it should be like one of those things

1336
01:11:02.581 --> 01:11:04.430
where your kid,
you know,
wants to go out and play.

1337
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:06.570
Like do have you done your homework?
You haven't done your homework,

1338
01:11:06.571 --> 01:11:08.220
you can't play.
It's that fucking simple.

1339
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:13.040
You can't have your wars unless you fix the kids.
Okay.
And they're there.

1340
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.913
So

1341
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.240
<v 1>smart.
And I,
you know,
I was the human,
I've had a whole bunch of experts,</v>

1342
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:22.720
a on my show,
a which is,
you talk about the native intelligence of,

1343
01:11:22.721 --> 01:11:23.490
of kids.

1344
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.870
Like kids can start doing mathematical reasoning at seven or eight months of
age.

1345
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.730
They can start,
do using empathy at 14 months.
And my daughter at the age of four,

1346
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.240
we started playing a game called subjective versus objective.
You know,

1347
01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:37.860
like is this something subjective?

1348
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:41.100
Like I like ice cream or is this something objective like ice cream is made from

1349
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:44.220
milk and you know,
we'd pointed staff and say subject or objective,
you know,

1350
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.670
I like jazz,
it's subjective or objective.
And she's like,
Bang,
rattling them off.

1351
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.640
The other day she was saying to me,
Oh dad,
you know,
we've talked a lot.

1352
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:52.950
She's always asking me about the show.
In fact,

1353
01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:56.770
I should have been taking notes because she's asked me all about you,
uh,

1354
01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.060
what's going to be the topic?
And I said,
you know what,
I have no idea.

1355
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.070
I know it's gonna be interesting to chat with Joe,

1356
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:05.700
no idea what we're going to talk about and was best.
Yeah,
yeah.

1357
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:06.900
She's asked all about,
you know,

1358
01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:09.160
where you're from and what you do and she's awesome.

1359
01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:13.290
Native by mixed martial arts and all that kind of stuff.
And uh,
um,

1360
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:16.500
and so she's gonna ask me all the time and I do some shows on economics and so

1361
01:12:16.501 --> 01:12:19.140
we talked a little bit about that,
you know,
fee money and all that.

1362
01:12:19.141 --> 01:12:21.960
And I diagram stuff out for her and she gets it really,

1363
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:24.240
we've gone through the whole history of the Second World War the other day.

1364
01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:27.510
She says,
you know,
my Daddy,
I think I've decided what I want to do.

1365
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.470
I think when I get bigger,
I think I just like to work.

1366
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.000
I think I want to be the government.

1367
01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:36.240
I'd love to be the government because I just,

1368
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:40.410
I want to type whatever I wanted to my bank account.
And I was just like,
wow,

1369
01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.950
you just nailed the Federal Reserve right there in a night.

1370
01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.050
Whatever I want into my bank account.
Vango via your old logic,
but perfect.

1371
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.860
It is what it is.
They can print their own money.
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

1372
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:57.450
Great system.
Yeah.
No.
When I come out of the sort of libertarian world,
right,

1373
01:12:57.451 --> 01:12:59.430
so I mean I'm an anarchist,

1374
01:12:59.431 --> 01:13:03.030
but I come out of the libertarian world and Libertarians very much as we talked

1375
01:13:03.031 --> 01:13:05.760
about La nonaggression principle and so on,
and I've been fighting this,

1376
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:09.270
this battle in the libertarian world and in other worlds as well around,

1377
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:13.260
you know,
things is to me is basic a spanking,
right?
I wasn't sure,

1378
01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:14.130
I mean we touched on this,

1379
01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.720
just throw a few stats for the audience who hasn't seen it before.

1380
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.970
More than 90% of parents of toddlers stayed.
They spank their child.
Toddlers,

1381
01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.310
60 61% of moms,
three to five year olds have spank their child.
In the past week,

1382
01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.450
boys spanked a lot more than girls.
Boys are also diagnosed with Adhd,

1383
01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:36.810
which is one of the symptoms of spanking a lot more than girls spanking.

1384
01:13:36.811 --> 01:13:41.160
Can continue into the adolescent years,
30 to 40% of people in junior high,

1385
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:43.380
kids in junior high.
I still being spanked.

1386
01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:45.380
Moms do spank children a lot more than fathers do.

1387
01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.990
Even controlling for time spent with kids and all of that kind of stuff.
Uh,

1388
01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:52.980
economic status doesn't have a huge amount to do with spanking,
but cultural dat.

1389
01:13:52.981 --> 01:13:56.820
So African Americans,
uh,
do a,
do a lot more corporate punishment.
Uh,

1390
01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.770
religious conservative,
fundamentalist,

1391
01:13:58.771 --> 01:14:02.410
do a lot more corporal punishment and so on.
And this to me is,

1392
01:14:02.411 --> 01:14:03.770
it's such a fundamental thing.
I'm,

1393
01:14:03.771 --> 01:14:07.410
I'm very much for philosophy that you can do philosophy that you can act on

1394
01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:09.690
values that you can do is,
I don't like the Federal Reserve.

1395
01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:12.850
I think central banking is a monstrous cancer in the eyeball of society,

1396
01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:16.150
but I can't really do much about it other than rant and rave about it.

1397
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.900
But we can't,
what we can do is,
you know,
do some basics,
like stop hitting kids.

1398
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:21.610
You know,
that to me is a very fundamental thing.

1399
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:25.000
And in the libertarian community,
that's a challenge.
Lard,
a lot of um,

1400
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:27.610
a religious conservatives in the libertarian community as you know,

1401
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:30.040
like on the underwriter,
wrong republicans.

1402
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:31.720
There tend to be more religious people on the left,

1403
01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:34.450
a secularist less religious people but more socialists and so on.

1404
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:38.530
And it is really tough,
you know,
to just get that basic thing across.

1405
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:42.770
We tell kids not to hit each other and we hit kids and we've all,
I dunno if you,

1406
01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:45.670
you,
they,
you see bad parenting sometimes when you're out and you act,

1407
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:46.511
you actually,

1408
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:49.420
and I'll usually say something to the parents because I don't want my,
my,

1409
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:50.650
I think it's the right thing to do.

1410
01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:54.070
I don't want my daughter to see me be all about the ethics and then not talk to

1411
01:14:54.071 --> 01:14:54.851
people doing something wrong.

1412
01:14:54.851 --> 01:14:58.060
But you can see parents hit kids saying don't hit your sister.

1413
01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.050
And that the fact that they can do that without their heads exploding from this

1414
01:15:02.051 --> 01:15:06.640
wormhole contradiction of Pretzel logic is just astounding.
But it is something,

1415
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:10.540
we still have a long way to go in.
I think we're kind of slowly getting there,

1416
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:12.960
but we have a long way to go in just let's not hit kids.
Yeah.

1417
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:16.750
I think how much of the world would change if we didn't do that?

1418
01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.600
I think we would be virtually unrecognizable as a culture.

1419
01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:23.600
<v 0>I couldn't agree more.
You know,
I read this article recently on my message board.</v>

1420
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:26.570
Uh,
I don't have it in front of me,
so I apologize to whoever posted it,

1421
01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:31.850
but it was about a man who got stuck in the financial system of divorce and it

1422
01:15:31.851 --> 01:15:34.640
was from his perspective,
he committed suicide,
lit himself on fire.

1423
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:39.910
I started reading his perspective and they came to his house and he had his

1424
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:44.300
initial issue because he slapped his daughter in the mouse so hard that her

1425
01:15:44.301 --> 01:15:48.110
mouth was bleeding and he did it because she was licking his hands.

1426
01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.340
She kept licking his hands.

1427
01:15:49.341 --> 01:15:52.420
So he slapped her in the mouth til her mouth has been.
And then everything I,

1428
01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:56.460
I stopped reading right there.
I'm like,
I don't want to know this guy.
I don't,
I,

1429
01:15:56.461 --> 01:15:59.660
I'm sad that he was so fucked up that he committed suicide.

1430
01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:04.090
But if I saw a guy slap his daughter in the face because she was,
you know,

1431
01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.610
was licking his hand,
I would have to really suppress my urge to strangle him.

1432
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.100
Yeah.
I mean,
that's violence.

1433
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:13.850
That's violence to someone who cannot defend themselves and can't leave.

1434
01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.460
Not only that,
to be there,
not only that,
it's,

1435
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:21.490
it's fundamentally the most fucked up kind of violence because you're doing it

1436
01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:25.430
to a developing human being who you allegedly love.

1437
01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.490
You're teaching them to violence is a part of life by the people that they

1438
01:16:28.491 --> 01:16:33.290
respect the most and that it can be done to you at any time when you don't agree

1439
01:16:33.291 --> 01:16:35.510
with whatever fucking guidelines and rules they've set up,

1440
01:16:35.511 --> 01:16:37.520
like licking your hand.
And my daughter was licking my hand.

1441
01:16:37.521 --> 01:16:40.280
I'd be laughing my ass off.
I would think.
It's so funny I do that.

1442
01:16:40.281 --> 01:16:44.150
I'd smack her in the mouth.
It's just fucking insane.
But people,

1443
01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:46.600
they fall into this pattern and they don't,
don't,

1444
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:49.040
don't realize that violence is violence.

1445
01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:51.160
Just because you're not going to hurt the kid that bad.

1446
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:53.870
You're just going to spank them and you think it's no big deal.
Fuck.
Yeah,

1447
01:16:53.871 --> 01:16:56.810
it's a big deal because that kid,
it's a horrific situation.

1448
01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.390
You're doing something in,
they can't control.
You're holding their arm,

1449
01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.290
they're moving their body and then this big hand comes in slaps their ass and

1450
01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.800
they feel pain and they feel confused cause you've acted out against them.

1451
01:17:06.801 --> 01:17:08.360
You've not only acted out against them,

1452
01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:12.650
you've done it yelling at slapping and it's a terrible,

1453
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:17.750
it's terrible precedent to set a terrible idea to plant in a child's mind.

1454
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:19.040
And it's unnecessary.

1455
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:22.850
It's just not necessary for you to tell me that you can't sit down and reason

1456
01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:25.640
with your child and,
and do it with love.
And the,
yeah,

1457
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.270
they're going to freak out and fucking flail sometimes get mad and yell.

1458
01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:32.720
And that's because they're a fucking child.
You piece of shit.

1459
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.400
You don't smack them.
You know,
you just
hitting your friends.

1460
01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:39.830
It's like hitting your for don't be,
don't hit anybody man.

1461
01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.030
<v 1>Well and,
and in particular,
you know,</v>

1462
01:17:42.031 --> 01:17:46.260
the moral concentration of like black hearted nastiness,
you know,

1463
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.900
you hit your wife,
she,
she got to date you.
She got to,
you know,

1464
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:53.760
you had an engagement.
She,
you know,
she,
she chose you and you chose her.

1465
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:57.430
But if you hit your wife,
she at least had to,
did you get to test drive you?
She,

1466
01:17:57.431 --> 01:18:01.130
you know,
and then she can leave at anytime.
She's an adult,
she's got shelters,

1467
01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.530
she's got whatever.
People will help her,
hopefully.
But kids,

1468
01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:06.660
they didn't choose you as parents,
you know,

1469
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:10.800
and they can't leave and they have no options.
And I say this to my daughter,

1470
01:18:10.801 --> 01:18:14.640
you know,
I say,
um,
I say,
I know you're not here by choice.
You know,

1471
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:16.800
you didn't choose me as a dad.
I choose to have kids.

1472
01:18:16.801 --> 01:18:21.060
And you didn't choose me as a dad.
The way I have to parent is I want to parent.

1473
01:18:21.061 --> 01:18:24.180
Like if my daughter didn't have a choice of any doubt in the world that she

1474
01:18:24.181 --> 01:18:29.050
would choose me like,
and so I imagine these all day long.
Absolutely.
And,

1475
01:18:29.051 --> 01:18:32.450
and,
and,
and,
and what about feedback?
You know,

1476
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:35.550
I go to my local pizza joint half the time I have to fill out,

1477
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:38.910
they give me this comment card to fill out,
you know,
how did you like the pizza?

1478
01:18:38.911 --> 01:18:40.970
You know what's good for you?
Was it bad for you?
You know,

1479
01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:44.790
they wanna know they wanna have a good pizza and how many times the parents do

1480
01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:46.620
that with their kids say,
how am I doing?
You know,

1481
01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:48.510
how's your experience of my parenting?
You know,

1482
01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:52.410
what's more important slice of pizza or your relationship with your offspring.

1483
01:18:52.411 --> 01:18:55.140
You know,
ask them how you're doing.
How could they have been better?

1484
01:18:55.141 --> 01:18:57.780
What did I do that that you liked?
What did I do that you didn't like?

1485
01:18:57.781 --> 01:18:59.580
And all that.
Get that kind of feedback.
I don't know.

1486
01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:02.940
It's just weird that we don't even think of doing that.

1487
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:03.121
<v 0>Well,</v>

1488
01:19:03.121 --> 01:19:06.510
I think your perspective is very unique in the fact that you are a stay at home

1489
01:19:06.511 --> 01:19:10.190
dad and you do have the resources to be able to do that.
It's,
it's,

1490
01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:11.730
it's really hard for a lot of people.

1491
01:19:11.731 --> 01:19:14.220
And that's while you were talking about before,
that number's pretty crazy.

1492
01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.510
The 20 minutes a week.
I didn't know that it was that low,
but honestly,

1493
01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:22.440
not shocked.
I don't have a regular life,
but I've dabbled in regular life.

1494
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:22.970
You know,

1495
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:27.870
I've had like jobs that take me away for a long period of time during the day.

1496
01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:31.650
And I could only imagine what kind of energy you have to devote to a kid.

1497
01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:36.090
If the mother,
both the mother and the father both leave the house all day long,

1498
01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:38.580
work an eight hour day,
and then come home.
How much is left?

1499
01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:41.290
There's not even much time.
The is going to be awake.
Yeah.

1500
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:42.660
How much energy do you have left?

1501
01:19:42.661 --> 01:19:44.880
How much focus or you're putting on that kid during the day?

1502
01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.810
<v 1>And,
and we have this again,
a couple more stats.
Um,</v>

1503
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:52.940
we have this idea that the moms have to be there and the dads can be there.

1504
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.590
But a study conducted by Dr. Kyle Pruitt found that infants between seven and 30

1505
01:19:57.591 --> 01:20:00.290
months respond more favorably to being picked up by their fathers.

1506
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.010
He also found a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical,

1507
01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:04.491
cognitive,

1508
01:20:04.491 --> 01:20:08.520
and emotional and behavioral development and tend to reassure toddlers when they

1509
01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:11.820
become frustrated while fathers encouraged them to manage their frustration.

1510
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.720
And my daughter's like this.
So she's learning to do all these things and,

1511
01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.350
and most of her friends are older cause you know,

1512
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:17.910
we're nothing like youngest parents on the block.

1513
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.940
And so a lot of her friends can do stuff better than she can.

1514
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.850
She gets frustrated and me helping her talk you through that frustration and

1515
01:20:23.851 --> 01:20:26.850
reminding her that I didn't know how to do this stuff and you know,

1516
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:29.820
she's trying to do racket sports and I remember took me years to become good at

1517
01:20:29.821 --> 01:20:34.590
racket sports.
So,
uh,
so that's important for,
for kids as well.
I mean,

1518
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.560
it's really important to remember,
you know,
the mom and the kid,

1519
01:20:37.561 --> 01:20:41.400
they used to be the same freaking person.
You know,
like she grew her,

1520
01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:44.490
they were like,
it's like my arm,
you know,
it's not like a separate thing.

1521
01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:46.830
Whereas they had to have a little bit more objectivity around that.

1522
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.370
A longer term study that this guy did to prove that the father's active

1523
01:20:50.371 --> 01:20:53.310
involvement with his kids from birth to adolescence promotes greater emotional

1524
01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:56.790
balance,
stronger curiosity,
a stronger sense of self assurance,

1525
01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.940
additional studies during the first five years of a child's life.

1526
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:03.390
The father's role is more influential than the mothers in how the child learns

1527
01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:07.230
to manage his or her body,
navigate social,
social,
social circumstances in play.

1528
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.731
And the last one is,

1529
01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:12.900
this is in 1996 study that I was referring to before by McGill university at the

1530
01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:16.380
single most important childhood factor in developing empathy is paternal

1531
01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:17.730
involvement in childcare.

1532
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:20.790
The study further concluded that children who spend time alone binding with

1533
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:22.140
their children more than twice per week,

1534
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:26.760
brought up the most compassionate adults.
Um,
so how do they measure that?

1535
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.920
How's that quantifiable?
Um,

1536
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:31.610
<v 0>it seems like a weird,
all those statistics seem very odd.</v>

1537
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:35.240
It's like how do you know what caused a person to have more empathy?

1538
01:21:35.241 --> 01:21:38.990
How do you know what caused a person to be able to move better?
And I mean,

1539
01:21:38.991 --> 01:21:39.824
how do you,
how do you work?

1540
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:43.070
<v 1>Well what they prove that again it's sort of a many to many relationships.</v>

1541
01:21:43.071 --> 01:21:46.190
So they ask the father is you know,
how often were you involved?

1542
01:21:46.191 --> 01:21:49.130
And maybe they even measured them if it's sort of a live study and then they

1543
01:21:49.131 --> 01:21:52.100
measured the compassion and then they measure a whole bunch of other things.

1544
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:54.560
And if the other things don't change the compassion measure,

1545
01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:56.900
but then the parental involvement is what moves the needle,

1546
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:58.910
then they assume that that's close to causal.

1547
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.590
<v 0>But isn't the issue also the parental involvement?</v>

1548
01:22:01.591 --> 01:22:04.080
Like say if a father is involved a lot in the kid's life,

1549
01:22:04.081 --> 01:22:08.310
he's also probably likely involved in the relationship with the wife and maybe

1550
01:22:08.311 --> 01:22:10.170
their wife bid would be more happy.

1551
01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.800
The father and the wife would be more happy and because of that they would both

1552
01:22:13.801 --> 01:22:15.800
be better parents.
So it could,

1553
01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.590
it might not just be that the impact of having a man around does all these

1554
01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:20.730
things and creates an empathy.

1555
01:22:20.731 --> 01:22:23.550
It might be the impact of having a successful family as well.

1556
01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:27.190
<v 1>Right.
Right now.
And that certainly is true.
And again,
I didn't run the studies.</v>

1557
01:22:27.191 --> 01:22:29.080
I assume that they've tried,
like whenever you questioned,

1558
01:22:29.081 --> 01:22:31.600
that's all we tried to tease it out this way or that way and they,

1559
01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:34.090
they to try to find that answer.
Um,

1560
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.890
but I do think that compassion
again,

1561
01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.600
you know,
I mean your marriage,
you've got,

1562
01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:43.550
you've got kids floating around and all that and I'm floating,
but

1563
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:48.520
they were floating at one point and then they came out through the magic
chamber.

1564
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.590
Uh,
but,
uh,
I think,
you know,

1565
01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.520
I mean my wife's skills as a parent are fantastic and,
um,
but,

1566
01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:56.560
but there are some differences between us,
you know,

1567
01:22:56.561 --> 01:22:59.020
and I don't know whether it's biological or whether it's just the way we were

1568
01:22:59.021 --> 01:23:03.220
raised or whatever,
but,
uh,
you know,
I encourage more risk taking a,
I'm,

1569
01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.790
I encourage,
you know,
if you fall off,
horse get back up and again,
kind of stuff.

1570
01:23:06.791 --> 01:23:10.150
And I think that's just on a kind of a natural kind of difference.
And,
um,

1571
01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:14.410
I'm also more encouraging of,
you know,
my daughter is like crazy friendly.

1572
01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:17.710
I keep thinking she's going to go up to someone,
sometimes an unfriendly world,

1573
01:23:17.711 --> 01:23:19.330
like a cheese up to a greater,
you know,

1574
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:20.770
and just kind gets shredded cause you know,

1575
01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:23.020
we go places and she just goes up to kids and says hi,

1576
01:23:23.021 --> 01:23:25.630
would you like to be friends?
And that's cool.
Fantastic.

1577
01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.990
The people up a little,
you know,
oh I love it.

1578
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:32.120
<v 0>Everybody was on ecstasy.
That's how we would interact with each other.</v>

1579
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:34.940
And that was one of the things that we got it a little bit off topic,

1580
01:23:34.941 --> 01:23:37.280
but one of the things that I wanted to complete this,

1581
01:23:37.281 --> 01:23:41.200
this thought on when you were talking about antidepressants and um,

1582
01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.670
we were talking about the good and the bad of them.

1583
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:49.270
I think right now one of the issues that we have with this idea of manipulating

1584
01:23:49.701 --> 01:23:52.550
human neurochemistry is that it's not really done.
There's,

1585
01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:56.960
it's not a complete art form yet.
It's not something like dying your hair.

1586
01:23:57.410 --> 01:24:00.200
If your hair is gray and you want to have black hair or you simply go to the

1587
01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:02.930
market and you buy some hair color and you put it in your hair and now your

1588
01:24:02.931 --> 01:24:05.300
hair's black,
it really is that fucking easy.
I mean,

1589
01:24:05.301 --> 01:24:08.540
they've got it down to a science.
You can see guys that are fucking 80 years old,

1590
01:24:08.541 --> 01:24:11.900
they have jet black hair and it looks ridiculous.
The Reagan.
Yeah,

1591
01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.590
but I think we,
we do have the potential,

1592
01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:19.550
just like we have mastered virtually every other aspect of our world that we

1593
01:24:19.551 --> 01:24:22.780
live in,
whether it's high speed communication or the ability to,
you know,

1594
01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.070
combustion engines with him ion batteries.

1595
01:24:25.071 --> 01:24:27.980
One day they're going to figure out how to engineer consciousness and you have

1596
01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:28.580
this,

1597
01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:33.020
you have this opportunity to take a pill or get a shot or whatever and you have

1598
01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.430
ultimate clarity and you fucking think much better and you're a better person.

1599
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:41.450
I keep swinging my hands for the air and knocking shit on my keyboard.

1600
01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.820
I am literally retarded when it comes to that.

1601
01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.690
I'm looking for something to hand you,
right?
I got some paper towels here.

1602
01:24:47.691 --> 01:24:50.090
It didn't,
didn't really get on anything and just get a little bit on my screen,

1603
01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.440
but I think that one day they're going to have the ability to do what we would

1604
01:24:54.441 --> 01:24:55.700
like them to be able to do,

1605
01:24:55.970 --> 01:25:00.970
to figure out how to engineer human consciousness ideally to make in a pill form

1606
01:25:01.611 --> 01:25:06.320
or in,
you know,
I mean in a shot or in some sort of genetic manipulation.

1607
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:08.990
I think that is that possible and is that bad?

1608
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:11.600
Is that going to take away from being a human being?
If we're,

1609
01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.820
I think that would be a great tragedy.
Why is that?

1610
01:25:13.821 --> 01:25:16.430
If we made it awesome in pill form,

1611
01:25:16.431 --> 01:25:20.990
life would be fucking literally everything we'd been searching for.
No struggle.

1612
01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.530
Just talking to that.

1613
01:25:22.531 --> 01:25:25.720
That's like everyone being born with $1 billion is just talking about no

1614
01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:29.210
resistant is it sounds that we know that to a large degree,
I think.

1615
01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:31.790
I think that we know that to a large degree with our current state of

1616
01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:32.380
consciousness.

1617
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:36.200
But what I'm saying is if we engineered it past this ape monkey paradigm that we

1618
01:25:36.201 --> 01:25:39.050
live in right now,
and boom,
with one shot,

1619
01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:43.130
they give you this Buddha thing,
it's called the Buddhists.
Would you take it?

1620
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.430
I don't.
I might probably you would.
I don't know if everybody else was taking it.

1621
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:51.980
You're a natural father.
I'm a father.
I think I would,
uh,
consider it.

1622
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:55.140
I would want to know what the,
would you want your kids to take it?
Um,

1623
01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.600
I would want to know what the results were.

1624
01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:00.680
Look if the entire world took it and then we would engineer consciousness past

1625
01:26:00.681 --> 01:26:04.160
this stage where we are now and completely restructure society that have no

1626
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.760
<v 3>evil,
no problems.
We think that we have to have a Yang to have a yen.</v>

1627
01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:11.090
And in our current state we do.
But is that the ultimate end all?

1628
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:12.650
Are we not continually evolving?

1629
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:17.720
Is this life that we live now not much easier and safer than it was living in a

1630
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:20.390
time of gangs con?
Well,
it certainly is.
Well isn't,

1631
01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:23.090
it isn't arguable that a thousand years from now it would,

1632
01:26:23.091 --> 01:26:26.030
it would adapt and change and become something different than it is now.

1633
01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:29.530
We have the technology and exponentially as that technology.

1634
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:32.630
None of your audience,
no.
$6 million man references.
Do they play?

1635
01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:37.610
A few of them do right?
Barely alive.
That's right.
Gentlemen.
We can rebuild him.

1636
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:41.750
We have the technology.
I met him recently.
Very nice guy.
Wow.
I think,

1637
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:45.290
I think he's a pretty fun guy.
But anyway,
it's pretty cool to meet him I imagine.

1638
01:26:45.291 --> 01:26:48.100
Yeah.
The cool shows.
His handshake.
It's very firms.
I man,

1639
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:53.000
I imagined it would be Steve Austin,
um,
Lee majors.
Great Guy.
I am I a fan.

1640
01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.000
I think we do have that.
I think we have that,
that tech.
Okay.
So let me,

1641
01:26:58.001 --> 01:27:01.220
let me ask you a think.
We have it now.
We engineer consciousness.

1642
01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.640
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean neuroplasticity and,</v>

1643
01:27:03.641 --> 01:27:08.110
and focusing on what I would argue is it's the old Eris routinely and idea that

1644
01:27:08.111 --> 01:27:10.380
we look for something come you Domenico a or,
or,

1645
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:13.750
or happiness and happiness is according to Aristotle.

1646
01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:17.710
Happiness is the one thing we seek for its own sake,
right?
Like we don't,

1647
01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.100
we get on a bus to go somewhere,
right.

1648
01:27:21.150 --> 01:27:24.550
We take a cab to get home and once we're home we've arrived there and we don't

1649
01:27:24.551 --> 01:27:27.850
stay on the bus,
will stay on the cap and most things we do in life are there to,

1650
01:27:27.851 --> 01:27:32.020
to pursue happiness.
Right.
Like I came here because it's sunny.
No,

1651
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:32.973
I came here for you.

1652
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:37.030
I came here and the son and the son and the son both makes it very easy.

1653
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.800
I really enjoyed our last conversation and I think it was great to,

1654
01:27:40.801 --> 01:27:43.960
to get the messages out that I think are really important for people.

1655
01:27:43.961 --> 01:27:47.260
And so I came down here because it will make me happy so far.

1656
01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:49.690
You and the coffee have made me very happy.

1657
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.290
I'm not saying necessarily in that order,
but they're both in the mix.

1658
01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:57.790
<v 3>Caveman coffee works.
It really is good stuff.
I'll tell you that.
Um,</v>

1659
01:27:57.970 --> 01:28:00.580
I knew that you were going to butter me up.
Yeah.
That's how I do it.

1660
01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:02.650
I butter people up,
but literally,

1661
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.780
<v 1>and so yeah,
Aristotle said,
so how do you achieve happiness?
Well,</v>

1662
01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:09.290
acts happened as he said,
it's the pursuit of excellence,
particularly in virtue.

1663
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.070
And now virtue for Aristotle was a little funky because he was pro slavery.

1664
01:28:13.071 --> 01:28:15.020
So yeah,
it's,
it's been,
you know,

1665
01:28:15.021 --> 01:28:18.320
they didn't have labor saving devices other than other human beings.
So,

1666
01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.570
so I think that we do have the capacity to be quite happy and,

1667
01:28:23.571 --> 01:28:23.991
and to,

1668
01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:27.350
to achieve a state of not contentment because I think contentment is for like

1669
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:31.280
cows and,
and uh,
stuff that they excrete.
But I think to,
to,

1670
01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:35.960
to achieve happiness,
we pursue virtue,
which is,
you know,
we,
we act to do good.

1671
01:28:35.961 --> 01:28:39.620
We fight the bad guys.
We try and reform the people on the fence.

1672
01:28:39.621 --> 01:28:43.220
We try and encourage those in pursuit of virtue.
And I mean,

1673
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:47.240
let me ask you this question.
How is your conscience,
right?
You know,

1674
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:48.470
this thing that you accumulate,

1675
01:28:48.471 --> 01:28:51.110
this sort of unconscious thing that accumulates the good and bad that you've

1676
01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:53.030
done in your life.
My conscience is pretty easy.

1677
01:28:53.031 --> 01:28:55.430
I think I've done some things wrong.
I think I've done a lot of things right.

1678
01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:56.660
My conscience is pretty easy.

1679
01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:59.990
How your conscience do you think in the sort of the sum total,

1680
01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:02.040
you know that thing you go in of Saint Peter at the end

1681
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.920
<v 3>of your life and he tallies up you sort of the good and bad.</v>

1682
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.200
How's your conscience as far as that goes?

1683
01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:12.220
Well in your life generally I engage in not so frequent but quite strong

1684
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:14.550
psychedelic activities.

1685
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.970
And in doing so roller coasters with your eyes closed is that,

1686
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.860
well the most common one for me is a sensory deprivation tank.

1687
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:23.820
Do that all the time.

1688
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:28.170
So you face yourself in that environment without distractions,
right?
Yes,

1689
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:28.951
you certainly do.

1690
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:31.710
And that's one of the more challenging aspects of it and one of the things that

1691
01:29:31.711 --> 01:29:35.130
people are most afraid of because of that.
And um,

1692
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:37.110
I certainly have done things wrong.

1693
01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:41.910
I certainly have made mistakes and I certainly think that those mistakes have

1694
01:29:41.911 --> 01:29:44.880
given me more empathy,
more understanding,

1695
01:29:44.881 --> 01:29:48.720
more objectivity in the analysis of those mistakes have made me a better person.

1696
01:29:48.721 --> 01:29:53.070
And the subsequent reaction to my analysis of those mistakes and made me a

1697
01:29:53.071 --> 01:29:56.370
better person.
You change,
you evaluate and change and all that.
So you know,

1698
01:29:56.371 --> 01:30:00.120
when you say your conscious,
is your conscience clean?
No,
no.

1699
01:30:00.121 --> 01:30:04.620
It's fucking littered with bodies.
But the result of that,

1700
01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:08.110
that life has made me a far better bodies,
not zombies.
Right?
Yeah.

1701
01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:10.530
A woman who I am right now.
Yes.

1702
01:30:10.531 --> 01:30:13.770
My conscience is clear the way I treat people now.
Yeah.
On hundred percent.
Yeah.

1703
01:30:13.771 --> 01:30:16.140
I'm very,
I try to be very nice.
I tried to be right before.

1704
01:30:16.141 --> 01:30:18.060
I think you do a lot of good in the world.
You bring a lot of,

1705
01:30:18.061 --> 01:30:20.700
I think good thinkers to people's attention.
Hopefully myself included.

1706
01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:22.920
I think that through your comedies we talked about before,

1707
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:26.130
I think you give people a very empathetic relationship to their own physicality

1708
01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:26.880
and,
and uh,

1709
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.120
bring sort of some of the secret stuff in people's lives into the open and have

1710
01:30:30.121 --> 01:30:32.460
them have good humor about it so much.

1711
01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.250
I think you do a lot of good and I think that's what you say,

1712
01:30:35.251 --> 01:30:37.650
that you quite happy.
Well,
yeah.
And I'm very happy.
But I,

1713
01:30:37.651 --> 01:30:41.330
and I think that that good though is a very reciprocal,
it's,

1714
01:30:41.331 --> 01:30:44.550
it's a very even relationship between audience and me.

1715
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:48.750
I think I easily get as much out of this podcast is that people who listened to

1716
01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:49.470
it too.

1717
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:52.110
And I think that's one of the reasons why it's so harmonious and one of the

1718
01:30:52.111 --> 01:30:53.880
reasons why it's so easy to do.

1719
01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:57.510
And also one of the reasons why the relationship that I have with the audience

1720
01:30:57.511 --> 01:30:58.344
when I meet them,

1721
01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:03.440
it's like I think they know that I'm as happy about all of this as they are and

1722
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:07.260
the people that it's benefited their lives and they've been exposed to all these

1723
01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:09.420
different people like yourself and other interesting people that have had on the

1724
01:31:09.421 --> 01:31:12.600
show.
I have also been exposed to those people.
It's been exposed to you,

1725
01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:17.190
been exposed to whether it's Sam Harris or uh,
uh,
you know,

1726
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:18.270
Goswami,

1727
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:21.000
the theoretical physicists are all these different fascinating people that I've

1728
01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:23.130
had on the podcast.
Graham Hancock.
Glad Nauseum,

1729
01:31:23.131 --> 01:31:27.870
Joey is all these people have made my life a more fascinating life for sure.

1730
01:31:27.871 --> 01:31:31.320
So it's been a completely mutual,
beneficial situation.

1731
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:33.720
So when you say like you've done a lot of good,
well,

1732
01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:38.460
it's done a lot of good for me.
So I really think it's a very old,
yeah,

1733
01:31:38.461 --> 01:31:40.320
it's a completely even exchange.

1734
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:45.470
What I've found is a path that I find to be a both fascinating and enjoyable,

1735
01:31:45.931 --> 01:31:48.240
and I've gone down that path.

1736
01:31:48.241 --> 01:31:52.140
I've been very fortunate to find it and then pursue it.
That's unusual,
you know,

1737
01:31:52.141 --> 01:31:54.780
for your profession,
right?
I mean it was,

1738
01:31:54.850 --> 01:31:58.200
what is my comedians who do a or public figures and so on,

1739
01:31:58.201 --> 01:32:00.280
who bring intellectuals to

1740
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:01.810
<v 1>a mainstream audience?
I mean,</v>

1741
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:05.780
<v 0>well that's because I've kind of resisted the idea of being pigeonholed into one</v>

1742
01:32:05.781 --> 01:32:08.600
sort of occupation.
Right?
I mean,
what I do is just,

1743
01:32:08.601 --> 01:32:11.550
I'm a person and there's a bunch of things that I enjoy.
Right.
You know,

1744
01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:13.220
one of the things that I enjoy is hunting.

1745
01:32:13.221 --> 01:32:15.470
This thing that I've really become fascinated with lately.

1746
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:20.040
That's for a lot of people's repulsive.
I've had,
you know,
incredible insults.

1747
01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.050
I mean,
whether they think they come from,
well not only that there's the,

1748
01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:28.010
the the do no do the least harm principle.
It's really kind of fucked.

1749
01:32:28.190 --> 01:32:31.970
But the reality of farming is that unless you're organically farming and your

1750
01:32:31.971 --> 01:32:36.190
own garden,
you're actually killing more animals per pound of you know,

1751
01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:40.670
of grain and for pound of rice then you do per pound of beef.

1752
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.200
It's really kind of fucked.
There's,

1753
01:32:42.201 --> 01:32:46.520
there's some study on it like how many animals get ground up and those machines

1754
01:32:46.521 --> 01:32:49.420
that they use to churn up crops and Oh,
is that right?

1755
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.890
How much displacement they do to the,

1756
01:32:51.891 --> 01:32:56.200
into the natural habitat of certain animals.
When you plant crops and there's a,

1757
01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:00.680
you know this,
it's very,
it's,
it's ideal if you can grow your own stuff.

1758
01:33:00.710 --> 01:33:03.170
If you can grow your own stuff and you want to be like a Vegan,

1759
01:33:03.171 --> 01:33:06.170
you want to have like the smallest footprint possible.
That's the way to do it.

1760
01:33:06.171 --> 01:33:08.330
Grow your own stuff and you know,
and,

1761
01:33:08.331 --> 01:33:11.160
and make sure that you don't harm anything and the,

1762
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:16.070
the cultivation of your fruits and vegetables.
But if you don't,
boy,

1763
01:33:16.071 --> 01:33:19.520
you're still participating with you,
believe it or not,
you're participating,

1764
01:33:19.521 --> 01:33:20.810
you're participating in slaughter.

1765
01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:24.670
<v 1>Well,
yeah,
I mean,
I,
I have some sympathy and again,
I,
you know,</v>

1766
01:33:24.671 --> 01:33:27.370
if you can do less harm,
I think that's great.
And after high school,

1767
01:33:27.371 --> 01:33:30.290
I wanted somebody for school.
I ended up going up to work,
uh,
in,

1768
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:31.390
in northern Ontario,

1769
01:33:31.391 --> 01:33:36.190
like past the tree line where you had to fly in to do claim staking and gold

1770
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:38.980
panning and all that kind of stuff.
And you know,

1771
01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:41.770
when you really in Mother Nature,
and this was like,
you know,

1772
01:33:41.771 --> 01:33:45.400
minus 50 degree weather in a tent for months.
I mean,

1773
01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:49.300
when you really in Mother Nature,
you realize she's,
she's kind of a bitch.

1774
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.390
She doesn't give a fuck about you.
Like she'll just,
you know,

1775
01:33:52.391 --> 01:33:55.450
fucking tree will fall on your head.
And that's it for you.
I mean,
you know,

1776
01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:59.220
it's really,
uh,
you know,
one time we got snowed in,

1777
01:33:59.230 --> 01:34:03.070
like we couldn't get the plane in with supplies and you realize,
look,

1778
01:34:03.071 --> 01:34:07.090
you're looking at a box of food and you're like,
you know,
when we're out of this,

1779
01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.940
it's getting all kinds of like stuck on a mountain looking at people.

1780
01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:12.680
I actually was thinking,
you know,
you see those,
um,

1781
01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.240
these are looney tunes cartoons.
So again,
for your younger audience members,

1782
01:34:16.241 --> 01:34:17.440
please ask your parents.
You know,

1783
01:34:17.441 --> 01:34:20.560
like when some guys really hungry and he looks across at some other guy and he

1784
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:23.800
turns into like this steaming chicken wing or something like that.

1785
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:26.700
Today though you couldn't.
But I was looking at,

1786
01:34:26.701 --> 01:34:29.590
there was one guy who was kind of plumping the in the camp and you know,

1787
01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:31.990
he actually just started to look well marbled to me.

1788
01:34:31.991 --> 01:34:34.810
Like I didn't think of it as fat anymore.
I thought of it as nutritious.

1789
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:39.650
<v 0>When things get ugly,
people do tend to start leaning towards survive.</v>

1790
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:41.900
<v 1>Yes.
And a lot of times like we,</v>

1791
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:45.650
we like nature because we are a comfortable distance from it.
You know,

1792
01:34:45.651 --> 01:34:48.560
like we've got our air conditioning,
we got our antibiotics,
we've got,
you know,

1793
01:34:48.561 --> 01:34:50.390
the people in the Middle Ages,
you know,

1794
01:34:50.391 --> 01:34:54.320
they were really close to nature and we died like flies,
you know,

1795
01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:58.120
like childbirth was half fatal to like half the women have,

1796
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.940
<v 3>every fucking story has a big bad wolf in it.
And the reason being is at wolves,</v>

1797
01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:04.130
we're fucking killing people on a regular base.
Yeah.

1798
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:08.960
Until people figured out firearms wolves were killing people like crazy.

1799
01:35:09.010 --> 01:35:12.740
It was a really common thing for people to get killed by wolves.
You know,
one,

1800
01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.420
one stupid ass flea comes across a in a rat from the Middle East and suddenly a

1801
01:35:17.421 --> 01:35:20.090
third of Europe is dying from the black death.
I mean,

1802
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:25.070
I in nature is great to visit,
but it's not a fucking Ansell Adams poster.

1803
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.760
I mean,
she is a sociopathic bitch who will wipe you out as soon as look at you.

1804
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.390
There's a story from 1450 that I've told them the podcast once before,

1805
01:35:32.391 --> 01:35:37.160
but for the,
this in this line of thinking,
there was a,

1806
01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:37.690
uh,

1807
01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:42.690
a series of murders in Paris in 1450 by wolves were murderers.

1808
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:47.540
I guess it's just PR predatory.
They killed 40 people.

1809
01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.310
Wolves killed 40 fucking people in Paris and 1450.

1810
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:57.260
And we are no different to them than a Caribou or anything else that they can

1811
01:35:57.261 --> 01:35:57.710
eat.

1812
01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:02.540
It's just when we have protected ourselves completely with cities and cars and

1813
01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:05.330
guns and all these things,
then it doesn't become an issue.

1814
01:36:05.331 --> 01:36:07.970
And then we look at them and like,
oh,
beautiful nature.

1815
01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:12.860
But that beautiful nature gives zero fucks about you and we'll absolutely eat

1816
01:36:12.861 --> 01:36:15.560
your baby in front of you.
Oh yeah.
They have no problem with it.

1817
01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:17.210
Whether it's a fox in London,

1818
01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:21.680
they actually have had issues recently where foxes have broken into children's

1819
01:36:21.681 --> 01:36:26.030
bedrooms and attack the children while they're asleep.
Rats.
If babies in Harlem,

1820
01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:30.230
I mean rats will just eat the baby's face.
Oh,
they just monstrous.
It's,
it's,

1821
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:33.800
it's so heartless and the,
it's all about survival.

1822
01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:35.790
And we've a radically did that by,

1823
01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:38.270
I love it and I love it too big at the top of the food chain.

1824
01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:41.060
I'm sorry that that we had to kill a whole bunch of stuff to get here,

1825
01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:43.130
but at the beginning it was us or them,
you know,

1826
01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:46.250
like I'm glad that some comment came and took the heads off the dinosaurs

1827
01:36:46.251 --> 01:36:48.680
because otherwise we'd just be little rodents that they're eating.

1828
01:36:48.710 --> 01:36:51.890
Like I'm sorry that a whole bunch of,
we were on top of a big pile of bodies,

1829
01:36:51.891 --> 01:36:53.240
but I'd rather be on top of then in them.

1830
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:55.400
I have no problem with killing dinosaurs.

1831
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:57.680
I have no problem with the media that killed their,

1832
01:36:57.681 --> 01:37:00.290
the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.
I'm happy that it happened.

1833
01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:02.930
It's like the big mammalian airstrike from outer space.
You know,

1834
01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:05.690
let's make some room in the food chain.
We've got to grow people.

1835
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:07.760
We got a podcast to do in 4 billion years.

1836
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:10.580
I used to have this bit about this people that I talked to once that we're

1837
01:37:10.581 --> 01:37:12.440
working to save the Komodo Dragon,

1838
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:14.780
they were going to the Komodo islands in two weeks.
Let's work.

1839
01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:18.050
Make sure the Komodo dragon populations are good and healthy.
I'm like,

1840
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:23.240
what?
Why would you want those heartless fucking monsters?

1841
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:26.210
Get a few of them.
Stick them in a zoo.
Shoot the rest of them in the head.

1842
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:30.610
Are you fucking evil?
These are evil reptiles.

1843
01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:34.070
Others so evil.
Tell me,
tell me why.
I got horrible monster.

1844
01:37:34.110 --> 01:37:38.480
I don't know much about biggest lizards on the planet and they water buffalo

1845
01:37:38.481 --> 01:37:41.510
people.
Anything on that island buffaloes.
Oh fuck yeah,
they do.

1846
01:37:41.511 --> 01:37:44.240
They eat them by biting them.
They're huge.
They're enormous.

1847
01:37:44.241 --> 01:37:46.010
You never seen a Komodo Dragon.
I mean,

1848
01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.410
Jamie pope a photo of a Komodo dragons mouth.

1849
01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:52.310
They used to think that they carry botulism their saliva that used to be
thought,

1850
01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.860
but now they realize that what happens is the environment that dragons live in,

1851
01:37:55.861 --> 01:37:59.520
it's so hot and tropical and that a lot of times they're biting into water

1852
01:37:59.521 --> 01:38:01.860
buffalo and all these different things that are exposed to moisture,

1853
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:05.770
and it's just a septic nature of their environment because water buffaloes piss

1854
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:07.320
and shit in the water that they live in.

1855
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:09.900
And then when this Komodo dragon bites them,

1856
01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:14.640
he opens up their flesh and the blood gets exposed to all the toxins and the

1857
01:38:14.641 --> 01:38:17.400
teeth waiting for whatever the next bite.
So it's venomous.

1858
01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.820
They're just like disgust,
disgust,
look at it,
look at that image.

1859
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:25.140
Evil Saliva.
One of them though a bit,

1860
01:38:25.141 --> 01:38:28.650
Sharon stone's husband on the foot,
this dump,
fuck,

1861
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:32.520
he got into a cage with a Komodo dragon and he had white socks on and the thing

1862
01:38:32.521 --> 01:38:36.180
thought his foot was a rabbit.
It's a clamped down on his foot and would let go.

1863
01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.060
And he almost lost his foot there.
It's really,

1864
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:41.210
they're really fucking gangster poplar.

1865
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:45.960
He got into a Komodo Dragon.
Oh,
it's so cute.

1866
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:48.870
I would do it if I was in a tank,
again,

1867
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:52.200
a cage with it and I had a Samurai sword fuck outta here.

1868
01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:53.610
Those things are horrifying.

1869
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:57.720
But these people that I met were like really dedicating all of their time and

1870
01:38:57.721 --> 01:39:00.390
effort.
And I'm like,
that is fascinating.

1871
01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:02.580
But those fucking lizards don't give a shit about you buddy.

1872
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:03.840
And now I can understand it.

1873
01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.000
<v 1>That's some big ecosystem thing.
Yes.</v>

1874
01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:10.350
But they got rid of the predators a in Australia I think it was.
And then the,

1875
01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:14.550
basically the rabbit's just ate the entire continent.
So I can like,

1876
01:39:14.551 --> 01:39:17.940
if there's some balance in nature of thing,
you know,
I think that's fine.
But,
uh,

1877
01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.460
I am very,
very glad to,
uh,
to not be around wild animals.
You know,

1878
01:39:23.461 --> 01:39:27.300
like when I was working up north,
we had to be armed because I mean,

1879
01:39:27.301 --> 01:39:31.620
there are bears who might not have had a meal in like a month and they don't

1880
01:39:31.621 --> 01:39:35.280
care.
They'll just,
they'll just come and rip your face off and eat it.

1881
01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:40.380
And that's,
you know,
wolves and all that.
We really had to be careful out there.

1882
01:39:40.381 --> 01:39:44.310
And this,
uh,
yeah.
So all the people who were like nature is basically cuddle.

1883
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:45.660
It's like,
that's great.

1884
01:39:45.661 --> 01:39:48.960
That's cause you go hiking in Yellowstone aren't on clearly marked parts when

1885
01:39:48.961 --> 01:39:50.700
people have cleared all the predators away.

1886
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:54.860
<v 3>And you know,
not even Yellowstone,
you'll 70,
maybe because they have black bears.</v>

1887
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:59.450
Yeah.
But,
uh,
I,
Alex Honnold,
you know,
he has,
he's the climber.

1888
01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:04.580
Uh,
he's one of the world's best.
He's on 60 minutes.
That one.
Yeah.

1889
01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.110
And he was on the podcast.

1890
01:40:06.170 --> 01:40:09.510
I've got Yellowstone confused with Yosemite and we were talking about bear desk.

1891
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:14.180
I'm like,
man,
bears and fucking died in,
in Yosemite.
Right.
And he was like,
no,

1892
01:40:14.210 --> 01:40:16.520
I don't know.
Bears or die.
And I was,
I got,
I didn't know that.

1893
01:40:16.521 --> 01:40:18.860
There's two different I had in my head,

1894
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:21.100
Yellowstone and Yosemite became the same thing,
right.

1895
01:40:21.230 --> 01:40:24.980
Because two people over the last couple of years were killed in Yellowstone by

1896
01:40:24.981 --> 01:40:27.710
grizzlies and just fucking hikers.

1897
01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.150
Just people wandering around and you run into a bear in the wrong situation.

1898
01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:37.151
And that is a giant 1800 pound monster or 1200 pounds or 800 pound,

1899
01:40:37.371 --> 01:40:39.920
whatever the fuck it is.
There are bears there are enormous.

1900
01:40:39.921 --> 01:40:43.420
It's think of a giant dog,
an 800 pound dog that wants to eat you.

1901
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:46.520
Like it's going to eat you your fuck can't get away.
You can't get,

1902
01:40:46.521 --> 01:40:47.790
they can put you on the fast,

1903
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:51.560
they can climb up and you cannot get away from those guys.
And I run up trees,

1904
01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:54.480
we run straight up a tree and black bears especially

1905
01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.960
<v 0>can run up a tree like a,
like a cat.
Yeah.</v>

1906
01:40:57.290 --> 01:41:00.080
<v 1>Yeah.
Oh.
And,
and I remember being in a,</v>

1907
01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:03.190
in a tent again in the middle of nowhere.
Um,

1908
01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:07.820
I was with this tiny Japanese woman who was like incredibly strong.

1909
01:41:07.821 --> 01:41:10.580
She was literally like made of muscle.
It was astounding.
Anyway,
but,

1910
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:15.350
and we were in this tent and I heard this,
oh wow.
You know,

1911
01:41:15.351 --> 01:41:18.370
snuffling around and,
and you know,
we did all that.
We hung the,
the,

1912
01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:21.350
the food and the trees and all that.
You don't never want any food around,

1913
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:24.350
obviously when you're sleeping and then this kind of stuff.
And,
I mean,

1914
01:41:24.351 --> 01:41:27.950
you literally think this is like,
this is my last 20 seconds in this planet.

1915
01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:31.730
You know,
this,
this is it.
You know this thing.
Cause you know,
even if your arms,

1916
01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.680
uh,
there's only so much you can do.

1917
01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:37.070
<v 0>Well you have to get off a shot very quickly and you have to hope that it's</v>

1918
01:41:37.071 --> 01:41:39.620
scares the bear away because if you just shoot them,

1919
01:41:39.621 --> 01:41:44.440
unless you have a really high powered rifle,
like a pistol shot 38.

1920
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.880
Yeah,
a shotgun is not good enough.
Now I'm not going to kill him.

1921
01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:49.760
<v 1>But what it will do is it will annoy him to the point where he killed you</v>

1922
01:41:49.761 --> 01:41:51.680
quicker.
So that won't be a lot of suffering.

1923
01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:54.560
<v 0>So you know,
you won't,
you know,</v>

1924
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:57.450
it'll rip your own head off and you won't get to see your own better off putting

1925
01:41:57.451 --> 01:42:02.260
the gun your mouth simply.
Yeah,
that might be the mood.
But the problem is then,

1926
01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:05.310
<v 1>you know,
they kind of identify you but dental records,
cause you're,
you know,</v>

1927
01:42:05.311 --> 01:42:07.020
your teeth is sprayed out all over the forest.

1928
01:42:07.021 --> 01:42:12.021
But so stuff like that gives you a pretty healthy appreciation for the bears

1929
01:42:12.121 --> 01:42:14.730
killed dogs near the camp and stuff like,
I mean,
it's,

1930
01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:19.310
it's seriously dangerous stuff out there and I'm very happy to,

1931
01:42:19.311 --> 01:42:22.260
to live in a civilized area where I can go visit.

1932
01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:26.740
Nature and nature is absolutely beautiful when it is not trying to kill you.
Uh,

1933
01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:28.920
it's like the,
you know,
the ocean is beautiful.

1934
01:42:28.921 --> 01:42:33.100
I love scuba diving and snorkeling.
That's a flying over the coral,
but the fee,

1935
01:42:33.330 --> 01:42:36.900
as long as nothing's taken your leg off,
it's a beautiful,
beautiful experience.

1936
01:42:36.901 --> 01:42:39.720
But that taking the leg off thing is a pretty important part of the equation.

1937
01:42:39.721 --> 01:42:41.940
And the people forget it.
Who spent a lot of time in cities.

1938
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:43.420
<v 0>Yeah.
People do forget it.</v>

1939
01:42:43.421 --> 01:42:47.320
That taking your leg off as a real thing to think about when you go swimming

1940
01:42:47.321 --> 01:42:49.930
anywhere in the world where there's sharks,
you know,

1941
01:42:49.931 --> 01:42:52.750
you might think that it's not going to happen to you because it hasn't happened

1942
01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:55.510
to that guy or that guy,
or this person has a surfboard over there.
Look,

1943
01:42:55.511 --> 01:42:59.560
this person's snorkeling.
I'm fine.
No,
you're not.
You're rolling the dice.

1944
01:42:59.561 --> 01:43:03.300
You're getting,
it's like if you go into the woods,
the idea of like that,

1945
01:43:03.330 --> 01:43:05.980
that somehow or another,
these millions of sharks going to avoid you.

1946
01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:10.600
Like likely yes,
because there's so much real estate,
but it's like if we've,

1947
01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:12.460
we've,
we knew that Werewolf's were real,

1948
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:14.740
but there was only one of them and it was out in the woods.

1949
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:17.590
How often would you go in the woods when it was a full moon?

1950
01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:20.600
You would never fucking go in the woods because you'd go,
fuck it.

1951
01:43:20.610 --> 01:43:23.950
What if I picked the wrong night in the wrong place and I get out there and the

1952
01:43:23.951 --> 01:43:28.450
wolf man has right there.
He eats me.
Well,
the fucking sharks are sharks all day,

1953
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:31.840
24 hours a day,
seven days a week,
365 days a year.

1954
01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.970
The wolf man is only the wolf man once a month.

1955
01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.030
<v 1>And you know,
but we,
you know,</v>

1956
01:43:36.031 --> 01:43:39.900
that we not that terrified of nature because all the kids toys are like cute

1957
01:43:39.901 --> 01:43:40.734
predators.

1958
01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:46.050
<v 0>Like if you go down to the woods tonight,
you're in for a big surprise,
you know,</v>

1959
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:49.860
cause the teddy bears or having a picnic.
But the real end of that story is Bra.

1960
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:52.160
I know.
Isn't it funny

1961
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:56.180
<v 1>that teddy bear is like a con?
That's that.
That is so common.</v>

1962
01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:59.030
It's a completely comments 20 it's only common now.

1963
01:43:59.031 --> 01:44:02.300
I don't think they had bear toys when bears could kill you.
You know,

1964
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:05.030
now that there's no bears around,

1965
01:44:05.031 --> 01:44:08.030
they can be cute and cuddly and you can have the lion king and all of that

1966
01:44:08.031 --> 01:44:10.280
because nobody's around lions.
But you know,
in Africa,

1967
01:44:10.281 --> 01:44:12.560
people still get regularly eaten by lions.

1968
01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:16.250
I bet you there are not a lot of lion toys lying around that are cute and
cuddly.

1969
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:19.650
<v 0>I bet you're right.
And if you think about some of the animals that we have a,</v>

1970
01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:23.460
what's the term anthropomorphism?
Is that it?

1971
01:44:23.461 --> 01:44:28.240
When you take a person or project human characteristics onto a nonhuman like

1972
01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.180
Tony,
the tiger there,
like Tony looking at your children,

1973
01:44:32.190 --> 01:44:36.180
he's a fucking asshole.
Great to eat.
Why are you making him cute?

1974
01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:40.050
They're tired because we don't have any tigers around there in zoos.

1975
01:44:40.051 --> 01:44:42.240
And you take pictures and so fun fact about India.

1976
01:44:42.241 --> 01:44:45.990
There's a place called the cinder bands were tires have killed 300,000 people

1977
01:44:45.991 --> 01:44:47.070
over the last 200 years.

1978
01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:51.570
300,000 people have been killed by tigers in the Sunderbans.

1979
01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.970
It's so incredible.
I had a bit about it.

1980
01:44:53.971 --> 01:44:56.400
I'm one of my past comedy specials cause it was just,

1981
01:44:56.401 --> 01:44:57.730
it's such a ridiculous statistic.

1982
01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:02.870
One tiger killed three men in a boat of five swim out to the boat,
killed a man,

1983
01:45:02.871 --> 01:45:06.150
dragged him back to the water,
to the beach,
jumped back in the water,

1984
01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:09.240
killed another guy,
hop and did it three times before.

1985
01:45:09.241 --> 01:45:12.560
Either got bored or they got away for full.
Yeah.
I mean they,

1986
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:15.090
they swim incredibly fast and they're really aggressive.

1987
01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:18.620
<v 1>They've got these teeth that can tell by your Jackie is yes,
they're sensitive.</v>

1988
01:45:18.621 --> 01:45:21.290
Yeah.
I mean the beat,
that's his job stuff.
Yeah.

1989
01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:24.250
<v 0>They adjust.
Well that's where they're designed for,
you know,</v>

1990
01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:28.180
I mean they are literally designed to clean up anything slow.

1991
01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.600
They're there as population control.
That's what they're there for.

1992
01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:34.160
<v 1>And also making sure the hood stays strong.
You know,</v>

1993
01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:37.190
getting rid of the slowest and the city gets then the oldest and keep this heard

1994
01:45:37.191 --> 01:45:38.024
strong

1995
01:45:38.050 --> 01:45:40.690
<v 0>to think of it that way.
But again,
this is the Yin and the Yang.</v>

1996
01:45:40.691 --> 01:45:43.450
If you gave the tiger's a pill and make everything groovy and there's no more

1997
01:45:43.451 --> 01:45:47.330
need to hunt,
what would we have?
Well,
we have nature but the,

1998
01:45:47.410 --> 01:45:52.060
but the real question is if,
if we are going to engineer that,
but what are,

1999
01:45:52.061 --> 01:45:53.800
what are we going to do with the natural world?

2000
01:45:54.190 --> 01:45:57.550
What are we going to do with the bears and the Tigers and the crocodiles?

2001
01:45:57.910 --> 01:46:01.600
<v 1>Well,
I mean of course the natural human predators.
Yeah,
that's this weird idea.</v>

2002
01:46:01.601 --> 01:46:03.460
And I think it comes out of religion that,

2003
01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:08.140
I mean there's a couple of things that are problematic which come out of

2004
01:46:08.141 --> 01:46:10.120
religion and some of them are obviously kind of obvious,

2005
01:46:10.121 --> 01:46:11.260
but some of them I think are more subtle.

2006
01:46:11.261 --> 01:46:14.620
Like the issue of the soul to me is always really interesting.
Like this,

2007
01:46:14.621 --> 01:46:17.950
this in the religious idea,
and not all religions,
but a lot of religions,

2008
01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.680
you know,
you have this eternal part of you called the soul,

2009
01:46:20.681 --> 01:46:24.550
which is uncorruptible,
uh,
which can all,
and so,
you know,
when they say,

2010
01:46:24.551 --> 01:46:27.550
you know that he's a bad guy,
but if you really can,
if you reach through,

2011
01:46:27.551 --> 01:46:28.870
if you connect with him,
there's,
you know,

2012
01:46:28.871 --> 01:46:31.150
there's good in some way or and all that kind of stuff.

2013
01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:35.080
I think that's a really dangerous idea and it's scientifically seems to be

2014
01:46:35.081 --> 01:46:38.560
entirely false.
You know,
like people who are sociopaths don't get better.

2015
01:46:38.561 --> 01:46:40.970
They don't reform.
They will become canning and they,

2016
01:46:40.971 --> 01:46:44.620
but they've tried everything.
They've tried injecting sociopath with LSD and say,

2017
01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:45.463
shit,

2018
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:50.890
well bullets or the cure and there are not pretty common like one in 25 people.

2019
01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.320
It's,
yeah,
I certainly come across them too.

2020
01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:00.360
And these are the human predators and I mean,
it's fairly easy to create them.

2021
01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:03.690
If you really traumatize a whole lot of kids,
then you can,
like they,

2022
01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:08.100
a lot of them came out of her chest cues,
um,
Romania because he banned abortion.

2023
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:11.430
And a lot of women who would otherwise have had abortions put these kids into

2024
01:47:11.431 --> 01:47:14.550
these orphanages where they were fed and taken care of but nobody ever touched

2025
01:47:14.551 --> 01:47:17.430
them.
And then I think it was in France,
that was when this came out,

2026
01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:21.690
a whole bunch of French families adopted these a Romanian orphanages kids and

2027
01:47:21.691 --> 01:47:24.450
they were strangling their cats and they would throw in there other kids out of

2028
01:47:24.451 --> 01:47:25.850
windows and stuff and they would just,

2029
01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.280
and they come unfixable completely unfixable from the jump.

2030
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.420
I mean like how old were they when they adopted them?
Usually it's within,

2031
01:47:33.421 --> 01:47:37.320
if you do this a,
if it's after two or three years,
it's usually a reversible,

2032
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.640
cause you know,
the brain development,

2033
01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:43.140
the development of empathy is like three years in or psychopaths empathy,

2034
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:48.141
is it 10 to 12 different brain centers all have to fire in harmony.

2035
01:47:48.241 --> 01:47:50.730
And you also have to develop these things called mirror neurons,

2036
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:54.330
which are I think completely fascinated the biological basis of empathy island.

2037
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:56.620
Completely Geeky.
Fascinating to me.
But,
uh,

2038
01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.100
since empathy I think is the most important resource in the world,

2039
01:47:59.101 --> 01:48:01.440
if you have that,
all other resource will be taken care of.

2040
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:06.750
But Mirror neurons are,
if you see someone taking nuts shot,
you go,
oh,

2041
01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:07.131
you know,

2042
01:48:07.131 --> 01:48:11.160
like you kind of get it in your body are those are mirror neurons and you can,

2043
01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:14.490
you can make them or deny them in monkeys very easily,
right?
I mean,

2044
01:48:14.491 --> 01:48:17.880
if you just give them all the food and drink that they need,
uh,

2045
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:21.090
but you just give them like a,
uh,
a simulated mom,

2046
01:48:21.210 --> 01:48:24.270
like the doesn't actually interact with them and you isolate them and you don't

2047
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:25.980
even have to traumatize them.
You don't have to hit them.

2048
01:48:25.981 --> 01:48:28.710
You don't have to scare them if you do that,
they gave even worse.

2049
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:30.120
But then they grow up with,

2050
01:48:30.121 --> 01:48:32.970
with no particular empathy because they don't get that sort of back and forth.

2051
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:34.200
I mean,
babies are born with it.

2052
01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:37.890
One freaky thing that babies can do is write out of the womb like right when

2053
01:48:37.891 --> 01:48:40.650
they're born.
If you stick your tongue out at a baby,

2054
01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:42.750
it will stick its tongue out back at you,

2055
01:48:42.751 --> 01:48:45.330
which is a completely freaky thing to do when you think about it.

2056
01:48:45.331 --> 01:48:48.330
They've never seen a town and they don't know that you have the same,
but they,

2057
01:48:48.630 --> 01:48:52.260
so if you develop mirror neurons then you won't get sociopathy because you will

2058
01:48:52.261 --> 01:48:53.160
have empathy.
Right?

2059
01:48:53.161 --> 01:48:56.970
And people who spank fundamentally are acting against empathy and they're

2060
01:48:56.971 --> 01:48:59.610
teaching their children to act against empathy because you're doing exactly what

2061
01:48:59.611 --> 01:49:01.500
your child desperately does not want you to do.

2062
01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:04.710
And so you're really screwing with with empathy and so on.

2063
01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:10.160
And so the development of the non development of mirror neurons appears to be

2064
01:49:10.621 --> 01:49:13.320
something that cannot be corrected later in life.
It's just this,

2065
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:16.620
it's like if you don't get exposed to language between like two and five,

2066
01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:19.590
you just never really learn it.
And there's this crazy,

2067
01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:24.210
and this is why when I talk about fixing the world or having a paradise on
earth,

2068
01:49:24.211 --> 01:49:26.400
which relative to what we have now,
I think we can have,

2069
01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:30.960
it's a multigenerational process because if the kids are screwed up that early,

2070
01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.080
it appears to be irreversible and all you can do is manage the symptoms,

2071
01:49:34.081 --> 01:49:38.460
you know,
through prison or whatever it is.
But these human predators,
um,

2072
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:42.930
it's not in the religious mindset where there's a soul that there's someone good

2073
01:49:42.931 --> 01:49:47.380
you can get into that.
It's like you can connect with is biologically completely.

2074
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:50.020
It seems to be,
again,
I'm no expert seems to be completely incorrect.

2075
01:49:50.021 --> 01:49:52.600
It's like saying if you've got lung cancer throughout your lungs,

2076
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:56.380
that there's a healthy ghost lung that you just have to connect with the breath.

2077
01:49:56.381 --> 01:49:59.680
Well,
no,
your lungs are corrupted.
They're screwed up.
They're there.
They're not,

2078
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:01.270
there's no healthy backup lungs.

2079
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:04.900
There's no healthy backup personality or brain called the soul.

2080
01:50:04.901 --> 01:50:08.500
But this idea that you can reach through to the most corrupted and destroyed

2081
01:50:08.501 --> 01:50:11.050
people and somehow reawaken their humanity,

2082
01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:14.860
which is necessary for religion.
You how you have to have a soul.

2083
01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:18.130
I think it's really a dangerous thing because it lets us,

2084
01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:20.030
if you have compassion for associate pass,

2085
01:50:20.031 --> 01:50:21.820
they use it to manipulate and control you.

2086
01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.550
And so it's almost like if you're a sociopath,

2087
01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:28.540
you'd love to invent the idea of a soul so that people will try and and help you

2088
01:50:28.541 --> 01:50:30.250
and then you can manipulate and control them.

2089
01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:33.580
Whereas if you recognize it that predators,
then you just steer clear of them.

2090
01:50:33.581 --> 01:50:37.390
They lose a lot of their power so well it was sometimes it's very difficult to

2091
01:50:37.391 --> 01:50:40.000
find them.
It's very difficult to identify them.

2092
01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:42.880
That's one of the comedians they camouflage,
right?
Yeah.
And there's,

2093
01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:44.470
there's one of the ways that you can,

2094
01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:48.550
is by when people behave around you that seems like really fake and weird.

2095
01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.210
It's like they have like a fake weird friendship with you or fake weird

2096
01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:53.080
interaction with you.

2097
01:50:53.410 --> 01:50:56.590
One of the reasons why they have this fake weird thing is because they don't

2098
01:50:56.591 --> 01:50:59.590
understand regular friendships,
loves and relationships.

2099
01:50:59.591 --> 01:51:03.460
So it all comes off as odd to them cause they're doing make-believe all the
time.

2100
01:51:03.461 --> 01:51:06.040
They're,
they're imitating what they've seen around them,

2101
01:51:06.130 --> 01:51:07.840
they know what's important to other people,

2102
01:51:07.841 --> 01:51:09.910
but they don't feel that it's important to themselves.

2103
01:51:09.911 --> 01:51:11.230
The best way to describe it right there,
right?

2104
01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:15.790
Like I mean like a torturer knows what hurts you and likes it,
you know?

2105
01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:18.820
And they've done actually it's a bunch of studies where they show people.

2106
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:20.190
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2107
01:51:20.190 --> 01:51:22.230
<v 1>And this,
this,
I find it's sewing comprehensible.</v>

2108
01:51:22.231 --> 01:51:25.020
I try and sort of get it cause having empathy for non empathetic people.

2109
01:51:25.021 --> 01:51:25.890
This is a tough thing.

2110
01:51:25.891 --> 01:51:28.890
I think it's a necessary process to go through for south protection and I think

2111
01:51:28.891 --> 01:51:29.790
for the betterment of the world.

2112
01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:32.820
So these studies where they sh they sorta hook up these,

2113
01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.230
these electrodes to people's brains.

2114
01:51:34.231 --> 01:51:37.860
They can measure what's going on in their brains and they show intentional

2115
01:51:37.861 --> 01:51:42.510
cruelty films.
Like they show like no cruelty and then accidental cruelty,

2116
01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.100
like guy steps on a rake or whatever,
right?

2117
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:45.840
And then they show intentional cruelty,

2118
01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.960
like guide pretending to like stapling and other guy's hand or something like

2119
01:51:48.961 --> 01:51:50.280
that.
And

2120
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.740
<v 5>okay.</v>

2121
01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:54.320
<v 1>When people see some people see the intentional cruelty,</v>

2122
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:58.250
the same happy centers related to orgasm,

2123
01:51:58.251 --> 01:52:02.440
related to just feelings of intense bliss show up because this a sadist,

2124
01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:06.350
I'm taking pleasure in the suffering of others.
I mean that is,

2125
01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.450
that's Auntie empathy.
That's like,
well I,
you know,

2126
01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.660
I know that you're attached to your children so I'm going to use your attachment

2127
01:52:11.661 --> 01:52:14.060
to your children to control and bully you or whatever it is.
You know,

2128
01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:17.960
like you kidnap some guy's kids or whatever.
And this,
this aspect of,

2129
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:21.170
of human predation is really important.
We are not a species.

2130
01:52:21.171 --> 01:52:25.790
We are a whole ecosystem of Predator and prey and our lack of ability to

2131
01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:29.270
differentiate between Predator and prey in the human species,

2132
01:52:29.271 --> 01:52:33.290
I think is one of the major routes of hierarchical brutalities and,

2133
01:52:33.291 --> 01:52:35.060
and wars and all of this kind of stuff.

2134
01:52:35.061 --> 01:52:38.190
And I think we really need to throw away the idea of the,

2135
01:52:38.191 --> 01:52:42.680
the eternal good within us and recognize that the most dangerous species to

2136
01:52:42.681 --> 01:52:45.200
human beings with other human beings.
By far.

2137
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:49.040
I mean just governments alone in the 20th century murdered,

2138
01:52:49.041 --> 01:52:53.420
not even including war governments murdered 250 plus million people.

2139
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:55.580
They can't even get it down to within 10 million people.

2140
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:59.390
It's a quarter of a billion people murdered just by one human institution

2141
01:52:59.391 --> 01:53:03.620
populated by sociopaths.
These are incredibly dangerous people,

2142
01:53:03.621 --> 01:53:05.870
but talking about bears and stuff and that's very important.

2143
01:53:05.871 --> 01:53:09.410
But the most important and most dangerous predators are human beings and we

2144
01:53:09.411 --> 01:53:13.190
don't really have a good way of identifying them other than they're on the

2145
01:53:13.191 --> 01:53:16.190
ballot.
Oh sorry,
little anarchist propaganda there.
But could you imagine

2146
01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:20.070
<v 0>if you had like a bunch of bears that were like really cool and you love to be</v>

2147
01:53:20.071 --> 01:53:23.400
around them and they were like really fun and they do things for you and they

2148
01:53:23.401 --> 01:53:26.430
help you and help you move and do provide you with joy.

2149
01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.770
And then there's other bears that we'll just fucking eat you if they find

2150
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:32.610
<v 1>yeah.
Or it's like that Battlestar Galactica thing like the sidelines.</v>

2151
01:53:32.670 --> 01:53:35.710
They looked like people when they're aliens.
And this is something that is,

2152
01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:39.900
we really got it as a species up are like radar for this kind of stuff.

2153
01:53:39.901 --> 01:53:43.510
Cause imagine if we could see these guys,
like if they hadn't been married,
right?

2154
01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:47.430
Just go home or whatever.
I get up on their psycho and then it'd be like,
okay,

2155
01:53:47.431 --> 01:53:50.790
well here's someone I'm not going to lend money to or be friends with or have

2156
01:53:50.791 --> 01:53:54.210
kids where or you know,
we could this gene or whatever.
Even if it's genetic,

2157
01:53:54.211 --> 01:53:57.330
we could,
we could eliminate that within a generation or two.
But as long as,

2158
01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:01.140
and of course if they are physically attractive or wealthy or powerful as well,

2159
01:54:01.141 --> 01:54:04.830
I mean they're just,
it's like Ambrosia for a lot of people,
right?
It's a,
anyway,

2160
01:54:04.831 --> 01:54:08.190
so this is sort of a pet thing of mine is just really help people to understand

2161
01:54:08.191 --> 01:54:10.590
that there are some really bad people out there.

2162
01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.250
And even if we say they don't have free will,
so what,
you know,
bears,

2163
01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.740
we don't say the bears a morally responsible for eating people,

2164
01:54:16.741 --> 01:54:18.310
but we don't hang out with them.
Right?
So

2165
01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.990
<v 0>by that the freewheel thing,
of course you free will.</v>

2166
01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.770
It's just like how much free will do you have?

2167
01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:24.780
How much decision making does your consciousness?
Huh?

2168
01:54:24.850 --> 01:54:26.800
<v 1>If you believe you don't have freewill,
guess what?</v>

2169
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:27.950
<v 0>But then there's a bunch of people,</v>

2170
01:54:27.951 --> 01:54:31.550
while there's factors go that go into every decision that you make and those

2171
01:54:31.551 --> 01:54:34.310
factors are genetic and environmental and this and that and that.

2172
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:36.540
And if you factor it all together,
it's not about freewill.

2173
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:40.680
It's not about your free decision maker that maybe or maybe not.
I mean it's,

2174
01:54:40.681 --> 01:54:41.514
it's a very,

2175
01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:46.340
it's a very slippery argument both ways on both sides actually.

2176
01:54:46.410 --> 01:54:50.010
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean for me,
because people don't say,</v>

2177
01:54:50.011 --> 01:54:53.250
well defined free will and I've given some thought to it and I got a series on

2178
01:54:53.251 --> 01:54:57.010
youtube about this freedom in youtube.com forward slash freedom and radio people

2179
01:54:57.011 --> 01:54:58.890
want to check it out.
But to me,

2180
01:54:58.891 --> 01:55:03.891
freewill is our capacity to compare something proposed with an ideal standard.

2181
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:09.630
That to me is,
is,
is really the essence of free.
So,

2182
01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:14.010
<v 0>so composed to an ideal standard meaning that's what you gauge your reactions</v>

2183
01:55:14.011 --> 01:55:14.844
and actions on.

2184
01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:18.570
<v 1>Yeah.
So that's so science,
a proposition about the physical universe.</v>

2185
01:55:18.571 --> 01:55:21.900
We compare it to an ideal standard called scientific verification or something

2186
01:55:21.901 --> 01:55:22.231
like that.

2187
01:55:22.231 --> 01:55:26.560
And more we compare a proposed action to a moral standard or a moral ideal or,

2188
01:55:26.561 --> 01:55:30.510
so that's the one thing we can do that nothing else in the universe that we know

2189
01:55:30.511 --> 01:55:35.250
of seems to be able to do to compare a proposed action.
Like,

2190
01:55:35.251 --> 01:55:38.070
I mean Dad's propose an action,
they all get together and they,
you know,

2191
01:55:38.071 --> 01:55:40.940
they all birds all fly in one direction or another and they,

2192
01:55:41.130 --> 01:55:43.620
but they don't compare it to an ideal.
And this,

2193
01:55:43.621 --> 01:55:48.610
this comparing things to an ideal I think is the fundamental aspect of our free

2194
01:55:48.611 --> 01:55:49.351
wheel that we have.

2195
01:55:49.351 --> 01:55:52.890
And we can either just go through a life and never compare anything that we do

2196
01:55:52.891 --> 01:55:56.670
to some ideal standard or we can say about the important things not,
you know,

2197
01:55:56.850 --> 01:55:57.900
do I have another sip of coffee?

2198
01:55:57.901 --> 01:56:01.560
But the important stuff will we compare that to some ideal standard?

2199
01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:05.850
And now people do this all the time,
right?
I mean,
is this moral,
is this right?

2200
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:08.910
Is this God's will?
Is this with the law?
Is it against the law?

2201
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:13.260
We compare a proposed actions to ideal standards in even in school.

2202
01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:15.630
Do you get a hundred on the test?
That's the ideal standard.

2203
01:56:15.631 --> 01:56:17.130
We had a 50 that's right.
No good.

2204
01:56:17.490 --> 01:56:21.210
So we are constantly comparing things to an ideal standard and I think that is

2205
01:56:21.211 --> 01:56:23.490
really the essence of choice that we have.

2206
01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.100
<v 0>And even if it's not an ideal standard,</v>

2207
01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:29.030
we're being inspired by what we deem to be successful behavior,

2208
01:56:29.031 --> 01:56:33.560
whether it's emotionally successful,
socially successful,
whatever,

2209
01:56:33.561 --> 01:56:35.840
career,
athletics,
whatever it is,
we,

2210
01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:39.350
we gain some sort of inspiration from that.

2211
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:42.890
That also enhances our ability to perform the same actions.

2212
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:47.900
And is that freewill to see?
Is it something else?

2213
01:56:47.901 --> 01:56:49.430
Is it a combination of all those things?

2214
01:56:49.431 --> 01:56:52.330
I think more likely that the argument that there is no freewill,

2215
01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:56.540
I think is a little silly because there is,
but that's not the only thing.

2216
01:56:56.630 --> 01:57:00.560
I think that's what it is.
I think there's a lot going on when it becomes,
when,

2217
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:03.980
when,
when you try to figure out what it is that makes a person to act,

2218
01:57:03.981 --> 01:57:04.814
the way they act,

2219
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:08.540
we could put you in a situation and something could occur with your daughter for

2220
01:57:08.541 --> 01:57:10.490
say and you,
you would be like,
well,

2221
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:14.540
let me explain to you what happened and let me explain to you how I've made the

2222
01:57:14.541 --> 01:57:16.640
same mistakes myself and this is what I learned from it.

2223
01:57:16.670 --> 01:57:19.540
Or You could put a different person in front of a,

2224
01:57:19.541 --> 01:57:22.490
a similar four year old kid and that person's going,
right.

2225
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:26.340
<v 1>What did I tell you?
Get your fucking hands off of that.
Come here.
Sit down.</v>

2226
01:57:26.341 --> 01:57:28.320
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times,

2227
01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:30.110
<v 0>you know,</v>

2228
01:57:30.110 --> 01:57:35.110
what is it that causes one to be you and one to be another person in the same

2229
01:57:35.211 --> 01:57:37.370
scenario with a completely different results?

2230
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:39.500
<v 1>Well,
it's,
no,
it's comparing two ideal standards,
right?</v>

2231
01:57:39.501 --> 01:57:43.880
So in distorted that earlier where I was saying,
my daughter said,
Daddy,

2232
01:57:43.881 --> 01:57:46.160
I contact,
you know,
should we have a standard,

2233
01:57:46.161 --> 01:57:47.930
which is if someone's saying something to you,

2234
01:57:47.931 --> 01:57:50.540
you should really pay attention to them.
That's the standard.
Right?
And I've,

2235
01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:51.890
I've told her about that.
You know,

2236
01:57:51.891 --> 01:57:55.290
like if she's playing on the IPAD and we're trying to have a conversation,
I say,

2237
01:57:55.291 --> 01:57:57.110
can you turn that off while we chat?
Because,
you know,

2238
01:57:57.111 --> 01:57:58.820
I don't want you to be distracted.
She can make,

2239
01:57:58.821 --> 01:58:02.390
so there's a standard that we have.
And then when we deviate from that standard,

2240
01:58:02.391 --> 01:58:05.570
we've tried to realign with that standard.
And I think those are the,

2241
01:58:05.571 --> 01:58:09.140
basically the fundamental choices,
uh,
that we have.
What are your standards?

2242
01:58:09.141 --> 01:58:13.130
So some guys,
like some guys with parenting genuinely believe,

2243
01:58:13.131 --> 01:58:16.520
like every time I put out the facts about spanking,
I just interviewed a doctor,

2244
01:58:16.521 --> 01:58:20.120
Elizabeth Grimshaw for spanking expert,
who's given all the facts.
People always,

2245
01:58:20.150 --> 01:58:21.050
they say,
well,
you know,

2246
01:58:21.051 --> 01:58:23.890
but kids these days are spank glass and they were running wild and they're

2247
01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:27.150
having lipstick parties and they're,
you know,
hooking up and they have no more.

2248
01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:29.630
So they genuinely believe,
what if I don't hit my kids,

2249
01:58:29.631 --> 01:58:30.950
it's going to be really bad.

2250
01:58:30.951 --> 01:58:35.760
And I think that our futures are fundamentally written by our deepest values by

2251
01:58:35.761 --> 01:58:40.460
by that which we consider the good,
uh,
what your values are.
Your virtues are,

2252
01:58:40.461 --> 01:58:42.280
will be your future,
like a train track.

2253
01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:47.760
Now we can't change the effects of our ethics,

2254
01:58:47.891 --> 01:58:51.610
but we can decide which are valid or invalid ethics.
So I make the case that,

2255
01:58:51.611 --> 01:58:54.250
you know,
don't hit your kids.
Non Aggression,
principle reasoning,

2256
01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:56.950
better parenting,
better child development,
all the science behind it.

2257
01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:58.630
You're a kid's Iq will be better.

2258
01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:01.150
That behavior would be better than social skills will be better,

2259
01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:03.940
there'll be more peaceful and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I make that case.

2260
01:59:03.941 --> 01:59:07.450
I change people's minds about that.
Like tens of thousands of of parents,

2261
01:59:07.451 --> 01:59:10.540
probably hundreds of thousands by now start spanking as a result of the work

2262
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:13.360
that I do and there's tons of people have to do in the same work.

2263
01:59:13.361 --> 01:59:17.410
We give people better ideals then it's like the,
the wind changes with a boat.

2264
01:59:17.411 --> 01:59:19.590
It just,
they'll,
they'll turn that way.
The,

2265
01:59:19.730 --> 01:59:24.220
the capacity to evaluate new information and have it change our ideals I think

2266
01:59:24.221 --> 01:59:27.400
is the fundamental essence of that.
Uh,
of free will.

2267
01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.710
We can either choose to ignore that information,

2268
01:59:29.711 --> 01:59:31.900
in which case we're just going to keep doing the same thing as history,

2269
01:59:31.901 --> 01:59:34.330
like a hamster wheel,
a revolving door of history.

2270
01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:38.140
Or we can evaluate new information and change our behavior according to some new

2271
01:59:38.141 --> 01:59:40.660
ideal.
That I think is the only choice we have.

2272
01:59:40.690 --> 01:59:44.830
The people who argue against freewill only ever argue with people,

2273
01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:47.800
which is really interesting when you think about it cause they say people are

2274
01:59:47.801 --> 01:59:51.280
fundamentally indistinguishable from other complex systems like the weather.

2275
01:59:52.030 --> 01:59:54.820
But you never see somebody arguing with the weather.

2276
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:58.610
You only ever see people debating or arguing with people.

2277
01:59:58.611 --> 02:00:01.690
Like had a guy call into my show recently who was telling me that he said,
Steph,

2278
02:00:01.691 --> 02:00:04.570
you're just like a computer.
And I said,
okay,
well why don't you here,

2279
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:07.960
here's my computer.
You can continue the debate with the computer.

2280
02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:10.240
And he didn't understand what I was talking about.
He said,

2281
02:00:10.241 --> 02:00:13.300
I'm not going to talk to your computer.
I said,
so you only want to talk to me,

2282
02:00:13.330 --> 02:00:15.830
not the computer.
And he said,
well,
the computer doesn't understand.

2283
02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:19.660
I've got voice recognition.
I'll turn it on.
Go ahead.
Right.
And I said,

2284
02:00:19.661 --> 02:00:21.970
so you don't want to debate with the computer only with me.

2285
02:00:21.971 --> 02:00:26.710
So you're saying there's something different about me versus the computer and

2286
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:30.310
have you ever yelled at the rain to stop raining or to change the winds

2287
02:00:30.311 --> 02:00:33.970
direction if it's wind is blowing the wrong way.
He said,
no,
of course not.

2288
02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:34.811
And I said,

2289
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:37.900
so you cannot say that people are just like everything else in the universe.

2290
02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:40.480
If you will only ever debate people,

2291
02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:44.290
you have to accept that there's something fundamentally different with people if

2292
02:00:44.291 --> 02:00:46.750
you will never debate anything else that you compare people to.

2293
02:00:47.170 --> 02:00:51.370
And that's the challenge of the deterministic argument.
We are just physics.

2294
02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:55.780
Everything has an antecedent cause.
But you only ever debate with human beings.

2295
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:58.640
<v 3>That's a strange argument.
I don't understand where you're going with that.</v>

2296
02:00:58.641 --> 02:01:01.610
Of course,
because human beings are the only ones that debate back.

2297
02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:05.000
The whole idea of a debate is you talk and they talk and you different opinions,

2298
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.170
right?

2299
02:01:05.170 --> 02:01:06.460
<v 1>They say that,
that you,</v>

2300
02:01:06.490 --> 02:01:09.220
you debate back like two television sets pointed at each other.

2301
02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:11.950
It's all pre scripted.
There's nothing the new that can come in.

2302
02:01:11.951 --> 02:01:14.080
Everything has a prior course based on physics.

2303
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:17.230
<v 3>That's what people who believe that there is no freewill site.</v>

2304
02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.040
That's what you're saying.
Yeah.
Um,
but I don't debate with the TV.

2305
02:01:20.041 --> 02:01:21.900
I know that the TV is going to,
you know,

2306
02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:23.950
I mean there are idiots who yell at movies,
you know,

2307
02:01:23.951 --> 02:01:26.550
but they don't demand it's going to chain bait in and of itself.

2308
02:01:26.610 --> 02:01:30.920
Isn't that that whole debate,
just an exchange of information and exchange in,

2309
02:01:30.970 --> 02:01:33.020
in a controlled system in order to humane,

2310
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:35.790
but it was someone to change their mind.
Right.
Well,

2311
02:01:35.791 --> 02:01:40.190
I think ultimately all human beings are trying accelerate

2312
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:44.120
<v 0>growth.
Uh,
whether it's financial growth,
intellectual growth,</v>

2313
02:01:44.121 --> 02:01:45.560
technological innovation.

2314
02:01:45.561 --> 02:01:48.560
I think we're constantly trying to grow and expand things.

2315
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:51.440
We also fundamentally know that we are imperfect.

2316
02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:56.510
So we will either argue our position or try to learn,
uh,
one of those two things.

2317
02:01:56.511 --> 02:02:00.080
Either try to reinforce ourselves on our own decisions as opposed to your

2318
02:02:00.081 --> 02:02:04.730
decisions.
Jesus is the Lord and you are incorrect,
sir,
with your Satan,

2319
02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:07.910
Satan St and song that you teach to your daughter.
You know,
what is that about?

2320
02:02:07.911 --> 02:02:12.170
Well,
that is about two,
two organisms inside of a system,
uh,

2321
02:02:12.171 --> 02:02:17.000
that agree upon a of a dictionary,
no vocabulary and definitions for things.

2322
02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:19.760
And they're arguing about whose path is a better path.

2323
02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:22.130
But ultimately all of them are trying to be better.

2324
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:27.430
All of them are trying to improve and there's no real set guidelines for how to

2325
02:02:28.581 --> 02:02:29.960
live correctly.
There's no,

2326
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:34.160
no one can really prove to you that it's better to be an atheist than it is to

2327
02:02:34.161 --> 02:02:37.550
be a Christian or it's better to be a person who likes to exercise and has to be

2328
02:02:37.551 --> 02:02:38.660
a guy who sits on the couch.

2329
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:42.170
You sort of have to figure it all out from it for yourself.
And along the way,

2330
02:02:42.171 --> 02:02:47.171
you want to justify your own actions and your own decisions by arguing and by,

2331
02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:49.280
by trying to debate.

2332
02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.750
So in a sense like saying that humans only argue with humans,

2333
02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:56.990
that doesn't really negate the idea that there is no free will.

2334
02:02:56.991 --> 02:03:01.070
In fact it might actually support it by showing the whole thing is just a system

2335
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:03.080
and it is just a mathematical algorithm.

2336
02:03:03.081 --> 02:03:06.080
And inside that algorithm is a thing called ego.

2337
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:10.340
And Ego is the thing that wants you to be correct and wants you to learn and

2338
02:03:10.341 --> 02:03:11.270
wants you to improve.

2339
02:03:11.271 --> 02:03:15.140
And once you also to assert dominance and perhaps sexual preference over those

2340
02:03:15.141 --> 02:03:19.070
around you by showing how clever you can turn a phrase and how easily you can

2341
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:22.640
diffuse someone and make them look foolish in front of the rest of the group.

2342
02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:23.690
You know,

2343
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:27.620
all these things are perhaps just more evidence that there is no free will.

2344
02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.350
I mean obviously playing devil's advocate a bit here,

2345
02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:33.140
but I think inside that controlled system,

2346
02:03:33.141 --> 02:03:36.080
I think it is possible that that could be,
that could be an argument.

2347
02:03:37.330 --> 02:03:41.350
<v 1>Let's go cause you,
you said something that
it's really,</v>

2348
02:03:41.351 --> 02:03:43.690
really important that that I would like to challenge.
Okay,

2349
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:45.160
maybe it's successful or not,

2350
02:03:45.161 --> 02:03:48.700
but you said nobody can say whether it's better to believe in a day that you're

2351
02:03:48.701 --> 02:03:50.100
not believing a dainty and so on.
Right.

2352
02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:53.440
What I mean by that is that you can't tell someone who is happy being a

2353
02:03:53.441 --> 02:03:57.030
Christian,
that it's better to be an atheist.
They're not going to look.

2354
02:03:57.130 --> 02:04:00.340
I certainly can't say that you'll be happier being an atheist.
Right.

2355
02:04:00.341 --> 02:04:02.080
Because let's say that they're going to atheist atheism,

2356
02:04:02.081 --> 02:04:04.510
it's going to cause problems in their family relationships.

2357
02:04:04.511 --> 02:04:06.040
It's going to cause problems in their community.

2358
02:04:06.041 --> 02:04:08.860
It's going to cause problems in their church and then they get hit by a bus and

2359
02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.810
they die.
Unhappy.
I have friend alone

2360
02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:12.480
<v 0>Mormon,
sorry to interrupt you.
Yeah.</v>

2361
02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:15.810
I have friends who are Mormons for the longest time and then in their forties

2362
02:04:15.811 --> 02:04:18.360
they abandoned it rough.
They are.
They are

2363
02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:20.160
<v 1>Penn Jillette writes about that actually.
Yeah.</v>

2364
02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:23.700
And in his most recent book about meeting up with a bunch of Mormons and and how

2365
02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:26.580
they become atheist and just a lot of it from his work.
Yeah.

2366
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:29.210
<v 0>Out of his from his,
he's a great guy.</v>

2367
02:04:29.211 --> 02:04:34.211
He's very logical and very smart and a lot of his questions and his,

2368
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:38.730
his discussions on these things have caused introspective thought and people

2369
02:04:38.731 --> 02:04:42.630
that perhaps would have just gone along with the program if it wasn't for guy

2370
02:04:42.631 --> 02:04:44.820
like Penn.
Yeah,
I think it's very interesting.

2371
02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:46.470
<v 1>But I,
I would make the case.</v>

2372
02:04:46.471 --> 02:04:51.471
So a Nietzschean the 19th century sure sort of philosopher is sort of guy who

2373
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:54.300
wrote great aphorisms,

2374
02:04:54.301 --> 02:04:59.301
but he said that that Socrates basic argument was reason equals virtue equals

2375
02:04:59.371 --> 02:05:03.240
happiness,
right?
So if you want to be happy,
you have to be virtuous.
How do you,

2376
02:05:03.241 --> 02:05:06.540
how are you virtuous?
You have to have con consistent principles,

2377
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:07.920
consistent principles.

2378
02:05:08.190 --> 02:05:13.190
And there's some support in psychology for this in that if you have opposing

2379
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:15.510
ideas within your own mind,

2380
02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:20.820
or if you have feelings that say one thing but your intellect says another,
uh,

2381
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:25.150
then you are going to be unhappy.
Or another way of putting it,
it says,
say that,

2382
02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:25.261
uh,

2383
02:05:25.261 --> 02:05:30.261
all psychological dysfunction results from a unacknowledged suffering.

2384
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:34.920
Um,
and so for instance,
like,
so some people,
you know,
they,

2385
02:05:34.930 --> 02:05:38.400
they're beaten up by their parents but they're told by their church honor thy

2386
02:05:38.401 --> 02:05:40.530
mother and their father.
So they've got this idea,

2387
02:05:40.531 --> 02:05:42.480
this ideal honor thy mother and their father,

2388
02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:46.890
but they have an emotional response of outrage at having been abused or

2389
02:05:46.891 --> 02:05:50.340
neglected or,
or whatever.
These are contradictions.

2390
02:05:50.341 --> 02:05:52.670
You've got an ideal that tells you one thing in your heart and your,

2391
02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:56.580
your monkey spleen telling you something else that if you aggress against an

2392
02:05:56.581 --> 02:06:00.300
animal,
it's going to react in a negative or hostile way.

2393
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:04.430
And so when you have contradictions in your mind,
uh,

2394
02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:08.520
that is going to produce dysfunction in your life and happiness in your life.

2395
02:06:08.521 --> 02:06:12.270
And so one of the purposes of philosophy is to say,
okay,

2396
02:06:12.271 --> 02:06:13.590
we've got some basic principles.

2397
02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:17.430
Let's keep rolling them forward and try and live as consistently as possible.

2398
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.610
Like if we used opposite words for things,

2399
02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:23.310
half the time it would be impossible to communicate.

2400
02:06:23.311 --> 02:06:26.880
We have to have consistency in our language to a large degree,
not perfectly.

2401
02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:30.390
Of course we have to have consistency in our language to be good at

2402
02:06:30.391 --> 02:06:33.930
communicating,
to have any possibility of communicating effectively.

2403
02:06:35.010 --> 02:06:39.450
And the degree to which we can have consistency in our thinking.

2404
02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:42.420
In other words,
we don't have contradictions.
We don't have a value here.

2405
02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:45.720
Like don't hit your wife and then a value here which says,
hit your children,

2406
02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:49.050
that that's going to produce contradictions in suffering and problems.

2407
02:06:49.410 --> 02:06:52.020
And so the more consistent your thinking is,

2408
02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:56.880
the greater chance you have to be happy.
Uh,
and in the same way,

2409
02:06:56.881 --> 02:07:00.960
like if you have a consistent methodology for examining the universe like

2410
02:07:00.961 --> 02:07:01.740
science,

2411
02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:05.580
you're going to get a lot further than reading chicken end trails or praying to

2412
02:07:05.581 --> 02:07:06.630
some nonexistent data.

2413
02:07:06.631 --> 02:07:10.200
You're actually going to have a way of organizing your knowledge about the world

2414
02:07:10.201 --> 02:07:13.680
to create computers and rocket ships and cars and all that kind of stuff.

2415
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:17.250
And so the idea is that the more consistent you are thinking,

2416
02:07:17.251 --> 02:07:19.830
the greater chance you have for happiness.
Now,

2417
02:07:19.831 --> 02:07:22.680
that doesn't always mean that you'll achieve it because it's good.

2418
02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:25.530
<v 0>Went though the way you're saying it,
the greater chance you'll have for him.</v>

2419
02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:29.590
<v 1>Yes,
I can.
Nobody,
nobody can guarantee anyone happiness,
right?
And,
and in fact,</v>

2420
02:07:29.770 --> 02:07:34.120
if you've grown up in an irrational culture and culture is sort of by definition

2421
02:07:34.121 --> 02:07:37.650
is irrational.
If it's not culture,
it's science or,

2422
02:07:37.651 --> 02:07:39.880
or math or logic or something like that,

2423
02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.480
then when you achieve the goal of reason,

2424
02:07:43.481 --> 02:07:45.670
then you start working out your beliefs from first principles.

2425
02:07:45.671 --> 02:07:49.950
And being good at philosophy puts you in a lot of conflict with,
uh,

2426
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:53.320
with people around you.
And of course,
a lot of power structure is fundamentally,

2427
02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:58.620
I think live or feed off an unacknowledged contradictions,

2428
02:07:58.841 --> 02:08:03.730
right?
So for me to,
to use force to take someone else's property is theft,

2429
02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:06.730
uh,
for the government to do what is called taxation and considered a virtue.

2430
02:08:06.731 --> 02:08:11.560
So there's all these contradictions in definitions that we have.
Uh,
we hit wives,

2431
02:08:11.561 --> 02:08:13.570
it's called the abuse.
We hit children,
it's called discipline.

2432
02:08:13.571 --> 02:08:17.290
We just redefine things all the time based upon emotional preferences and prior

2433
02:08:17.291 --> 02:08:20.380
trauma.
And the,
what philosophy does is it says,
well,

2434
02:08:20.381 --> 02:08:21.670
we've got to resolve this stuff.

2435
02:08:21.671 --> 02:08:25.330
We can't just have these little beliefs floating around unattached to each
other.

2436
02:08:25.331 --> 02:08:29.500
We need a consistent way of organizing our minds and our values and our

2437
02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:30.820
decisions and all of that stuff.

2438
02:08:30.821 --> 02:08:33.670
And we can't just make up different values based on the circumstances.

2439
02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:38.980
With the idea being that the more consistent you are,
the happier you'll be.

2440
02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:42.470
<v 0>I definitely think that the last contradiction you have in your mind,
the,</v>

2441
02:08:42.471 --> 02:08:43.510
the happier you'll be.

2442
02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:47.980
And it's really hard for a lot of people to eliminate contradiction because

2443
02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.800
they've made so many rationalizations about their actions.

2444
02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:54.580
It made so many rationalizations has at the past in order to shield themselves

2445
02:08:54.581 --> 02:08:59.530
from the staying of the,
that corrective,
the need to correct behavior,

2446
02:08:59.531 --> 02:09:01.540
need to correct some of the things that you've done,

2447
02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:04.810
that staying is very difficult for a lot of people to deal with.
So they,

2448
02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:09.430
they justify,
oh,
they all argue louder,
you know,
to try to,

2449
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:10.710
<v 1>that's,
you know,</v>

2450
02:09:10.711 --> 02:09:14.340
I've got a whole series on youtube called the bomb and the brain,
uh,
which is,
um,

2451
02:09:14.490 --> 02:09:17.580
I don't mean to,
it's FDR,
url.com,
forward slash bib.

2452
02:09:18.330 --> 02:09:20.550
There's huge amount of science that,

2453
02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:24.000
that really establish how people argue.

2454
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:29.510
How people argue is you get an emotional trigger like right deep down in your,

2455
02:09:30.061 --> 02:09:31.200
the base of your brain,
right?

2456
02:09:31.201 --> 02:09:33.990
Like where we don't know anything about civilization.

2457
02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:37.230
Right down in the base of our brain,
you get a fight or flight response.

2458
02:09:37.231 --> 02:09:42.231
And what happens then is you come up with a justification for it afterwards.

2459
02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:44.970
It's called ex post facto justification.

2460
02:09:44.971 --> 02:09:47.250
Right after the fact you have an emotional response.

2461
02:09:47.251 --> 02:09:50.220
And then people come up with some frankly bullshit,

2462
02:09:50.221 --> 02:09:54.330
some polysyllabic bullshit to justify their emotional reaction.

2463
02:09:54.690 --> 02:09:57.210
And they've actually done studies,
amazing stuff where

2464
02:09:58.830 --> 02:10:02.670
they give people a moral position and they say,
do you believe in this?

2465
02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:06.330
And then people say yes and they will give you great arguments as to why.

2466
02:10:06.630 --> 02:10:09.090
And then they say,
close the book,
I want to ask you something else.

2467
02:10:09.450 --> 02:10:13.470
And then the book has some special glue thing and when they open it up,

2468
02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:14.880
it's the opposite moral position.

2469
02:10:14.881 --> 02:10:17.490
And they ask people to reread that statement and defend it.

2470
02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:19.453
<v 0>Wow.</v>

2471
02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:22.400
<v 1>Right?
So it says,
I oppose abortion.
And people say,
well,</v>

2472
02:10:22.401 --> 02:10:24.530
here's all the reasons I oppose abortion.
They close the book,

2473
02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:26.960
they talk to them about something else for 50 minutes they say,

2474
02:10:27.230 --> 02:10:30.080
uh Oh we didn't get the recording right.
Can you open it?
And then it says,

2475
02:10:30.081 --> 02:10:34.040
now I oppose abortion.
And the majority of people,
like thirds of people

2476
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.760
<v 3>will give you great arguments for both and not notice the contrast.</v>

2477
02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:42.820
That seems to be the key to experiencing this fight or flight feeling in the

2478
02:10:42.981 --> 02:10:46.760
middle of an argument is being completely attached or having your ego attached

2479
02:10:46.761 --> 02:10:48.410
to ideas or a position.

2480
02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.800
If you are not and you treat it as an intellectual puzzle that you can both

2481
02:10:51.801 --> 02:10:54.770
solve together,
then that stuff doesn't exist.

2482
02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:58.430
I've had some really fascinating disagreements with very close friends where

2483
02:10:58.431 --> 02:11:02.300
we've managed to keep it completely civil but yet explored some really

2484
02:11:02.301 --> 02:11:03.134
interesting topics.

2485
02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:06.020
But then I've also been involved in conversations with people where they get

2486
02:11:06.021 --> 02:11:09.120
really insulting like almost immediately if they disagree with you.
Yeah.

2487
02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:13.360
Like I had an argument with a dude about recent findings in,
in uh,

2488
02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:17.200
about the Yeti.
You know,
they,
they've found that there is a,

2489
02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:20.180
this thing that they thought was a Yeti,
uh,

2490
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:24.830
may very well be an ancient bear or at least the DNA from an ancient bear.

2491
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:28.650
We have a theme,
you know that,
right?
It's like a bear show.
The bare shots fair.

2492
02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:31.190
And because like bears,
I know we're going to walk out of this room.

2493
02:11:31.191 --> 02:11:32.420
It just be mauled.
I did some,

2494
02:11:32.421 --> 02:11:35.630
some freak escaped from the zoo thing and this is going to be hugely ironic

2495
02:11:35.631 --> 02:11:36.070
podcasts.

2496
02:11:36.070 --> 02:11:41.070
What was fascinating to me in the middle of this heated argument was not that

2497
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:44.630
this guy disagreed with my,
my thoughts that uh,

2498
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:48.560
this whole thing was probably a big misunderstanding.

2499
02:11:48.561 --> 02:11:50.440
And there's probably some strange looking bear it looks like,

2500
02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:55.520
but it was how aggressive like someone would get about a fucking Yeti.

2501
02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:00.540
Like you're raising your voice and you're getting shitty in real snipey and like

2502
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:03.890
this is not the way you should get ever with your friends.

2503
02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:06.440
And you're getting this over a fucking Yeti.
Yeah.

2504
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:10.250
If it's over the ethics of violence or something that's at least an important

2505
02:12:10.251 --> 02:12:13.850
topic.
But whether there's big foot or not.
Well,
not only that,
it was,
oh man,

2506
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:15.740
it was over a fucking DNA evidence.
I mean,

2507
02:12:15.741 --> 02:12:18.200
this is all pretty straightforward stuff.
Like,
you know,

2508
02:12:18.201 --> 02:12:22.550
they've found that there's some,
some what they thought was extinct,

2509
02:12:22.551 --> 02:12:25.550
polar bear,
some hybrid type of polar bear.
This,

2510
02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:30.020
they thought it was extinct for 40,000 plus years and they've got DNA that came

2511
02:12:30.021 --> 02:12:32.690
from something that was killed a long time ago,
probably,

2512
02:12:32.691 --> 02:12:35.210
I think it was in 1900 or something.
And they say,
oh,
well this,

2513
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:38.300
this thing matches up with this,
this DNA,

2514
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:41.060
what we might be dealing with when these people were seeing Yeti's.

2515
02:12:41.061 --> 02:12:44.030
It's actually just polar bears.
Right.
You know,
it's really simple,
right?

2516
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:48.020
It's just an idea and it's just,
I don't,
I didn't do the fucking research.

2517
02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:52.040
He didn't do the fucking research.
So like getting upset about it.
It's so weird.

2518
02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:55.670
But,
but that's what it is.
It's,
it triggers that fight or flight thing.

2519
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:59.540
And then once they realize they're in some sort of a debate and perhaps they

2520
02:12:59.541 --> 02:13:01.670
don't engage in enough competition,

2521
02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:06.320
perhaps they don't engage enough athletic endeavors where they strain their body

2522
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:08.760
and get rid of some of that fucking monkey shoes.

2523
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:11.750
It used to failure and he used to losing.
That's another thing that's,

2524
02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:16.580
it's some people do not like to lose at anything.
Like they won't even,

2525
02:13:16.670 --> 02:13:19.910
they won't bowl because if they lose,
they get sick.
You know,
they,

2526
02:13:19.911 --> 02:13:23.720
they won't play checkers.
They won't do anything.
But that's,
I mean it's crazy.

2527
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:27.230
Isn't that always just childhood stuff Joe?
I mean this is that just people,

2528
02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:27.651
you know,

2529
02:13:27.651 --> 02:13:30.260
they don't like to admit that they're wrong because whenever they would admit

2530
02:13:30.261 --> 02:13:32.600
that they're wrong,
there would be mocked or humiliated

2531
02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:37.560
<v 1>that happens in school all the time.
Like I had a guy in a friend of mine,
uh,
in,</v>

2532
02:13:37.561 --> 02:13:38.580
in junior high school,

2533
02:13:38.581 --> 02:13:43.470
we were in science class and he used the word orgasm instead of organism.

2534
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:46.440
I don't even remember the sentence,

2535
02:13:46.441 --> 02:13:49.710
which is a shame cause I bet you it was a really great sentence because anytime

2536
02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:53.910
you put the word orgasm into a sentence inadvertently,
it's funny.
Yeah,

2537
02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:58.140
I think it's premature elaboration is the phrase.
But anytime you did that,

2538
02:13:58.141 --> 02:14:01.950
it's funny.
But literally for the whole year he was the calm guy.

2539
02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:04.620
Like he was,
he was the orgasm guy.

2540
02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:08.790
And it's like how comfortable do you feel making stupid mistakes like that?

2541
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:10.710
If that is the environment that you're in,

2542
02:14:10.711 --> 02:14:14.130
then you're just not going to like families will so often stereotype people.

2543
02:14:14.131 --> 02:14:17.700
Like you drop three plates and then for the next 50 years you're the clumsy one.

2544
02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:19.980
You know?
And then you become paranoid about all this kind of stuff.

2545
02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.520
<v 0>Yes.
And it becomes something that's in the forefront of your mind.</v>

2546
02:14:22.521 --> 02:14:23.354
Don't drop the plates

2547
02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:27.200
and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because then people don't

2548
02:14:27.201 --> 02:14:29.330
remember the million times you carried a plate successfully,

2549
02:14:29.331 --> 02:14:31.190
but 20 years later you drop a plate.
It's like,

2550
02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:33.270
oh well he's the clumsy one and people hate beast.

2551
02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:36.680
I hate being stereotyped like that.
And if you carry that idea in your head,

2552
02:14:36.710 --> 02:14:40.470
it does create weight and it gets momentum behind it.
It's with everything.

2553
02:14:40.471 --> 02:14:43.070
Like if you're playing basketball,
don't miss a shot.
Don't miss your shot.

2554
02:14:43.071 --> 02:14:44.960
What are you thinking about?
You thinking about missing the shot?

2555
02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:46.340
You don't even think about making it.

2556
02:14:46.341 --> 02:14:48.560
You're thinking about missing it more than you thinking about making it.

2557
02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:51.680
You're feeling the failure already before you even attempted it,

2558
02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:54.830
because it's become a predominant pattern in your way of thinking.

2559
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:59.580
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
I wouldn't,
I mean,
I'd love to know,
you know,</v>

2560
02:14:59.581 --> 02:15:00.960
like the twins experiments that someone,

2561
02:15:00.961 --> 02:15:05.580
I would love to know which parts of me are me and which part of media or

2562
02:15:05.581 --> 02:15:09.840
environment or which part of me of genetics,
like put me somewhere else.
I know.

2563
02:15:09.841 --> 02:15:11.070
I mean,
that'd be fascinating

2564
02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:13.070
<v 0>because,
but it's not,
I mean,</v>

2565
02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:18.370
you are a series of events that have taken place over 46 years of life and 24

2566
02:15:19.521 --> 02:15:24.170
hours in a day and 365 days in a year and just blah so much.

2567
02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:25.610
There's so many calculations.

2568
02:15:25.611 --> 02:15:30.270
And here's the interesting question to you because you predominantly,
uh,

2569
02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:31.910
ply your trade on the Internet,

2570
02:15:32.150 --> 02:15:36.680
how much of an impact has the Internet had on who you are as a person?

2571
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:40.190
Just the,
the free flowing of information over the last 20 years.

2572
02:15:40.191 --> 02:15:44.000
Since we're the same age.
Thinking of nine 94 ish.
Yeah.
Where,

2573
02:15:44.001 --> 02:15:47.360
where it really popped out.
How much of an impact has it had on you?

2574
02:15:47.710 --> 02:15:51.670
<v 1>Oh,
it's,
it's
big.</v>

2575
02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:55.060
I know it is.
It is.
If I were to look at,

2576
02:15:55.061 --> 02:16:00.010
I mean other than learning how to read it,
it's the biggest influence and impact.

2577
02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:00.281
I mean,

2578
02:16:00.281 --> 02:16:04.730
I'm only able to do what I do because of the Internet because the gatekeepers

2579
02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:07.690
are gone.
Like we can talk to people without gatekeepers.

2580
02:16:07.691 --> 02:16:12.250
That is like the last time this happened in in such a fundamental way was like

2581
02:16:12.251 --> 02:16:17.251
in the 16th century when Martin Luther translated the Bible from Latin to the

2582
02:16:17.621 --> 02:16:21.280
vernacular and then people got to get their hands on the Bible verse before it

2583
02:16:21.281 --> 02:16:24.400
was all done in in Latin and nobody knew what the hell was going on other than

2584
02:16:24.401 --> 02:16:28.210
like the priest told them they got a hold of the Bible and basically the tax

2585
02:16:28.211 --> 02:16:31.180
could speak directly to people and didn't have to go through gatekeepers
anymore.

2586
02:16:31.450 --> 02:16:33.940
The unfortunate result of that was a couple of hundred years of religious

2587
02:16:33.941 --> 02:16:34.421
warfare,

2588
02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:37.420
which then again culminated in a separation of church and state because they

2589
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:41.260
just were killing each other and Lutherism and Lutheranism ends when gay elitism

2590
02:16:41.261 --> 02:16:44.890
and Calvinism and Anabaptism and all that kind of stuff and a baptism where you

2591
02:16:44.891 --> 02:16:46.180
have to have an adult baptism.

2592
02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.220
Do you know how they did dealt with this in Germany?
Oh,

2593
02:16:48.270 --> 02:16:51.880
you're an Anabaptist will drown you because you just into adult baptism.

2594
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:52.900
I mean it was just brutal.

2595
02:16:52.930 --> 02:16:56.260
One of the reasons that the Nazis had such power was the Germany missed the

2596
02:16:56.261 --> 02:16:59.560
whole enlightenment because they were just so embroiled in religious warfare.

2597
02:16:59.590 --> 02:17:03.670
I mean there's travelers who went through Germany in the 17th and 18th century

2598
02:17:03.671 --> 02:17:04.001
and said,

2599
02:17:04.001 --> 02:17:08.560
you could barely see a tree without the fruit of a hanging person on it.
I mean,

2600
02:17:08.561 --> 02:17:12.490
it was that insanely violent society based upon religious dogma.

2601
02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:15.130
And so they,
they not system.

2602
02:17:15.131 --> 02:17:18.280
It's like this weird medieval isn't that made it through the renaissance and the

2603
02:17:18.281 --> 02:17:20.850
enlightenment in Germany.
Uh,
and,

2604
02:17:20.851 --> 02:17:24.610
and then had the power of the 20th 20th century technology with all the

2605
02:17:24.611 --> 02:17:29.220
brutality of a medieval parenting and,
and uh,
brutalities.

2606
02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:32.250
So anyway,
a lot of the strict discipline as well for the,

2607
02:17:32.310 --> 02:17:34.270
the military discipline,
the goose stepping,

2608
02:17:34.271 --> 02:17:36.550
all that came from Oh and hit the screaming.

2609
02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.530
Alice Miller has written great stuff about this.
Like a Hitler was,

2610
02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:44.380
was beaten so badly.
He actually went into a coma at once.

2611
02:17:44.470 --> 02:17:48.640
He was beaten so badly and was,
I mean he was just so,
and the kids,

2612
02:17:48.641 --> 02:17:52.510
they would hang their babies on hooks in,
in swift,

2613
02:17:52.511 --> 02:17:54.730
in bandages that often would have licensed them.

2614
02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:57.100
Then the lights would crawl all over the baby's skin and lay eggs.

2615
02:17:57.310 --> 02:18:00.790
And so when he referred to the Jews as Lyse,
it,

2616
02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:04.240
it connected with something so primal in the German psyche.

2617
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:08.000
And I tell you this though,
the Germans learned an incredible lesson from that.

2618
02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:12.400
My mom is German and when I grew up,
my cousins would come to visit from Germany.

2619
02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:15.550
And of course we were idiot warmonger British boys.

2620
02:18:15.551 --> 02:18:18.940
Cause you know we won the war,
right?
Which meant we lost to socialism,
but we,

2621
02:18:19.170 --> 02:18:23.200
we won the war.
And so we were all playing word games.
And my German friends,

2622
02:18:23.710 --> 02:18:25.630
cousins would come over and they'd say,
well,

2623
02:18:25.631 --> 02:18:29.410
we were not allowed to play with guns.
We're not allowed to do any of that stuff.

2624
02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.420
Because they did finally get,
you know,

2625
02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.720
I hope we get this book for some other stupid cataclysm on the planet.

2626
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:38.020
They finally got that they needed to change their parenting if they didn't want

2627
02:18:38.050 --> 02:18:39.880
this crazy stuff to continue.

2628
02:18:39.881 --> 02:18:43.090
There's a book I'm reading as an audio book by Lloyd demoss called the origins

2629
02:18:43.091 --> 02:18:46.230
of war in child abuse.
It's actually available for free,
uh,

2630
02:18:46.390 --> 02:18:49.150
freedom and radio.com where he says,
basically,

2631
02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.890
if you want to know where war comes from,
a,

2632
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:55.960
you have to focus on child abuse status,
where all of this stuff gets laid in a,

2633
02:18:55.980 --> 02:18:58.960
and this is,
you can,
they've done a huge number of studies.

2634
02:18:58.961 --> 02:19:01.720
Robin grills written a book called parenting for a peaceful world where he

2635
02:19:01.721 --> 02:19:02.920
traces,
you know,

2636
02:19:02.921 --> 02:19:07.620
you can tell how quickly a democracy comes to a country by how the prevalence

2637
02:19:07.621 --> 02:19:08.830
banking is.
I mean,

2638
02:19:08.831 --> 02:19:12.920
there's incredible things like all politics to me is an effect of,

2639
02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.330
of early family experiences of early childhood experiences.

2640
02:19:16.331 --> 02:19:20.410
And to try and understand how hierarchies can exist without looking at early

2641
02:19:20.411 --> 02:19:24.280
childhood experiences is impossible.
It's like trying to,

2642
02:19:24.281 --> 02:19:26.920
to run the solar system model without putting the sign in the middle.

2643
02:19:26.921 --> 02:19:31.160
It gets ridiculously complicated and,
and,
and so on.
So,
um,
yeah.

2644
02:19:31.161 --> 02:19:34.310
So I think that's one of the reasons why I continue to focus on this.

2645
02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:37.080
You started with the question about the Internet and it did,

2646
02:19:37.090 --> 02:19:41.450
it's being able to talk directly to people without gatekeepers is an incredible

2647
02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:45.440
experience.
Uh,
and,
and,
and is the greatest leap forward I think,
in,

2648
02:19:45.441 --> 02:19:50.020
in human communication and,
and the possibility of,
of virtue I think is,

2649
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:52.280
is unbelievably enhanced by this.

2650
02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:55.350
<v 0>I agree with you.
And A,
I also agree with you that I,</v>

2651
02:19:55.580 --> 02:20:00.370
I am unrecognizable to myself of the past because of the Internet.

2652
02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:02.670
And I think my,
my understanding,

2653
02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:05.240
<v 1>tell me,
I mean,
you've got one of the biggest shows around.
I mean,</v>

2654
02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:07.130
that would that have happened without

2655
02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:11.580
<v 0>no,
no,
no.
I mean,
no,
it's impossible.</v>

2656
02:20:11.581 --> 02:20:13.800
It would've never happened.
I would never been able to do this.

2657
02:20:13.801 --> 02:20:15.840
I would have been fired a long time ago.

2658
02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:19.380
There's no way I would've been able to do any of the things that I've done

2659
02:20:19.381 --> 02:20:23.640
online with,
with some sort of accompany backing it and saying,

2660
02:20:23.641 --> 02:20:27.480
this is a good idea.
No one would have said it's a good idea.
No,
no,
no.

2661
02:20:27.481 --> 02:20:30.120
Publicist would have said it's a good idea to say the things that I've said.
No,

2662
02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:34.290
no agent would have advised me to move in that direction.
Wouldn't have happened.

2663
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:36.630
It happened naturally.
It happened on its own.

2664
02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:41.720
But I think that the biggest impact for me is not that I've been able to express

2665
02:20:41.851 --> 02:20:45.340
myself,
but that other people have been able to send me information,

2666
02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:50.310
express themselves to me,
the impact of being able to share information online,

2667
02:20:50.311 --> 02:20:52.080
store even wrong things.

2668
02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:55.770
Like there's a mean that there's a video that went around that it has gotten

2669
02:20:55.771 --> 02:20:57.570
massive traction in the past few days.

2670
02:20:57.571 --> 02:21:01.740
It was a man who was a on the news and didn't know the camera was on,

2671
02:21:01.741 --> 02:21:04.380
didn't know that his microphone was on and he was talking about a missing girl

2672
02:21:04.650 --> 02:21:08.450
and he was saying,
you know that uh,
hey,
if he finds her I would fuck her.

2673
02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:11.220
Fuck her right in her pussy hole.
Like,
but it was fake.

2674
02:21:11.250 --> 02:21:14.550
And then you see the newscaster go,
we're sorry for that unfortunate thing.

2675
02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:18.660
But that newscaster was from a previous thing where a woman didn't know that her

2676
02:21:18.661 --> 02:21:23.250
microphone was on and dropped an f bomb,
just said,
fuck,
oh fuck.
And so I'm sorry,

2677
02:21:23.251 --> 02:21:25.050
ladies and gentlemen,
we're having some editorial.

2678
02:21:25.051 --> 02:21:29.220
We were very sorry that you know,
editing issues.
Very sorry.
You had to hear that.

2679
02:21:29.430 --> 02:21:34.410
Well,
this video has gone viral and it's millions and millions of,
and I don't,

2680
02:21:34.411 --> 02:21:36.150
can't tell you how many people sent it to me on Twitter,

2681
02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:39.000
but we're going a couple of days.
It resolves itself and people realize,
oh,

2682
02:21:39.001 --> 02:21:40.530
it's just bullshit.
Okay,
here we go.

2683
02:21:40.650 --> 02:21:42.190
<v 1>So wait,
how is it fake?
Was it</v>

2684
02:21:42.350 --> 02:21:45.760
<v 0>fake?
It's just an actor.
So I pretended and spliced it in.</v>

2685
02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.940
He put his footage of him saying this horrible thing,

2686
02:21:49.210 --> 02:21:50.860
but it wasn't really a missing girl.

2687
02:21:50.861 --> 02:21:55.550
It was all fake and fake Fox broadcast label and all that shit.

2688
02:21:55.551 --> 02:21:58.320
It gets exposed.
It does get exposed and that's what,

2689
02:21:58.330 --> 02:21:59.860
that's what's unique about the times.

2690
02:21:59.890 --> 02:22:02.920
And it's also that something can just spread.

2691
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:06.670
It just has to be impactful and interesting,
whether good or bad.

2692
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:11.730
<v 1>I mean that's,
it's an incredible thing which is happening in America as well,</v>

2693
02:22:11.731 --> 02:22:16.440
where you can actually see bodies of imperialism,

2694
02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:18.180
right?
Like you,

2695
02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:23.180
you can go online and you can see the bodies of the Iraqis or the bodies of the

2696
02:22:23.191 --> 02:22:27.480
Afghanis or whatever.
That's,
I mean,
you'd never get that through the media.

2697
02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:28.341
<v 0>I mean,
not only that,</v>

2698
02:22:28.341 --> 02:22:31.340
it was made illegal during the Bush administration in the United States.

2699
02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:32.530
She'll show coffins,

2700
02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:37.410
<v 1>coffins,
let alone the victims of the imperialism and the media.
I mean,</v>

2701
02:22:37.411 --> 02:22:41.670
there's no law that says you can't show Iraqi,
uh,
victims of the war,

2702
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:43.920
which there are over a million.
But nonetheless,

2703
02:22:43.921 --> 02:22:45.660
you will not get this through the mainstream media.

2704
02:22:45.661 --> 02:22:48.570
You'll see the pictures of the guys who died,
which is also a great tragedy.

2705
02:22:48.571 --> 02:22:52.150
The American soldiers who've died,
but you can't see this and you,

2706
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:56.850
you can't find out the basic fact that there has been so much radiation damage

2707
02:22:56.851 --> 02:22:59.070
down to the Iraqis,
particularly in Fallujah,

2708
02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:02.160
that up to a third of children are being born with birth defects.

2709
02:23:02.161 --> 02:23:05.520
That people who've gone to study Iraqi cities where these depleted uranium

2710
02:23:05.521 --> 02:23:06.510
shells have been used.

2711
02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:09.930
Say that they've never seen a more genetically compromised,

2712
02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:13.470
genetically ruined population,
the whole world over.

2713
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:18.240
And the fact that this information is available at the click of a button to me

2714
02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:22.560
means that people no longer have the excuse of having been propagandized,

2715
02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:27.210
you know,
some poor bastard who,
who was in a Stalinist Russia,
you know,

2716
02:23:27.211 --> 02:23:31.410
in the 1950s,
you know,
okay,
be a communist or go to the Gulag,
you know,
uh,
that,

2717
02:23:31.411 --> 02:23:32.940
that's your choice.
So he,
he's a communist,

2718
02:23:32.941 --> 02:23:35.910
but you don't say you're a communist by choice,
then it's just like the way you,

2719
02:23:35.911 --> 02:23:37.530
it's like you're in the Hitler youth.
You're a Nazi,

2720
02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:39.450
but you're not a bad kid because you're an Nancy.

2721
02:23:39.451 --> 02:23:42.660
That's just what you have to do a to survive in the culture.

2722
02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:47.790
But now that information is so available,
nobody can claim any more,

2723
02:23:47.791 --> 02:23:50.080
at least in the West that they didn't know.
Uh,

2724
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:54.000
because it's so immediately available to everyone at all times that if you don't

2725
02:23:54.001 --> 02:23:57.450
know now,
it is an act of choice.
It is not the result of propaganda.

2726
02:23:57.690 --> 02:24:01.080
I have a lot more sympathy,
like a woman called in my show the other day.

2727
02:24:01.210 --> 02:24:02.070
Then she said,
you know,

2728
02:24:02.071 --> 02:24:04.500
and my dad beat me and my mom didn't do anything about it.

2729
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:09.510
And a mom grew up under China under Mao and the cultural revolution where people

2730
02:24:09.511 --> 02:24:12.210
were dropping like flies every time they bad at their eyelids wrong.

2731
02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:17.540
As a great story in Salto needs into the Gulag apical Argo where some minor

2732
02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:23.720
party functionary has given a speech and everyone gets up and is applauding and

2733
02:24:23.851 --> 02:24:27.900
they're also terrified of being the first person to stop applauding that they

2734
02:24:27.901 --> 02:24:32.310
just keep applauding and keep applauding until their hands look like hamburgers

2735
02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:34.590
and they can't even like,
it's so incredible,

2736
02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:38.490
but nobody wants to stop because the first person who stops his art a comrade,

2737
02:24:38.491 --> 02:24:40.680
you seem to be less enthused and they're just terrified.

2738
02:24:40.681 --> 02:24:42.780
This is the world that some people live in.

2739
02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:46.170
We don't have that world here in the west and we have access to every kind of

2740
02:24:46.171 --> 02:24:48.960
information,
opposing viewpoints.
You can go on to Al Jazeera,

2741
02:24:48.961 --> 02:24:52.740
you can find out what American imperialism or British imperialism looks like or

2742
02:24:52.741 --> 02:24:56.130
even Canadian imperialism in Afghanistan looks like from the other side.

2743
02:24:56.490 --> 02:25:00.600
So there's a great ripping away of the excuse of propaganda and ignorance and a

2744
02:25:00.601 --> 02:25:03.150
great settling of moral responsibility on people.

2745
02:25:03.630 --> 02:25:04.021
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2746
02:25:04.021 --> 02:25:09.021
it's a very unique time as far as exposing evil and distributing information of

2747
02:25:09.511 --> 02:25:10.890
very,
very unique time.

2748
02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:14.070
I don't think there's ever been anything like it and I think uh,

2749
02:25:14.071 --> 02:25:19.071
you and I are both two perfect examples and also that we can find each other and

2750
02:25:19.081 --> 02:25:24.070
be able to do this.
I mean this what,
what,
what,
how would,
if this,
how would have

2751
02:25:24.310 --> 02:25:28.330
<v 4>our friendship happened?
How would it,
we have had these three hour conversations.</v>

2752
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:31.660
Even if we,
if we didn't have podcasts and we got to meet each other,

2753
02:25:31.661 --> 02:25:36.160
we would have to agree to sit down and talk for three hours and then it's like,

2754
02:25:36.190 --> 02:25:39.040
who would benefit from that?
You and I would certainly benefit from it.

2755
02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:41.700
We would enjoy it,
but no one else would get it.
It's not,

2756
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:44.110
it's not like something that would just get out to millions and millions of

2757
02:25:44.111 --> 02:25:47.830
people like almost instantaneously forever and grow constantly.

2758
02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:49.850
Last show went to number one on iTunes.
Yeah.

2759
02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:52.360
Like I was expecting that to happen cause my rap sucks.

2760
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:56.500
So that's really great that we're doing this cause my music career remains

2761
02:25:56.501 --> 02:25:58.030
stilled in the doldrums.
Yeah.

2762
02:25:58.090 --> 02:26:02.680
But I think that it is an incredible opportunity.
It's like,

2763
02:26:02.890 --> 02:26:04.210
you know,
we've got this,
this,

2764
02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:07.180
I do a lot of talk about bitcoin and stuff like that where we have the

2765
02:26:07.181 --> 02:26:11.260
opportunity to have a currency system not controlled by governments.
You know,

2766
02:26:11.261 --> 02:26:12.130
where there's ways of,

2767
02:26:12.310 --> 02:26:15.550
I mean these things are just unbelievable opportunities for,

2768
02:26:15.551 --> 02:26:19.480
for human communication that doesn't have to go through the prescribed channels

2769
02:26:19.481 --> 02:26:22.900
and the prescribed gatekeepers and ways of exchanging value.
I mean,

2770
02:26:22.901 --> 02:26:26.640
you can have a,
an IPO,
I don't know it in bitcoin.

2771
02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:30.310
You can have an IPO and you can start a company without having to spend $4

2772
02:26:30.310 --> 02:26:32.380
million on,
on,
on,
uh,
the,
the,

2773
02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:35.230
all of the accountants and lawyers that are needed from an IPO in the west.

2774
02:26:35.231 --> 02:26:38.080
I mean the things like that just a incredible,

2775
02:26:38.081 --> 02:26:42.280
because we have got to get faster at getting better as a species because our

2776
02:26:42.281 --> 02:26:44.080
technology is going through the roof.

2777
02:26:44.081 --> 02:26:46.480
Human knowledge is doubling every 18 months.

2778
02:26:46.690 --> 02:26:51.690
Weapons that are inconceivable to to even a generation or two ago are a readily

2779
02:26:52.601 --> 02:26:57.160
available [inaudible] and three d printers and surveillance technologies.
I mean,

2780
02:26:57.220 --> 02:26:59.260
God,
every time we come up with something good,

2781
02:26:59.261 --> 02:27:02.530
the assholes take it and use it against us.
Doesn't that drive you crazy?

2782
02:27:02.531 --> 02:27:05.500
It's like every time you pull out a gun to fight the mugger the Maga dose like

2783
02:27:05.501 --> 02:27:07.170
this and he has the gun,
it's like,
dammit,

2784
02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:11.280
can't we have technology that isn't put to the service of assholes?

2785
02:27:11.290 --> 02:27:15.910
We have to get faster at getting better as a species because our technology is

2786
02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:18.370
increasing to the point where if we don't get better quickly,

2787
02:27:18.371 --> 02:27:21.460
I don't think we're going to have much luck staying free.
Well,
I think we're,

2788
02:27:21.461 --> 02:27:24.310
we are getting better and I think it is,

2789
02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:27.910
we are trying to catch up to this technological capability that we find

2790
02:27:27.911 --> 02:27:31.520
ourselves in right now,
but I think we are.
I really do.
I really,

2791
02:27:31.521 --> 02:27:33.250
I mean it's not just hollow optimism.

2792
02:27:33.251 --> 02:27:35.110
I really do believe that we are getting better.

2793
02:27:35.111 --> 02:27:38.560
I think that we're commenting on the fact that it's not perfect and I think

2794
02:27:38.561 --> 02:27:39.341
everybody is,

2795
02:27:39.341 --> 02:27:43.120
and I think Glenn Greenwald and all of these different Edward Snowden and
others,

2796
02:27:43.121 --> 02:27:46.350
people exposing all of the hypocrisy and government and all the,

2797
02:27:46.810 --> 02:27:51.070
all of that is working towards what ultimately will be a very unique time in

2798
02:27:51.071 --> 02:27:53.020
history when they look back at this time,

2799
02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:57.580
the birth of the Internet will be by far one of the biggest events in the

2800
02:27:57.581 --> 02:28:01.270
history of the human race and we'll look at all these different growing phases

2801
02:28:01.271 --> 02:28:04.330
and all these different challenging events that happen and we won't,

2802
02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:06.850
we won't see it as much because we were a part of it right now,

2803
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:09.010
but I think things are just changing.

2804
02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:12.940
People are more responsible for their actions.
People are more educated,

2805
02:28:12.941 --> 02:28:16.300
information flows far more freely than ever before.
It's happening.

2806
02:28:16.301 --> 02:28:19.420
It's all happening right now.
But I don't know about you.
I mean,

2807
02:28:19.930 --> 02:28:22.130
I know that a lot what you do is about getting

2808
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:23.840
<v 1>information out to people and I think that's great.</v>

2809
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:27.260
I do off of the things that there's a lot of ethics behind what it is that you

2810
02:28:27.261 --> 02:28:30.170
do because it's not like you get a whole bunch of KKK members on here

2811
02:28:30.171 --> 02:28:31.860
proselytizing about white nationalism.

2812
02:28:31.870 --> 02:28:35.390
I think you try to get people with good and useful a few points,

2813
02:28:35.391 --> 02:28:39.440
even if it's just mentally stimulating that promotes virtue as well.
For me,

2814
02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:43.820
I really feel a sense of urgency and I try not to let it,
you know,

2815
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:47.660
make every day like a race against evil or something like that.
But I,
you know,

2816
02:28:47.661 --> 02:28:48.494
the,
the,
the,

2817
02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:52.720
the technology of control and surveillance and all of that is,

2818
02:28:52.721 --> 02:28:56.540
is growing so quickly.
I really do feel like the same medium that is,

2819
02:28:56.541 --> 02:29:00.530
can be capable of so much control and surveillance is also what we're using to

2820
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:04.270
communicate.
I feel quite a strong urgency that it's,

2821
02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:07.290
it's a race of us versus them.
Uh,
and,

2822
02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:11.690
and this is why I have like 3000 shows.
I mean,
it's,
it's lunatic,
right?

2823
02:29:11.691 --> 02:29:15.980
But I really do feel cause remember freedom in radio where quantity is quality,

2824
02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:17.320
but I really,

2825
02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:19.630
<v 0>well,
you're selling yourself short.
You have a lot to say to me.</v>

2826
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:22.690
You can do 3000 shows because you have 3000 shows where the things you say

2827
02:29:22.691 --> 02:29:26.410
you're not trying 3001 with this because if this is the last show,

2828
02:29:26.490 --> 02:29:29.230
without going to understand that we're good.
Do you feel,

2829
02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:30.520
<v 1>do you feel that there is,</v>

2830
02:29:30.580 --> 02:29:33.430
I don't feel it's inevitable that the good people when I think that's a lot to

2831
02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:36.550
do with really working at,
at getting the message out.

2832
02:29:36.610 --> 02:29:37.540
<v 0>I think there's a battle.</v>

2833
02:29:37.541 --> 02:29:41.500
I think there always is and I think that battle exists because you need a yen to

2834
02:29:41.501 --> 02:29:44.420
have a Yang.
You need a push and a pull.
You need an eval and a good.

2835
02:29:44.421 --> 02:29:48.880
Do you need an ideal to subscribe to or aspire to when you also need a really

2836
02:29:48.881 --> 02:29:50.230
negative thing to avoid?

2837
02:29:50.470 --> 02:29:54.280
I've learned personally from the failures of other people and I think that's an

2838
02:29:54.281 --> 02:29:57.280
important lesson that you've learned from people who've gotten hooked on drugs.

2839
02:29:57.281 --> 02:30:00.940
I've learned from people who have ruined their life because of alcoholism or

2840
02:30:00.970 --> 02:30:03.520
gambling or whatever the fuck it's been.
I the,

2841
02:30:03.521 --> 02:30:07.900
these are all there also as life lessons and it's a very,
very,
very,

2842
02:30:07.901 --> 02:30:12.340
very fascinating trip that we're on.
Um,
I do have a sense of urgency,

2843
02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:17.110
but for the most part it's really a sense of stimulation and excitement and have

2844
02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:19.660
just really excited about,

2845
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:23.170
<v 1>I like to fight.
Yes.
I think that if I'd been born later,</v>

2846
02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:25.060
it wouldn't have been as much fun.

2847
02:30:25.340 --> 02:30:29.020
I like being in the fight where it is now because it seems so overwhelming,

2848
02:30:29.050 --> 02:30:32.560
you know?
I mean,
what if we got two microphones and,
and uh,

2849
02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:34.510
one bad haircut and one great Polish?

2850
02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:35.111
<v 0>Well,
we're,</v>

2851
02:30:35.111 --> 02:30:39.460
we're in the craziest time that human being has ever existed in and trying to

2852
02:30:39.461 --> 02:30:43.390
figure as far as like technology and information trying to figure our way

2853
02:30:43.391 --> 02:30:47.350
through this.
You're going to get these things like the NSA surveillance issue.

2854
02:30:47.351 --> 02:30:48.320
You're going to get that.

2855
02:30:48.321 --> 02:30:52.330
And when you find out that they're building this gigantic facility in Utah to

2856
02:30:52.331 --> 02:30:54.790
store all the information that slowly but surely it gets out.

2857
02:30:54.791 --> 02:30:56.890
They've already started doing it,
and then you know,

2858
02:30:57.070 --> 02:31:00.040
all of this capability remotely,

2859
02:31:00.460 --> 02:31:02.590
I phoned and they have a hundred percent control of it.

2860
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:04.990
They could turn your camera on,
they could turn your phone on.

2861
02:31:05.020 --> 02:31:07.960
You don't even see it.
You don't even know it's on.
And it can be explored.
Node.

2862
02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:12.130
Yeah.
Well,
uh,
Amber Lyon told us that when she went to other countries,

2863
02:31:12.370 --> 02:31:15.040
they wouldn't let anybody talk to them.
If they had an iPhone,

2864
02:31:15.041 --> 02:31:17.260
you had to have an android of some other phone where they could remove the

2865
02:31:17.261 --> 02:31:21.210
battery or they wouldn't talk to you.
Wow.
They were like,
what do you think?

2866
02:31:21.211 --> 02:31:24.180
We're stupid?
Get that.
Fuck.
I'm crazy.
Spy device out of here.

2867
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:27.240
Like there's no such thing as an iPhone to them.
That's a spy device.

2868
02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:28.770
You've got to have a phone.

2869
02:31:28.771 --> 02:31:32.040
We can remove the battery and sit down where we know that you're not

2870
02:31:32.041 --> 02:31:36.660
transmitting this conversation to some nefarious source across the world,

2871
02:31:36.661 --> 02:31:37.590
which is what they can do.

2872
02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:41.070
That is also a part of this weird thing that we're doing.

2873
02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:45.660
But ultimately my thoughts are that if I look at the accountability,

2874
02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:48.600
here's the perfect example.
Look at General Petraeus.

2875
02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:54.080
General Petraeus got caught and removed as the head spy from that CIA being

2876
02:31:56.551 --> 02:31:58.500
investigated by the FBI.

2877
02:31:58.770 --> 02:32:03.770
I mean the FBI found out that he was having this affair and all this jazz with

2878
02:32:03.931 --> 02:32:06.750
the reporter or the woman who wrote the book about him,
but why?

2879
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:08.400
How did that happen?
It was cyber.

2880
02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:12.930
It happened through the very thing that we're all scared of where everyone is

2881
02:32:12.931 --> 02:32:16.770
scared of someone being able to go into your email and find,
oh look,

2882
02:32:16.771 --> 02:32:17.740
Stefan Molyneux a,

2883
02:32:17.741 --> 02:32:21.150
apparently he's gone to these communist meetings and he wanted his find out what

2884
02:32:21.151 --> 02:32:21.960
it's all about.

2885
02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:24.840
We have some information that maybe you've been thinking about overthrowing the

2886
02:32:24.841 --> 02:32:27.840
government and then boom,
you're in jail.
Like,
look,
I was just talking to,

2887
02:32:27.841 --> 02:32:31.200
he was a theoretical ideas.
He's just,
I,
I'm,
I'm an anarchist,

2888
02:32:31.201 --> 02:32:33.990
but not really young.
I'm,
I'm not,
I'm not raising dones or anything.

2889
02:32:34.350 --> 02:32:36.980
This is what happened to the head spoons.

2890
02:32:37.220 --> 02:32:41.150
<v 1>Oh yeah,
no,
I,
when someone calls in my my show and they say that the name's Jack,</v>

2891
02:32:41.151 --> 02:32:44.420
I don't say hi to them.
I would say,
Hi Jack.
Nope,
nope.

2892
02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:47.730
I say high listener hijack is,
Oh,

2893
02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:52.910
you gotta get red flags.
And I,
I still do it,
but I'm like,
I'm,

2894
02:32:52.911 --> 02:32:56.090
I'm conscious of the fact that,
you know,
when I say something is the bomb,

2895
02:32:56.091 --> 02:32:57.960
you know,
this could be pink,
you know,

2896
02:32:57.980 --> 02:33:00.370
it could be flagged and Microsoft and Skype or you know,

2897
02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:04.190
in deep with these guys and it's,
you know,
it is there.
I mean,

2898
02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:07.940
we do have to struggle through this stuff and I don't feel particularly a

2899
02:33:07.941 --> 02:33:10.760
concern.
I think I hit like with three or 4 million downloads a month,

2900
02:33:10.761 --> 02:33:14.240
I think I've hit enough trajectory that,
you know,

2901
02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:18.290
I just can't be targeted in that kind of way very easily anymore.
But yeah,

2902
02:33:18.291 --> 02:33:21.530
definitely at the beginning there was a little bit of,
Oh,
I'm still pretty small.

2903
02:33:21.531 --> 02:33:22.450
And it's also,

2904
02:33:22.450 --> 02:33:25.870
<v 0>you have the ability to be honest and express yourself.
You can't be like,</v>

2905
02:33:25.900 --> 02:33:29.990
you can't be silenced in the McCarthy era.
How did you get your,
if you know the,

2906
02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:32.920
they came after you and said you were a communist and you got kicked out of,

2907
02:33:32.921 --> 02:33:35.200
you know,
whatever job you were doing,
what are you going to do?

2908
02:33:35.201 --> 02:33:37.380
Are you going to start a blog and we're going to do it and you're going to get

2909
02:33:37.381 --> 02:33:42.070
on it on fucking Twitter and explain yourself and 140 characters now you

2910
02:33:42.071 --> 02:33:44.260
couldn't do a damn thing right now.
You know,

2911
02:33:44.261 --> 02:33:48.580
if you have a situation where perhaps maybe something comes out where you did

2912
02:33:48.581 --> 02:33:51.690
say something that you regretted or you did do something in the past that maybe

2913
02:33:51.710 --> 02:33:52.300
wasn't the best,

2914
02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:55.780
you could describe it in depth and a show own it and it wouldn't be,

2915
02:33:55.781 --> 02:33:58.810
it would be a complete nonissue and in fact you'd probably grow from this non

2916
02:33:58.811 --> 02:34:02.470
issue and the listeners would grow from the experience of hearing you honestly

2917
02:34:02.471 --> 02:34:05.260
talk about whatever it is,
whether it's,
you know,

2918
02:34:05.261 --> 02:34:07.960
going to some fucking communist meeting.
I mean obviously that's not an issue.

2919
02:34:07.961 --> 02:34:12.490
Now I'm giving McCarthyism terms,
but whatever it could be,

2920
02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:16.420
that would be something that they could hold over you.
And it's almost,

2921
02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:19.480
it doesn't anymore.
You know,
it almost doesn't batter.

2922
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:23.530
And I believe that where this is heading is a time,

2923
02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:26.590
whether it's a decade,
two,
three,
what have you,

2924
02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:29.950
where there are no secrets and it's probably beginning to be some sort of a

2925
02:34:29.951 --> 02:34:33.010
technological change.
And the way we exchange information,

2926
02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:36.910
maybe it's some Google glass thing that goes to the next level and becomes an

2927
02:34:36.911 --> 02:34:38.260
implant or whatever the fuck it is.

2928
02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:40.300
I really don't think there's going to be any secrets.

2929
02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:42.640
I think we're going to laugh one day at the times.

2930
02:34:42.641 --> 02:34:44.020
We used to be able to lie to people.

2931
02:34:44.170 --> 02:34:46.960
We're going to laugh at the time she used to be able to tell people that you're

2932
02:34:46.961 --> 02:34:49.780
going to go to some place,
but really you went to some other place.

2933
02:34:50.050 --> 02:34:53.680
There's not going to be that anymore.
That,
that,
that your whereabouts.

2934
02:34:53.681 --> 02:34:58.000
We'll just be information and it's easy to look as a,
as a Google search.

2935
02:34:58.690 --> 02:35:01.630
<v 1>Well,
I,
I think that,
uh,
that's in real benefits of that,
you know,</v>

2936
02:35:01.631 --> 02:35:05.880
that there's a whole bunch of lawyers who are now trying to subpoena the NSA for

2937
02:35:05.890 --> 02:35:08.230
data that will exonerate their clients hopefully,

2938
02:35:08.490 --> 02:35:11.440
where they had cell phone records or something that will helpfully exonerate

2939
02:35:11.441 --> 02:35:13.280
their clients and so on.
I mean,

2940
02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:17.200
I personally would be more than willing to give up where I'm going and what I'm

2941
02:35:17.201 --> 02:35:21.130
doing and so on to an organization that was actually there to sort of help them

2942
02:35:21.131 --> 02:35:24.250
protect me.
I mean,
I was just reading on,
on the drudge report the other day,

2943
02:35:24.251 --> 02:35:25.031
I think it was the,

2944
02:35:25.031 --> 02:35:28.270
it was the FBI or the CIA have just scrubbed from their mission plan,

2945
02:35:28.271 --> 02:35:30.760
anything to do with criminal,
like pursuing criminals.
Now.

2946
02:35:30.761 --> 02:35:34.750
It's just been entirely basically protecting the powers that be,

2947
02:35:34.890 --> 02:35:38.880
<v 0>that's so crazy.
Really.
It's natural though.
I mean the scrambling for control.</v>

2948
02:35:38.940 --> 02:35:42.990
<v 1>Well look,
the police have no duty per to protect.
That's been shown many,</v>

2949
02:35:42.991 --> 02:35:43.800
many times.

2950
02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:47.040
You have no constitutional right to a jury before the trial of your peers

2951
02:35:47.041 --> 02:35:48.510
because what is it?

2952
02:35:48.511 --> 02:35:52.770
95% of people never get a jury trial in the United States because all they do is

2953
02:35:52.771 --> 02:35:55.650
they get threatened with insane sentences and they just plead down.
I mean,

2954
02:35:55.651 --> 02:35:58.770
because there's just,
you have no hope.
I mean,
they've even said that,
that,

2955
02:35:58.771 --> 02:36:03.320
that I'm threatening someone with a life sentence for a minor transgression,

2956
02:36:03.690 --> 02:36:08.010
uh,
in there getting to deplete for something less while threatening them with a

2957
02:36:08.011 --> 02:36:11.670
life sentence for a minor transgression of the law is not cruel and unusual

2958
02:36:11.671 --> 02:36:16.110
punishment.
Uh,
it is,
it is.
You can't bribe someone with 50 bucks,
uh,

2959
02:36:16.111 --> 02:36:16.950
in the legal system,

2960
02:36:16.951 --> 02:36:20.730
but you can bribe them with reducing something from 20 years to two years and

2961
02:36:20.731 --> 02:36:22.380
somehow 18 years is not a bribe.

2962
02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:27.090
So there is no constitutional right to a trial.
There's almost nobody,

2963
02:36:27.091 --> 02:36:30.920
particularly in drug stuff.
I mean,
people just plead down and go to jail.
Uh,

2964
02:36:30.921 --> 02:36:33.930
and a lot of these people are convicted on the hearsay of other people who

2965
02:36:33.931 --> 02:36:35.130
themselves are giving up,

2966
02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:40.080
whoever they knew in order to get out of crazy jail time and so on.
So it is a,

2967
02:36:40.530 --> 02:36:42.330
it is a monstrous system right now.
I mean,

2968
02:36:42.331 --> 02:36:45.750
this comes back to the whole war on drug stuff,
which is just,
I mean,

2969
02:36:45.751 --> 02:36:50.730
so amazingly evil that it's,
it staggers the imagination.
I mean,
I can't believe,

2970
02:36:50.731 --> 02:36:52.800
and it's so fantastic that that America's find,

2971
02:36:52.801 --> 02:36:55.380
they're looking over to the example of Portugal,
Portugal 10 years ago,

2972
02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:00.390
decriminalize their drugs and now they have a 50% reduction in drug use and they

2973
02:37:00.391 --> 02:37:03.630
actually get addicts help.
Addicts should get help.
It's a medical problem.

2974
02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:06.090
They need,
you know,
let's say it's not medical that they got in there,

2975
02:37:06.091 --> 02:37:07.710
but so what they're in there,
right?

2976
02:37:07.711 --> 02:37:10.760
I mean even drunk drivers needed the jaws of life to get out of a car and,

2977
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:12.150
and they,
they get these people,

2978
02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:15.090
the medical help they need and they don't throw people in jail.

2979
02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.220
Personal consumption of mind altering substances.
Like TV isn't one of those.

2980
02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:21.360
And they actually get people help,

2981
02:37:21.361 --> 02:37:24.140
but now they're starting to get a couple of things here and there where you can

2982
02:37:24.141 --> 02:37:27.760
go and buy this stuff legally and so on.
I mean,
thank God.
I mean,
I,

2983
02:37:27.761 --> 02:37:31.550
I thought we were going to be so past what it used to be like before the war on

2984
02:37:31.551 --> 02:37:33.710
drugs that people like,
at least with prohibition,
it was only what,

2985
02:37:33.711 --> 02:37:38.570
13 or 14 years in the 30s with prohibition and even that brought organized crime

2986
02:37:38.571 --> 02:37:40.030
over to America.
I thought we'd,

2987
02:37:40.031 --> 02:37:42.380
we'd have this war on drugs for so long that people would be,

2988
02:37:42.510 --> 02:37:45.890
would have forgotten what it was like beforehand and it would have just gone on

2989
02:37:45.891 --> 02:37:46.221
forever.

2990
02:37:46.221 --> 02:37:49.820
But it does look like there is going to be some relaxation of this stuff.

2991
02:37:49.821 --> 02:37:52.790
Some tentative steps are being taken towards it.
And my God,

2992
02:37:52.791 --> 02:37:56.330
what an incredible thing,
uh,
that that's happening because I mean,

2993
02:37:56.780 --> 02:38:00.430
the majority of people in prison are there for completely nonviolent offenses.

2994
02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:04.630
<v 0>Do you know the what the,
what they did in Colorado with the,
uh,
legal marijuana,</v>

2995
02:38:04.631 --> 02:38:08.140
you're allowed to buy it and sell it.
Retail was the first guy who bought,
right?

2996
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:12.370
Yes.
That was the first co Bot and one day they went,

2997
02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:13.780
they made over $1 million.

2998
02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:17.590
The first day 12 stores made over a million dollars in Colorado.
Wow.

2999
02:38:17.650 --> 02:38:18.880
And by the way,

3000
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:22.690
that money is going to be taxed and it's going to be going back to the people

3001
02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:25.690
and that's going to benefit people.
That stimulates the economy.

3002
02:38:25.691 --> 02:38:27.790
It's actually good and it makes people nicer.

3003
02:38:27.890 --> 02:38:30.040
And so it was going to come a lot of people down.
Well,

3004
02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:31.570
if people in a more sensitive mood

3005
02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:35.810
<v 1>so much,
I mean,
let's say you could just legalize all this stuff tomorrow,</v>

3006
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:39.280
what an incredible thing it would be.
First of all,
there'd be less incentive.
One,

3007
02:38:39.281 --> 02:38:42.800
one of the reasons people get hooked a is because people offer them free drugs

3008
02:38:42.801 --> 02:38:44.480
because it's so profitable once they are hooked,

3009
02:38:44.740 --> 02:38:47.780
<v 0>it's also forbidden.
So it seems it's enticing.</v>

3010
02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:51.470
And one of the things about Holland that's been so fascinating is that they're

3011
02:38:51.471 --> 02:38:56.471
hard drug use is a radically down because cannabis is so prevalent in and

3012
02:38:57.061 --> 02:38:57.540
accepted.

3013
02:38:57.540 --> 02:39:00.030
<v 1>Did that just so I actually going to go speak in Amsterdam,</v>

3014
02:39:00.031 --> 02:39:03.450
I'm speaking to with this huge crowd and Amsterdam about cryptocurrencies in,

3015
02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:05.610
in April,
I think it's called don't sweat currencies,

3016
02:39:05.850 --> 02:39:10.020
bitcoin and stuff like corn yet.
Why is that crypto?
Oh,
because it's encrypted.

3017
02:39:10.021 --> 02:39:14.010
It's anonymous.
It's,
you know,
it's not open clear text.
It was like secret.

3018
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:16.350
What kind of secret?
Right.
In that you just,

3019
02:39:16.590 --> 02:39:19.130
you can't be identified if you take some basic steps in,

3020
02:39:19.131 --> 02:39:22.020
in your economic transactions and what a blessing that is for a lot of people,

3021
02:39:22.021 --> 02:39:25.050
even people who are doing the right stuff,
like a third of the world's economy,

3022
02:39:25.380 --> 02:39:29.520
a third of the whole world's economy is black or gray market.
It's huge.

3023
02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:30.820
<v 0>Crazy.
It is.</v>

3024
02:39:30.821 --> 02:39:34.510
When people find out that that was a major motivation for the Vietnam War,

3025
02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:35.560
the in you,

3026
02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:38.200
that's another thing that you can find out on the internet today is how much

3027
02:39:38.201 --> 02:39:41.830
money was being made by selling heroin.
People don't even want to believe that.

3028
02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:43.000
They're like,
oh,
come on.

3029
02:39:43.001 --> 02:39:46.670
You really think that heroin had a lot to do with the Vietnam War for the people

3030
02:39:46.671 --> 02:39:51.280
who are selling and it's certainly fun and those people made millions of
dollars,

3031
02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:53.530
right?
Like what do you think?
Where did that all go?

3032
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:55.750
Did that all just disappear and did it turn into a mist?

3033
02:39:55.930 --> 02:39:58.570
Was it like the super soaker and the 41 below zero air?

3034
02:39:58.830 --> 02:40:01.130
Like what the fuck happened?
What happened to all that

3035
02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:02.350
<v 1>peace in Afghanistan?</v>

3036
02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:05.950
The people think that the poppies in Afghanistan and completely irrelevant to

3037
02:40:05.951 --> 02:40:07.830
the Watson anyway,
it's a whole,
well it's,

3038
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:11.250
<v 0>yeah,
it's a fascinating subject because people automatically want to dismiss it</v>

3039
02:40:11.251 --> 02:40:14.190
because of the war on drugs because it's not

3040
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:15.750
<v 3>thought of as a commodity.</v>

3041
02:40:15.930 --> 02:40:19.190
It's instead thought of as something that's illegal and,

3042
02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:23.010
and you just gross and look,
oh drugs,
drugs,
drugs,

3043
02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:27.150
drugs are money and money is what everybody wants.

3044
02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:30.480
And these fucking people that are over there that are trying to extract

3045
02:40:30.481 --> 02:40:31.201
resources,

3046
02:40:31.201 --> 02:40:34.770
whether it's in the form of natural gas or whether it's in the form of oil,

3047
02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:36.390
that same type of thinking.

3048
02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:39.450
If you think that that same type of thinking doesn't agree or doesn't,

3049
02:40:39.490 --> 02:40:43.800
doesn't work in terms of like trying to make similar amounts of money from

3050
02:40:43.801 --> 02:40:46.770
illegal drugs,
you're crazy.
And it's,
it's so naive

3051
02:40:46.970 --> 02:40:51.500
<v 1>and drugs are a fantastic way to harass the population.
You know,</v>

3052
02:40:51.501 --> 02:40:56.501
because the whole idea behind common law is that the law is passive.

3053
02:40:56.990 --> 02:41:00.260
Like the law doesn't go out looking for problems.
You know,
like if you,

3054
02:41:00.261 --> 02:41:03.620
if you come key my car,
then I call up the cops and then like,

3055
02:41:03.621 --> 02:41:06.620
because you've done me wrong,
you know,
the law leaps into action.

3056
02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:11.270
The law is never supposed to exist without a complaint.
Right.
And if you know,

3057
02:41:11.330 --> 02:41:14.240
you buy drugs from some guy and you like the drugs and he likes your money,

3058
02:41:14.241 --> 02:41:15.074
there's no complaint,

3059
02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:18.590
but the law then becomes proactive and it goes out there looking for problems

3060
02:41:18.591 --> 02:41:21.950
and nobody's complaining.
And that's when the law becomes tyrannical.

3061
02:41:22.250 --> 02:41:25.220
When the law is passive and just waits for a complaint and it has clear rules.

3062
02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:26.960
Ah,
okay.
That's a fairly good thing.

3063
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:31.310
When the law goes from reactive to proactive and starts going out there to look,

3064
02:41:31.610 --> 02:41:34.220
oh,
prostitution or gambling or drugs,
you know,

3065
02:41:34.430 --> 02:41:37.010
this is all voluntary consensual stuff.
You know,

3066
02:41:37.011 --> 02:41:39.710
it may not be healthy and excess,
but neither are cheesecakes who gives a shit.

3067
02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:42.820
<v 3>Right.
How about the fact that people are being arrested now for having secret</v>

3068
02:41:42.821 --> 02:41:46.840
compartments in their car?
Yeah,
I read about that.
Yeah.
Not even having drugs,

3069
02:41:46.841 --> 02:41:51.190
having zero drugs,
but having a secret compartment in their car.
Your you,

3070
02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:54.280
they can strip your car down,
search it.
Even if they find nothing,

3071
02:41:54.490 --> 02:41:55.323
they're not in trouble.

3072
02:41:55.470 --> 02:41:56.171
<v 1>Well then they get the,</v>

3073
02:41:56.171 --> 02:42:00.070
they get these stupid drug sniffing dogs that completely retarded.
I mean like,

3074
02:42:00.130 --> 02:42:01.240
well did you find something like,

3075
02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:04.110
Oh did you find something that dog starts going like this because of the tone of

3076
02:42:04.111 --> 02:42:07.340
voice of the cop and they suddenly think that this is somehow some
justification.

3077
02:42:07.530 --> 02:42:11.780
<v 3>[inaudible] they're actually very good at training dogs to find drugs</v>

3078
02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:15.780
<v 1>encouraged by the policeman who wants to harass them.</v>

3079
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:18.510
<v 3>Ray can be if they're trained poorly,</v>

3080
02:42:18.511 --> 02:42:21.030
but if they react in a very strong women taught their,

3081
02:42:21.031 --> 02:42:24.570
their sense of smell is impossible for us to even fathom.

3082
02:42:24.571 --> 02:42:29.571
They put up with people I can be because so bad like a how they got to love us

3083
02:42:30.061 --> 02:42:32.400
something fierce,
you know,
cause we think it's hell.

3084
02:42:32.490 --> 02:42:36.060
We think of smells a bad thing and they don't,
they sniff other dogs.

3085
02:42:36.061 --> 02:42:39.630
Shit bothered them.
Maybe that's why they love us as we smelled like shit,

3086
02:42:39.690 --> 02:42:44.460
I didn't like that.
But dogs can actually smell cancer.
They can take files.
Yeah.

3087
02:42:44.461 --> 02:42:45.420
They've trained dogs.

3088
02:42:45.421 --> 02:42:50.421
They've taken vials of tissue and have cancerous tissue in certain vials and had

3089
02:42:51.091 --> 02:42:54.270
a whole row of the many,
many,
many choices.

3090
02:42:54.271 --> 02:42:57.900
And there's dawn who went down the road and went right to it over and over again

3091
02:42:57.901 --> 02:43:01.800
so they can actually smell cancer on people.
They can smell sick people.
Wow.

3092
02:43:02.060 --> 02:43:04.500
I did.
Yeah,
we did.
We can't even,
I mean,
they can smell fear.

3093
02:43:04.530 --> 02:43:06.300
They can smell adrenaline rushes,
they can smell.

3094
02:43:06.301 --> 02:43:07.740
When you're thinking about doing something,

3095
02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:12.130
there's a lot of reasons to have those.
Those senses,
the senses of smell.
I mean,

3096
02:43:12.130 --> 02:43:16.390
<v 0>animals have them in a very,
very strong way.
If animals smell you in the woods,</v>

3097
02:43:16.570 --> 02:43:21.400
they fucking run.
I mean,
they smell you.
They know your intentions almost.
I mean,

3098
02:43:21.401 --> 02:43:24.610
there's information that comes out in your scent that we just,

3099
02:43:24.611 --> 02:43:28.660
our noses are stupid or knows it.
Oh,
I was pot roast.
Oh,
I smell gas.
You know,

3100
02:43:28.661 --> 02:43:32.860
I know this isn't broken.
There's so clumsy.
A great analogy for,

3101
02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:37.840
for how incompetent our noses are in comparisons to a dog is skunks.

3102
02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:42.880
Because we can smell skunk sent in one part per billion.

3103
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.620
We can smell skunk sent a little bit of spray whey the fuck down the block and

3104
02:43:47.621 --> 02:43:51.330
we be like,
what is that?
That's how a dog is for everything.

3105
02:43:51.370 --> 02:43:53.200
Dog can smell everything like that.

3106
02:43:53.270 --> 02:43:57.490
They can smell all kinds of things and tiny amounts of it in the air and the

3107
02:43:57.490 --> 02:43:58.990
weekend they'd find people in the woods.
Man.

3108
02:43:59.010 --> 02:44:03.580
I run through the woods and a dog knows where the guy went based on his body

3109
02:44:03.581 --> 02:44:08.581
touching the ground in certain places and it's your fucking shoe and your sh how

3110
02:44:08.651 --> 02:44:12.550
much scent is your shoe giving off?
But the dog can smell that and find you.

3111
02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:17.720
<v 1>Would you have off?
I've thought about this sometimes I was like,
I was just,
I,</v>

3112
02:44:17.721 --> 02:44:21.570
I went to exercise before the show and so my wife was laying out some stuff

3113
02:44:21.571 --> 02:44:23.400
cause she,
you know,
has a better clothing sense.

3114
02:44:23.401 --> 02:44:26.460
I'd be here and like a mess t shirt and like this.
Yeah,
something like that.

3115
02:44:26.461 --> 02:44:31.050
Caveman coffee.
And I was thinking,
which is if you could like just,
I don't know,

3116
02:44:31.051 --> 02:44:33.480
like 10 seconds in someone else's consciousness,

3117
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:36.510
do you think that would be like the most oh 10 seconds in a dog's brain?

3118
02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:40.830
I think it would just be like if I could do that and come back and not be
insane.

3119
02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:44.100
I think I,
you know,
we were talking about,
I would totally do that.

3120
02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:48.300
Like if I could sit there in my wife's brain for 10 seconds or half day or

3121
02:44:48.301 --> 02:44:51.510
whatever,
I think that would be so amazing.
You know,

3122
02:44:51.511 --> 02:44:54.900
to just with her experience is different than mine and other species.

3123
02:44:55.290 --> 02:44:58.080
I could love it to be in a shark's brain to be in it.
I just,

3124
02:44:58.310 --> 02:45:01.480
if I could do that and come back and not be completely mental and,

3125
02:45:01.570 --> 02:45:04.560
but still retain the memory of it.
I don't know.
It's kind of an idle thought,

3126
02:45:04.561 --> 02:45:07.440
but I think it would be really,
really fascinating.
They should do,
they should,

3127
02:45:07.441 --> 02:45:09.390
if they do ever come up with that technology,

3128
02:45:09.490 --> 02:45:14.130
they should force it on the people at seaworld and get killer whales mind and

3129
02:45:14.131 --> 02:45:17.750
stick it in a person.
And to have them by your Larson's leg off.
Oh,

3130
02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:20.630
just have them.
If I didn't like herring so much.
You bastard.

3131
02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:25.440
What kind of torture their their existing in a daily basis.
Yeah.

3132
02:45:25.441 --> 02:45:26.070
Make them,

3133
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:28.680
make them do it and see if they come back and still want to run seaworld.

3134
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:32.190
Oh I dunno.
Or zoos or anything like that.
Zeus we have to have,

3135
02:45:32.191 --> 02:45:34.860
cause it's the only place you will let Komodo dragons exists.
Oh,

3136
02:45:35.050 --> 02:45:38.890
Sue's rich guy's yard.
Some rich guys got a big fucking big fence.

3137
02:45:39.090 --> 02:45:42.570
Big Komodo size like barbecue there for special guests.
Right.

3138
02:45:42.910 --> 02:45:46.150
Well this is my thoughts on,
on animals.
You know,
I've always said I,

3139
02:45:46.151 --> 02:45:48.180
I do love nature much as you do

3140
02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:52.580
<v 0>spec nature.
I'm,
I find it absolutely beautiful and fascinating.
Amazing.</v>

3141
02:45:52.581 --> 02:45:56.090
And I talk about wolves and bears and all this different shit like as if I hate

3142
02:45:56.091 --> 02:45:59.900
them all,
but I'm absolutely thrilled that they exist.
I find it amazing.

3143
02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:04.970
But one of the things that people who are more interested in animals and they

3144
02:46:04.971 --> 02:46:06.410
are people,
I mean there's a,

3145
02:46:06.411 --> 02:46:10.310
there's a lot of animal lovers that say just unbelievably things.
Sometimes

3146
02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:14.920
<v 3>we can't find cures for childhood cancers because of bunnies like they give,</v>

3147
02:46:14.930 --> 02:46:16.970
you can't test off on bunny,
you know,

3148
02:46:16.971 --> 02:46:19.700
these are the people whose kids have never been sick.
You know,
like,

3149
02:46:19.701 --> 02:46:22.460
I don't care how many bunnies it takes.
Make my,
I mean,
sorry,
you know,

3150
02:46:22.461 --> 02:46:26.450
I have a little bit more allegiance to the,
you know,
genetic closeness a,

3151
02:46:26.451 --> 02:46:29.840
I think there is,
um,
a bit too much.
I think you know,
a bit too much that way.

3152
02:46:29.841 --> 02:46:32.900
I mean,
human life is still pretty significant relative to animals

3153
02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:38.210
and you know,
on people.
I've always been on Ted team by pen.

3154
02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:42.020
It doesn't mean I hate the other teams,
but if the shit goes down,

3155
02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:44.780
I'm with the people.
Rabid start fucking running through the streets,

3156
02:46:44.781 --> 02:46:48.470
killing babies.
I'm shooting rabbit,
you know?
Absolutely.
It's real simple.

3157
02:46:48.490 --> 02:46:51.580
I'm not going to say,
well,
you know,
they were here first.
You know that all,

3158
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:54.140
you can totally sell tickets to your dreams because you know,

3159
02:46:54.141 --> 02:46:55.310
you're going to dream about that tonight.

3160
02:46:55.311 --> 02:46:57.240
Like you had that dream about giving roses at the guy.

3161
02:46:57.250 --> 02:46:59.390
Now you could have a dream about rabbits running through the streets,

3162
02:46:59.391 --> 02:47:04.160
killing people.
It's possible.
It's very possible.
Dammit.
Buddies.

3163
02:47:04.430 --> 02:47:07.530
Well,
I've had,
I've had many,
many animal dreams.
Um,
I have a,

3164
02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:11.390
a vast amount of respect for animals and I've also been around them.

3165
02:47:11.391 --> 02:47:14.180
I've seen a couple of mountain lions.
I've been around a lot of coyotes.

3166
02:47:14.390 --> 02:47:18.020
Coyotes are the creepiest fuckers ever.
You know,
I was in my yard the other day,

3167
02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:21.200
uh,
and uh,
I think it was a coyote.
It might've been a mount line,

3168
02:47:21.201 --> 02:47:24.860
but something was chasing a deer and I just randomly happened to be there when

3169
02:47:24.861 --> 02:47:28.580
it happened and this deer was fucking big,
you know,
like,
you know,

3170
02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:30.380
maybe a hundred plus pounds,
whatever it was,

3171
02:47:30.381 --> 02:47:33.170
because I could hear it running and I'm outside.
It's two o'clock in the morning.

3172
02:47:33.171 --> 02:47:36.470
I'm just chilling outside and I just happened to be really close to this

3173
02:47:36.471 --> 02:47:41.450
happening.
So this animal just fucking runs through white eyes and all that.

3174
02:47:41.451 --> 02:47:44.900
Yeah,
I didn't see it.
I saw a silhouette because it was really dark out,

3175
02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:48.170
but it was fucking running and it was heavy and behind.

3176
02:47:48.171 --> 02:47:49.580
It was something chasing it,
something,

3177
02:47:49.581 --> 02:47:53.930
trying to eat it and I appreciate it was a coyote.
And when I see,

3178
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:57.980
when I just feel that and hear that and know that like I find it thrilling.

3179
02:47:57.981 --> 02:48:01.790
I find it fascinating,
but I also find it quite terrifying.
That's the food chain.

3180
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.960
There's something about as big as me and it's running away from something about

3181
02:48:05.961 --> 02:48:08.900
as big as me.
Oh yeah.
I mean,
if grass could make horror movies,

3182
02:48:08.901 --> 02:48:11.930
they'd all be called the deer,
you know,
at the fucking cows.
You know?

3183
02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:15.260
He didn't even kill him.

3184
02:48:15.261 --> 02:48:20.180
He just bit the top of his head bleeding and screaming and some ripped out by

3185
02:48:20.181 --> 02:48:24.850
the roots.
Yup.
Monstrous.
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.
100% I said,

3186
02:48:24.860 --> 02:48:29.490
I think we're out of time.
I think we,
we,
yeah,
we just,
she had rushed through it.

3187
02:48:29.780 --> 02:48:32.330
Yeah.
We didn't talk about it.
A lot of things that I wanted to talk about quick.

3188
02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:35.710
Definitely.
It always feels quick,
man.
Yeah.
I could tell him,
I said,

3189
02:48:35.711 --> 02:48:37.370
tell my girlfriends,
you know,
it's longer than it feels.

3190
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:42.680
These conversations are fascinating.
You know,
they,
they do feel quick.
They go by,

3191
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:44.390
but three hours seems to be the right amount.

3192
02:48:44.391 --> 02:48:47.030
You don't have any like chat room because people are watching.

3193
02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.640
They've watched his life.
Yeah.
This is live on Ustream right now.

3194
02:48:49.641 --> 02:48:54.410
It's ustream.tv forward slash Joe Rogan.
It's live right now.

3195
02:48:54.411 --> 02:48:56.450
So there,
there's a bunch of people watching it live.

3196
02:48:56.780 --> 02:48:59.760
More people will catch it on Youtube,
but the most we'll see it,
uh,

3197
02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:02.990
either as an MP three relative to the last show.

3198
02:49:02.991 --> 02:49:07.040
This has delicious buttery audio.
Yeah,
there's more deliciousness to it for sure.

3199
02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:11.030
Had some caveman coffee with butter last time we were stuck in downtown Toronto

3200
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:14.760
to put in a pitch for the Stevia.
Is that,
that is like cocaine from my sugar.

3201
02:49:14.761 --> 02:49:18.870
Tea is my sweet tooth.
That is just fantastic.
It's not dangerous.
It's not,
I mean,

3202
02:49:18.871 --> 02:49:21.570
you'd need a tiny amount of it to sweeten things as well.

3203
02:49:21.571 --> 02:49:24.810
And it doesn't spike your sugar doesn't fuck with your insulin levels.

3204
02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:27.960
It's actually not bad for you.
Yeah.
Listen,
man,
we got to do this more often.

3205
02:49:27.961 --> 02:49:30.090
I really enjoyed this very much.
I'll be back here and watch.

3206
02:49:30.091 --> 02:49:33.660
Maybe we do another one.
Fuck yeah.
Down Ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you sir.

3207
02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:36.740
Thank you.
So a lot of fun.
Even more fun than the last one.
Um,

3208
02:49:36.850 --> 02:49:40.500
and you can catch Stefan online if free domain,

3209
02:49:40.501 --> 02:49:43.770
radio.com.com FDR,

3210
02:49:43.771 --> 02:49:47.520
you were l.com forward slash iTunes for my feed.
And you might as well give my,

3211
02:49:47.521 --> 02:49:49.350
I'm sure most of my listeners know your feet as well,

3212
02:49:49.351 --> 02:49:54.000
but free domain radio is your eye,
your uh,
your iTunes feed.
Uh,
yeah,
it's uh,
FDR,

3213
02:49:54.010 --> 02:49:57.390
url.com,
forward slash free made radio.
We'll get people to the iTunes feed.

3214
02:49:57.391 --> 02:49:59.950
It's a redirect and you have a vast amount of,
of,

3215
02:49:59.951 --> 02:50:03.690
of content out there and incredible amounts and uh,
all that sort of stuff.

3216
02:50:03.691 --> 02:50:05.820
So I hope people will check it out to videos as well.

3217
02:50:05.821 --> 02:50:07.920
And that's one of the things that are really admire about what you do.

3218
02:50:07.921 --> 02:50:10.680
Like whenever something happens in the news,
it's controversial.

3219
02:50:10.681 --> 02:50:15.570
You have a very poignant point about,
about it.
You'll do this long,

3220
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:20.670
20 minute really in depth discussion of these things.
Just,
you know,
editing,

3221
02:50:20.671 --> 02:50:22.080
standing right in front of a camera.

3222
02:50:22.081 --> 02:50:24.950
And that takes a lot of balls and it's also very impressive.
It's,

3223
02:50:24.951 --> 02:50:27.700
it's great stuff and you have great points.
I really enjoyed talking to you.

3224
02:50:27.930 --> 02:50:31.440
So Stefan Molyneux,
ladies and gentlemen,
and you could find him on Twitter.

3225
02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:35.070
Your Twitter is same.

3226
02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:39.180

Uh,

that's what I yeah,

3227
02:50:39.270 --> 02:50:41.010
you're following me buddy.
I'm looking at you right now,

3228
02:50:41.770 --> 02:50:44.580
but so there's a fine domain radio when you're looking at on the screen.

3229
02:50:44.581 --> 02:50:47.670
That seems true that is there a free domain radio one as well?
I think there is,

3230
02:50:47.671 --> 02:50:50.300
yeah.
Mike is going to kill me if I get oh you have a guy that does.
Yeah,

3231
02:50:50.310 --> 02:50:52.940
he does it.
So I do all my Twitter shit.
Yeah.

3232
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:57.260
So I have a guy that guy got,
might get mad at you put up Dick Pictures and shit.

3233
02:50:57.610 --> 02:51:00.210
He just,
if I get the feed wrong and he's going to be like,

3234
02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:02.700
I can't believe you'd do this at seven years and you can't give people your

3235
02:51:02.701 --> 02:51:03.151
Twitter feed.

3236
02:51:03.151 --> 02:51:06.390
What the Hell is wrong with you if you can't spell Stefan Molyneux our

3237
02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:08.660
understanding.
Yeah.
M o.

L.
Y.
N.
E.
U.
X.
That's a crafty name,
ladies and gentlemen.
It's,

3239
02:51:13.650 --> 02:51:15.530
it's an F,
not a p.
H.
S.
T.
E.

3240
02:51:15.530 --> 02:51:18.810
F as in frank [inaudible] main radio.com is where people should go.

3241
02:51:18.811 --> 02:51:21.330
They get free books and podcasts and no commercials and all that kind of stuff.

3242
02:51:21.331 --> 02:51:22.650
So,
all right.
Comedy wise,

3243
02:51:22.651 --> 02:51:27.651
I will be at the standup live in Phoenix this weekend with the lovely and

Lee.

02:51:37.171 --> 02:51:41.250
Funny.

It's just,
it's incredible.
It's like an ab workout.

3247

You know,
you come out with the tears in your eyes and ripples in your stomach.

3248
02:51:44.881 --> 02:51:48.100
I'm glad you had a good time,
