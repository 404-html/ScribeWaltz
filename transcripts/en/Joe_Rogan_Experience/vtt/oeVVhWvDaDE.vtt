00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to this thing.</v>

3
00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a talk once that this guy was giving about,</v>

4
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.841
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different psychological disorders in one of them was a theory that</v>

7
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>they had had at one point in time about schizophrenia,</v>

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia being,</v>

9
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>having something to do with smells and that</v>

11
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

12
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>that you give off certain that it's a form for mono will issue that you give off</v>

13
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>a certain smell and then people respond to that smell and they go,</v>

14
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:28.621
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

15
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>this guy's weird.</v>

16
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And then you go,</v>

17
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:30.931
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

18
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking weird.</v>

19
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts this chain reaction that makes you weird,</v>

20
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>that makes you yourself pheromones upset someone else.</v>

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:39.841
<v Speaker 1>Because your,</v>

23
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>your reality becomes defined by people avoiding you and freaking out by you and</v>

24
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>you can get kind of crazy because of the successive right.</v>

25
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>People even more secure in who they are.</v>

26
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

27
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>look at you fucking take that.</v>

28
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.781
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

29
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

30
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>we all start from different places.</v>

31
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Allows us,</v>

32
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>last year some people had shitty homes without organized parents like you.</v>

33
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

34
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.003
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

35
00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the schizophrenia,</v>

36
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I think the pheromone thing is huge.</v>

37
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.671
<v Speaker 1>I have dated,</v>

38
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I did remember dating someone.</v>

39
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>We didn't really have anything in common,</v>

40
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't stop smelling each other well,</v>

41
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>went to a bar and I just buried my face in his neck and I just like,</v>

42
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:13.501
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop.</v>

43
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>There was something,</v>

44
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>some people just smell like home for some reason.</v>

45
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.641
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily your home,</v>

46
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>but like you get a very comfortable feeling.</v>

47
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.603
<v Speaker 1>He's turned out to be,</v>

48
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>a nightmare.</v>

50
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

51
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>on a pheromone level,</v>

52
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>it was so,</v>

53
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.173
<v Speaker 1>he was a nightmare.</v>

54
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Nightmare psychologically.</v>

55
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

56
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>we just didn't work out and that's fine,</v>

57
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>but I remember just sitting there and I was just like,</v>

58
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I cannot stop doing this.</v>

59
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Was He the nightmare where you uh,</v>

60
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.651
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about off the air.</v>

61
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:38.484
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely,</v>

62
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not me.</v>

63
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say what it was because I wasn't listening to happens to know</v>

64
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>and we'll be like,</v>

65
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I know that was right.</v>

66
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:44.611
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

67
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

68
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I will share with you a story if you want to please,</v>

69
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.634
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

70
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Because this is failing everything.</v>

71
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>And I share this for the first time in Tampa this weekend and I hadn't told the</v>

72
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>scoot on up to the microphone,</v>

73
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.114
<v Speaker 1>let us know.</v>

74
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

75
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.061
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

76
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>this is just a quick not wearing headphones.</v>

77
00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm letting people know,</v>

78
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>like when you move away,</v>

79
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>left and to the right of these things,</v>

80
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>it changes the volume.</v>

81
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it really matters if you put it left to right?</v>

82
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:06.471
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

83
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

84
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.703
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't matter.</v>

85
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>But if we look looking for blanche,</v>

86
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for the volume.</v>

87
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It's up here.</v>

88

<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

90
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Next to the salt.</v>

91
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>That is a salt rock.</v>

92
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.963
<v Speaker 1>We're hippies here.</v>

93
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.691

<v Speaker 1>Jimi Hendrix.</v>

100
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't eat looking at the Predator thing,</v>

101
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>like if I had a sandwich or won't be able to look at that and eat,</v>

102
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.023
<v Speaker 1>it grosses me out.</v>

103
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just a mask.</v>

104
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Halloween costumes gross me out with the smell of latex and that's actually</v>

105
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

106
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.401
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>

107
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>a model that was made by special effects guy was looking at,</v>

108
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>cause he's so scary,</v>

109
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>but like that thing couldn't eat you.</v>

110
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

111
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.383
<v Speaker 1>you short could,</v>

112
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.843
<v Speaker 1>it would rip you apart.</v>

113
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.400
<v Speaker 1>It's small now.</v>

114
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

115
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>But it would chew chunks of you.</v>

116
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

117
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and those other things act as teeth to just pulls hunks of meat off you.</v>

118
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>But it depends on how it can articulate it.</v>

119
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to make them human.</v>

120
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.430

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

122

<v Speaker 1>the last one on the plane.</v>

137
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And we hit it off and he told me his name and he said he went to Yale and he</v>

138
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>worked in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

149
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>before we'd started dating,</v>

150
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>he told me he bought a house and I never wanted to see the house because I</v>

151
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.051
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

152
00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:45.671
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't dating him,</v>

153
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:46.504
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>

154
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So we start dating and the whole time we're dating,</v>

155
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>things start getting weird.</v>

156
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Like we get along perfectly,</v>

157
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but there are certain aspects of his personal life that are like not checking</v>

158
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:56.584
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

159
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Like I told my mom,</v>

160
00:03:58.931 --> 00:03:59.261
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

161
00:03:59.261 --> 00:03:59.650

163
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>So she googled him because that's what moms do.</v>

164
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And his work bio says that he graduated from,</v>

165
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.550
<v Speaker 1>not he's anyone to Yale is that he'd graduates around.</v>

168
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.071
<v Speaker 1>So I call him,</v>

169
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:12.281

170
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:12.881

171
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:13.121
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

172
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:13.954
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

173
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>they've cut and pasted the wrong bio.</v>

174
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:16.481
<v Speaker 1>It's a mess up.</v>

175
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.291
<v Speaker 1>My company's a mess.</v>

176
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:17.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

177
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:17.861
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

180
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I totally get it.</v>

181
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.711
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

182
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I want to send you a present.</v>

183
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>What's your address?</v>

184
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.351
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

185
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:23.411
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

186

<v Speaker 1>just send it to my work.</v>

187
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.241
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

188
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:25.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

189
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to send it to your house.</v>

190
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So he gives me this address.</v>

191
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>So I sent him a gift and he gets it.</v>

192
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And then one day I'm out with my friend Laura,</v>

193
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>we're at lunch and we start to build a case about why we think this guy is a</v>

194
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>liar as a joke at first cause nothing's checking out.</v>

195
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.441
<v Speaker 1>So Laura's like,</v>

196
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>let's drive by his house.</v>

197
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And I remember what the house looked like from the picture he'd sent me,</v>

198
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>cause like six months before we were dating,</v>

199
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.621
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

200
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>check out this house that I bought.</v>

201
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>So we go to the house and it's not a house,</v>

202
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:48.604
<v Speaker 1>it's an apartment.</v>

203
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>And Laura goes up to the door and she's like looking in and all of a sudden the</v>

204
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>girl opens the door and I'm just,</v>

257
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.873
<v Speaker 1>That's when he told me,</v>

258
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.601
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

259
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.500
<v Speaker 1>she's wants privacy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

262
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And I fell in love with him in the first place because he told me she had cancer</v>

263
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>and I got,</v>

264
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to take care of him.</v>

265
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And like that really like tugged on my heartstrings.</v>

266
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.661
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

267
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

268
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I met them on once and every single time after I met her once,</v>

269
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>like the first week we started dating and every time after that I'd be like,</v>

270
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>let me take,</v>

271
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.261
<v Speaker 1>if you're at work,</v>

272
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

273
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.161
<v Speaker 1>I've got free time.</v>

274
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Let me take your mom to lunch.</v>

275
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Let me take your mom to the movies.</v>

276
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Can we go to like anything?</v>

277
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Could never make it happen.</v>

278
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to brunch with your mom.</v>

279
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.181
<v Speaker 1>Let me do something.</v>

280
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Let me take her somewhere.</v>

281
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>No one you met the mom.</v>

282
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Did her illness ever come up in conversation?</v>

283
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought that would be tactless for me to be like,</v>

284
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>how's your cancer if she brought it up,</v>

285
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.610
<v Speaker 1>she brought her up.</v>

286
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

287
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

288
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.310
<v Speaker 1>They came with me to the craft store.</v>

289
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I had to buy stuff for Christmas party.</v>

290
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

291
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.413
<v Speaker 1>we didn't say much,</v>

292
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>but I never,</v>

293
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>so weeks are going by and I'm like,</v>

294
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.201

296
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.750

00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:57.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to give that to her.</v>

324
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:57.921
<v Speaker 1>He kept saying that,</v>

00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got their baggage,</v>

343
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>and I was trying to be respectful of that.</v>

344
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>A couple of weeks go by,</v>

345
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.040

<v Speaker 1>like this is someone that I love and we traveled together and you don't want to</v>

353
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:33.644
<v Speaker 1>push it.</v>

354
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.400

355
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

356
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I was only on campus for this amount of time,</v>

357
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:37.420
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

358
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

359
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 1>he'd already invited me to go to England with him for a skull and bones reunion,</v>

360
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.281
<v Speaker 1>like a whole thing.</v>

361
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:43.521
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

362
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>it got cancelled because his mom had cancer.</v>

363
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:45.651
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

364
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like letting all this go.</v>

365
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>So he goes out of town,</v>

366
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I go to five to five cookies,</v>

367
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist.</v>

368
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So I call him and I'm like,</v>

369
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>what are you fucking doing?</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he goes and he launching a store.</v>

371
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:00.891
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

372
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in the city he lived in before he goes,</v>

373
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I had this crazy ex girlfriend,</v>

374
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got a crazy ex.</v>

375
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.721
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

376
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and basically she wreak havoc on my social life and my personal life with my</v>

377
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>family and I'm just very protective of that.</v>

378
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And my mom's sick and I'm just trying to like keep her out of that.</v>

379
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.621
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

380
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:16.454
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

381
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:16.881
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

382
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you need to give me your address.</v>

383
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>This is the last time I'm going to ask you for this.</v>

384
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying not to like push something.</v>

385
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.951
<v Speaker 1>So he comes over,</v>

386
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>he gives me the address,</v>

387
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>his mom's number and his email.</v>

388
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

389
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm an open book,</v>

390
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to know.</v>

391
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>So I took that as a sign of like,</v>

392
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.341
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

393
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>that was really hard for you.</v>

394
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Gail registrar comes back,</v>

395
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>no record of him.</v>

396
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

397
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 1>none of my friends that went to Yale know who he is.</v>

398
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And every time I ask him anything,</v>

399
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 1>like the answer is super simple.</v>

400
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Like if I asked you where you live,</v>

401
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you just tell me to just roll off your tongue.</v>

402
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's everything was so I go to that house,</v>

403
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>like I let a couple of weeks go by.</v>

404
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>My birthday happens.</v>

405
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:47.091
<v Speaker 1>We had Christmas,</v>

406
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:47.924
<v Speaker 1>my birthday,</v>

407
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's a day before I'm leaving for San Antonio to go to play this comedy</v>

408
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>

409
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>and I go to his house and my friend,</v>

410
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's not his house,</v>

411
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like some other woman lives.</v>

412
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>They're like an old woman lives there.</v>

413
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not as mom's house.</v>

414
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>And he sees like my mom,</v>

415
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.180
<v Speaker 1>he's like you.</v>

416
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>My mom bought the house from me to keep my cash liquid.</v>

417
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>The title's not in her name.</v>

418
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I call him and I was like,</v>

419
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking out of your life because you're lying about something.</v>

420
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And it all came crashing down at 7:00 AM he texts me,</v>

421
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

422
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.713
<v Speaker 1>I never went to Yale.</v>

423
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I never bought a house.</v>

424
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been lying to you for over a year.</v>

425
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And so it was just one of those like,</v>

426
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>and then so you start going back and then you start wondering if you're crazy</v>

427
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.661
<v Speaker 1>and then you're like,</v>

428
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>does your mom even if cancer did you,</v>

429
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>are you really in the small of cancer?</v>

430
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say she does,</v>

431
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's really weird that I met her once and then like I was like,</v>

432
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of the doctor at the hospital where she is?</v>

433
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:39.961
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

434
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:40.794
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

435
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like very like wouldn't give any information.</v>

436
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.003
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

437
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 1>and so yesterday I wrote an email,</v>

438
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I'm sharing all of this,</v>

439
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>but this is very funny to me.</v>

440
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.861
<v Speaker 1>I wrote everybody,</v>

441
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>when you break up with someone,</v>

442
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>depending on how tactful you are,</v>

443
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>you hold back on what you want to say.</v>

444
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.941
<v Speaker 1>Like we all say,</v>

445
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:57.140
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

446
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:57.631
<v Speaker 1>you're an asshole.</v>

447
00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I hate you.</v>

448
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>But like then there's like the dark shit that you don't write.</v>

449
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote an email that I almost,</v>

450
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it,</v>

451
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>but I almost want to post online as like a template for any girl that ever wants</v>

452
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 1>to like enraged her next boyfriend.</v>

453
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>And I just lost my shit and it felt so good.</v>

454
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:12.901
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck.</v>

455
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:13.734
<v Speaker 1>Having tact.</v>

456
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Like it just was the best thing ever.</v>

457
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Well it sounds like you gave him every possible,</v>

458
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>every possible scenario for him to be truthful.</v>

459
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you gave him every possible like,</v>

460
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.930
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he's this and maybe it's that you gave a lot of leeway so much so and</v>

461
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:34.471
<v Speaker 1>then every day I'd be like,</v>

462
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:34.981
<v Speaker 1>if you're lying,</v>

463
00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>please just tell me or just tell anyone to look me in the eye and be like,</v>

464
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:38.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lying.</v>

465
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Which makes me think if we ever got married we would go on a boat and he would</v>

466
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 1>kill me.</v>

467
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 1>But the whole never know.</v>

468
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

469
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You never know how that shit happens.</v>

470
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>You find out he's got a life insurance policy on you and I and I accidentally</v>

471
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 1>signed it.</v>

472
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you find out where he worked?</v>

473
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Did he actually have the job that he had?</v>

474
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>He had left the company and all of these things are weird.</v>

475
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Like he left the company and like a weird way and he started his own so that</v>

476
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 1>like I just at some point it's not up to you to piece together what's real and</v>

477
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>what isn't.</v>

478
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I told this story on the radio in Tampa and when I got off the air,</v>

479
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>all of these people that sent me tweets with Hashtag Yale and somebody sent me a</v>

480
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>picture of someone running the Boston marathon in a Yale shirt and they're like,</v>

481
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 1>is your ex boyfriend running the Boston marathon?</v>

482
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh the poor bastard.</v>

483
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you don't say his name publicly shame him because the poor fuck is</v>

484
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:20.640
<v Speaker 1>already a mess.</v>

485
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I told him he's fucking lucky.</v>

486
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like you're I think on that show I did but I didn't.</v>

487
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I've never say the last name.</v>

488
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Well he is lucky you could make them a part of your act with his actual name.</v>

489
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's so little bit.</v>

490
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 1>If I could think of unrelatable the whole like that amount of lying,</v>

491
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>like cheating is one thing I thought meant you meant like as a bit right.</v>

492
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very relatable.</v>

493
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I think I will get around to it.</v>

494
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I think eventually it'll stop.</v>

495
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop being cause I'm not sad anymore,</v>

496
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:52.820
<v Speaker 1>but my email pretty much included cause like obviously you know if you break up</v>

497
00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:55.070
<v Speaker 1>with someone don't want to hear about people are sleeping with right.</v>

498
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>He got upset because I posted a picture when I was in Saint Martin of Mian</v>

499
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Topless beach with two friends in front of me so he can't see anything.</v>

500
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.981
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

501
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I felt that you posted that picture and it was directed at me,</v>

502
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>which it wasn't like I posted it like a hot picture.</v>

503
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I just unleashed on this email and I was like,</v>

504
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 1>it's none of your fucking business.</v>

505
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:11.621
<v Speaker 1>What I do.</v>

506
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:12.101
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

507
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Saint Martin,</v>

508
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I hooked up with a guy and he went down on me for 20 minutes and it was fucking</v>

509
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.073
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

510
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I will never talk to him.</v>

511
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

512
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that's dark.</v>

513
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.953
<v Speaker 1>It felt so good.</v>

514
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh that makes you cringe.</v>

515
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of the act doesn't make me cringe at all.</v>

516
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.640
<v Speaker 1>The writing that email and say,</v>

517
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

518
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.311
<v Speaker 1>that was a guy and he went down.</v>

519
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:34.144
<v Speaker 1>He ate my pussy.</v>

520
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say anything.</v>

521
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Same thing you said it.</v>

522
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question though.</v>

523
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 1>At what point are you as a human being allowed to just unleash and be like,</v>

524
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:43.084
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

525
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.233
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

526
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.381
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

527
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that guy's worth your effort,</v>

528
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.570
<v Speaker 2>making more tension with him.</v>

530
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

531
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.200
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy person that guys fabricating in existence.</v>

532
00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:55.680
<v Speaker 2>He fabricated as education.</v>

533
00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:56.300
<v Speaker 2>He fabric.</v>

534
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.760
<v Speaker 2>He may have fabricated his mother being sick.</v>

535
00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:02.510
<v Speaker 2>He fabricated where he lived twice or three times.</v>

536
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.583
<v Speaker 2>Three times.</v>

537
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

538
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

539
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.490
<v Speaker 2>he's probably pathological.</v>

540
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:07.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

541
00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:10.010
<v Speaker 2>there are people that just can't stop lying.</v>

542
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.731
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

543
00:13:10.731 --> 00:13:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it before.</v>

544
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.230
<v Speaker 2>When you're living in Hollywood,</v>

545
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

546
00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:16.580
<v Speaker 2>if you live around here,</v>

547
00:13:16.581 --> 00:13:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

548
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.230
<v Speaker 2>you'll meet people that are,</v>

549
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:18.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.800
<v Speaker 2>fake it til you make it type people that will tell you stories that just don't</v>

551
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.730
<v Speaker 2>add up.</v>

552
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.330
<v Speaker 2>And in the old days used to just have to kind of accept people at those stories.</v>

553
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.660
<v Speaker 2>But now your mom can just Google them and find out anything</v>

554
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.480
<v Speaker 1>thing and she got on it.</v>

555
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.071
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

556
00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Your mom's awesome.</v>

557
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Good for her.</v>

558
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.553
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

559
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.761
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this,</v>

560
00:13:37.761 --> 00:13:38.340
<v Speaker 2>cause this is,</v>

561
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.173
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

562
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.850
<v Speaker 2>this is the difference between a man and a woman because you could tell me that</v>

563
00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:48.380
<v Speaker 2>you went to pierce college or you went to a high school and you dropped out when</v>

564
00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you're 16,</v>

565
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.480
<v Speaker 2>and if you're,</v>

566
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:51.800
<v Speaker 2>you and I like you,</v>

567
00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't care at all.</v>

568
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.080
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean anything to me.</v>

569
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you a nurse,</v>

570
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're a doctor.</v>

571
00:13:57.561 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're a brain surgeon or a girl who works in a clothing store.</v>

572
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.370
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter to me if I do not care.</v>

573
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I do not care if someone's fun and nice to be around.</v>

574
00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I do not care.</v>

575
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.290
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

576
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.981
<v Speaker 2>I never have.</v>

577
00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:10.814
<v Speaker 2>I never will.</v>

578
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

579
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.070
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's,</v>

580
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

581
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between a man and a woman,</v>

582
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.810
<v Speaker 2>like women desire men to be successful.</v>

583
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:21.451
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

584
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:22.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole,</v>

585
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.430
<v Speaker 1>that's an illusion thing.</v>

586
00:14:23.431 --> 00:14:24.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a protective thing.</v>

587
00:14:24.481 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

588
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.063
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

589
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I don't want a date like a homeless person.</v>

590
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.693
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

591
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.810
<v Speaker 1>What killed nor does,</v>

592
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.500
<v Speaker 1>nor do I,</v>

593
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:31.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

594
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

595
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't want someone who can't feed themselves.</v>

596
00:14:34.651 --> 00:14:35.484
<v Speaker 1>Does.</v>

597
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what kills me is that those things genuinely don't matter and he chose</v>

598
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:42.300
<v Speaker 1>to judge me ahead of time,</v>

599
00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:46.290
<v Speaker 1>or maybe he's got a chemical imbalance from the day I met him on the plane.</v>

600
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:47.124
<v Speaker 1>I went to Yale.</v>

601
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with lying to a stranger or a pretty girl on a plane.</v>

602
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't care where there is something wrong with you,</v>

603
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.170
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

604
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

605
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 1>there's no ramifications for lying to a stranger if you never see them again.</v>

606
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

607
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.303
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

608
00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.371
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't bother me.</v>

609
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you own a house,</v>

610
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>so it irks me.</v>

611
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a shame because you lied about two things.</v>

612
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's just too,</v>

613
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 1>and you ruined a perfectly good relationship.</v>

614
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 1>If it's just those two things in your insecure,</v>

615
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:08.991
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to Harvard.</v>

616
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:09.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a road scholar.</v>

617
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you went to Yale,</v>

618
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.450
<v Speaker 1>how long did you guys date for?</v>

619
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I knew him for over a year and we dated for about three months.</v>

620
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And what was it about his personality that was attracted to you?</v>

621
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Does a whizzer a unique thing that you could define?</v>

622
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.983
<v Speaker 1>Truthfully,</v>

623
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean as friends,</v>

624
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:26.534
<v Speaker 1>he was very smart.</v>

625
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

626
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.681
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

627
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 1>for me intelligence is a huge thing and very,</v>

628
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:31.220
<v Speaker 1>and a little like funniest,</v>

629
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 1>snobby way,</v>

630
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 1>like a little con and I kind of liked that and he's very smart,</v>

631
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:35.001
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

632
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 1>very smart,</v>

633
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.591
<v Speaker 1>a little Dorky,</v>

634
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:37.424
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

635
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.230
<v Speaker 1>But when he,</v>

636
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 1>when we were friends and when he called me and was like,</v>

637
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 1>we can't go on this trip to the skull and bones thing because my mom has cancer.</v>

638
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.981
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance.</v>

639
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:46.641
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be weird.</v>

640
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

641
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I think only women will relate to this for the whole time we knew each other.</v>

642
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>He put me on this pedestal,</v>

643
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.650
<v Speaker 1>always asking,</v>

644
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.201
<v Speaker 1>can you please,</v>

645
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:54.921
<v Speaker 1>can we please date?</v>

646
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:55.581
<v Speaker 1>Can I have the kids?</v>

647
00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Will you be my girlfriend?</v>

648
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:56.901
<v Speaker 1>And I were like,</v>

649
00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:57.591
<v Speaker 1>we would hang out.</v>

650
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:58.041
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

651
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:58.521
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>

652
00:15:58.521 --> 00:15:59.354
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not into this.</v>

653
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So no one wants to be on a pedestal because there's nothing for you to do.</v>

654
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.441
<v Speaker 1>His mom had cancer.</v>

655
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

656
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I can take care of you now.</v>

657
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you've been nothing but sweet to me.</v>

658
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Now let me take care of you.</v>

659
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And in getting to take care of him,</v>

660
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I started to like him cause I had like an active role.</v>

661
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

662
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Um Wow.</v>

663
00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:17.390
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

664
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:17.571
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

665
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>those things didn't matter.</v>

666
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So is that like the maternal instincts that you have is like the taking care of</v>

667
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:24.850
<v Speaker 1>instincts,</v>

668
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

669
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:27.920
<v Speaker 1>because some women have those instincts sort of built in those?</v>

670
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:28.401
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

671
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>But I think it was also just,</v>

672
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing for me to do to have an active role in our relationship as</v>

673
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:34.641
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

674
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Like he had a lot of money and a lot of time and he could do nice things like he</v>

675
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

676
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 1>did he really have a lot of money because you'd have a lot of money.</v>

677
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

678
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:42.741
<v Speaker 1>how's that possible?</v>

679
00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 1>He has a fucking roommate.</v>

680
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.141
<v Speaker 1>So the roommate,</v>

681
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:45.380
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

682
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>if the answer was he goes,</v>

683
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:46.671
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

684
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>my lease was up in Santa Monica.</v>

685
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.711
<v Speaker 1>I was going to buy a house.</v>

686
00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 1>But then I decided I thought it was going to move.</v>

687
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.660
<v Speaker 1>He goes again.</v>

688
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Then you and I started dating.</v>

689
00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't wanna move.</v>

690
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I moved in with a friend to help her pay her rent cause he's never home and he's</v>

691
00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:55.911
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

692
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:56.960
<v Speaker 1>so I just leave my stuff there,</v>

693
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 1>but how can they even trust that I couldn't,</v>

694
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 1>he did send me a picture of his bank account to like why use a human being?</v>

695
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.771
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

696
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:04.604
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask for it.</v>

697
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Speaker 1>He sent you the numbers in his bag.</v>

698
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Can you send me like a screen grab of it?</v>

699
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker doctored his bank.</v>

700
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 1>He might've shot the shit out of his bank account.</v>

701
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

702
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I saw the way he lived in the way he,</v>

704
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do think the money thing is real.</v>

705
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:18.651
<v Speaker 1>We did,</v>

706
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:19.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe it may,</v>

707
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I may or may not have done a background check.</v>

708
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 1>So I definitely know when he came from.</v>

709
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

710
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>but the answer your question to the House and the,</v>

711
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 1>the college and like he lied about weird things.</v>

712
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.793
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

713
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing man.</v>

714
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Like that saying you went to Yale,</v>

715
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.910
<v Speaker 1>like the Harvard,</v>

716
00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:41.744
<v Speaker 1>Yale,</v>

717
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Ivy League.</v>

718
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Like that's like,</v>

719
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

720
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:44.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

721
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>like I don't,</v>

722
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.761
<v Speaker 1>and then he would sit,</v>

723
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:49.620
<v Speaker 1>my cousin went to Yale and they would have a conversation and he would talk</v>

724
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:50.410
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

725
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.000
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

726
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

727
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

728
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Poor bet you're ripping paper over there.</v>

729
00:17:54.461 --> 00:17:57.800
<v Speaker 1>If you hear that and she's going crazy fucker.</v>

730
00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

731
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

732
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:58.891
<v Speaker 1>not even that.</v>

733
00:17:58.891 --> 00:17:59.611
<v Speaker 1>Every time we think about it,</v>

734
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I go back and I'm like,</v>

735
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:00.781
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

736
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 1>What clues did I miss?</v>

737
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:02.671
<v Speaker 1>What am I?</v>

738
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:02.941
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

739
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:03.774
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

740
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.100
<v Speaker 1>what am I realizing now?</v>

741
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm trying to like put the dots,</v>

742
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.683
<v Speaker 1>connect the dots.</v>

743
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>The day I met him,</v>

744
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I went on Twitter and I followed him and his Twitter handle hadn't had a Yale</v>

745
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:15.054
<v Speaker 1>reference in it.</v>

746
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.321
<v Speaker 1>And I asked him,</v>

747
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:16.441
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

748
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:16.861
<v Speaker 1>when we broke up,</v>

749
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:17.071
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

750
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 1>keeping your Twitter was about Yale.</v>

751
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:18.991
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

752
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I made up my Twitter account the day I met you.</v>

753
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

754
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Just because he met you and he wanted,</v>

755
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.390
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

756
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:26.580
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

757
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:26.911
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

758
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:27.481
<v Speaker 1>maybe he lied.</v>

759
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe change the name.</v>

760
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

761
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

762
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 1>What a psycho.</v>

763
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 1>And every time I tell the story,</v>

764
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:34.230
<v Speaker 1>like I think about different things that I've missed.</v>

765
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>So Jesus Christ,</v>

766
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 1>the good news is when something that weird happens to you,</v>

767
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no lesson to be learned.</v>

768
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:42.234
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

769
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 1>oh I thought he was cheating.</v>

770
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a normal thing.</v>

771
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not something I'll take into another relationship.</v>

772
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Well you kind of do because you guys do lie about their past to become more</v>

773
00:18:52.971 --> 00:18:54.230
<v Speaker 2>impressive to a girl.</v>

774
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:54.741
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

775
00:18:54.741 --> 00:18:55.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is really,</v>

776
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.600
<v Speaker 2>it's super common,</v>

777
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.553
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

778
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.590
<v Speaker 2>And now you'll sort of recognize those sort of bullshit signs maybe quicker.</v>

779
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe it's like when a guy throws that out there like makes a big deal out</v>

780
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:08.031
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

781
00:19:08.031 --> 00:19:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe that's when you look.</v>

782
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.483
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

783
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

784
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people like it wasn't really online.</v>

785
00:19:15.351 --> 00:19:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Some people take pride in not really being online a lot that,</v>

786
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Internet helps.</v>

787
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Like even if you can,</v>

788
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I went on a date last night and you could Google the guy and everything about</v>

789
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:22.041
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

790
00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Is there an,</v>

791
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.483
<v Speaker 1>and you're like</v>

792
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.000
<v Speaker 1>me and this guy had no friends in common.</v>

793
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Like the email I wrote him was so I guess so pointed.</v>

794
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.090
<v Speaker 1>We forward it to me.</v>

795
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:35.631
<v Speaker 1>I'll send it.</v>

796
00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you right after this.</v>

797
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I went online and he had deleted his Twitter account.</v>

798
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.381
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

799
00:19:39.381 --> 00:19:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I think I made this motherfucker leave cyberspace.</v>

800
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.211
<v Speaker 2>Well you should.</v>

801
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's for him.</v>

802
00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be some people just do that over and over and over again though.</v>

803
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm my friend Eddie met this guy and this guy,</v>

804
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.913
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

805
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.490
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

806
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.350
<v Speaker 2>he was working on,</v>

807
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.690
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to put him in some project.</v>

808
00:19:59.691 --> 00:20:04.220
<v Speaker 2>He was doing some television project and he claimed that he had these studios</v>

809
00:20:04.221 --> 00:20:07.130
<v Speaker 2>and he was working with all these networks and this and that.</v>

810
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.800
<v Speaker 2>But where we found out that he was full of Shit,</v>

811
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was full of Shit right away.</v>

812
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.011
<v Speaker 2>I told Eddie,</v>

813
00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:12.321
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

814
00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way Scott talks.</v>

815
00:20:13.641 --> 00:20:14.780
<v Speaker 2>He named jobs too much.</v>

816
00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:14.991
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

817
00:20:14.991 --> 00:20:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a bullshitter.</v>

818
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a certain thing that people do when they bullshit when they talk</v>

819
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:20.030
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>

820
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I've got a project going on with Steven Spielberg and this,</v>

821
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.770
<v Speaker 2>there's just no fucking way Tom Cruise is passing on the project.</v>

822
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:25.551
<v Speaker 2>We want to bring it to you.</v>

823
00:20:25.551 --> 00:20:26.384
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

824
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.491
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

826
00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:29.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of those things.</v>

827
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:29.811
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

828
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:30.650
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

829
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:20:31.071 --> 00:20:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I was peripheral,</v>

831
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.721
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

832
00:20:32.721 --> 00:20:33.554
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

833
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.451
<v Speaker 2>interacting with sky,</v>

834
00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:35.470
<v Speaker 2>but Eddie was interacting.</v>

835
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:35.781
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

836
00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm like any of that guy's a bullshitter.</v>

837
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.933
<v Speaker 2>He smells,</v>

838
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.361
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

839
00:20:38.361 --> 00:20:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

840
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.643
<v Speaker 2>he just smells.</v>

841
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

842
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

843
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.700
<v Speaker 2>then the guy starts taking Jujitsu class.</v>

844
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

845
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean zero experience in Jujitsu and then calls Eddie after doing Jujitsu for</v>

846
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

847
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.011
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

848
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 2>like a day,</v>

849
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 2>maybe two days and is talking about catching people and triangles and all these</v>

850
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 2>different submissions that he pulled off,</v>

851
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 2>which is never going to happen.</v>

852
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just not going to happen unless,</v>

853
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 2>unless you're doing it with someone who's absolutely physically and competent.</v>

854
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

855
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 2>when you first start out,</v>

856
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what you're doing,</v>

857
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't learn that day one,</v>

858
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:10.811
<v Speaker 2>we'll also,</v>

859
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 2>he's not a stud.</v>

860
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 2>The guy wasn't like,</v>

861
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.470
<v Speaker 2>there's certain guys like you could tell a guy,</v>

862
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 2>he's like a pro basketball player who's just a fucking athlete and maybe he</v>

863
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>loves MMA and maybe he's never taken the Jujitsu classes life.</v>

864
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:25.000
<v Speaker 2>But he's seen a few fights and if he recognizes the position that you teach it</v>

865
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>

866
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.620
<v Speaker 2>he could maybe pull it off on someone who sucks but it's an advanced move like</v>

867
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 2>setting up a triangle,</v>

868
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:31.361
<v Speaker 2>finishing it.</v>

869
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>It's an advanced move and this guy was like,</v>

870
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I got three triangles today and practice and to armbars when we were like,</v>

871
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:36.611
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

872
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:37.300
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

873
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.781
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

874
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I told you he's a bullshitter.</v>

875
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And then he go,</v>

876
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 2>well he did actually go to class.</v>

877
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 2>He did not ever tap anyone ever.</v>

878
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 2>He is physically and competent.</v>

879
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.851
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

880
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Speaker 2>if you see him,</v>

881
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you look at his body is like this guy is lucky if he can brush his teeth like</v>

882
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a fucking athlete at all.</v>

883
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.063
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was just like,</v>

884
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a gumby.</v>

885
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 2>He was a guy who essentially had never worked out his whole life and then all of</v>

886
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>a sudden he's claiming he's tapping people out in Jujitsu.</v>

887
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.580
<v Speaker 2>But that was just confirmation.</v>

888
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.911
<v Speaker 2>Then ed,</v>

889
00:22:05.911 --> 00:22:06.744
<v Speaker 2>he looked into his,</v>

890
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Speaker 2>his whole situation and found out the guy was just a total complete liar and</v>

891
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 2>broke it down with them over the phone.</v>

892
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.880
<v Speaker 2>There's another one I've got,</v>

893
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy,</v>

894
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.230
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

895
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.063
<v Speaker 2>his name,</v>

896
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.470
<v Speaker 2>his real name was Ralph and he was telling us that his name was Rafael Tori.</v>

897
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:21.930
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

898
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.290
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that he was a black belt in Jujitsu,</v>

899
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 2>but just as friends or like how did you,</v>

900
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 2>well this guy I'm telling us.</v>

901
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

902
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 2>He was at his friend and he was a journalist for a mixed martial arts magazine,</v>

903
00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 2>an online magazine.</v>

904
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.260
<v Speaker 2>And so he would go to these events and uh,</v>

905
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 2>and he would do,</v>

906
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:40.571
<v Speaker 2>Eddie was a,</v>

907
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the commentators for the king of the cage,</v>

908
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 2>which is a smaller mixed martial arts,</v>

909
00:22:44.171 --> 00:22:44.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

910
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>organization familiar with are,</v>

911
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

913
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

914
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Rafael Tory actually had a fake fight.</v>

915
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

916
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 2>he said that he was a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.</v>

917
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:55.600
<v Speaker 2>He was not at all.</v>

918
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Eddie rolled with them.</v>

919
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 2>And Eddie is a black belt.</v>

920
00:22:57.821 --> 00:22:58.361
<v Speaker 2>And at the time,</v>

921
00:22:58.361 --> 00:22:59.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Getty was a black,</v>

922
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:01.570
<v Speaker 2>but I think Eddie was a brown belt and then he just smashed him,</v>

923
00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 2>just tapped him left and right.</v>

924
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 2>And he was like confused.</v>

925
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:04.511
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

926
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:04.631
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

927
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:05.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe they didn't.</v>

928
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it wasn't really trying.</v>

929
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't get it because he was a bigger guy too.</v>

930
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It was like way too easy for Eddie to tap them.</v>

931
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.811
<v Speaker 2>So Eddie there,</v>

932
00:23:11.811 --> 00:23:14.770
<v Speaker 2>there was a few like red flags that popped up there.</v>

933
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

934
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.870
<v Speaker 2>long story short,</v>

935
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.520
<v Speaker 2>the guy never digits before it was a complete fake would disappear.</v>

936
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.570
<v Speaker 2>And here's a good one.</v>

937
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Went away.</v>

938
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

939
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Told his friend to drop him off.</v>

940
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Like pulled up to this a wooded area,</v>

941
00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:29.050
<v Speaker 2>told his friend to drop off.</v>

942
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.280
<v Speaker 2>He had a duffle bag with them,</v>

943
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 2>filled with some shit.</v>

944
00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

945
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.150
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

946
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 2>drop me off here.</v>

947
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fight in this,</v>

948
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:35.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

949
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 2>no rules.</v>

950
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Karate tournament out in the woods and uh,</v>

951
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll be back in two days.</v>

952
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.651
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

953
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So his friend comes back in two days and now he doesn't have the duffle bag</v>

954
00:23:45.171 --> 00:23:45.400
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

955
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Buddy has a trophy that's the same size as the fucking duffle bag.</v>

956
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:49.121
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

957
00:23:49.121 --> 00:23:49.420
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

958
00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I won this no rules karate tournament.</v>

959
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

960
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.211
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's like,</v>

961
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:53.601
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

962
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:54.434
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

963
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

964
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 2>so the guy completely made up is martial arts background completely made up.</v>

965
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.140
<v Speaker 2>He also went to Thailand for a fight and got a guy in a twister.</v>

966
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>A twister is a very complex move that involves not just getting on top of Oh</v>

967
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:09.191
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

968
00:24:09.191 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 2>but getting on top of guy inside control,</v>

969
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:15.970
<v Speaker 2>lacing one leg with your two legs rolling on your shoulders.</v>

970
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 2>So you go behind him,</v>

971
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:17.954
<v Speaker 2>take his bath,</v>

972
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.150
<v Speaker 2>you wrap his arm around your head,</v>

973
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.910
<v Speaker 2>grab his head and Torque his spine.</v>

974
00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:25.280
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredibly complex maneuver.</v>

975
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.770
<v Speaker 2>This guy had just learned it and he started pulling it off on people in,</v>

976
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 2>in a fucking no holds barred fight.</v>

977
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 2>So there was all these things.</v>

978
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:32.631
<v Speaker 2>So Eddie,</v>

979
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Eddie cuts the guy off and he's like,</v>

980
00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:34.784
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

981
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 2>you're bullshit artists.</v>

982
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I know you're full of shit.</v>

983
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:38.210
<v Speaker 2>You're not a fucking black belt.</v>

984
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 2>You're not fighting in these fucking fights.</v>

985
00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 2>He's wanting to be near it.</v>

986
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

987
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.141
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

988
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I know that your fight.</v>

989
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:45.640
<v Speaker 2>But Eddie had been friends with this guy for months and months and months and</v>

990
00:24:45.641 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 2>just slowly piled on the bullshit,</v>

991
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

992
00:24:47.871 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 2>just not trying to investigate a guy,</v>

993
00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:51.050
<v Speaker 2>just thinking he's a cool guy.</v>

994
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 2>He was already in the mix before Eddie got there.</v>

995
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 2>He was already deepen with these mixed martial arts guy.</v>

996
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 2>So he just assumed that a guy's legit.</v>

997
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Turns out as the time goes on,</v>

998
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.510
<v Speaker 2>he murdered a guy,</v>

999
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 2>murdered a guy who was married to a girl that he was fucking,</v>

1000
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.150
<v Speaker 2>he got close to the guy and I guess he had like some sort of karate school that</v>

1001
00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:18.050
<v Speaker 2>he was teaching that with his fake fake martial arts and uh,</v>

1002
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.640
<v Speaker 2>got the guy to come to his school,</v>

1003
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 2>strangled him,</v>

1004
00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:21.344
<v Speaker 2>killed him,</v>

1005
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.480
<v Speaker 2>and then was driving the guy's car,</v>

1006
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:24.231
<v Speaker 2>Rau witnesses,</v>

1007
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:26.980
<v Speaker 2>saw him drive the guy's car around and um,</v>

1008
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:32.470
<v Speaker 2>had a gun that he gave to my friend Gerald and told Gerald to hide it.</v>

1009
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 2>And then Gerald,</v>

1010
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:34.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1011
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 2>calls me up and tells me the whole situation.</v>

1012
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:37.851
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:38.390
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1014

<v Speaker 2>what he kills him.</v>

1017
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.830
<v Speaker 2>And then Gerald goes to the cops.</v>

1018
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.431
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1019
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:47.510
<v Speaker 2>And then the cops called me because Gerald had apparently been,</v>

1020
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.403
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1021
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.640
<v Speaker 2>they had wiretapped him while all this was going down because they suspected</v>

1129
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:24.591
<v Speaker 1>Did you talk,</v>

1130
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:24.891
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

1131
00:28:24.891 --> 00:28:25.640

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.870
<v Speaker 1>he apologize.</v>

1134
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.160
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't like Poof,</v>

1135
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:28.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm gone.</v>

1136
00:28:28.461 --> 00:28:29.121
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of,</v>

1137
00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:29.421
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1138
00:28:29.421 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 1>But did you think about like keeping the Moran couldn't,</v>

1139
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.900
<v Speaker 1>couldn't because like you have to take yourself,</v>

1140
00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1141
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.531
<v Speaker 1>I even,</v>

1142
00:28:36.531 --> 00:28:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I knew this,</v>

1143
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to take yourself out of like you,</v>

1144
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.730
<v Speaker 1>your hurt and your heart's broken.</v>

1145
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.200
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to let that heal.</v>

1146
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.270
<v Speaker 1>But getting back with someone like that is not,</v>

1147
00:28:44.271 --> 00:28:44.631
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1148
00:28:44.631 --> 00:28:46.820
<v Speaker 1>I lose respect from my all my friends and family.</v>

1149
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And then also like,</v>

1150
00:28:48.411 --> 00:28:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust that person.</v>

1151
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.800
<v Speaker 1>The end game for you is that you'd be dating someone you couldn't trust.</v>

1152
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.460
<v Speaker 1>However.</v>

1153
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1154
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:53.721
<v Speaker 1>but I asked,</v>

1155
00:28:53.721 --> 00:28:53.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1156
00:28:53.871 --> 00:28:55.060
<v Speaker 1>when he just never,</v>

1157
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.731
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing.</v>

1158
00:28:55.731 --> 00:28:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And I said in the email,</v>

1159
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.291
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1160
00:28:57.291 --> 00:28:57.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1161
00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't have all the answers from him.</v>

1162
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.601
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1163
00:28:59.601 --> 00:29:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to trade my lack of closure for the privilege of never having to</v>

1164
00:29:04.281 --> 00:29:05.114
<v Speaker 1>talk to you again.</v>

1165
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:06.830
<v Speaker 1>So I will write my own closure.</v>

1166
00:29:06.831 --> 00:29:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll draw my own conclusions.</v>

1167
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I won't defend you to anyone.</v>

1168
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And he went down on me for 20 minutes.</v>

1169
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1170
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.490
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1171
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So funny outside is outside too,</v>

1172
00:29:16.911 --> 00:29:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1173
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Danger,</v>

1174
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.561
<v Speaker 1>danger,</v>

1175
00:29:18.561 --> 00:29:19.394
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>

1176
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1177
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.080
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy that did that.</v>

1178
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 2>The lack of closure thing is a big thing,</v>

1179
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:24.031
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1180
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Cause you'll stay up late to try to figure it out.</v>

1181
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you like find yourself like during the day,</v>

1182
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:31.010
<v Speaker 2>like just driving around trying to piece it together?</v>

1183
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Where did it,</v>

1185
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting on the plane yesterday and like you're here,</v>

1186
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.590
<v Speaker 1>especially when you just go through a breakup,</v>

1187
00:29:35.591 --> 00:29:35.950
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

1188
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:36.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:29:36.101 --> 00:29:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you think about that person,</v>

1190
00:29:37.211 --> 00:29:38.044
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1191
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And the hard thing is not,</v>

1192
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm past that phase.</v>

1193
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no,</v>

1194
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:41.651
<v Speaker 1>the blocked,</v>

1195
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 1>like I can't call him or anything,</v>

1196
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:43.961
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

1197
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>You sit there and you go back over things and then I start like,</v>

1198
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 1>here's a weird piece of the puzzle if you want to know what I was thinking.</v>

1199
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1200
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 1>when before we were dating,</v>

1201
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.350
<v Speaker 1>he invited me to go to England for the skull and bones thing and obviously not</v>

1202
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:55.821
<v Speaker 1>in skull and bones.</v>

1203
00:29:55.821 --> 00:29:56.654
<v Speaker 1>You didn't go to Yale.</v>

1204
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.030
<v Speaker 1>And even after this all happened,</v>

1205
00:29:58.031 --> 00:29:58.211
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1206
00:29:58.211 --> 00:29:58.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1207
00:29:58.301 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 1>my dad was in skull and bones and I'm like,</v>

1208
00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 1>your dad went to Yale Grad school,</v>

1209
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

1210
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 1>What's Your Dad's name?</v>

1211
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 1>But Dad's dead in real life.</v>

1212
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean that for.</v>

1213
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1214
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>he invited me to go to England,</v>

1215
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:13.770
<v Speaker 1>so I was going to go separate rooms and I went out to dinner with a friend who</v>

1216
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 1>has a body that I really liked.</v>

1217
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 1>So I took a picture of my drink and in the background was my friend's body.</v>

1218
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 1>He's like a big guy.</v>

1219
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 1>So the point of the picture was to be like,</v>

1220
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:23.650
<v Speaker 1>look at this hot thing.</v>

1221
00:30:23.651 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a drink was not so much to me,</v>

1222
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:25.491
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1223
00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 1>look at the drink.</v>

1224
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1225
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I think he saw that picture because I don't remember if it was before or after,</v>

1226
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:32.860
<v Speaker 1>but that was the night he called me and said,</v>

1227
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.701
<v Speaker 1>we can't go to England.</v>

1228
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:34.534
<v Speaker 1>My mom has cancer.</v>

1229
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I think he saw that picture on Instagram and he was like,</v>

1230
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I got to do something to shake this up if the mom,</v>

1231
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.800
<v Speaker 1>if the mom doesn't have cancer.</v>

1232
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:43.600
<v Speaker 1>It's odd that that was the night of all nights.</v>

1233
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 2>So you were friends only up until that point.</v>

1234
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1235
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>

1236
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.820
<v Speaker 2>There's friends and there's friends with an agenda and you and I are friends.</v>

1237
00:30:54.341 --> 00:30:55.690
<v Speaker 2>We will never have sex.</v>

1238
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that right now.</v>

1239
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm married,</v>

1240
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.060
<v Speaker 2>we're friends.</v>

1241
00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to let it happen.</v>

1242
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Eliza just stop with those eyes.</v>

1243
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.601
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

1244
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Like we're legitimate friends,</v>

1245
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Amy Schumer's and other ones.</v>

1246
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 2>She's my legitimate friends and I,</v>

1247
00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1248
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very important to like have men and women like that,</v>

1249
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:14.470
<v Speaker 2>that are friends like that.</v>

1250
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:16.810
<v Speaker 2>There's like a line that will never be crossed.</v>

1251
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't,</v>

1252
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.190
<v Speaker 2>but there's guys who are really never your fucking friend.</v>

1253
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.761
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>

1254
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:22.121
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

1255
00:31:22.121 --> 00:31:22.481

00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:23.201
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1258
00:31:23.201 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

1259
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was a lie from the beginning.</v>

1260
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew that like I'm not dumb.</v>

1261
00:31:27.751 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 1>And he had said that to me is like goes over your friend but you,</v>

1262

1263
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:32.460
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

1264
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.790
<v Speaker 1>we hung out and we had a really nice like relationship his friends and</v>

1265
00:31:35.791 --> 00:31:37.830
<v Speaker 1>definitely I would get drunk once in a while and I'd be like,</v>

1268
00:31:39.661 --> 00:31:40.494

1282
00:31:56.001 --> 00:31:56.701
<v Speaker 1>I also said,</v>

1283
00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:57.534

00:32:13.171 --> 00:32:13.441
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1297
00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I have no intention of dating you.</v>

1298
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.590
<v Speaker 1>But you kissed him tongue.</v>

1300
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>You can walk away.</v>

1301
00:32:17.821 --> 00:32:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't chain him to the wall and I was like,</v>

1302
00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to date other guys.</v>

1303
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have other guys be my boy.</v>

1304
00:32:23.071 --> 00:32:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Like not when I was kissing him,</v>

1305
00:32:24.541 --> 00:32:25.110
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

1306
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably never going to date you.</v>

1307
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.293
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1308
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.320
<v Speaker 1>And he hung around.</v>

1309
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1310
00:32:28.681 --> 00:32:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1311
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

1312
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:30.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1313
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.471
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1314
00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:33.660
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely a silly man for hanging around,</v>

1315
00:32:33.661 --> 00:32:35.550
<v Speaker 2>but not because he eventually got to fuck you.</v>

1316
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So he wins,</v>

1317
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.043
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1318
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't think furlough.</v>

1319
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:39.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1320
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>

1321
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Well listen</v>

1322
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.090
<v Speaker 2>to you because you're a girl.</v>

1323
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.661
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1324
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:42.440
<v Speaker 2>you kissed him.</v>

1325
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:42.711
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1326
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you tongued him and he eventually got in there.</v>

1327
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.890
<v Speaker 1>But you're telling me that every girl you've brought prior to being married,</v>

1328
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 1>ever girl you ever like drunkenly made out with that meant something to you?</v>

1329
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:51.551
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1330
00:32:51.551 --> 00:32:51.710
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1331
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.951
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1332
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:52.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1333
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a difference between you saying to someone,</v>

1334
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1335
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.181
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1336
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm a man.</v>

1337
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 2>When a man drunkenly makes out with a girl,</v>

1338
00:32:58.701 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 2>he absolutely wants a fucker.</v>

1339
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 2>If a girl drunkenly makes out with a guy,</v>

1340
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:03.171
<v Speaker 2>she can do it.</v>

1341
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:03.981
<v Speaker 2>Just to be silly,</v>

1342
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:04.461
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1343
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 2>And then just shut the door and go in.</v>

1344
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1345
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.670
<v Speaker 2>guys don't ever do that.</v>

1346
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1347
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.190
<v Speaker 2>If a guy drunkenly makes out with a girl,</v>

1348
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 2>it's almost always because he eventually ultimately wants to have sex with her.</v>

1349
00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:14.820
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1350
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1351
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's what hasn't,</v>

1352
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that's how guys are and that's not how girls are.</v>

1353
00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think all any girl would relate to that.</v>

1354
00:33:20.491 --> 00:33:20.701
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1355
00:33:20.701 --> 00:33:21.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1356
00:33:21.271 --> 00:33:22.104
<v Speaker 1>or you're just,</v>

1357
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're drunk and you want it.</v>

1358
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just want to make out with someone and that's the God's honest</v>

1359
00:33:28.171 --> 00:33:28.411
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1360
00:33:28.411 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Like we all get horny and I don't feel like having had those expo.</v>

1361
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Here's my point though.</v>

1362
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.130
<v Speaker 1>No matter what relationship you're conducting,</v>

1363
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.300
<v Speaker 1>even like,</v>

1364
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.860
<v Speaker 1>even if you feel I'm throwing mixed signals,</v>

1365
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.810
<v Speaker 1>you at any point are allowed to walk away.</v>

1366
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And at no point was I like,</v>

1367
00:33:41.011 --> 00:33:41.461
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

1368
00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Please stay.</v>

1369
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It was me being like,</v>

1370
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make out with you.</v>

1371
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll take my shirt off.</v>

1372
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to date you.</v>

1373
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll go anyway.</v>

1374
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.610
<v Speaker 1>But this one,</v>

1375
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 1>the whole time they will,</v>

1376
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I started from day one side isn't as if like they came into play later,</v>

1377
00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:57.540
<v Speaker 1>like the whole time.</v>

1378
00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I think what he was like,</v>

1379
00:33:59.491 --> 00:34:01.500
<v Speaker 1>what happened is I lied and I know what to do.</v>

1380
00:34:01.501 --> 00:34:01.741
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1381
00:34:01.741 --> 00:34:02.551
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think we would date.</v>

1382
00:34:02.551 --> 00:34:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You always told us,</v>

1383
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:03.931
<v Speaker 1>told me we wouldn't.</v>

1384
00:34:03.931 --> 00:34:04.561
<v Speaker 1>And then we did.</v>

1385
00:34:04.561 --> 00:34:04.801
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1386
00:34:04.801 --> 00:34:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do.</v>

1387
00:34:05.761 --> 00:34:06.594
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1388
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.171
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

1389
00:34:07.171 --> 00:34:08.004
<v Speaker 1>it's on you.</v>

1390
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Well that's definitely on him and the lies are unacceptable.</v>

1391
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1392
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.600
<v Speaker 2>all I'm trying to do is as your friend breakdown though the mindset and try to</v>

1393
00:34:17.661 --> 00:34:20.150
<v Speaker 2>figure out like how someone says,</v>

1394
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll tongue you and kiss you and take my shirt off,</v>

1395
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:25.640
<v Speaker 2>but we're never going to have sex for a guy that's like,</v>

1396
00:34:25.641 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 2>if we're getting that close,</v>

1397
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:29.330
<v Speaker 2>if your tits are coming out and my tongue's in your mouth.</v>

1398
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1399
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I was joking about the shirt thing.</v>

1400
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1401
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:32.803
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1402
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:33.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

1403
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody's been there words for like a drunk make out to the end of the</v>

1404
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 1>night and you're just like,</v>

1405
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:38.091

00:34:38.091 --> 00:34:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I feel like making out.</v>

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.870
<v Speaker 1>And so you do like you like I know this person and this is fine and they're like</v>

1409
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.680
<v Speaker 2>your right to make out with people and you're drunk and have like a very</v>

1410
00:34:49.681 --> 00:34:52.140
<v Speaker 2>specific boundary where it's not going to go any further than this.</v>

1411
00:34:52.141 --> 00:34:53.430
<v Speaker 2>We're never going to date,</v>

1412
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.570
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to make out,</v>

1413

1414
00:34:55.591 --> 00:34:56.161
<v Speaker 2>But that's it.</v>

1415
00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:56.760
<v Speaker 2>And then that's it.</v>

1416
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.200
<v Speaker 2>That's your,</v>

1417
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.170
<v Speaker 2>your your prerogative.</v>

1418
00:34:58.171 --> 00:34:59.640
<v Speaker 2>100% is on your show.</v>

1419
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 2>We did,</v>

1420
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean like a long time ago where I will,</v>

1421
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 1>if I'm like,</v>

1422
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.540
<v Speaker 1>let's say I'm seeing someone and let's say it's like the second date or</v>

1423
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:06.020
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1424
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I will straight up say to a guy,</v>

1425
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sleep with you just yet.</v>

1426
00:35:09.711 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

1427
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>

1428
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.980
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanna go upstairs,</v>

1429
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 1>we can make out among touch your wiener,</v>

1430
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.611
<v Speaker 1>I'll take my shirt off.</v>

1431
00:35:16.611 --> 00:35:17.444
<v Speaker 1>That is a treat for you</v>

1432
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow you'll buy me breakfast and no one has ever said no.</v>

1433
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.850
<v Speaker 1>When you give men certain boundaries or parameters ahead of time,</v>

1434
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1435
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:26.580
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1436
00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.460
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm giving you the option to say I'm good,</v>

1437
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:29.151
<v Speaker 1>or I'm tired,</v>

1438
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:29.721

1442
00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:33.980
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever pushed it.</v>

1443
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.830
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever tried to get me to do more than wanting to do.</v>

1444
00:35:36.831 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And one's ever said no.</v>

1445
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1446
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.630
<v Speaker 2>you're a very strong personality,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1448

<v Speaker 2>And if you say that a guys,</v>

1449
00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying every guy would respect it,</v>

1450
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 2>but most guys who go,</v>

00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 2>she's not fucking around like this is what she wants.</v>

1452
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And it's better than nothing for a lot of guys that like,</v>

1453
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:50.821
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

1454
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:51.610
<v Speaker 2>it's better than nothing.</v>

1455
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1456
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll go make out and squeeze some titties.</v>

1457
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:54.444

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1460
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually we'll fuck.</v>

1461
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.343
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1462
00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1463
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.710
<v Speaker 2>well there's nothing wrong with that because also we're talking to,</v>

1464
00:36:00.711 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 2>if I was a girl also it would be really difficult for me,</v>

1465
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.453
<v Speaker 2>I assume,</v>

1466
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 2>to just trust a man.</v>

1467
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Like physically,</v>

1468
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.620
<v Speaker 2>like there's the physical thing like,</v>

1469
00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1470
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 2>you had this guy,</v>

1471
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 2>you knew him for a fucking year,</v>

1472
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 2>you data for three months and he turned out to be a complete total bull sharks.</v>

1473
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 2>What if it was,</v>

1474
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 2>you knew him for a year,</v>

1475
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 2>you dated him for three months and he turn out to be a fucking psychopath and</v>

1476
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:24.590
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know the whole time you were dating.</v>

1477
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Well sort of,</v>

1478
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 2>but what if it's the whole time you were dating?</v>

1479
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 2>He was raping girls while you weren't around?</v>

1480
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just as possible as him faking Yale.</v>

1481
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.210
<v Speaker 2>He could have been a serial rapist or with a gun.</v>

1482
00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Like he could be a total fucking,</v>

1483
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.403
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1484
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.181
<v Speaker 2>Did he have a key?</v>

1485
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't at any point in time,</v>

1486
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 2>but he did like from the only thing that,</v>

1487
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.670
<v Speaker 2>because we'd known each other for a year.</v>

1488
00:36:44.671 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Speaker 2>So when you know someone for a year and then date,</v>

1489
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a little,</v>

1490
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you could take it a little bit faster because it isn't like you just started</v>

1491
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:52.380
<v Speaker 2>dating I've nowhere but like a month.</v>

1492
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:52.741
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1493
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to move in.</v>

1494
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1495
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 2>what can we move in together?</v>

1496
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.410

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1520
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:33.571

1521
00:37:33.571 --> 00:37:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would have had to take my mortgage from afar.</v>

1522
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:37.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1524
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ physical thing.</v>

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I always kind of like test.</v>

1526
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.531

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:47.861
<v Speaker 2>Are you serious?</v>

1531
00:37:47.861 --> 00:37:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I was just trying to see like physically where we are.</v>

1532
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I definitely almost beat a boyfriend in a wrestling,</v>

1533
00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 2>an arm wrestling match one time.</v>

1534
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:56.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1535
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody works out and not everybody's angry,</v>

1536
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.260
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely was saying I work out in them angry.</v>

1537
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.810
<v Speaker 2>So we were trying to say I did not implies and comparative.</v>

1538
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:04.471
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1539
00:38:04.471 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 2>but the physical thing I definitely,</v>

1540
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.590
<v Speaker 2>but it really works on that.</v>

1541
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:08.281
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's angry.</v>

1542
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:09.450
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I meant for me.</v>

1543
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:09.991
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm saying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean I was paying,</v>

1552
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:21.084
<v Speaker 2>even with smart.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a tricky like that and a trick you over a long period of time with a lot of,</v>

1562
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.691

<v Speaker 2>a lot of questions along the where you hit some bumps</v>

1564
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:36.941
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1565
00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:37.691
<v Speaker 1>But here's the other thing.</v>

1566
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1567
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if the word is trick and I'll,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one's ever lied about where they went to school that I knew of.</v>

1577
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1578
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 1>These are not lies that in society we're told to look out for.</v>

1579
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It'd be one like everyone's like,</v>

1580
00:38:55.781 --> 00:38:56.650
<v Speaker 1>does he have another family?</v>

1581
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I would even think about like your school,</v>

1582
00:38:59.171 --> 00:38:59.821
<v Speaker 1>like who cares?</v>

1583
00:38:59.821 --> 00:39:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like lying about your blood type.</v>

1584
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:01.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1585
00:39:01.431 --> 00:39:02.120
<v Speaker 2>not just his,</v>

1586
00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.100
<v Speaker 2>he lied about where most likely,</v>

1587
00:39:04.101 --> 00:39:04.770
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest,</v>

1588
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.300
<v Speaker 2>most likely a about his mom having cancer because you were dating a big heart</v>

1589
00:39:08.301 --> 00:39:08.930
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

1590
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1591
00:39:09.381 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 2>and he most likely lied.</v>

1592
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:11.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1593
00:39:11.271 --> 00:39:14.630
<v Speaker 2>he definitely lied about the skeleton bones part about England.</v>

1594
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.880
<v Speaker 2>He lied about his house twice.</v>

1595
00:39:16.881 --> 00:39:17.481
<v Speaker 2>He lied about,</v>

1596
00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:17.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1597
00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.840
<v Speaker 2>he sounds like a guy who just lies at a d.</v>

1598
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:24.470
<v Speaker 2>It means probably gotten laid doing that his whole life.</v>

1599
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's gotten late enough.</v>

1600
00:39:25.801 --> 00:39:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it was.</v>

1601
00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:29.340
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just thinking about it.</v>

1602
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1603
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.990
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think it's,</v>

1604
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:31.893
<v Speaker 1>he's not like,</v>

1605
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll look,</v>

1606
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I totally got tricked.</v>

1607
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not above admitting that.</v>

1608
00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm also not above admitting that.</v>

1609
00:39:37.591 --> 00:39:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I think when you love someone,</v>

1610
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.320
<v Speaker 1>you're judgment is clouded.</v>

1611
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.213
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't,</v>

1612
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the scope of what that could be.</v>

1613
00:39:43.591 --> 00:39:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't in a billion years,</v>

1614
00:39:44.431 --> 00:39:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have thought that that was real.</v>

1615
00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought it was a joke that like,</v>

1616
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:47.521
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1617
00:39:47.521 --> 00:39:48.660
<v Speaker 1>we can't find is the diploma,</v>

1618
00:39:48.661 --> 00:39:49.494
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1619
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.100
<v Speaker 1>but you won't.</v>

1620
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.300
<v Speaker 1>You almost don't want it to be true.</v>

1621
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
