<v Speaker 1>Monday 2:30</v>

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>PM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2:37.</v>

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles high aids,</v>

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>higher aids content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the amt.</v>

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Brian has every known venereal disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting it out for dominance inside of </v>

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>his soul right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm on zinc and magnesium.</v>

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>He's taken Alpha brain that's keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>them together.</v>

9
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 2>What would you recommend in on its </v>
<v Speaker 2>category or different things for me</v>

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>before you went?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say take a shitload of that.</v>

11
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Take a lot of coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coconut oil is shown to have </v>

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>antibacterial and antimicrobial pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities to it,</v>

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>so you could take coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rub it on your Dick,</v>

14
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>and conceivably it protect you from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few very unambitious,</v>

15
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 2>stds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lazy Std.</v>

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Not like aggressive Ebola type super </v>
<v Speaker 2>aids.</v>

17
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ain't going to fight that out,</v>

18
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 2>but it might kick the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chlamydia.</v>

19
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been running rubbing a killer bee </v>

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 2>honey on some of the sores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

21
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We pull and sticky now.</v>

22
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

23
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot Com.</v>

24
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 2>This is not bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sell killer bee honey.</v>

25
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 2>We also offer no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's even better than regular honey.</v>

26
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 2>We don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we can sell the honey from</v>

27
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 2>those gangster bees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stole it from them.</v>

28
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 2>That's human dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one for teen people.</v>

29
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that killer bee honey and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go fuck yourself.</v>

30
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:35.701
<v Speaker 2>Bees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We win and they are not very good on </v>

31
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 2>these sores though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for real?</v>

32
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just probably go to a doctor.</v>

33
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 2>You probably have eight now.</v>

34
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go to a doctor because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to know that you have </v>

35
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 2>your patient zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you get ingrown hairs a lot though?</v>

36
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 2>You get ingrown hairs because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hairy guy so I get is a lot.</v>

37
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean on your package now.</v>

38
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 2>My packets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like around that area right on your </v>

39
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get them once in a while.</v>

40
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 2>My face like my heavier in Shaden </v>
<v Speaker 2>shavings.</v>

41
00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 2>You don't look like you shave a lot man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's usually the cause of ingrown hairs.</v>

42
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Messing around with your hair when you </v>

43
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>shave your right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you use a blade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about</v>

45
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>shaving it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stubble you don't run the risk of </v>

46
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hair's getting stuck under the skin </v>

47
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>because that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an ingrown like grows in a fucked </v>

48
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.181
<v Speaker 1>up way and then pops out like a Zit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you leave stubble that doesn't </v>

49
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:20.181
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

50
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Do you shave like from your butthole to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your balls like once every six months,</v>

51
00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:24.550
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three months,</v>

52
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

53
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.120
<v Speaker 2>the whole taint area or do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't</v>

54
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 1>do a full groom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do do the balls and the front package </v>

55
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>and not usually like down to the bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time I did because I fucked up </v>

56
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>but it just cut it too low and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid and I was looking at the hedges.</v>

57
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a wrap.</v>

58
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I got to wrap this one up and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking buzz the whole thing.</v>

59
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So for the next couple of weeks I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to look like a 12 year old.</v>

60
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm chicks dig that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm checking.</v>

61
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point it doesn't matter.</v>

62
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.360
<v Speaker 1>You know who gives a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shave it off,</v>

63
00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:03.000
<v Speaker 1>keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't cut any patterns in it.</v>

64
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go with a razor.</v>

65
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're getting the</v>

66
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Gillette sensor to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

67
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.480
<v Speaker 3>you get sold</v>

68
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.800
<v Speaker 1>blow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:17.801
<v Speaker 1>you're like exfoliating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that's also one of the reasons </v>

70
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.771
<v Speaker 1>why men don't get those funky lines in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their face and near their mouth as much </v>

71
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:22.970
<v Speaker 1>as women do because of the shaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exfoliates the skin.</v>

72
00:03:22.971 --> 00:03:25.760
<v Speaker 1>It constantly creates a new level layer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of skin.</v>

73
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Whereas women don't get that opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shave.</v>

74
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.140
<v Speaker 1>So they get creepy old lady face.</v>

75
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's getting big now?</v>

<v Speaker 2>down straight razor.</v>

78
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends,</v>

79
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.740

<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

118
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 3>This is insane that the phone companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this,</v>

119
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:17.031
<v Speaker 3>this is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are pretty much like if you have a </v>

120
00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:17.910
<v Speaker 3>contract with verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you cancel it's $350.</v>

121
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Usually it's like you're a year into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract and it's probably like $180.</v>

122
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.010
<v Speaker 3>What Ting is doing is if you switch over</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Qa Ting,</v>

123
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.400
<v Speaker 3>they will give you whatever that money </v>
<v Speaker 3>is as credit.</v>

124
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 3>So pretty much like if you pay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have $150 at verizon,</v>

125
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.780
<v Speaker 3>they're giving you a $150 credit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>tings for all your,</v>

126
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your use of a service through them.</v>

127
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:42.200
<v Speaker 3>So you won't have to pay anything for </v>
<v Speaker 3>$150 credit.</v>

128
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Conceivably get like a free year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

129
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

130
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:49.200
<v Speaker 3>If you have $350 now pretty much have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>full year of free free cell phone,</v>

131
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

132
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.600
<v Speaker 3>that's very kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

133
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a very cool company and it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why we,</v>

134
00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got connected with them.</v>

135
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I just love the fact</v>

136
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.690
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to set up a company </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not trying to fuck you.</v>

137
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's like in their mission </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

138
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying.</v>

139
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm talking like a paraphrasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit,</v>

140
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it so there's no contracts.</v>

141
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.090
<v Speaker 1>They want to sell you phones at a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable rate and they want to put you</v>

142
00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:20.091
<v Speaker 1>on a good network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sprint is one of the best networks in </v>

143
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:21.450
<v Speaker 1>the country depending upon where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

144
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Every phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending upon where you live.</v>

145
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any one provider </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't nailed,</v>

146
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people like and prefer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>CDMA network that sprints on over like </v>

147
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.420
<v Speaker 1>the t mobile GSM network or 18 and t GSM</v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

148
00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.030
<v Speaker 1>the CDMA phones cut out less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's apparently it's older technology.</v>

150
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm too stupid to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that people are pretty happy </v>

151
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.690
<v Speaker 1>with the sprint service and it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap.</v>

152
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also can set it up so that you have </v>

153
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.381
<v Speaker 1>one or more people can share an account </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can share an account with your </v>

154
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:57.381
<v Speaker 1>wife so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:59.070
<v Speaker 1>you could share minutes which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is great,</v>

156
00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

157
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.830
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use the phone that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of us today I fucking text a </v>

158
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:10.131
<v Speaker 1>lot more than I make phone calls a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and that's the most important thing</v>

159
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:12.930
<v Speaker 1>to me is to be able to text and bill to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the Internet.</v>

160
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Like my actual phone calls per day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do in my mind when I'm in my car,</v>

161
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could get work done while I'm </v>

162
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.230
<v Speaker 1>driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not ready.</v>

163
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not using it like I used to.</v>

164
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I text so much more now than talking on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the phone.</v>

165
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Which is weird because when you read </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody texts,</v>

166
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 3>you're reading it how you want to read </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

167
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.980
<v Speaker 3>like in your own head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it kind of makes me wonder if you are</v>

168
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 3>kind of controlling who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people's opinions of you are.</v>

169
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Very deep philosophical way to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically contorting my world.</v>

170
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.070
<v Speaker 3>You're imposing my worldview on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are contacting me.</v>

171
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.430
<v Speaker 3>You're missing sarcasm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely.</v>

172
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Think everybody actually does think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the shit.</v>

173
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Here we go quite a bit depending on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of texts you getting into.</v>

174
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go go to [inaudible] dot ting dot</v>

175
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>comm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Support a cool company that's uh,</v>

176
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.710
<v Speaker 1>that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing the right thing.</v>

177
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the companies can make money and</v>

178
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:10.291
<v Speaker 1>not be consumed and Tang agrees and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we have them as a </v>

179
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:14.971
<v Speaker 1>sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that will guarantee you </v>

180
00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:14.971
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said it a million times,</v>

181
00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:14.971
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to repeat it.</v>

182
00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:19.510
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to have someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsor this show that we don't believe </v>

183
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to make some sense.</v>

184
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a legit product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it wasn't a legit product,</v>

185
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Brian and I will sit down and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and we would say,</v>

186
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

187
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:28.090
<v Speaker 1>we can't have these guys on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid,</v>

188
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is some bullshit.</v>

189
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.940
<v Speaker 1>So the people that were involved with as</v>
<v Speaker 1>least under our opinion,</v>

190
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>it's all legit companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in a games,</v>

191
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 1>one of our other sponsors is kerosene </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and kerosene games has.</v>

192
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second game is about to drop.</v>

193
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.720
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in the final stages,</v>

194
00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:51.721
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first game is called Blade </v>

195
00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:52.900
<v Speaker 1>slinger and they're making all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>games for ipads and iphones.</v>

196
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like a pc game has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

197
00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.681
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking real legit high end game </v>

198
00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>that's really cool to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

199
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to look at like visually </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fun.</v>

200
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>It's any you play on an ipad means it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>three bucks.</v>

201
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You just can't go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One apple editor's choice award and has </v>

202
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.151
<v Speaker 1>been rated for at a four must have by </v>
<v Speaker 1>many critics with a winning score of </v>

203
00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 1>other industry accolades for quality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellence.</v>

204
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>People have been saying it's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad ass game,</v>

205
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 1>gets gets very good reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to have to give a </v>

206
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.531
<v Speaker 1>few bad reviews and if it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I saw something that didn't have a </v>

207
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>few bad reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

208
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

209
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't trust it.</v>

210
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a dummy account.</v>

211
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.080
<v Speaker 1>You'd probably have to fucking pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody to be able to post here because</v>

212
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>there's always comes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find something.</v>

213
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the greatest songs ever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have people like,</v>

214
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's whiny bullshit.</v>

215
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:50.241
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say something like that in the </v>

216
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:50.241
<v Speaker 1>youtube comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be that guy,</v>

217
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:54.470
<v Speaker 1>so if you have something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>universally praised that that sounds </v>

218
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.790
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that said,</v>

219
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>the praise for this game has been pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

220
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>People love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in this first person,</v>

221
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 1>third person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Because you first person would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking through his actual eyes.</v>

223
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 3>I believe the finance game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

224
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 3>I played this on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great for playing on the plane,</v>

225
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have your ipads.</v>

226
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting.</v>

227
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm using my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had more and more lately.</v>

228
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I love about</v>

229
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.250
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is it.</v>

230

<v Speaker 2>you know Kenny does a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that many people doing that.</v>

283
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 2>So strange Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

284
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 2>It's weird and I'm sure you get the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

285
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 2>What I try and tell a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of fighters with outstanding</v>

286
00:12:56.741 --> 00:13:01.741
<v Speaker 2>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing the retirement of the </v>

287
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:01.741
<v Speaker 2>second generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may not,</v>

288
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:06.000
<v Speaker 2>not the founders in a hoist and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second generation is starting to break </v>

289
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 2>down and retire and I've had guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally coming up to me going,</v>

290
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 2>how did you get this Gig?</v>

291
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Because if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

292
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 2>did we get this job?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a sense,</v>

293
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy,</v>

294
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 2>but there are very few that actually do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

295
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so few.</v>

296
00:13:20.031 --> 00:13:25.031
<v Speaker 2>And for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy does the commentary for Bella </v>

297
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 2>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the second biggest promotion in</v>

298
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're there on spike tv now.</v>

299
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.740
<v Speaker 2>They've actually taken the position that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC had and just had the first </v>

300
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've been around a long ass time,</v>

301
00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:42.481
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been doing commentary like for </v>

302
00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:42.481
<v Speaker 2>for belt or for how long now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bella?</v>

303
00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Towards three and one for six years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing this.</v>

304
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I did anyone before before Bella tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did three years of commentary.</v>

305
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was listening to to get good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

306
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.900
<v Speaker 2>It was cool that you had a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience doing television stuff </v>

307
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.020
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were already loose enough.</v>

308
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

309
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a big thing for guys is just</v>

310
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to loosen up so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can explain themselves.</v>

311
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:07.891
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird gig because the only one </v>

312
00:14:07.891 --> 00:14:10.861
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be able to do it is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to be possible unless you </v>

313
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:10.861
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you train you,</v>

314
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna.</v>

315
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Be able to see things you'll sound like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Douche to.</v>

316
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

317
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that really personally bugs me</v>

318
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.080
<v Speaker 2>about commentary is when people question</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody and they haven't been there </v>

319
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 2>when it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's,</v>

320
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:28.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of people question </v>

321
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 2>somebodies heart or they get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go down from a body shot,</v>

322
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 2>you've been hit in the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go down and if you've trained,</v>

323
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.010
<v Speaker 2>if you sparred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>

324
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.120
<v Speaker 2>and people that don't and and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>are hard on fighters and question our </v>

325
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a questionnaire design when they haven't</v>

326
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.650
<v Speaker 2>been there and gone through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That bugs me.</v>

327
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

328
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.310
<v Speaker 2>that does bug me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That bugs me a lot.</v>

329
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 2>What else bugs me is people saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know who's gonna win.</v>

330
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.300
<v Speaker 2>That bugs me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

331
00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk shit on occasion if like I</v>

332
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.550
<v Speaker 1>see a match up and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

333
00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:54.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is.</v>

334
00:14:54.971 --> 00:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy matchup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whatsapp Petrocelli.</v>

335
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Ellie fought Kimbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

336
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I made a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a green room in Atlanta and we </v>

337
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.711
<v Speaker 1>were about to watch the fight and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was Ken shamrock and </v>

338
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:06.711
<v Speaker 1>literally right before the fight I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>off stage.</v>

339
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about to happen right now and I can</v>

340
00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:09.920

<v Speaker 1>Ellie is legit.</v>

346
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.920
<v Speaker 5>The people in the know knew how that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight was.</v>

347
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that fucking crazy people</v>

348
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:26.450
<v Speaker 1>over at CBS who said yes to that or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

349
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Was it CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBS at the time.</v>

350
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you have?</v>

351
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that knows mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a mismatch.</v>

352
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a gross mismatch.</v>

353
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.500
<v Speaker 5>You and I know the disconnect between </v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that put mma on TV and the </v>

354
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:42.430
<v Speaker 5>people that know mma is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be,</v>

355
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 5>can be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can be huge network people.</v>

356
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:48.800
<v Speaker 5>The people that put him on tv don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>always know a man.</v>

357
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 5>It crops up a lot</v>

358
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.440
<v Speaker 1>because you and I essentially we sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>established positions in the sport doing</v>

359
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.710
<v Speaker 1>commentary like as it grew and it became</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that it is now.</v>

360
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.220
<v Speaker 1>While we know when we both started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you go back to six years ago,</v>

361
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 1>it was not nearly as big as it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bananas how big it is now and it </v>

362
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.760
<v Speaker 1>sort of happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was really.</v>

363
00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:16.761
<v Speaker 1>If you want to break it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it actually happened around eight </v>

364
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:16.761
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 5>Ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was really the biggie eight years </v>

366
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>

367
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Was it 2004 to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

368
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that area in that area from there that </v>

369
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:25.790
<v Speaker 1>started this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the,</v>

370
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the level that it's at right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fame of a GSP or an Anderson </v>

371
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones,</v>

372
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:31.750
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

373
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.190
<v Speaker 1>they're right up there with basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>any athlete in pro sports.</v>

374
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>The top level guys like they're talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about on a,</v>

375
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 1>in bars and in the same way people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about plays and games.</v>

376
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 1>They talk about GSP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

377
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 1>landing at giant knee or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

378
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

379
00:16:48.151 --> 00:16:51.270
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how this has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while while tapping.</v>

380
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean we essentially just had to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out our own way through it,</v>

381
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and learning like what's the best rules </v>

382
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.080
<v Speaker 1>and it seeing the rules change and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

383
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Like when I first started there was bare</v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckle and you can wear shoes.</v>

384
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was UFC 12,</v>

385
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.360
<v Speaker 1>that was the first UFC I ever did </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary on.</v>

386
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I did a post fight interviews rather and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

387
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.300
<v Speaker 1>to so to see it from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to where it is now with flyweights </v>

388
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and bantams and feathers and lightweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>cement.</v>

389
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of lightweight guys now.</v>

390
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 5>The first time I fought was that a thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>called neutral grounds and central </v>

391
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.380
<v Speaker 5>grounds and pankration pin crace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of amateur,</v>

392
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 5>but not really ms dot back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it wasn't sanctioned in California,</v>

393
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 5>they literally had everybody line up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was next to this dude and they went,</v>

394
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 5>you guys simply fighting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We didn't weigh in nothing.</v>

395
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.680
<v Speaker 5>And we went in and we thought that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was how it worked.</v>

396
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.570
<v Speaker 5>They use open hands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

397
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.760
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We weren't</v>

398
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.880
<v Speaker 1>to the stakes of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had no gloves on.</v>

399
00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.910
<v Speaker 1>And this is how crazy I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be really nuts and there's a </v>

400
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.491
<v Speaker 1>bunch of weird rules in mma that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just total ignorance and from just </v>

401
00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:06.290
<v Speaker 1>misconceptions about w w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them is at one of them is that </v>

402
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Speaker 1>downward elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The downward elbow is a crazy one.</v>

403
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why the 12 to six elbow is </v>

404
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big John Mccarthy told me this,</v>

405
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:17.810
<v Speaker 1>that when they were describing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts techniques to the athletic </v>

406
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.861
<v Speaker 1>commissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was one of the guys that worked </v>

407
00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:24.321
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That letter commission said you can't </v>

408
00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:26.151
<v Speaker 1>have them do that thing with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>elbows because I've seen that on TV and </v>

409
00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:26.151
<v Speaker 1>they can break boards by Golly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

410
00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would it do to a person's skull </v>

411
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 1>like this guy thought for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this was in any way,</v>

412
00:18:33.121 --> 00:18:38.121
<v Speaker 1>shape or form as bad as Anderson Silva </v>
<v Speaker 1>kneeing you in the head makes no sense </v>

413
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

414
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legitimately ridiculous.</v>

415
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:46.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a rule that's in place like </v>

416
00:18:46.971 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 1>strictly because of ignorance and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so many of those in the beginning.</v>

417
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew what the right thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

418
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

419
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you can't have mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

420
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:57.441
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well when if we wrestle and slap fight </v>

421
00:18:57.441 --> 00:18:57.441
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

422
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>no sense at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to go with it.</v>

423
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.480
<v Speaker 1>That was what it was for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have pankration fights and </v>

424
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 1>pankration fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would pull their hands back.</v>

425
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bas rutten was the only dude who ever </v>

426
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:11.960
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to deliver like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

427
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.690
<v Speaker 1>He could knock out one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

428
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.470
<v Speaker 1>because boss has this crazy anatomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>first voice,</v>

429
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.500
<v Speaker 1>these giant ass long hands and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to pull his hands way </v>

430
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.771
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that is like his fingers were almost </v>

431
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 1>like facing towards him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a punch.</v>

432
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.420
<v Speaker 1>He's punching you with his palm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

433
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 1>You're not catching any of the fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's absorbing.</v>

434
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.750
<v Speaker 1>The idea I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a slab being easier is that your </v>

435
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.780
<v Speaker 1>fingers are absorbing some of the impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your hand is moving back,</v>

436
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:39.570
<v Speaker 1>which takes away that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but boss is hitting you with this.</v>

437
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.570
<v Speaker 1>He's like straight punching you with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>palm.</v>

438
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:47.610
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember the exchange when frank </v>
<v Speaker 5>shamrock went for a leg lock on him and </v>

439
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.700
<v Speaker 5>bosses John and Frank Smile and Adam and</v>
<v Speaker 5>laugh.</v>

440
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.690
<v Speaker 5>There's a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a problem with your rule system</v>

441
00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:53.740
<v Speaker 5>when that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

442
00:19:53.741 --> 00:19:57.100
<v Speaker 5>That was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was funny though.</v>

443
00:19:57.101 --> 00:19:59.650
<v Speaker 5>Frank Shamrock is funny and that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it developed,</v>

444
00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:01.480
<v Speaker 5>and I say this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>MMA now,</v>

445
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 5>it developed from for good or for bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a sport of martial artists to </v>

446
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.391
<v Speaker 5>support of athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's a sport of athletes that don't </v>

447
00:20:10.391 --> 00:20:13.981
<v Speaker 5>necessarily like we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>right before the podcast about Roy </v>

448
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:13.981
<v Speaker 5>Mcdonald,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a bad ass he is.</v>

449
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:17.150
<v Speaker 5>The guy started mma at 14.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't grow up doing kilkenny.</v>

450
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.180
<v Speaker 5>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't come from martial artist </v>

451
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:22.180
<v Speaker 5>background who said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

452
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 5>I'll turn this into mma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guys just studying them and they </v>

453
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 5>approach it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're saying,</v>

454
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.180
<v Speaker 5>the NFL or the NBA or any other big time</v>
<v Speaker 5>sport and that's come with advantages </v>

455
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.490
<v Speaker 5>and disadvantages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

456
00:20:30.491 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 5>their training,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like professional athletes right now,</v>

457
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>there is a massive difference in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to move your ability to </v>

458
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.321
<v Speaker 1>withstand shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to keep your energy levels </v>

459
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:45.250
<v Speaker 1>up when you're training in the gym and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:48.060
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're doing just only or </v>
<v Speaker 1>only</v>

461
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 2>grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get in tremendous shape.</v>

462
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.620
<v Speaker 2>But in this day and age it seems like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to beat a GSP to beat like the highest </v>

463
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 2>of highest levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Competitors,</v>

464
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you got to be both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be both.</v>

465
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.950
<v Speaker 2>A martial artist is very technical and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have to put the fucking time in</v>

466
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 2>that you don't want to put into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning.</v>

467
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 2>You got to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know nobody wants to.</v>

468
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to do battle ropes.</v>

469
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to fucking her old ropes </v>
<v Speaker 2>until your body feels like it's going to</v>

470
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 2>explode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't do it,</v>

471
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.860
<v Speaker 2>there could be just that little less </v>
<v Speaker 2>juice that you don't have in the third </v>

472
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.270
<v Speaker 2>and it causes you to either get caught </v>
<v Speaker 2>or it causes your opponent to get away </v>

473
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 2>from something when you caught them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

474
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 2>but you just can't squeeze it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets out of it and you're like,</v>

475
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

476
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:35.730
<v Speaker 2>The only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only time that isn't wasted in </v>

477
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.341
<v Speaker 2>training is cardio training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you spend all your time on </v>

478
00:21:38.341 --> 00:21:38.341
<v Speaker 2>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

479
00:21:38.341 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about boxing the guys a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better boxer.</v>

480
00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.970
<v Speaker 2>You fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spent that time inappropriately.</v>

481
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.980
<v Speaker 2>You have x number of hours in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no negative to being in better </v>

482
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.160
<v Speaker 2>shape than the other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no nate.</v>

483
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:53.161
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no negative to being in better </v>

484
00:21:53.161 --> 00:21:53.161
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be guys that are better than you</v>

485
00:21:53.161 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 2>if you can wear them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that happens.</v>

486
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happened to me.</v>

487
00:21:56.291 --> 00:22:01.291
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had guys that I usually tap like </v>

488
00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:03.091
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll go to the gym and I'll be out </v>

489
00:22:03.091 --> 00:22:03.091
<v Speaker 2>of shape and I'll get dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:22:03.091 --> 00:22:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll get mounted and my mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm not in shape for it and if</v>

491
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:06.820
<v Speaker 2>you're not in shape that just.</v>

492
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a fact that you're not gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to defend.</v>

493
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be able to execute </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the fullest of abilities.</v>

494
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.880
<v Speaker 2>The hardest part is I'm on the road 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks in a row because I have 12 week </v>

495
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:17.880
<v Speaker 2>season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm literally gone.</v>

496
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I fly out tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get back till Friday morning,</v>

497
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 2>so I'm really home on the weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

498
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 2>do you train when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the road.</v>

499
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.900
<v Speaker 2>When I see that's the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

500
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm working out pitbull brothers in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator.</v>

501
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:33.150
<v Speaker 2>They turn to the translator and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pippa wants to know if you want to roll </v>

502
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:33.370
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to my gym.</v>

503
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.400
<v Speaker 2>I go to my room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I changed that would go and I with </v>

504

<v Speaker 2>The next day he's speaking.</v>

506
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.300
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Gracie was an ed.</v>

507
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy went roll with me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

508
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not in that kind of shape.</v>

509
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 2>You're in their training with animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go home for days to come home.</v>

510
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

511
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:56.550
<v Speaker 2>back when I was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was six day a week guy and that's </v>

512
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 2>where these guys are and it's like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting with guys,</v>

513
00:22:57.071 --> 00:22:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>world champs,</v>

514
00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

515
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
<v Speaker 2>these people kind of don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of conditioning that's </v>

516
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 2>required to compete in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

517
00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 2>it's so taken for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>

518
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the aspect of the sport that has</v>

519
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:16.711
<v Speaker 2>to do with what kind of shape you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so gigantic and there's levels and </v>

520
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:22.171
<v Speaker 2>some guys like a Frankie Edgar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never let the cardio dropoff and </v>

521
00:23:22.171 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>every time you see them you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been pushing it.</v>

522
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 2>They've been pushing it and you build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>base,</v>

523
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:31.650
<v Speaker 2>you get like a Nick Diaz type base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Nick Diaz has such a strong cardio </v>

524
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:35.680
<v Speaker 2>base because he's constantly swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly biking,</v>

525
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:40.681
<v Speaker 2>constantly running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His cardio is sensational and you can't </v>

526
00:23:40.681 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 2>keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

527
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:46.231
<v Speaker 2>He will drown you if you get in a fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that would nick Diaz is one of </v>

528
00:23:46.231 --> 00:23:46.231
<v Speaker 2>those like who</v>

529
00:23:46.231 --> 00:23:49.670
<v Speaker 1>can keep up this pace fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go 60 percent on you,</v>

530
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe 70 percent and then you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

531
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna be able to keep up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to try to mix it </v>

532
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:57.640
<v Speaker 1>in with 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's Chins made out of</v>

533
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 2>volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puncher.</v>

534
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a bobby to up Paul Williams for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

535
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.480
<v Speaker 2>for the boxing fans out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a great boxer.</v>

536
00:24:04.481 --> 00:24:08.530
<v Speaker 2>He recently got paralyzed an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he throw a 150 punches around 100.</v>

537
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nick deist.</v>

538
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.930
<v Speaker 2>He just throws so many punches so I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't go away so I will not go away.</v>

539
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.370
<v Speaker 2>And his chin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his iron,</v>

540
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.280
<v Speaker 2>it allows them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very relaxed so he rolls with shit </v>

541
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:21.640
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's never committing to a punch.</v>

542
00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:26.641
<v Speaker 2>You never catch him committing on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never get that big counter punch </v>

543
00:24:26.641 --> 00:24:26.670
<v Speaker 2>because he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's slapping.</v>

544
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>You saw such an important point that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't catch him with a counter shot.</v>

545
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.330
<v Speaker 2>There's a dude named Michael Jai white </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a very,</v>

546
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.040
<v Speaker 2>very smart dude and a great martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>artist as well.</v>

547
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.280
<v Speaker 2>People don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seem in movies.</v>

548
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:41.290
<v Speaker 2>You think he's not like a real martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>artist now.</v>

549
00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:43.070
<v Speaker 2>He's totally legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to.</v>

550
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.720
<v Speaker 2>He's the one that joker cut a new mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a.</v>

551
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 2>He played</v>

552
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>in that Tyson documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

553
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.750
<v Speaker 1>my point is he was explaining like dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lifelong martial artists and he was</v>

554
00:24:55.271 --> 00:24:59.650

<v Speaker 1>about throwing jabs and throwing punches</v>

555
00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.220
<v Speaker 1>from just a relaxed position and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when when someone does that,</v>

556
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't even see it comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

557
00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:07.480
<v Speaker 1>it just lands and they were like going </v>
<v Speaker 1>over this,</v>

558
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.030
<v Speaker 1>like something that that's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of people don't realize.</v>

559
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.060
<v Speaker 1>When you tense up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telegraph,</v>

560
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna your chances of hitting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy are significantly lower than if you </v>

561
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.381
<v Speaker 1>just hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit him like that and it got like </v>

562
00:25:22.381 --> 00:25:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz is not training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not full blast.</v>

563
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It's mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like tap,</v>

564
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:25.240
<v Speaker 1>tap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pap pap,</v>

565
00:25:25.241 --> 00:25:30.241
<v Speaker 1>pap pap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mechanical and you starting to see </v>

566
00:25:30.241 --> 00:25:31.140
<v Speaker 1>stars and then you'll step back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

567
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to blast this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do to get him off me.</v>

571
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.920
<v Speaker 1>but then you going to wear yourself out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that big explosion that you can't </v>

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.560
<v Speaker 1>keep up with and he's going to keep 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of your pap pap pap pap.</v>

573
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:46.210
<v Speaker 2>What people don't understand is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>x amount of training sessions you can go</v>

574
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.160
<v Speaker 2>through in your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are x amount of hours.</v>

575
00:25:48.161 --> 00:25:53.161
<v Speaker 2>You can train their x amount of punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can throw how you spend that energy </v>

576
00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:54.410
<v Speaker 2>defines how you are as a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

577
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz is not a knockout punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never been knockout punches.</v>

578
00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.760
<v Speaker 2>He throws so many that you're eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

579
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.820
<v Speaker 2>He'll up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dropped Robbie lawler drop with </v>

580
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Jacksons you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just sort of fade away.</v>

581
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Jose Fadeaway Jab that Robbie lawler </v>
<v Speaker 2>step right into [inaudible].</v>

582
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.080
<v Speaker 2>That frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does too.</v>

583
00:26:11.081 --> 00:26:13.450
<v Speaker 2>He unloads until you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get frustrated,</v>

584
00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:15.370
<v Speaker 2>you do something stupid and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes you out.</v>

585
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.940
<v Speaker 2>You have fight to was all of the classic</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit talk and fights.</v>

586
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was awesome because that was one of</v>

587
00:26:20.711 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 2>the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept doing it.</v>

588
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.370
<v Speaker 2>See Nick</v>

589
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 1>get he got into the octagon and as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got into the octagon,</v>

590
00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>he looks over at robby law and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>his arms out.</v>

591
00:26:27.831 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stockton motherfucker.</v>

592
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 1>And he starts pacing back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see Robbie lawler is like,</v>

593
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Nick Diaz claiming the two,</v>

594
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:38.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

595
00:26:38.151 --> 00:26:43.151
<v Speaker 1>And walk out with his arms out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he proceeded to just talk mad </v>

596
00:26:43.151 --> 00:26:47.201
<v Speaker 1>shit through the whole fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could tell Robbie lawler was </v>

597
00:26:47.201 --> 00:26:47.201
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

598
00:26:47.201 --> 00:26:47.201
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

599
00:26:47.201 --> 00:26:51.561
<v Speaker 5>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should I call me to break down the </v>

600
00:26:51.561 --> 00:26:51.561
<v Speaker 5>last.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Da has been Henderson fight.</v>

601
00:26:51.561 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 5>His brother Nate took similar fighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>style course and he said,</v>

602
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 5>what do you think of all that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That Nate Diaz come get me,</v>

603
00:26:58.940 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the,</v>

604
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 5>the MCGINN and throwing her hands up in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the shit talking.</v>

605
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.500
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their footwork isn't great.</v>

606
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 5>And what it did is he's brings you into </v>
<v Speaker 5>that zone with the Mcginn and to come on</v>

607
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>

608
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 5>is that when you saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw that same problem,</v>

609
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

610
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:14.850
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with nick,</v>

611
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.490
<v Speaker 5>against Carlos Condit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't engage him,</v>

612
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:22.580
<v Speaker 5>his footwork isn't great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a little flat foot and he throws </v>

613
00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 5>his punches and a lot of that and come </v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

614
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 5>come get me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is come into my range,</v>

615
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 5>come into my kind of fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

616
00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very calculated what it Robbie do.</v>

617
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.550
<v Speaker 5>He stepped in eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really a jab hook,</v>

618
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a super hard punishment,</v>

619
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.220
<v Speaker 5>stepped right into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom and went face down on the mat.</v>

620
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 5>And that's part of the strategy.</v>

621
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Interesting about the Carlos condit </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with Carlos condit fight.</v>

622
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Very similar to the way he throws his </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>

623
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.800
<v Speaker 1>but he just did it moving away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked his own spots,</v>

624
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.630
<v Speaker 1>picked his own bots and moved away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

625
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.960
<v Speaker 1>like when he landed that head kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell just by the way,</v>

626
00:27:53.961 --> 00:27:55.910
<v Speaker 1>landed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not a full blast head kick.</v>

627
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.340
<v Speaker 1>He just thrown it up there quick to land</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

628
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.500
<v Speaker 1>just because he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he does it that way,</v>

629
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.430
<v Speaker 1>it really took a page out of Nick's book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I totally think it is.</v>

630
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally think it is.</v>

631
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

632
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you think you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that style because the </v>

633
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy doesn't get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get tired.</v>

634
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.710
<v Speaker 1>It takes a tremendous shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad combination.</v>

635
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Kj noons was able to cut,</v>

636
00:28:15.141 --> 00:28:17.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was successful in that way,</v>

637
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:22.031
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then nick outboxed him in the </v>

638
00:28:22.031 --> 00:28:22.031
<v Speaker 1>rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:28:22.031 --> 00:28:23.210
<v Speaker 1>the only one to really outboxed him.</v>

640
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Joel rigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diesel rigs up possibly land a little </v>

641
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.121
<v Speaker 1>bit harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just I think landed with a little more </v>

642
00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:31.121
<v Speaker 1>forced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

643
00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:31.121
<v Speaker 1>you want a decision against nick in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

644
00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:32.830
<v Speaker 1>What about Jeremy Jackson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest.</v>

645
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back in the Janet Jackson is a waste</v>

646
00:28:36.101 --> 00:28:36.910
<v Speaker 1>of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

647
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Jackson was a real waste of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent.</v>

648
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kid had whatever issues,</v>

649
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got kicked off of the ultimate </v>

650
00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:47.650
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

651
00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.470
<v Speaker 1>and he's got some really big legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems now he's in prison.</v>

652
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.140
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get a lot bigger than doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

653
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the crime was,</v>

654
00:28:56.331 --> 00:28:58.940
<v Speaker 1>what he was accused of and whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not he actually did it,</v>

655
00:28:58.941 --> 00:29:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but I physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude,</v>

656
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:03.260
<v Speaker 1>he was a great boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

657
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.870
<v Speaker 1>he's the only guy to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

658
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz because besides the Kj noon </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut,</v>

659
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.180
<v Speaker 1>which is just the doctor saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the cuts too bad.</v>

660
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.100
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in danger.</v>

661
00:29:13.101 --> 00:29:18.101
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't see blood was pouring into </v>

662
00:29:18.101 --> 00:29:18.101
<v Speaker 1>his eyes and it just looks really </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly.</v>

663
00:29:18.101 --> 00:29:19.910
<v Speaker 1>But Jeremy Jackson stopped him like </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>

664
00:29:19.911 --> 00:29:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And Nick was really young at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

665
00:29:21.831 --> 00:29:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was only 18.</v>

666
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a right hand over the jab.</v>

667
00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:27.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That low jab and he hadn't quite learned</v>

668
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.400
<v Speaker 5>to keep that hand up and use and volume </v>
<v Speaker 5>punch guest who's coming in eight a </v>

669
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:33.440
<v Speaker 5>right hand over the top and just stunned</v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

670
00:29:33.441 --> 00:29:33.860
<v Speaker 5>And that was it.</v>

671
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.160
<v Speaker 1>He had some hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

672
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 1>He had some hands when there wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't that much in the UFC in </v>

673
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 1>terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

674
00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 1>he had like Jens pulver type knockout </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

675
00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sad to see that guy.</v>

676
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like he came along and mma just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little too early and to have the main,</v>

677
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 1>the endurance to get from the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz,</v>

678
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:59.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 year old stage where mma was then to </v>

679
00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 1>get to be like a pro today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few few guys.</v>

680
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Few guys.</v>

681
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett Barnett.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Josh is a rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rare example of a guy who's been in the </v>

683
00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 1>game a long fucking time and still </v>
<v Speaker 1>competes at the top level.</v>

684
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.160
<v Speaker 5>The thing that rob lava number one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>19 to 29,</v>

685
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:22.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing is you have to be open to the </v>

686
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.430
<v Speaker 5>kind of changes that destroy athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be open to men.</v>

687
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:29.590
<v Speaker 5>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>men past six years has gone from three </v>

688
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.530
<v Speaker 5>to 10 as far as the talent level and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>competitive pettiness of it.</v>

689
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.520
<v Speaker 5>And to stay in the mix,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even to stay in the discussion that long</v>

690
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:41.090
<v Speaker 5>is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to make the kind of cardio </v>

691
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.761
<v Speaker 5>commitments and training commitments </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of people with that I would </v>

692
00:30:43.761 --> 00:30:47.661
<v Speaker 5>say in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts mentality of this is the </v>

693
00:30:47.661 --> 00:30:47.661
<v Speaker 5>way I do things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't make it.</v>

694
00:30:47.661 --> 00:30:49.140
<v Speaker 5>They didn't make that transition and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>few great athletes did.</v>

695
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.460
<v Speaker 5>And that's why they're still around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

696
00:30:50.461 --> 00:30:52.510
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird time to see those</v>

697
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.640
<v Speaker 1>guys that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

698
00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.840
<v Speaker 1>It didn't quite come along at the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

699
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

700
00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you only have a certain amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can go balls out in mma and </v>

701
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it varies depending upon your style and </v>

702
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 1>varies depending upon grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it is really saves a </v>

703
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.120
<v Speaker 1>lot of guys like randy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:17.121
<v Speaker 1>randy was able to continue his career </v>
<v Speaker 1>like way longer than he probably would </v>

705
00:31:17.121 --> 00:31:18.400
<v Speaker 1>have if he was a pure striker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

706
00:31:18.401 --> 00:31:23.401
<v Speaker 1>it's the fact that he was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he took some big shots and </v>

707
00:31:23.401 --> 00:31:26.061
<v Speaker 1>some of the fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was able to close the distance a lot </v>

708
00:31:26.061 --> 00:31:29.211
<v Speaker 1>of the time and he's able to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys up against the cage a lot of the </v>

709
00:31:29.211 --> 00:31:30.270
<v Speaker 1>time and that minimized like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage that he could have taken.</v>

710
00:31:30.271 --> 00:31:31.980
<v Speaker 1>It allowed him to extend his career </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

711
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just through the intelligence.</v>

712
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Look at this physical gifts that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

713
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>speed time.</v>

714
00:31:36.841 --> 00:31:41.841
<v Speaker 5>Your kids a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roy Jones Jr went off a cliff because </v>

715
00:31:41.841 --> 00:31:42.300
<v Speaker 5>once you lose that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't come back.</v>

716
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think with no one's</v>

717
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.520
<v Speaker 1>junior are you also have to consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological damage.</v>

718
00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severely.</v>

719
00:31:48.201 --> 00:31:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Severely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's one thing I hate saying that,</v>

720
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to be a realist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

721
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:58.060
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at the Glen Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight where he was completely out cold </v>

722
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.600
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that it was shortly after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tarver fight that yet,</v>

723
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaned.</v>

724
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:05.120
<v Speaker 1>You know what got ruined him man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he went down in weight,</v>

725
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 1>cutting weight from the fight back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lift heavy weights.</v>

726
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of folks don't know he won the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight title.</v>

727
00:32:10.431 --> 00:32:13.970
<v Speaker 1>He fought John Ruiz and a box his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking face off.</v>

728
00:32:13.971 --> 00:32:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a beautiful fight.</v>

729
00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:17.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a guy won his first</v>

730
00:32:17.601 --> 00:32:22.601
<v Speaker 1>title at one slash 68 and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden he's fighting as a heavyweight </v>

731
00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and fighting grain and there's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to question what the fuck he </v>

732
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.840
<v Speaker 1>took to get to be a heavyweight and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get off that shit,</v>

733
00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.510
<v Speaker 1>the reality is in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stuns your body.</v>

734
00:32:32.511 --> 00:32:37.511
<v Speaker 1>Your testicles stop producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and his body looked way </v>

735
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:38.840
<v Speaker 1>smoother and the tarver fight than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had ever seen him before.</v>

736
00:32:38.841 --> 00:32:42.060
<v Speaker 1>He like depleted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look good and he was,</v>

737
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really weak from that weight cut.</v>

738
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 5>The great thing about sports,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mma,</v>

739
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:51.730
<v Speaker 5>any sport is that you see people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are doing things that seemed beyond the </v>

740
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 5>physical limits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what sports is all about.</v>

741
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 5>Your body will pay you back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You cannot keep its,</v>

742
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot keep pushing that envelope and </v>

743
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

744
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fighters that do that,</v>

745
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 5>that we see pushing them up all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

746
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.630
<v Speaker 5>There's a price to pay your body will </v>
<v Speaker 5>come back at you and,</v>

747
00:33:09.631 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's just a human fact of life.</v>

748
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.940
<v Speaker 5>And as competent as we see so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighters in so many various stages of </v>

749
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.471
<v Speaker 5>their careers and we kind of see the </v>
<v Speaker 5>longterm in a way a lot of other people </v>

750
00:33:20.471 --> 00:33:24.071
<v Speaker 5>don't because once somebody gets off a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fan's rate or they're still on our </v>

751
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:24.071
<v Speaker 5>radar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to be.</v>

752
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:24.071
<v Speaker 5>That's our job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

753
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:25.430
<v Speaker 5>Like Pedro,</v>

<v Speaker 1>start giving out from getting hit.</v>

782
00:34:40.751 --> 00:34:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called North Hollywood Moitai,</v>

783
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.740
<v Speaker 5>which was Ramallah pet and guys like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that with train was all tied there and </v>

784
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.590
<v Speaker 5>it was amazing training and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy,</v>

785
00:34:50.591 --> 00:34:53.830
<v Speaker 5>all the traders walk around like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they had their shins are like steel.</v>

786
00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:55.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean they were literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like iron.</v>

787
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.130
<v Speaker 1>So they don't feel their shins anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

788
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit the skin so much that it becomes</v>

789
00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>like a knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

790
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:07.310
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those guys had been doing it their </v>

791
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.981
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally don't feel shit like </v>

792
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:10.950
<v Speaker 1>regularly people kick ropes that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap around like a poll.</v>

793
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.760
<v Speaker 1>They just thought the leg into the rope </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again just to deaden it.</v>

794
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
<v Speaker 1>So that becomes like a weapon and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit is slamming into the meat of your </v>

795
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.400
<v Speaker 1>fucking thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ugh.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and I tell marshal people into various </v>

797
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.490
<v Speaker 5>combat sports,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I call it the dark side of martial arts </v>

799
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.600
<v Speaker 5>or combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quicker,</v>

800
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.950
<v Speaker 5>easier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more seductive.</v>

801
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.360

<v Speaker 5>200 fights.</v>

802
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.870
<v Speaker 5>You have your first one or two fights </v>
<v Speaker 5>for anybody knows if you are.</v>

803
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 5>It's dead serious.</v>

804
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred.</v>

805
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 2>200 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

806
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Sandra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw kickstarters like 240 fights,</v>

807
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.320
<v Speaker 2>30 laws where the hell it is and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't understand the culture will </v>

808
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.870
<v Speaker 2>never be able to wrap their head around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they do.</v>

809
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 2>They fight at a very young age and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>take on the last name of their gym.</v>

810
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a slavery sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation like they own.</v>

811
00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:59.790
<v Speaker 2>You Baucau had big problems with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym.</v>

812
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understood.</v>

813
00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 2>He recently left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

814
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the.</v>

815
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Is his name or is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Jim's name.</v>

816
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

817
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Bull cow is his actual actual net,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

818
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.470
<v Speaker 2>They take on the and it's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those guys,</v>

819
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.190
<v Speaker 2>they know they take the first round off </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially first and the fifth verse.</v>

820
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Thailand the first round I </v>

821
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.450
<v Speaker 2>saw a great fight.</v>

822
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.450
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>

823
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Thailand a Turkish dude was fighting </v>

824
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.000
<v Speaker 2>a tiger and I was like one 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a heavyweight in Thailand,</v>

825
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.670
<v Speaker 2>and the first round the target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just feeling them out,</v>

826
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.790
<v Speaker 2>not really throwing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Turkish guys going,</v>

827
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.120
<v Speaker 2>this guy is scared or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought he was scared and kind of </v>

828
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.120
<v Speaker 2>went after him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to just defending whatever.</v>

829
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 2>And he thought he was kicking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second round the tag I opened up on him,</v>

830
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 2>crushed his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped the fight.</v>

831
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Second round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take the first round off,</v>

832
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.240
<v Speaker 2>they take the first round off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fight rounds two,</v>

833
00:36:54.241 --> 00:36:59.241
<v Speaker 2>three and four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the fifth round they take off </v>

834
00:36:59.241 --> 00:36:59.241
<v Speaker 2>because they know who won already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was asking my instructor go,</v>

835
00:36:59.241 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 2>why are they just walking around and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

836
00:36:59.821 --> 00:37:01.410
<v Speaker 2>they already know who won and they fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>next week.</v>

837
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:02.910
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fight next week.</v>

838
00:37:02.911 --> 00:37:03.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

839
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why it was weird like as an American</v>

840
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:07.690
<v Speaker 2>mentality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

841
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 2>last round fucking I'm behind you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

842
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really do that.</v>

843
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 2>They fight rounds two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

844
00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:16.401
<v Speaker 2>and four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then fifth round they take off </v>

845
00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:16.401
<v Speaker 2>because he already won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to fight in 10 days.</v>

846
00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:18.190
<v Speaker 2>When your career is 255,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one last and hold.</v>

847
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:23.510
<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating that literally one </v>
<v Speaker 2>style figured out how like what is the </v>

848
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:29.931
<v Speaker 2>most effective?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the most economic use of your </v>

849
00:37:29.931 --> 00:37:32.811
<v Speaker 2>physical tools when it comes to striking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's one group of people in this </v>

850
00:37:32.811 --> 00:37:35.940
<v Speaker 2>one small chain of islands when it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thailand's a couple islands,</v>

851
00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:36.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

852
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you consider put cat island,</v>

853
00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 2>his apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

854
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.560
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

855
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Kick the shit out of your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elbow you in the face flying knees and </v>

856
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:45.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

857
00:37:45.601 --> 00:37:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know that stuff,</v>

858
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 2>all the other stuff becomes invalid.</v>

859
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.900
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you need all the other stuff?</v>

860
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't understand those leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks,</v>

861
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.240
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know how to check them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

862
00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.890
<v Speaker 2>especially if you get a pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his type dude hitting you,</v>

863
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's guys that can hit you over and </v>

864
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.040
<v Speaker 2>over again in the legs and you can take </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you can have,</v>

865
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can hit you like 20 times and </v>

866
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:08.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll still be moving around the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight,</v>

867
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 2>but then this pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his who was a couple of those,</v>

868
00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 2>you hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear that meat cutting shin.</v>

869
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Just dig into the dudes thigh and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the look in his eyes and you go,</v>

870
00:38:18.061 --> 00:38:23.061
<v Speaker 2>oh Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got so many of the misery of </v>

871
00:38:23.061 --> 00:38:26.001
<v Speaker 2>fighting guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I had to do in Thailand a couple </v>

872
00:38:26.001 --> 00:38:27.780
<v Speaker 2>times is it doesn't knock you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please knock me out.</v>

873
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I can go down onto the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're standing there in it.</v>

874
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 2>You either quit or you keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

875
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.830
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your choice.</v>

876
00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>When the kicks you like</v>

877
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:41.100
<v Speaker 5>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can either quit because this sucks or </v>

878
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.100
<v Speaker 5>I can keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like a knockout.</v>

879
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.070
<v Speaker 5>We're like bang,</v>

880
00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 1>canvas and it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been stopped from?</v>

881
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

882
00:38:45.661 --> 00:38:46.890
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

883
00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I've had trouble walking the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never quit because of it.</v>

884
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.260
<v Speaker 1>You know who's going to hit you so fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>

885
00:38:52.261 --> 00:38:54.780
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible and it's such an easy.</v>

886
00:38:54.781 --> 00:38:59.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like an economic movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the movement of the Thai leg </v>

887
00:38:59.781 --> 00:39:00.720
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that requires a great</v>

888
00:39:00.721 --> 00:39:03.630
<v Speaker 1>amount of strength like a wheel kick or </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning back kick.</v>

889
00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:08.631
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't require a lot of dexterity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's natural for the average human </v>

890
00:39:08.631 --> 00:39:09.450
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the cool things about it.</v>

891
00:39:09.451 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique involved in more time,</v>

892
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:17.830
<v Speaker 1>what ties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so prizing really technical and you can </v>

893
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.961
<v Speaker 1>see a lot of guys who are not athletic </v>
<v Speaker 1>specimens but they excel at it because </v>

894
00:39:20.961 --> 00:39:23.940
<v Speaker 1>their technique is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what to do when this happens.</v>

895
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 1>They know what to do with that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've gone through it so many times in</v>

896
00:39:26.611 --> 00:39:31.611
<v Speaker 1>the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw that left hook of your red </v>

897
00:39:31.611 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 1>legs there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that right leg kicks comment and then </v>

898
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 1>the jabs falling behind it and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>combinations,</v>

899
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.090
<v Speaker 1>he's classic combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start to get through,</v>

900
00:39:36.091 --> 00:39:41.091
<v Speaker 1>so even like a guy who's more athletic </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't fuck with a guy who's more </v>

901
00:39:41.091 --> 00:39:43.950
<v Speaker 1>technical and more time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more so even than boxing.</v>

902
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you shut it down to just two things</v>

903
00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.010
<v Speaker 1>left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand and all the combinations that</v>

904
00:39:50.011 --> 00:39:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you could step man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super athletic guy like a Roy Jones</v>

905
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Jr is always going to be the slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cumbersome guy.</v>

906
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing about a Thai kick in,</v>

907
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.450
<v Speaker 5>and I've been hit with every kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>kick.</v>

908
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.130
<v Speaker 5>Don't fight questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that.</v>

909
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.980
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not hard to see.</v>

910
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:10.170
<v Speaker 5>There are only really three targets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They hit your leg to hit your ribs to </v>

911
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.190
<v Speaker 5>hit your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter if you get </v>

912
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.190
<v Speaker 5>something there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

913
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.190
<v Speaker 5>I see them hit for my ribs and you block</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

914
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.430
<v Speaker 5>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll throw one at your elbow.</v>

915
00:40:14.431 --> 00:40:16.890
<v Speaker 5>I saw Andy Sour fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeltsin cloudfare texts.</v>

916
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.080
<v Speaker 5>You know anything about Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an amazing matchup.</v>

917
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:24.650
<v Speaker 5>By the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Andy sours arm was like bright purple </v>

918
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.640
<v Speaker 5>and swollen because he kept blocking me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and blocking it.</v>

919
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.380
<v Speaker 5>He don't put your elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the throat,</v>

920
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:28.870
<v Speaker 5>your Shin.</v>

921
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a guy who hits really hard</v>

922
00:40:31.361 --> 00:40:33.580
<v Speaker 1>and you hold the pads for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much fucking hurts?</v>

923
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.080
<v Speaker 1>That shit hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine it hitting the outside Midi soft</v>

924
00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>part of your arm with no pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a guy like Peter efforts.</v>

925
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Now one of those you're going to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take three,</v>

926
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.420
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take four and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna want to cry for a month and</v>

927
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.230
<v Speaker 1>your whole body is going to be all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

928
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You just can't take those.</v>

929
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.660
<v Speaker 5>It's not a sport where you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to train really hard and be </v>

930
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:56.660
<v Speaker 5>okay tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

931
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.080
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just have to extend.</v>

932
00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.650
<v Speaker 5>I've done it in Holland and in Thailand </v>
<v Speaker 5>and was like,</v>

933
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:04.010
<v Speaker 5>it sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just have to know that this is what </v>

934
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go through.</v>

935
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Jerome Le Banner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest of all time,</v>

936
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.780
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a k one championship,</v>

937
00:41:05.781 --> 00:41:10.781
<v Speaker 1>but he was on his way and Nesto who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>banner was winning the fight and the </v>

938
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.280
<v Speaker 1>nested who's kept kicking his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>

939
00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:18.460
<v Speaker 1>just kicked him in the arm to his arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>broke and then you see the banner go </v>

940
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.910
<v Speaker 1>down and tried to get back up and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back into.</v>

941
00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Then who's kicked him right in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking spot again.</v>

942
00:41:22.401 --> 00:41:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Like bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

943
00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:29.110
<v Speaker 1>slammed right into that broken arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost a fight from broken arm at the </v>

944
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:31.850
<v Speaker 1>highest level of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

945
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you have to always be worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking those shots.</v>

946
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Your power kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of MMA,</v>

947
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:42.490
<v Speaker 1>the mentality is you can go through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling tournament and probably be </v>

948
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 1>okay at the end if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey Joe Rogan and Jimmy Smith,</v>

949
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.640
<v Speaker 1>you guys are going to grapple each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an hour.</v>

950
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>We can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

951
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:48.690
<v Speaker 1>we can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

952
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm in shape or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

953
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 1>We're not in shape and do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

954
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:56.921
<v Speaker 1>you can take breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to survive more time for an </v>

955
00:41:56.921 --> 00:41:56.921
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

956
00:41:56.921 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Hell.</v>

957
00:41:57.561 --> 00:42:02.561
<v Speaker 1>And it's that mentality of you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to get through that kind of shit </v>

958
00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 1>to be a good mixed martial artists and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of guys can't do it.</v>

959
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's the stopping point for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of guys and the elbows are just starting</v>

960
00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:10.490
<v Speaker 1>to make their way over the really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>elbow specialist.</v>

961
00:42:10.491 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 1>So just start like Anderson has always </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a master.</v>

962
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the clench.</v>

963
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.540
<v Speaker 1>He's a master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dirty boxing elbow like he,</v>

964
00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll pull you aside with one hand.</v>

965
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Anderson is so surprisingly physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong and we saw that in like the rich </v>

966
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Franklin fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which frankly is a fucking stud,</v>

967
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an Anderson got that plum on them.</v>

968
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.890
<v Speaker 1>It just started manipulating its neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>and driving those knees and you're like,</v>

969
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking strong and the technique is</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

970
00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:39.671
<v Speaker 1>His positioning of you is perfect every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time he knows what he's doing and he </v>

971
00:42:39.671 --> 00:42:40.680
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would land like a lot.</v>

972
00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm only techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like the high end </v>

973
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:45.690
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

974
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 1>they all I'm sure capable of throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

975
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:50.160
<v Speaker 1>but who's been super successful with </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing elbows,</v>

976
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 1>it's only like a few guys did with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Waza was good back in the day.</v>

977
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Especially on like it was known for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

978
00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would slice part.</v>

979
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

980
00:42:58.971 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would let them fly.</v>

981
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 1>He would have like these fucking really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide elbows when he would come in.</v>

982
00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:09.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was throwing torque into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of spinning techniques to </v>

983
00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 1>that famous knock out of Charles </v>
<v Speaker 1>McCarthy with a spinning back kick.</v>

984
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.210
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louisa was one of the first guys to drop</v>

985
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 1>a guy with a spinning back kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's way before,</v>

986
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis seaver.</v>

987
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.000
<v Speaker 1>He's become like sort of the specialists</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

988
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:21.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

989
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:26.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to have seen that man </v>

990
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.700
<v Speaker 1>seeing that this sort of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression of techniques and they're </v>

991
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fact that front kicks to the face </v>

992
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 1>of just started knocking people out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

993
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:36.110
<v Speaker 1>was it 2011 the need to be tore out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

994
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:38.960
<v Speaker 1>how did it make it to 2011?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's doesn't even make,</v>

995
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Speaker 1>it's such a good technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're almost,</v>

996
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pendulum swings around and mma,</v>

997
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:45.170
<v Speaker 1>it always has an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of those,</v>

998
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 1>if you want to say traditional martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts techniques we didn't see for awhile</v>

999
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:54.430
<v Speaker 1>are starting to make a comeback in mma </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of Anderson Silva and </v>

1000
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.430
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1001
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's making them.</v>

1002
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.890
<v Speaker 1>He was saying how it can be effective in</v>
<v Speaker 1>small doses.</v>

1003
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it in your back pocket for when you</v>

1004
00:43:59.661 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 1>need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real effective.</v>

1005
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole key is they only work if you </v>

1006
00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.291
<v Speaker 1>have all the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is most of the like </v>

1007
00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:08.990
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have all the other stuff.</v>

1008
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:13.991
<v Speaker 1>They don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what leg kicks are or </v>

1009
00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:13.991
<v Speaker 1>they don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not used to them.</v>

1010
00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to sprawl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to grapple.</v>

1011
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So those techniques are never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1012
00:44:16.611 --> 00:44:21.611
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get them off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because God is going to grab you and </v>

1013
00:44:21.611 --> 00:44:22.040
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you know all the other shit,</v>

1014
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 1>you know how to sprawl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Yay.</v>

1015
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled in college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1016
00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:27.110
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know submission defense?</v>

1017
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a black belt in Jujitsu.</v>

1018
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1019
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1020
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Well how long you been doing taekwondo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started when I was a little kid.</v>

1021
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1022
00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you talk about a guy who fought or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>karate style and then learn Jujitsu.</v>

1023
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are going to have like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird advantage because they have this </v>

1024
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.030
<v Speaker 1>dexterity know that the average person </v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't possess like a guy like Leo</v>

1025
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Machida can kick you in the face in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that the average person just can't </v>

1026
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.030
<v Speaker 1>do it because he's been doing karate his</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>

1027
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Like Anderson too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he had a taekwondo background first</v>

1028
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.260
<v Speaker 1>and then learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1029
00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

1030
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:04.390
<v Speaker 1>he has this dexterity with his body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he can do shit comfortable from </v>

1031
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 1>both sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is taekwondo thing.</v>

1032
00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're going to allocate like </v>

1033
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 1>what you were saying before about </v>
<v Speaker 1>allocating time to training,</v>

1034
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not going to put a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time on the wheel kick.</v>

1035
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 1>You're about to have a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn that shit sort of as a</v>

1037
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:19.590
<v Speaker 1>child or as a straight taekwondo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>karate competitor first,</v>

1038
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.770
<v Speaker 1>because the only way to really pull that</v>
<v Speaker 1>off is if a guy's not kicking your leg </v>

1039
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 1>or if a guy you know is not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot it and then take you down.</v>

1040
00:45:26.881 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Like for you to get good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're a white belt,</v>

1041
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try and it's gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 1>way easier for people to take you down.</v>

1042
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1043
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:37.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier for them to take you </v>

1044
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.411
<v Speaker 1>down and it's for you to land this </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlandish move where you're twisting </v>

1045
00:45:39.411 --> 00:45:40.980
<v Speaker 1>your body around like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballerina and they're going to drop it.</v>

1046
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna that's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gonna throw it away,</v>

1047
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but if you start out in taekwondo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop those techniques,</v>

1048
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:50.841
<v Speaker 1>when that's what everybody's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have them and then you can </v>

1049
00:45:50.841 --> 00:45:51.720
<v Speaker 1>learn the other things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>

1050
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:56.190
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of ironic that that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big sport for little kids like taekwondo</v>

1051
00:45:56.191 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's okay.</v>

1052
00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a good one for this.</v>

1053
00:45:58.930 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1054
00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:04.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like MMA is basically a scaled down</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of these different styles of </v>

1055
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.880
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see millie different throws outside </v>

1056
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.101
<v Speaker 2>ankle picks and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't see an MMA because </v>

1057
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:13.261
<v Speaker 2>they're not in that kind of range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have those things and </v>

1058
00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:13.261
<v Speaker 2>occasionally with good guy you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1060
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:18.830
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always fascinating to me when a </v>

1061
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:19.420
<v Speaker 2>really good wrestler gets in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see guys who,</v>

1062
00:46:19.421 --> 00:46:21.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally exhibit fairly decent takedown</v>

1063
00:46:21.761 --> 00:46:24.190
<v Speaker 2>defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get fucked up over and over again,</v>

1064
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like junior versus Cain in the rematch.</v>

1065
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1066
00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Who was the perfect example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Juniors takedown defense was the best</v>

1067
00:46:30.551 --> 00:46:35.551
<v Speaker 1>in the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been on his back for 13 seconds </v>

1068
00:46:35.551 --> 00:46:38.410
<v Speaker 1>in his entire fucking UFC career and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the heavyweight champion.</v>

1069
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some ridiculous tap danced around</v>

1070
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then people say,</v>

1071
00:46:42.611 --> 00:46:43.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did you fight?</v>

1072
00:46:43.841 --> 00:46:48.841
<v Speaker 1>That was a really good wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you stop and you think about it and </v>

1073
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:48.841
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane,</v>

1074
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Shane car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Olivia this wrestling thing,</v>

1075
00:46:50.771 --> 00:46:53.680
<v Speaker 1>this kid gets down and the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights land on him,</v>

1076
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1077
00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.570
<v Speaker 2>that is just awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1078
00:46:58.571 --> 00:47:01.570
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're in parterre positions.</v>

1079
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:04.490
<v Speaker 2>You're like thinking about what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do and then sucks.</v>

1080
00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.080
<v Speaker 2>How heavy is that light to that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to really hurt.</v>

1081
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:13.250
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't play it over at Madison Square </v>

1082
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Epic Fail on Youtube.</v>

1083
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody looked at that because it's </v>

1084
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:17.600
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1085
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.281
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think I'm listening hoodie takes </v>

1086
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:20.590
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had that kind of take down.</v>

1087
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane.</v>

1088
00:47:22.661 --> 00:47:27.661
<v Speaker 2>But Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for a fact came into that fight </v>

1089
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:30.661
<v Speaker 2>injured Janet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Janie had been having a lot of back and </v>

1090
00:47:30.661 --> 00:47:30.661
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:47:30.661 --> 00:47:30.661
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1092
00:47:30.661 --> 00:47:34.030
<v Speaker 1>he came into that fight after he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten off of surgery.</v>

1093
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1094
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.550
<v Speaker 1>some sort of crazy spine surgery or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1095
00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:41.551
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know he didn't have much time to </v>

1096
00:47:41.551 --> 00:47:44.491
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he didn't have much time to do </v>

1097
00:47:44.491 --> 00:47:44.491
<v Speaker 1>any sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1098
00:47:44.491 --> 00:47:44.491
<v Speaker 1>just he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1099
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.910
<v Speaker 1>he's dealing with some football injuries</v>
<v Speaker 1>from way back when.</v>

1100
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:54.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard for that dude to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a solid camp without getting </v>

1101
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:54.090
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

1102
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you go back to like when I think</v>

1103
00:47:55.841 --> 00:48:00.841
<v Speaker 1>his best performance was Frank Mir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the scariest Shane Carlin </v>

1104
00:48:00.841 --> 00:48:01.090
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just murdered Frank Mir.</v>

1105
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:03.380
<v Speaker 1>He got ahold of just mugged him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1106
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.290
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had them.</v>

1107
00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:07.120
<v Speaker 1>He had them ran out of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Well he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't breathe.</v>

1109
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:10.900
<v Speaker 1>He was like throwing punches and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>

1110
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:15.901
<v Speaker 1>And then he just had nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad because if he had just </v>

1111
00:48:15.901 --> 00:48:20.161
<v Speaker 1>learned how to relax and pick his shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might've been able to stop them in </v>

1112
00:48:20.161 --> 00:48:20.161
<v Speaker 1>the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all.</v>

1113
00:48:20.161 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And he definitely wouldn't have gassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out like he did.</v>

1114
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1115
00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:27.961
<v Speaker 1>it's a to visit adrenaline to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting for the title and you </v>

1116
00:48:27.961 --> 00:48:31.890
<v Speaker 1>just get this mad adrenaline dump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you realize the god is still there </v>

1117
00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:32.380
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

1118
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I might actually have to go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>three more fucking around for more </v>

1119
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:37.560
<v Speaker 1>rounds of this.</v>

1120
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:37.560
<v Speaker 5>Nobody listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1121
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you are a,</v>

1122
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:43.110
<v Speaker 5>an aspiring fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I have one piece of advice to give </v>

1123
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.110
<v Speaker 5>you based on what Joe here right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never ever set a pace.</v>

1124
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 5>You can't keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't throw.</v>

1125
00:48:46.241 --> 00:48:51.241
<v Speaker 5>If you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have x number of punches and around </v>

1126
00:48:51.241 --> 00:48:51.241
<v Speaker 5>or you have x number of punches in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

1127
00:48:51.241 --> 00:48:55.500
<v Speaker 5>If it's $300,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't feel 300 punches in the first </v>

1128
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:55.500
<v Speaker 5>round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see guys who was ultimately set a pace</v>

1129
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.040
<v Speaker 5>and you will look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't keep this up,</v>

1130
00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.600
<v Speaker 5>but you're hoping the other guy will </v>
<v Speaker 5>hopefully the other guy wants,</v>

1131
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.850
<v Speaker 5>which is never a solid bet</v>

1132
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.430
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not intelligent.</v>

1133
00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not an intelligent way to approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be successful occasionally.</v>

1134
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.210
<v Speaker 1>For a guy like vandelay Silva could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful for fucking ever.</v>

1135
00:49:09.211 --> 00:49:14.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was successful because he was so </v>

1136
00:49:14.211 --> 00:49:15.831
<v Speaker 1>murderous in his approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just freak people out and then he </v>

1137
00:49:15.831 --> 00:49:16.130
<v Speaker 1>would stomp them and destroy them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people figured out,</v>

1138
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.520
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can throw a left hook in the middle of</v>

1139
00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:20.190
<v Speaker 1>this will drop your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which happened.</v>

1140
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Cro Cop really sort of exposed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a real high level</v>

1141
00:49:24.001 --> 00:49:27.570
<v Speaker 1>striker and a guy was wild murderers </v>
<v Speaker 1>brawler angled off into,</v>

1142
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.580
<v Speaker 1>but vandelays stills one of my favorites</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

1143
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:35.540
<v Speaker 1>His fights were the most exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was fight like if you were going </v>

1144
00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.981
<v Speaker 1>to go see a vandelay Silva fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit was an event with vandelay </v>

1145
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:38.981
<v Speaker 1>fought soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abiola go,</v>

1146
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:39.480
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1147
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Looking at him across the corners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this shit was collarbone.</v>

1148
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:47.660
<v Speaker 1>We broke his collarbone three inches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my my favorite and one was that </v>

1149
00:49:47.881 --> 00:49:49.200
<v Speaker 1>knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fade away.</v>

1150
00:49:49.201 --> 00:49:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Punch that he landed as he was stepping </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

1151
00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And the sock Robert just flew backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1152
00:49:54.871 --> 00:49:55.680
<v Speaker 1>He is first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1153
00:49:55.681 --> 00:49:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:00.420
<v Speaker 1>He put down through the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen minutes.</v>

1155
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.320
<v Speaker 1>It was a tough fight and his face was </v>
<v Speaker 1>all fucked up to it.</v>

1156
00:50:03.321 --> 00:50:06.360
<v Speaker 1>You only had one eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could not see a lot of his left eye.</v>

1157
00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you want it to look at swollen I </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson or a vandelay Silva maybe.</v>

1158
00:50:11.971 --> 00:50:14.560
<v Speaker 1>You know the Google image sent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1159
00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Off the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson fight was one of the worst</v>

1160
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.010
<v Speaker 1>cuts and swollen eyes I've ever seen a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy keep fighting with.</v>

1161
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking nasty.</v>

1162
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:24.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan had him hurt too bad.</v>

1163
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 5>Took them down and then the got up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well Dan took</v>

1164
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.310
<v Speaker 2>that fight on short notice those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about trading with Dan at that</v>

1165
00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:32.000
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you really,</v>

1166
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at team punishment at Huntington </v>

1167
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:40.450
<v Speaker 2>beach and Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he lived there at the </v>

1168
00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:41.951
<v Speaker 2>time or lived near there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and randy couture come in there all </v>

1169
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:41.951
<v Speaker 2>the time and that was one of the fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

1170
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:41.951
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1171
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1172
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 2>was training with him for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan has always had that retarded power,</v>

1173
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.840
<v Speaker 2>just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his strength.</v>

1174
00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:49.980
<v Speaker 2>We grappled with room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1175
00:50:49.981 --> 00:50:50.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1176
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Was grappled with a fire hydrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a man.</v>

1177
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 2>He's made of wood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

1178
00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:57.130
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous that I grabbed a once in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

1179
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I actually had a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sucked,</v>

1180
00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he mauled me.</v>

1181
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.890
<v Speaker 2>He got me a leg lock or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe.</v>

1182
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.250
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it got me in a head and arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>choke or something like that.</v>

1183
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 2>But he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a dense dude dude.</v>

1184
00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Like he's like dense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hold on.</v>

1185
00:51:11.031 --> 00:51:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Don't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

1186
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.900
<v Speaker 2>it's got that grapplers bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of dudes out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't realize how you can look at </v>

1188
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 2>them and they develop this like freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>grapplers strength.</v>

1189
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1190
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 2>from just years and years and years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing bodies around what Dan has done</v>

1191
00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:28.640
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people don't as he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted that to striking.</v>

1192
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 2>You can't turn that into a knockout </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

1193
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because they're used to being </v>

1194
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.050
<v Speaker 2>such varied as they can't get that snap </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there punches.</v>

1195
00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Dan has somehow translated that grappler</v>
<v Speaker 2>body into a knockout punch,</v>

1196
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.370
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of guys can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1197
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.400
<v Speaker 2>and typically it wasn't the Greco guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would get like really good at </v>

1198
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 2>striking either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now I'm just more of the freestyle</v>

1199
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:51.500
<v Speaker 2>guys because the freestyle guys could </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot and when you're.</v>

1200
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.860
<v Speaker 2>When you develop that sort of ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explode in a double leg,</v>

1201
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same Shit can come with a punch.</v>

1202
00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Like Kevin random is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the retard,</v>

1203
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:05.030
<v Speaker 2>just unbelievably fast powered devil and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin randleman his prime.</v>

1204
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 2>He was a steamroller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would just freight train your ass.</v>

1205
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could jump over your body like he,</v>

1206
00:52:12.531 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was so ridiculously athletic.</v>

1207
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.790
<v Speaker 2>He could jump over your fucking body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 2>and random.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he would land a punch,</v>

1209
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.330
<v Speaker 2>he could land a punch the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could land that double.</v>

1210
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.940
<v Speaker 2>He would explode on you before you even </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it was common.</v>

1211
00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:28.580
<v Speaker 2>And you can crack you and tag you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he did to cro.</v>

1212
00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knocked out Cro,</v>

1213
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like a crazy surprise.</v>

1214
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a surprise that he had one </v>

1215
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:37.000
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you took them down and you know,</v>

1216
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.600
<v Speaker 2>mold them on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked about the fact that he knocked </v>

1217
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:40.600
<v Speaker 2>them out with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a left hook.</v>

1218
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Just ridiculous speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that coming from that,</v>

1219
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that use of that wrestling background.</v>

1220
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's a weird thing to transition </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a sport where you don't ever get </v>

1221
00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.221
<v Speaker 2>hit to transition from a sport where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>very might likely get knocked </v>

1222
00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least in practice.</v>

1223
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 2>It's very likely one day you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get unconscious wrestlers.</v>

1224
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:01.410
<v Speaker 2>What they bring generally to mma is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're incredibly hard workers.</v>

1225
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wrestled in high school and it was</v>

1226
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:09.161
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly difficult to training </v>

1227
00:53:09.161 --> 00:53:09.970
<v Speaker 2>and they compete a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be a lot,</v>

1228
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.780
<v Speaker 2>lot of tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:14.540
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wrestler in the NCAAS by like 40,</v>

1230
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:19.570
<v Speaker 2>40 matches in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They reached out to because of the </v>

1231
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 2>fucking weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just used to companion that used</v>

1232
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 2>to cut and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There used to be a miserable,</v>

1233
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.960
<v Speaker 2>miserable and hungry and all the time.</v>

1234
00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 5>So it's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem they have is they have to </v>

1235
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:32.300
<v Speaker 5>adjust to getting hit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are certain wrestlers that,</v>

1236
00:53:32.301 --> 00:53:37.301
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that never make that successful mental </v>

1237
00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:37.301
<v Speaker 5>leap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's also an issue with</v>

1238
00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 1>overtraining and that's a real issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with wrestlers and you know,</v>

1239
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:45.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like this whole willingness to push</v>
<v Speaker 1>it farther than the next man and the </v>

1240
00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:46.210
<v Speaker 1>pain is just weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaving your body.</v>

1241
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:51.830
<v Speaker 1>That's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is you should probably </v>

1242
00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 1>be paying attention to your heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should probably know.</v>

1243
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Is it up five beats today from </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday?</v>

1244
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1245
00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:56.270
<v Speaker 1>you're overtraining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want.</v>

1246
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you piss in a cup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1247
00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you're dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

1248
00:53:58.381 --> 00:53:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Look what's going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1249
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't have minerals in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know,</v>

1250
00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like the wrestling mentality is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up pussy,</v>

1251
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:09.290
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on your fucking converse all stars </v>

1252
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.290
<v Speaker 1>or run up hill to get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in there and that,</v>

1253
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:12.240
<v Speaker 1>that's good and it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good if you're,</v>

1254
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you're super honest about what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on but bad if you know you're not and </v>

1256
00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:19.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't pay attention to signs of over</v>

1257
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.250
<v Speaker 5>our wold in wrestling before mma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when resident is wrestling,</v>

1258
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.520
<v Speaker 5>how old did people wrestle?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't get out of your mid twenties </v>

1259
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you can have that mentality because </v>

1260
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 5>you only did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You 25 problems.</v>

1261
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.530
<v Speaker 5>You take that to mma where you could do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it until your mid thirties.</v>

1262
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:38.680
<v Speaker 5>Randy couture to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't maintain that.</v>

1263
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:41.710
<v Speaker 5>How about Hopkins man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1264
00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:43.630
<v Speaker 5>How to explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what it is.</v>

1265
00:54:43.631 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 5>You know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to tell you why I'm gonna.</v>

1266
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.820
<v Speaker 5>Tell you why the dude is tech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen him get hurt.</v>

1267
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.480
<v Speaker 5>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many Bernard Hopkins </v>

1268
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:54.480
<v Speaker 5>fight since way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His first fight with Roy Jones.</v>

1269
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:59.280
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy doesn't get is technically so </v>

1270
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.280
<v Speaker 5>good that he hasn't gone through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things physically.</v>

1271
00:55:00.281 --> 00:55:01.780
<v Speaker 5>A lot of fighters have gone through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hasn't.</v>

1272
00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.160
<v Speaker 5>Did Chad Dawson drop him?</v>

1273
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Chad doesn't ever dry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see the fight.</v>

1274
00:55:05.941 --> 00:55:08.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't think ever dropped him unless </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm mistaken.</v>

1275
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that number's dropped him </v>
<v Speaker 5>off at work though.</v>

1276
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's easy to do when you're 45 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is what it said.</v>

1277
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.480
<v Speaker 5>There's 48 dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's 48.</v>

1278
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:20.050
<v Speaker 5>Then this fighting soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's fighting in March.</v>

1279
00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.340
<v Speaker 5>There's something I want to talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

1280
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:22.490
<v Speaker 5>I want to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1281
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.280
<v Speaker 5>As a commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we.</v>

1282
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.280
<v Speaker 5>We interview thousands of fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousand.</v>

1283
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:32.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something called the heartmath,</v>

1284
00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:35.410
<v Speaker 5>which is in interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We asked a fighter,</v>

1285
00:55:35.411 --> 00:55:37.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had fighters cry.</v>

1286
00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:39.100
<v Speaker 5>They wanted something so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want this so bad.</v>

1287
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:44.280
<v Speaker 5>They literally cry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They literally break down in front of </v>

1288
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:44.280
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go in there,</v>

1289
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.780
<v Speaker 5>they take on a guy who's just better </v>
<v Speaker 5>than they are and they lose.</v>

1290
00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was at Ego Wagner Jujitsu down in </v>

1291
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 5>Missouri.</v>

1292
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 5>I was picking up a car and I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1293
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.381
<v Speaker 5>how do we go values here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was doing some Jujitsu with them </v>

1294
00:55:56.381 --> 00:55:56.381
<v Speaker 5>and all these guys are going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1295
00:55:56.381 --> 00:55:59.660
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you tell a guy getting ready </v>

1296
00:55:59.660 --> 00:55:59.660
<v Speaker 5>for mma?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

1297
00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.060
<v Speaker 5>be technically sound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will listen to your coaches and make </v>

1298
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.361
<v Speaker 5>sure you have all the tools to win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they all kind of sat and they were </v>

1299
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:06.361
<v Speaker 5>quiet for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>

1300
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:06.640
<v Speaker 5>I thought you'd give some speech about </v>
<v Speaker 5>heart.</v>

1301
00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Speaker 5>And I know I've seen guys with a heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>without technique makes a beating more </v>

1302
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.340
<v Speaker 5>interesting because the guy is still </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting up when he's getting tattooed.</v>

1303
00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:16.420
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

1304
00:56:16.421 --> 00:56:21.421
<v Speaker 5>if you weren't technically sound like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bernard Hopkins probably beat a lot of </v>

1305
00:56:21.421 --> 00:56:23.120
<v Speaker 5>guys with my heart that he had floyd </v>
<v Speaker 5>mayweather weeds.</v>

1306
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.430
<v Speaker 5>A lot of guys with more heart than they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have because they are technically sound.</v>

1307
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.930
<v Speaker 5>They're really sounded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:56:27.931 --> 00:56:28.780
<v Speaker 5>Heart's important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what?</v>

1309
00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.660
<v Speaker 5>You can't overstate the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>heart.</v>

1310
00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.370
<v Speaker 5>But guys who go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1311
00:56:32.371 --> 00:56:33.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got heart.</v>

1312
00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:34.440
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1313
00:56:34.441 --> 00:56:35.790
<v Speaker 5>that can make a beating a lot more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>you need.</v>

1314
00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:37.050
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the technique to go with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1315
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.450
<v Speaker 5>And it brought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hopkins is a great example of that,</v>

1316
00:56:39.451 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 5>of a guy who is just technically really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really sound.</v>

1317
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:44.400
<v Speaker 5>It had a long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great career because of it.</v>

1318
00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:45.210
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1319
00:56:45.211 --> 00:56:50.211
<v Speaker 5>people think that somehow my heart's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to overcome a guy who put in more </v>

1320
00:56:50.211 --> 00:56:50.760
<v Speaker 5>work and it's more tech than I am and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1321
00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:55.940
<v Speaker 5>It rarely works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It works often enough that it's </v>

1322
00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:56.940
<v Speaker 5>developed this myth of that that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot work these guys and you know,</v>

1323
00:56:56.941 --> 00:56:59.220
<v Speaker 5>if he's in shaping as good technique,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is really,</v>

1324
00:56:59.221 --> 00:57:04.221
<v Speaker 5>really hard to do and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've noticed over and over again and </v>

1325
00:57:04.221 --> 00:57:04.221
<v Speaker 5>fighting the guy can be motivated as </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1326
00:57:04.221 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't have the technique and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't put in work,</v>

1327
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:07.860
<v Speaker 5>it is not going to help you.</v>

1328
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll happen.</v>

1329
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm now and then if you catch a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's out of shape or a guy who's got it</v>

1330
00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:14.820
<v Speaker 1>and weakness in his game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a striking weakness in his game,</v>

1331
00:57:14.821 --> 00:57:19.821
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's more technical and grappling </v>

1332
00:57:19.821 --> 00:57:19.821
<v Speaker 1>and you have more heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd take it to them,</v>

1333
00:57:19.821 --> 00:57:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but a guy was technically sound across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the board.</v>

1334
00:57:21.001 --> 00:57:21.990
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>

1335
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 5>It can expose the other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lack of preparedness.</v>

1336
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:29.370
<v Speaker 5>That's what heart does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It exposes the other guys lack of </v>

1337
00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:29.370
<v Speaker 5>preparedness because you know the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

1338
00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:29.980
<v Speaker 5>shogun forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first shogun.</v>

1339
00:57:29.981 --> 00:57:32.650
<v Speaker 5>Forrest Shogun was not prepared for that</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight,</v>

1340
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 5>he just wasn't physically prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what happened in the rematch showing</v>

1341
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:41.791
<v Speaker 5>was prepared and blasted for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's probably the biggest heart in </v>

1342
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:41.791
<v Speaker 5>the whole game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1343
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:42.700
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things where I think a</v>

1344
00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 5>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1345
00:57:44.531 --> 00:57:49.531
<v Speaker 5>it's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy with this big heart defeated </v>

1346
00:57:49.531 --> 00:57:49.531
<v Speaker 5>this guy and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey look,</v>

1347
00:57:49.531 --> 00:57:49.531
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be technically sound</v>

1348
00:57:49.531 --> 00:57:54.180
<v Speaker 1>first before anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're dealing with two </v>

1349
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.420
<v Speaker 1>different us too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference of several fights </v>

1350
00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.130
<v Speaker 1>and fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest fires sites,</v>

1351
00:57:59.131 --> 00:58:04.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forrest is known for having the most </v>

1352
00:58:04.131 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 1>exciting fights in the UFC history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important,</v>

1353
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:08.320
<v Speaker 1>exciting fight in the history of the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Stephan Bonner and forrest griffin,</v>

1354
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:11.050
<v Speaker 1>the files of the ultimate fighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're folks who haven't seen it.</v>

1355
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:16.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a real classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it again recently because it </v>

1356
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:16.260
<v Speaker 1>was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I was dealing,</v>

1357
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:16.260
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1358
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've saw was,</v>

1359
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of them dvr and I've </v>

1360
00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:22.580
<v Speaker 1>watched that fight and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1361
00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 1>what a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was at the time it was so crazy,</v>

1362
00:58:24.431 --> 00:58:26.020
<v Speaker 1>like we knew it was going to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

1363
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.510
<v Speaker 1>but when they got on there and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>went off,</v>

1364
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:30.090
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just chaos.</v>

1365
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.250
<v Speaker 1>There were so evenly matched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had trained together for so long.</v>

1366
00:58:33.251 --> 00:58:38.251
<v Speaker 1>They knew what the fuck each other did </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just went after each other for </v>

1367
00:58:38.251 --> 00:58:40.890
<v Speaker 1>three glorious rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe made him in that modern man.</v>

1368
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 1>He can't do that forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1369
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:47.791
<v Speaker 1>that's not the smartest way to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smartest way to fight is to be </v>

1370
00:58:47.791 --> 00:58:50.371
<v Speaker 1>technical and to choose your spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although I appreciate for sure from </v>

1371
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.880
<v Speaker 1>a point of view of like a spectator who </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves to say,</v>

1372
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1373
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the fuck out of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they did it,</v>

1374
00:58:58.001 --> 00:59:00.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was great to watch.</v>

1375
00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Well pay to watch that guy anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime,</v>

1376
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.430
<v Speaker 1>anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1377
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Chris leave and is always going to be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think Chris is a not the right </v>

1378
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.710
<v Speaker 1>example anymore because he's got a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more technical over.</v>

1379
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Like especially if you go back to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Erin Simpson fight.</v>

1380
00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.950
<v Speaker 1>He fought very smart in that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1381
00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 1>his last fight wasn't as best fight the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Derek Brunson fine,</v>

1382
00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:21.830
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>

1383
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just he had a,</v>

1384
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.300
<v Speaker 2>he had at least a year off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1385
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 2>and he had substance issues and a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of other shit going on,</v>

1386
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:35.561
<v Speaker 2>so I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Chris liebing is always one of the </v>

1387
00:59:35.561 --> 00:59:37.430
<v Speaker 2>most exciting guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys that he might not</v>

1388
00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:42.431
<v Speaker 2>ever be the champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not ever be able to beat </v>

1389
00:59:42.431 --> 00:59:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will pay to see that guy fight any day</v>

1390
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:43.820
<v Speaker 2>of the week.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Beast.</v>

1402
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 2>He goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not expect that at all.</v>

1403

<v Speaker 2>He's an intention and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see when he's talking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot going on behind the eyes.</v>

1405
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>You're just getting started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the scary part.</v>

1406
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1407
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:24.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was super impressed with him and Eddie</v>

1408
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Alvarez fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1409
01:00:24.581 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

1410
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 2>She's done it.</v>

1411
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.230
<v Speaker 2>did you really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1412
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.240
<v Speaker 2>because that third round Eddie starts 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>off channel,</v>

1413
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:33.560
<v Speaker 2>looked at a gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1414
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:35.960
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably great performance.</v>

1415
01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:40.961
<v Speaker 2>This is probably it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came out and round for like it was </v>

1416
01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:40.961
<v Speaker 2>shot out of a cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie just was not ready for it.</v>

1417
01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:42.590
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad Dude.</v>

1418
01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:47.760
<v Speaker 2>There's so few of those guys that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this special thing about them and </v>

1419
01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:53.501
<v Speaker 2>you see them come up and you go with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy just for whatever reason he </v>

1420
01:00:53.501 --> 01:00:53.501
<v Speaker 2>just stands out.</v>

1421
01:00:53.501 --> 01:00:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Like what percentage of it is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

1422
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.580
<v Speaker 2>is it one percent of all the fighters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>see a guy,</v>

1425

<v Speaker 2>I would go as high as 55 percent use.</v>

1433
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:23.150
<v Speaker 2>early fights and I was there when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought a jay her on.</v>

1434
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.140

<v Speaker 2>he was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that really turned my head when </v>

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because trick at the time was a top </v>

1442
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.511
<v Speaker 2>contender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only lost to Matt Hughes and soccer and </v>

1443
01:01:43.511 --> 01:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>it was like he just balled him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ran through them.</v>

1444
01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 2>He just put up a page that frank trigg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it got to the ground of.</v>

1445
01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just manhandled them.</v>

1446
01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like really shocked.</v>

1447
01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember when he got off of a </v>

1448
01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:57.960
<v Speaker 2>trick said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really fucking good man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was just shocked.</v>

1450
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of those guys,</v>

1451
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>like when Anderson first came into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>octagon and we fought Chris leaving,</v>

1452
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had seen him fight many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen his difference between his </v>

1453
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:12.760
<v Speaker 2>pride days where he was still learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>submissions and is more time,</v>

1454
01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:17.090
<v Speaker 2>wasn't exact word was then to the cage </v>
<v Speaker 2>rage days.</v>

1455
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.510
<v Speaker 2>When you went over to England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a cage rage</v>

1456
01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>in cage rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he fought Lee Murray and he fought.</v>

1457
01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Tony frequently hit him with that upward</v>
<v Speaker 1>elbow was a stepping forward,</v>

1458
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>upward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elegant.</v>

1459
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Missed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1460
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you pretend to miss the hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we loaded him with blam and </v>

1461
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:37.941
<v Speaker 1>caught him on the Chin and knocked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unconscious and I knew that </v>

1462
01:02:37.941 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Anderson was something special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew he was coming into his own,</v>

1463
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>especially the Lee Marie fight because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee Mary,</v>

1464
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>who went on to be one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>notorious criminals in UK history and </v>

1465
01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>get a movie about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1466
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I've heard MMA fighter turned,</v>

1467
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was alleging is Tyson because,</v>

1468
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1469
01:02:55.790 --> 01:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>he was history at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the story goes that he met </v>

1470
01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Tito Ortiz in London back when Tito was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the champ.</v>

1471
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.790
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

1472
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.740
<v Speaker 1>either didn't know Tito was or didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck who tito was and they got an</v>

1473
01:03:09.741 --> 01:03:10.410
<v Speaker 1>a street fight.</v>

1474
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And the word is that Lee Marie one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street fight.</v>

1475
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.740
<v Speaker 1>That was what everybody had said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1476
01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:17.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1477
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.640
<v Speaker 1>even after Tito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last to chuck in the post fight </v>

1478
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.371
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was talking about how there's 185 </v>

1479
01:03:25.371 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>pounders running his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoot,</v>

1480
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is after he just thought chocolate </v>

1481
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:31.080

<v Speaker 1>He was calling out Leanne Marie.</v>

1482
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>So it was a legit chief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happened for sure.</v>

1483
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.020
<v Speaker 1>And then he went from there to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1484
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.080
<v Speaker 1>getting somehow or another involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this insane armed robbery,</v>

1485
01:03:43.081 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>like right out of state the movie where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have masks on and machine guns.</v>

1486
01:03:47.941 --> 01:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>And they held hostages and they stole </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of dollars.</v>

1487
01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the biggest heist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>British history,</v>

1488
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>and then he went to Morocco and then in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morocco he got arrested for,</v>

1489
01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like cocaine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping.</v>

1490
01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many years can I add onto my </v>

1491
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>sentence here?</v>

1492
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at it here.</v>

1493
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>You would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1494
01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the run from the biggest armed </v>
<v Speaker 1>robbery in the UK history.</v>

1495
01:04:12.571 --> 01:04:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I got this fat bag of money with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I come out?</v>

1496
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I never understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a great dark cooking </v>

1497
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>cowboys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen it?</v>

1498
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Great documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corbin Corbin,</v>

1499
01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I met that guy in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1500
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.020
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Florida.</v>

1501
01:04:25.021 --> 01:04:30.021
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I kept thinking as I was </v>

1502
01:04:30.021 --> 01:04:30.021
<v Speaker 1>watching that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way listeners,</v>

1503
01:04:30.021 --> 01:04:30.021
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't seen cookie cowboys was </v>
<v Speaker 1>great documentary.</v>

1504
01:04:30.021 --> 01:04:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1505
01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one into there's two.</v>

1506
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>And these guys make hundreds of millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars closer.</v>

1507
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.040
<v Speaker 1>At what point do you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done not risking life sentence over </v>

1508
01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have $50 million.</v>

1509
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Can I budget in my head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1510
01:04:46.381 --> 01:04:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can live on this.</v>

1511
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1512
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you could spend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1513
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I think they take the money and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes like they know what the numbers </v>

1514
01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.280
<v Speaker 1>on the money where and then they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the circulation.</v>

1515
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Be alerted to get a legit job and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to be a mortician.</v>

1516
01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:10.740
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to be in Morocco to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not go to prison for the rest of my </v>

1517
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:10.740
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I would rather be lucky.</v>

1519
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I think he gets like girls in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because got a chick pregnant.</v>

1520
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

1521
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:18.990
<v Speaker 2>hooked up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

1522
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 2>That's why he ran there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His family's Moroccan.</v>

1523
01:05:21.281 --> 01:05:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I guess they got some juice in Morocco </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't.</v>

1524
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's dealing with like the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pablo Escobar prison in Colombia.</v>

1525
01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:28.590
<v Speaker 2>That's like a compound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't let them.</v>

1526
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.630
<v Speaker 2>The idea of supporting criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither do I,</v>

1527
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:35.670
<v Speaker 2>but I do like the idea that this a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go where jail's not really jail </v>

1528
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:40.490
<v Speaker 2>and he could pay some people off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just live like they did the rest of the </v>

1529
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.490
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1530
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:43.480
<v Speaker 2>That is the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been all over the place.</v>

1531
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.500
<v Speaker 2>It's the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1532
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1533
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.060
<v Speaker 2>you should be using it in a bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think corruption should be used </v>

1534
01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 2>in a bad way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once he used that way,</v>

1535
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.650
<v Speaker 2>when a guy can get a dope cell because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's paying for,</v>

1536
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.930
<v Speaker 2>they can bring in girls.</v>

1537
01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't really hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1538
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:59.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1539
01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 2>fucking a security guards got to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>security guards got a tough way to make </v>

1540
01:06:04.681 --> 01:06:05.520
<v Speaker 2>a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1541
01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:09.180
<v Speaker 2>So I don't mind him getting a few extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred bucks if he brings it hookers.</v>

1542
01:06:09.181 --> 01:06:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Really Marie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't see a problem with that.</v>

1543
01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:13.200
<v Speaker 2>The unions in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hilarious.</v>

1544
01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:18.201
<v Speaker 2>Here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prison guard union is one of most </v>

1545
01:06:18.201 --> 01:06:19.260
<v Speaker 2>powerful unions in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time they tried to do any kind of,</v>

1546
01:06:19.261 --> 01:06:24.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we search guards before they go in </v>

1547
01:06:24.261 --> 01:06:24.261
<v Speaker 2>there or something because dark guards </v>
<v Speaker 2>are making huge money,</v>

1548
01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:26.500
<v Speaker 2>get old cell phones and give them to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners and Melissa,</v>

1549
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:30.480
<v Speaker 2>they can do their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stop it every single time,</v>

1550
01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:36.860
<v Speaker 2>every single time and because if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>know they're all corrupt and then all </v>

1551
01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:37.980
<v Speaker 2>they're all sneaking weed in and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1552
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.110
<v Speaker 2>The fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1553
01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:43.260
<v Speaker 2>this needs to be a little room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckery in this world.</v>

1554
01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Everything can be cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty bucks.</v>

1555
01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Let's prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in a cigarette is 20 bucks a </v>

1556
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.280
<v Speaker 2>cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one cigarette being a guard and bringing</v>

1557
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.040
<v Speaker 2>in a pack of cigarettes and making that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of money.</v>

1558
01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian would be worth every penny.</v>

1559
01:06:56.271 --> 01:06:58.240
<v Speaker 2>It would give you that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would,</v>

1560
01:06:58.241 --> 01:06:58.870
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1561
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Probably just have one Sayer Ji who he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be one a day.</v>

1562
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:06.910
<v Speaker 2>What could you deal with like $100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette habit a week and you deal with</v>

1563
01:07:06.911 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 2>one cigarette a day or would you just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy?</v>

1564
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I probably have like two hits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put it out to hits the next day,</v>

1565
01:07:11.621 --> 01:07:15.010
<v Speaker 2>put it out so I would make it last like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're like crazy.</v>

1566
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.080
<v Speaker 2>That's like serious addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

1567
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 2>how many of you smoking a day these days</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a pack?</v>

1568
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Are you worried about like when you hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our friend Duncan gets cancer,</v>

1569
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's basically your age and then all</v>

1570
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:32.281
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going through radiation and all </v>

1571
01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:32.281
<v Speaker 2>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that freak you out at all?</v>

1572
01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't put cigarettes at mass or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1573
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you trying to say about talking</v>

1574
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:40.210
<v Speaker 2>shit about a fucking person?</v>

1575
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.040
<v Speaker 2>You know what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else is bad that I do?</v>

1576
01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:47.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drank,</v>

1577
01:07:47.491 --> 01:07:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoke whatever.</v>

1578
01:07:50.031 --> 01:07:52.040
<v Speaker 2>So you just don't give a fuck about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat vehicle.</v>

1579
01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:54.080
<v Speaker 2>You're just gonna ride that shit until </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wheels fall off.</v>

1580
01:07:54.081 --> 01:07:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Is that the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

1582
01:07:57.351 --> 01:08:02.351
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got their own decisions to </v>

1583
01:08:02.351 --> 01:08:04.400
<v Speaker 2>making this really hard to be a comedian</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go to a comedy club and not drink.</v>

1584
01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:08.030
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to go to be a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go to a comedy club and not smoke.</v>

1585
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1586
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:14.900
<v Speaker 2>it's more fun if you do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

1587
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1588
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 2>you're hanging out with comedians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want a drink.</v>

1589
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

1590
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1591
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.570
<v Speaker 2>pulls out a joint yet little known fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a drink in my life.</v>

1592
01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Really little known fact.</v>

1593
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 2>But my parents are both alcoholics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1594
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.600
<v Speaker 2>dad's real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real bad.</v>

1595
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Good move that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1596
01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't need this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1597
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Just in case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just in case we went back off.</v>

1598
01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.690
<v Speaker 2>That's a reason why I've never tried </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

1599
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:43.691
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a chance to watch no one in my </v>

1600
01:08:43.691 --> 01:08:45.461
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have chance to watch some friends </v>

1601
01:08:45.461 --> 01:08:45.461
<v Speaker 2>lose their fucking shit over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1602
01:08:45.461 --> 01:08:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Smart to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1603
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that everybody should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an alcoholic in their family,</v>

1604
01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:54.041
<v Speaker 2>but you should really held the broad </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrums of how bad something can fuck </v>

1605
01:08:54.771 --> 01:08:55.760
<v Speaker 2>up your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1606
01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:57.820
<v Speaker 2>the show intervention on any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1607
01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 2>my wife's a producer and she produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention for like a year and a half.</v>

1608
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she worked for the production unit,</v>

1609
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:05.390
<v Speaker 2>didn't mention the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would tell me about these addicts.</v>

1610
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:06.730
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the what,</v>

1611
01:09:06.731 --> 01:09:11.731
<v Speaker 2>what's weird is the inconsistency of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>where some adults will do one drug and </v>

1612
01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:12.080
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really do.</v>

1613
01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

1614
01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1615
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:18.300
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but coke is their thing or why our </v>

1616
01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:22.450
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our brains key into a particular drug </v>

1617
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:22.860
<v Speaker 2>and go and they can't get off whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is is,</v>

1618
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1619
01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1620
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.600
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird how some people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard hardwired for that and other people</v>

1621
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:31.601
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have an addictive </v>

1622
01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:31.601
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I remember,</v>

1623
01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:31.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love fighting,</v>

1624
01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:35.641
<v Speaker 2>I love training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's more of a reaction that you </v>

1625
01:09:35.641 --> 01:09:36.200
<v Speaker 2>could call it a physical addiction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1626
01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 2>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1627
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:38.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1628
01:09:38.251 --> 01:09:39.980
<v Speaker 2>it's weird what keys into certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1629
01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:43.230
<v Speaker 2>how some people get hooked on something </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people have no problem with it.</v>

1630
01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:45.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of genetic variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Especially when it comes to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1632
01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 2>it's the oldest running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1633
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:53.410
<v Speaker 2>story in America really from the dawn of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1634
01:09:53.411 --> 01:09:54.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pilgrim days.</v>

1635
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:57.410
<v Speaker 2>It was the Indians and their inability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to handle alcohol.</v>

1636
01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.680
<v Speaker 2>That is the American and native </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans have consistently had a </v>

1637
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.200
<v Speaker 2>problem with alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that genetically they're</v>

1638
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:10.201
<v Speaker 2>bodies are not designed to process it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't a part of their </v>

1639
01:10:10.201 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 2>culture until the white man showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was this massive Polynesian.</v>

1640
01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.240
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Long Beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of samoans.</v>

1641
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1642
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Last thing you want is a family of drunk</v>
<v Speaker 2>samoans.</v>

1643
01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right after you.</v>

1644
01:10:18.401 --> 01:10:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love me.</v>

1645
01:10:19.221 --> 01:10:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I lost some old friends so I'm cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

1646
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.540
<v Speaker 2>they roam in packs with families and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1647
01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Well I find that generally very friendly</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1648
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievably friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Family oriented.</v>

1649
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't be content with you.</v>

1650
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1651
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:34.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1652
01:10:34.601 --> 01:10:35.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1653
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.740
<v Speaker 2>cultural lack of a history with alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucks them up,</v>

1654
01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really can.</v>

1655
01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:46.150
<v Speaker 2>There's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a cultural history of </v>

1656
01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:46.150
<v Speaker 2>fucking straight alcoholics.</v>

1657
01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a lot of Irish folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my dad was half Irish.</v>

1659
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:48.500
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:53.501
<v Speaker 2>I have a good buddy who's a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was Irish and drunk a Greg Fitzsimmons.</v>

1661
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 2>He's told the story 100 times and about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how his dad,</v>

1662
01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking crashed a car while he was drunk</v>

1663
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.740
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1664
01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.760
<v Speaker 2>it was in the hospital for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then got out of the hospital and like </v>

1665
01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.390
<v Speaker 2>almost immediately started drinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1666
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

1667
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.320
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my dad went through dts while </v>

1668
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:14.320
<v Speaker 2>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time my mom said,</v>

1669
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:14.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was driving,</v>

1670
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 5>apparently had any drink in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is weird.</v>

1671
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what he was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>

1672
01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.490
<v Speaker 5>but mom said you were in the backseat or</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1673
01:11:19.491 --> 01:11:22.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were there and he started shaking and</v>

1674
01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.440
<v Speaker 5>he started shaking any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulled the car over and he started </v>

1675
01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:27.440
<v Speaker 5>convulsing and a cop came and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you need help?</v>

1676
01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 5>Does he need to go to the emergency </v>
<v Speaker 5>room?</v>

1677
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 5>Because he was having convulsions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gideon drink that morning.</v>

1678
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.320
<v Speaker 5>One day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One morning,</v>

1679
01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:36.600
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One morning I saw he had a head injury,</v>

1680
01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:38.250
<v Speaker 5>which is how he will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really how he died,</v>

1681
01:11:38.251 --> 01:11:40.110
<v Speaker 5>but he had a head injury and he was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hospital.</v>

1682
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:45.111
<v Speaker 5>One time I went to visit him and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>had him tied to the bed and he's like </v>

1683
01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:45.690
<v Speaker 5>thrashing around in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His eyes are rolling back.</v>

1684
01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.150
<v Speaker 5>He's literally in a coma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but dts we'll go through them anyway.</v>

1685
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:53.180
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body's still reacting to the fact </v>

1686
01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.161
<v Speaker 5>that you don't have any alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these thrashing around and he's </v>

1687
01:11:55.161 --> 01:11:55.161
<v Speaker 5>screaming and all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I.</v>

1688
01:11:55.161 --> 01:11:56.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking down at him and I forget who</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm with.</v>

1689
01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 5>And they went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you believe this?</v>

1690
01:11:58.231 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 5>I turned them off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I don't drink.</v>

1691
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.050
<v Speaker 5>You see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wanna take a picture of this because</v>

1692
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:02.520
<v Speaker 5>this is why I don't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

1693
01:12:02.521 --> 01:12:04.830
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can see why you don't drink this.</v>

1694
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.520
<v Speaker 5>Your body will go through dts anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you're in a coma or not,</v>

1695
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:10.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that kind of stuff,</v>

1698
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:17.240
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1699
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Design can get hooked on alcohol or </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin or something that sucks.</v>

1700
01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Something that's bad for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like working out.</v>

1701
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.750
<v Speaker 1>It's been asked for people and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do it.</v>

1702
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1706
01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:35.870
<v Speaker 1>some sort of training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me feel better.</v>

1707
01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:40.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suffering through a bulging disc </v>

1708

1709
01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Rolfing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

1711
01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:50.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like what kind of pain relief it </v>

1712
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.180
<v Speaker 1>gives you once the pain is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the loosening of my back,</v>

1713
01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.480
<v Speaker 1>my back feels more limber than it's felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a year.</v>

1714
01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had an issue with my back for </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a while.</v>

1715
01:12:59.691 --> 01:13:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I could get injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neck is bad.</v>

1716
01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.020
<v Speaker 1>You have bulging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1717
01:13:03.021 --> 01:13:03.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1718
01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.110
<v Speaker 1>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you get an MRI or anything?</v>

1719
01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1720
01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:12.220
<v Speaker 5>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is years ago when I was at teen </v>

1721
01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:12.220
<v Speaker 5>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody dropped me on my head and I,</v>

1722
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.810
<v Speaker 5>I it balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It herniated slight herniation here.</v>

1723
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:16.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1724
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.730
<v Speaker 5>I had therapy for like six months and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they went okay,</v>

1725
01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:25.970
<v Speaker 5>and this is a backline how many money?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I had to have a friend of mine as </v>

1726
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:27.090
<v Speaker 5>chiropractors take care of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was like therapy and it fixed it,</v>

1727
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.920
<v Speaker 5>but it's the one thing that I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 5>sparring.</v>

1728
01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:30.950
<v Speaker 5>I'll take one and I'll fill this and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>got,</v>

1729
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.000
<v Speaker 5>I got to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep going,</v>

1730
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:34.440
<v Speaker 5>then I got to put ice on it and all that</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1731
01:13:34.441 --> 01:13:38.520
<v Speaker 5>It's just always a slight problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you do still have a bulbs?</v>

1732
01:13:38.521 --> 01:13:39.570
<v Speaker 5>They're probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1733
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:41.190
<v Speaker 5>no press in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:13:41.191 --> 01:13:43.020
<v Speaker 5>If I get hit on the head janitor,</v>

1735
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:47.160
<v Speaker 1>what happened to mark Coleman apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>got paralyzed.</v>

1736
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.520
<v Speaker 1>He was training with random and again </v>
<v Speaker 1>and random and dumped amount his head </v>

1737
01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.750
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't move for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was something crazy like 30 </v>

1738
01:13:56.750 --> 01:14:00.291
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his body was just completely </v>

1739
01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:00.291
<v Speaker 1>frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary 30 seconds.</v>

1740
01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he thought this is it.</v>

1741
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in a wheelchair for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life directly myself with my </v>

1742
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:06.230
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1743
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what could have happened to them.</v>

1744
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Going from the UFC heavyweight champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world and that from one like that</v>

1745
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:13.300
<v Speaker 5>wilkes retired because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he?</v>

1746
01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 5>He was the guy that I fought actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was fighting.</v>

1747
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:21.210
<v Speaker 5>I fought James Walks and he had a some </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of herniation in his neck and set </v>

1748
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 5>and the doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you keep doing this,</v>

1749
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:25.280
<v Speaker 5>you're going to risk paralysis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I'm out I'm out.</v>

1750
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.200
<v Speaker 1>There's different ways to treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1751
01:14:27.201 --> 01:14:32.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Ra thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a buddy of mine from the gym had a </v>

1752
01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:35.730
<v Speaker 1>good personal experience from it and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like really painful stuff,</v>

1753
01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but when it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they're breaking the muscle,</v>

1754
01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:44.690
<v Speaker 1>like the muscle Fascia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're ripping it off the scar </v>

1755
01:14:44.821 --> 01:14:46.440
<v Speaker 1>tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're dealing with,</v>

1756
01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:48.570
<v Speaker 1>their elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking horrifically painful.</v>

1757
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:52.620
<v Speaker 1>They put all their weight on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it's done like man,</v>

1758
01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:57.621
<v Speaker 1>like all the sudden like there's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this range of motion that wasn't there </v>

1759
01:14:57.621 --> 01:14:58.200
<v Speaker 1>before and I tried to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this fuckery man?</v>

1760
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Is this like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1761
01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:04.790
<v Speaker 1>some bullshit Voodoo that they put on me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and given me a rubber place hit with a </v>

1762
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Hologram on it and saying it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>make my balance better.</v>

1763
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.620
<v Speaker 1>But I think objectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1764
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.590
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some serious relief in my.</v>

1765
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty consistent about like deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue massage and all the different </v>

1766
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.030
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chiropractic care,</v>

1767
01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but this made a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a noticeable difference.</v>

1768
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:25.060
<v Speaker 5>A fighter is always in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never fought in a retrain.</v>

1769
01:15:25.061 --> 01:15:30.061
<v Speaker 5>Don't understand that like any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any athlete or basketball players and </v>

1770
01:15:30.061 --> 01:15:30.061
<v Speaker 5>knees are shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1771
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.580
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1772
01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 5>they're constantly in pain and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>difference between hurt and injured,</v>

1773
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.450
<v Speaker 5>his align a fighter is always walking a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighter.</v>

1774
01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:38.980
<v Speaker 5>Never goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not hurt ever.</v>

1775
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.490
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is always in pain</v>

1776
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.330
<v Speaker 1>thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1777
01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:49.380
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys trained through injuries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why how I fucked my backup </v>

1778
01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.441
<v Speaker 1>way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I injured it and then I was </v>

1779
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:52.441
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1780
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:52.441
<v Speaker 1>just keep rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go talk to them.</v>

1781
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Call Roll Light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tap quicker,</v>

1782
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>

1783
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I won't put myself in strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

1784
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Once you get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start rolling.</v>

1785
01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Starting the whole purpose of role in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's try to get dudes.</v>

1786
01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get you and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get them.</v>

1787
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:04.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1788
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

1789
01:16:05.931 --> 01:16:10.931
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why you're doing in the </v>

1790
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:10.931
<v Speaker 1>first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of this because it's fun.</v>

1791
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:13.270
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to go after I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to go home.</v>

1792
01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had done,</v>

1793
01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I had numbness in my hand and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>get this pain in my elbow and things got</v>

1794
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.140
<v Speaker 1>the Ulnar nerve is so you'll see seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that where your injury</v>

1795
01:16:25.141 --> 01:16:26.160
<v Speaker 1>is just here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1796
01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a really scary one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting dropped on the head sucks.</v>

1797
01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons I liked that.</v>

1798
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:35.281
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu starts on the knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bad thing is that a lot of guys </v>

1799
01:16:35.281 --> 01:16:38.350
<v Speaker 1>don't have good take downs or take down </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense and if you you face a wrestler,</v>

1800
01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:43.351
<v Speaker 1>you're really fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't take him down and he's </v>

1801
01:16:43.351 --> 01:16:43.351
<v Speaker 1>better standing because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doomed,</v>

1802
01:16:43.351 --> 01:16:44.770
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna get teed off on.</v>

1803
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.960
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to defend submissions if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've been grappling your whole life.</v>

1804
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:49.610
<v Speaker 5>It's just a natural thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard.</v>

1805
01:16:49.611 --> 01:16:50.780
<v Speaker 5>I hate carrying around,</v>

1806
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting tossed around is one of the </v>

1807
01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:56.780
<v Speaker 1>easiest ways to get fucking seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt when you're.</v>

1808
01:16:56.781 --> 01:17:00.080
<v Speaker 1>When you're wrestling with really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who can throw,</v>

1809
01:17:00.081 --> 01:17:05.081
<v Speaker 1>you know guys who can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get double unders on you and they </v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking Suplex you legit in the gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're launching their back,</v>

1811
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:09.840
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1812
01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:10.050
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1813
01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.100
<v Speaker 2>slamming you into the ground first with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them behind you.</v>

1814
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:18.101
<v Speaker 2>All 200 plus pounds of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get really fucked up like </v>

1815
01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:19.990
<v Speaker 2>separated shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible disc injuries.</v>

1816
01:17:19.991 --> 01:17:24.991
<v Speaker 2>So I don't fuck with that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's an important thing to do to </v>

1817
01:17:24.991 --> 01:17:26.120
<v Speaker 2>like roll with a guy like that to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's possible.</v>

1818
01:17:26.121 --> 01:17:31.121
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worries about getting slammed on </v>

1819
01:17:31.121 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me that's a big one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a gigantic.</v>

1821
01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.850
<v Speaker 2>The most injuries I've ever seen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat sports.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Judo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's judo is like.</v>

1823
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.440
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because people don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1824
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:40.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1825
01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.810
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like it would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst.</v>

1826
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:45.060
<v Speaker 2>People get thrown in their elements pop </v>
<v Speaker 2>out or nice.</v>

1827
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Probably a fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean world champs.</v>

1828
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll shoot a broke his arm in a </v>

1829
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 2>tournament because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a world champ.</v>

1830
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you just,</v>

1831
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.670
<v Speaker 2>you don't see that that often?</v>

1832
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Like hardly ever will a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1833
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally I'll get an arm broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily tap,</v>

1834
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:59.660
<v Speaker 2>but they typically don't want to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get thrown,</v>

1835
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:02.750
<v Speaker 2>you're not in shock array.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haji gracie fight where he didn't.</v>

1836
01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Sap tucks it in his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd let them fight and he let him break</v>

1837
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:08.060
<v Speaker 2>his fucking arm and then he got out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and won by points.</v>

1838
01:18:08.061 --> 01:18:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I could not believe I trained machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>grab too,</v>

1839
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:14.000
<v Speaker 2>but how?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is his mentality?</v>

1840
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:16.520
<v Speaker 2>He let a dude break his arm and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu tournament.</v>

1841
01:18:16.521 --> 01:18:18.830
<v Speaker 2>Where's he going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he gonna win that $100,</v>

1842
01:18:18.831 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is he going to win?</v>

1843
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:22.890
<v Speaker 2>How much is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just do tournament pay at 20,000.</v>

1844
01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:28.130
<v Speaker 2>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it worth to get your fucking arm </v>

1845
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.700
<v Speaker 2>salute?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Final match of the absolute sued stuffed</v>

1846
01:18:28.701 --> 01:18:33.701
<v Speaker 2>in there and this is after you'd already</v>
<v Speaker 2>won his division and just defended for </v>

1847
01:18:33.701 --> 01:18:34.580
<v Speaker 2>the last few seconds for him.</v>

1848
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1849
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.480
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude's a beast.</v>

1850
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:41.150
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a serious competitor man who lets</v>

1851
01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:43.490
<v Speaker 2>you break his fucking arm and just says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1852
01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1853
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:45.830
<v Speaker 2>here's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one mentality.</v>

1854
01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's one thing you can say though,</v>

1855
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:51.230
<v Speaker 2>is there is the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1856
01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:52.370
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already broken.</v>

1857
01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I got a minute and I remember it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time left.</v>

1858
01:18:54.901 --> 01:18:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a minute and a half left of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minute match and he went,</v>

1859
01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 2>it's already broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to get more broken.</v>

1860
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can win this thing.</v>

1861
01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not the kind of thing where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an MCL goes out and like if I stand</v>

1862
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 2>on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get even worse.</v>

1863
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Fucking broken is broken on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't gonna get a whole lot worse and</v>

1864
01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:11.870
<v Speaker 2>when I got a minute left and made it.</v>

1865
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the mentality of yeah,</v>

1866
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't make it twice I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can.</v>

1867
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.110
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is when a guy gets a </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical injury like that,</v>

1868
01:19:21.111 --> 01:19:23.280
<v Speaker 2>like you'd get an arm snapped or a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>nap,</v>

1869
01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:28.720
<v Speaker 2>you might not ever be the same again and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have to go through Rehab for </v>

1870
01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.410
<v Speaker 2>seven months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight months if you're lucky.</v>

1871
01:19:30.411 --> 01:19:33.650
<v Speaker 2>If everything goes perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can schedule your surgery in time</v>

1872
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.450
<v Speaker 2>and then go through it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1873
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:38.510
<v Speaker 2>that's why everybody's terrified of guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who's Mr Paul Harris,</v>

1874
01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.800
<v Speaker 2>who some are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets a hold of your leg and starts </v>

1875
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.421
<v Speaker 2>rolling and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's my height and a foot wider </v>

1876
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 2>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1877
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:53.051
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much weight he cuts to </v>

1878
01:19:53.051 --> 01:19:53.051
<v Speaker 2>get down to a hundred 85 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>

1879
01:19:53.051 --> 01:19:54.320
<v Speaker 2>he literally looks like a cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure.</v>

1880
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:55.260
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's from,</v>

1881
01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.780
<v Speaker 2>from my team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlson Gracie,</v>

1882
01:19:56.810 --> 01:20:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of them was the Montana is and </v>

1883
01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm with Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga was you the same family and stuff.</v>

1884
01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:04.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dude is one of those guys where it's</v>

1885
01:20:04.761 --> 01:20:06.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

1886
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:07.970
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you okay</v>

1887
01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:13.150
<v Speaker 1>to Jujitsu all you do because it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you saw in Abu Dhabi and he took on </v>

1888
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>God I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marco's Avalon,</v>

1889
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to say had him and he'll hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1890
01:20:18.991 --> 01:20:19.860
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1891
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And he keeps rolling and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're out of bounds.</v>

1892
01:20:21.991 --> 01:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And he taps and he knew that Marcos have</v>
<v Speaker 1>law was lightening up because they're at</v>

1893
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:30.171
<v Speaker 1>a browns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he just went for the kill and </v>

1894
01:20:30.171 --> 01:20:30.171
<v Speaker 1>try to submit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he stood up like,</v>

1895
01:20:30.171 --> 01:20:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good match,</v>

1896
01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:33.430
<v Speaker 1>because that one was furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then remember they restarted,</v>

1897
01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>they restart and when the heel hook tap </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>

1898
01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 1>ready go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

1899
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:42.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum and moving and you generate </v>

1900
01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 1>that momentum to say stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready,</v>

1901
01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:48.831
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big advantage to the guy that </v>

1902
01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:51.411
<v Speaker 1>was applying to submission you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you allowed him to get to a superior </v>

1903
01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:55.491
<v Speaker 1>position because that initial explosion </v>
<v Speaker 1>is way quicker to do with your arm like </v>

1904
01:20:55.491 --> 01:20:57.990
<v Speaker 1>that than it is to do with your leg and </v>
<v Speaker 1>twisting your fucking foot.</v>

1905
01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:00.000
<v Speaker 1>That's already in a bad spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

1906
01:21:00.001 --> 01:21:05.001
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the idea of more because I was </v>

1907
01:21:05.001 --> 01:21:07.810
<v Speaker 1>clearly upset and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Tokyo is like,</v>

1908
01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.400
<v Speaker 1>are you paying attention?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slapped him.</v>

1909
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:13.770
<v Speaker 1>When he went to hug him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he hit him,</v>

1910
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.870
<v Speaker 1>which maps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he jumped up on the fence before the</v>

1911
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 1>fight was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1912
01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:20.820
<v Speaker 1>that was Kim Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Miller,</v>

1913
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Dan Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that combination of,</v>

1914
01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:29.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick on the ground and not all their </v>

1915
01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:29.490
<v Speaker 1>upstairs is frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.610
<v Speaker 1>He's a nut frightening and he's been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg snapper forever.</v>

1917
01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1918
01:21:33.511 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've never seen him.</v>

1919
01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry guerrilla type man.</v>

1920
01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And his technique is lawless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1921
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.310
<v Speaker 1>he's so strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his technique is perfect.</v>

1922
01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:49.311
<v Speaker 1>There's a video online with him rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>with mayhem in Brazil and he takes me.</v>

1923
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.450
<v Speaker 1>He takes him down like smoothly passes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1924
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:58.700
<v Speaker 1>takes his back and then transitions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arm bar all in one glorious move.</v>

1925
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And you watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

1926
01:22:00.451 --> 01:22:04.320
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's just fluid like water.</v>

1927
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he,</v>

1928
01:22:05.531 --> 01:22:07.440
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ducked under ma'am.</v>

1929
01:22:07.441 --> 01:22:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Scooped him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumped him,</v>

1930
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:10.830
<v Speaker 1>just took his back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took the arm by.</v>

1931
01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:11.670
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1932
01:22:11.671 --> 01:22:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I know mayhem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1933
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Mayhem is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man has a very good ground game.</v>

1934
01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:18.270
<v Speaker 1>He's got very good defense.</v>

1935
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.480
<v Speaker 1>He survives a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to see that guy run through them </v>

1936
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:23.480
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he like,</v>

1937
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Woo wasn't even there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1938
01:22:24.061 --> 01:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker,</v>

1939
01:22:25.951 --> 01:22:27.180
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plan B,</v>

1940
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Plan B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hector lumbar fight was a terrible </v>

1941
01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:36.540
<v Speaker 1>matchup for him because Hector Lombard </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so fucking powerful with his hands.</v>

1942
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And Hector's takedown defense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

1943
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:44.270
<v Speaker 1>When you see the Tim Boetsch fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a good fight for hector was </v>

1944
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.270
<v Speaker 1>one of his worst fights ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look good.</v>

1945
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking takedown defense is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1946
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:49.800
<v Speaker 1>he sprawls and slammed down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground with them.</v>

1947
01:22:49.801 --> 01:22:52.560
<v Speaker 1>That is a power sprawl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he gets those,</v>

1948
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Bush shot in on him and he,</v>

1949
01:22:55.030 --> 01:23:00.030
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he over under them and kicked his hips </v>

1950
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.030
<v Speaker 1>back and drop the two of them down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

1951
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1952
01:23:00.841 --> 01:23:03.510
<v Speaker 1>That is some other worldly strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another dude.</v>

1953
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 1>He's like five foot nothing and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet wide.</v>

1954
01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

1955
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.820
<v Speaker 1>like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

1956
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:11.821
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight and just built like a fucking </v>

1957
01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 1>comic book hero and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his movement,</v>

1958
01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 1>like the shit that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can do to people,</v>

1959
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:20.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's striking the put on people.</v>

1960
01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:24.160
<v Speaker 1>He's just a ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous athletic specimen.</v>

1961
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett said that a heat taught him</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle ups,</v>

1962
01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had never done it before,</v>

1963
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:35.040
<v Speaker 1>which a muscle up is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start with a chin up and then you </v>

1964
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 1>pull yourself up to your Chin and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you push yourself all the way up to like</v>

1965
01:23:37.571 --> 01:23:42.571
<v Speaker 1>a dip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're fully extended and he said </v>

1966
01:23:42.571 --> 01:23:42.571
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to do.</v>

1967
01:23:42.571 --> 01:23:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Like Alistair Overeem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they liked,</v>

1968
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:46.340
<v Speaker 1>someone was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had one of those gymnastics do,</v>

1969
01:23:46.341 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1970
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:51.520
<v Speaker 1>let's treat workout dudes that do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like crazy core strength,</v>

1971
01:23:51.521 --> 01:23:56.521
<v Speaker 1>athletic moves and he couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped along by just starts whipping </v>

1972
01:23:56.521 --> 01:23:56.521
<v Speaker 1>them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

1974
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just does like 10 muscle ups in a row,</v>

1975
01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:03.160
<v Speaker 1>which is impossible to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to never have done it before.</v>

1976
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:05.590
<v Speaker 1>And just pull yourself up like that over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

1977
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You got to be unbelievably strong.</v>

1978
01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.130
<v Speaker 5>I've had people tell me that when he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>at CSW,</v>

1979
01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 5>which is Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian's team here in southern </v>

1980
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 5>California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1981
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 5>on Fulton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

1982
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:15.740
<v Speaker 5>mop up the blood when they would spar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes.</v>

1983
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:19.880
<v Speaker 5>Hector does not know how to spar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Luckily he doesn't know how to be like,</v>

1984
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:22.420
<v Speaker 5>he just goes full out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just Barnett.</v>

1985
01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.240
<v Speaker 5>Gigantic dude.</v>

1986
01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Barnett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like punishing him or he got on he </v>

1988
01:24:30.630 --> 01:24:32.261
<v Speaker 1>mounted and they would not let them go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just kept beating them up because </v>

1989
01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:36.880
<v Speaker 1>apparently there was an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>hector beating up other people in the </v>

1990
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.100
<v Speaker 1>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're sparring hector,</v>

1991
01:24:37.101 --> 01:24:42.101
<v Speaker 1>that's always been the knock is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to fight you like you're </v>

<v Speaker 1>but ideally it would be great if there </v>

2052
01:26:48.730 --> 01:26:51.971
<v Speaker 1>was like equal value because if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>equal value then everybody would get </v>

2053
01:26:51.971 --> 01:26:52.040
<v Speaker 1>together and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2054
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:54.110
<v Speaker 1>we've got to promote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's fucking make a deal.</v>

2055
01:26:54.111 --> 01:26:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do in here?</v>

2056
01:26:55.191 --> 01:27:00.191
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's chop this up and let's figure out </v>

2057
01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:00.191
<v Speaker 1>a way to get the best fighters in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world fighting.</v>

2058
01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:00.191
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

2059
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:05.300
<v Speaker 5>the UFC to its credit is so the brand </v>
<v Speaker 5>has been marketed so incredibly well in </v>

2060
01:27:08.361 --> 01:27:12.740
<v Speaker 5>so incredibly well that the value behind</v>
<v Speaker 5>the UFC brand is so high.</v>

2061
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:14.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

2062
01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:14.660
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2063
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.070
<v Speaker 5>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A brand behind the UFC is so high that,</v>

2064
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:18.880
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that brand is what's on the line if they</v>

2065
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:19.760
<v Speaker 5>finally you see either the best.</v>

2066
01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's what's on the line.</v>

2067
01:27:21.131 --> 01:27:23.170
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy because when we first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

2068
01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:26.590
<v Speaker 1>when I became a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that me and my friends sit</v>

2069
01:27:26.591 --> 01:27:31.591
<v Speaker 1>around and think that mma needed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of folks don't know that in 1997 </v>

2070
01:27:31.591 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 1>and then may was so underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people had no idea what it is.</v>

2071
01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:36.520
<v Speaker 1>And I always said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2072
01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.760
<v Speaker 1>We need some like crazy billionaires </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened in be fight fans to just </v>

2073
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 1>come along and buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I never thought that was actually </v>

2074
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.051
<v Speaker 1>gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it would actually be like some </v>

2075
01:27:49.051 --> 01:27:49.540
<v Speaker 1>of the nicest fucking guys on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>

2076
01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:54.541
<v Speaker 1>like Lorenzo in Frankfurt or some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicest fucking human beings you could </v>

2077
01:27:54.541 --> 01:27:56.830
<v Speaker 1>ever want to meet that gentleman in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every sense of the word.</v>

2078
01:27:57.250 --> 01:27:59.830
<v Speaker 1>They're easy to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're friendly,</v>

2079
01:27:59.831 --> 01:28:02.440
<v Speaker 1>they're kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cool motherfuckers.</v>

2080
01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.900
<v Speaker 1>And they love fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love boxing.</v>

2081
01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.750
<v Speaker 1>They bet stupid money on boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all of the time.</v>

2082
01:28:07.751 --> 01:28:12.751
<v Speaker 1>They're big floyd mayweather fans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were big ricky Hatton fans and you </v>

2083
01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:12.751
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2084
01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:13.540
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love combat sports.</v>

2085
01:28:13.541 --> 01:28:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It's always been a passion for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

2086
01:28:15.161 --> 01:28:17.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also happen to own 20 casinos.</v>

2087
01:28:17.261 --> 01:28:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps.</v>

2088
01:28:17.861 --> 01:28:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like literally like we manifested</v>

2089
01:28:21.401 --> 01:28:25.270
<v Speaker 1>them like we created the Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Joe Rogan.</v>

2090
01:28:25.271 --> 01:28:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We needed billionaires to come along and</v>

2091
01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like simulation theory,</v>

2092
01:28:30.490 --> 01:28:31.060
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2093
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:36.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe provides you what your </v>

2094
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.070
<v Speaker 1>creative imagination is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concoct.</v>

2095
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2096
01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do buy that.</v>

2097
01:28:39.641 --> 01:28:44.641
<v Speaker 1>We were lucky as fuck to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fertittas come along and they spent so </v>

2098
01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:47.971
<v Speaker 1>much money to get the UFC to where it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they actually started making </v>

2099
01:28:47.971 --> 01:28:51.991
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That at one point in time they were </v>

2100
01:28:51.991 --> 01:28:53.551
<v Speaker 1>thinking about quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like 40 something million </v>

2101
01:28:53.551 --> 01:28:53.551
<v Speaker 1>dollars in the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people don't know.</v>

2102
01:28:53.551 --> 01:28:53.551
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

2103
01:28:53.551 --> 01:28:57.210
<v Speaker 5>People talk about MMA and UFC like it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a home run.</v>

2104
01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.090
<v Speaker 5>That was of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course it was going to be big,</v>

2105
01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:01.290
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't.</v>

2106
01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 5>They took and</v>

2107
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 1>people that I don't understand who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2108
01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:08.730
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knocked the UFC and and look,</v>

2109
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.480
<v Speaker 1>they took the risk and put the money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it wasn't a home run,</v>

2110
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when like you said,</v>

2111
01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:19.281
<v Speaker 1>they were 40 in the hole and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>super intelligent and they did create a </v>

2112
01:29:19.281 --> 01:29:23.010
<v Speaker 1>brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They built the brand up and they got it </v>

2113
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:23.010
<v Speaker 1>to where it is and they deserve every </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking penny.</v>

2114
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:23.780
<v Speaker 1>They knew exactly what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

2115
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:25.380
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's reality.</v>

2116
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:30.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sport would not be here where it</v>

2117
01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:32.070
<v Speaker 1>is right now if it wasn't for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

2118
01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:34.410
<v Speaker 1>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they didn't spend that money and take</v>

2119
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:37.350
<v Speaker 1>that chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it had to get promoted,</v>

2120
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing that it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2121
01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It really is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so psyched.</v>

2122
01:29:41.191 --> 01:29:45.750
<v Speaker 1>We're going to Chicago this weekend and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then pedes versus Serona's happened </v>

2128
01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:10.690
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If folks can get past the fact that </v>

2138
01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:42.120
<v Speaker 1>interesting lineage to me because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just talking about his trainer Matt Hume</v>

2139
01:30:42.121 --> 01:30:42.720
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>

2140
01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.180

<v Speaker 1>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically every coaching stuff,</v>

2142
01:30:49.531 --> 01:30:54.531

<v Speaker 1>It was pankration and it was.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ranks.</v>

2148
01:31:10.650 --> 01:31:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hume has stayed ahead of the curve </v>
<v Speaker 1>and continue to evolve his teaching and </v>

2149
01:31:16.861 --> 01:31:20.280
<v Speaker 1>his game and his fighters to where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports at.</v>

2150
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like a lot of guys get stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get stuck with a certain style.</v>

2151
01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:25.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the hammer house style.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the guys who make it from that early </v>

2156
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:44.940
<v Speaker 1>pioneer age where Matt Hume's fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back and look at Matt,</v>

01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Frank shamrock submitted data and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood the heel hook inverted.</v>

2165
01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 2>He'll hook you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2166
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 2>that was nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of interesting of in Dan</v>

2167
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Gable gave commentary on it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was already.</v>

2168
01:32:15.971 --> 01:32:17.350
<v Speaker 2>It was already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty involved.</v>

2169
01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the matches,</v>

2170
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:25.111
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember what I was hoping </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that would actually become </v>

2171
01:32:25.111 --> 01:32:27.721
<v Speaker 2>something that people could watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think there's something cool </v>

2172
01:32:27.721 --> 01:32:31.201
<v Speaker 2>about watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really aggressive submission </v>

2173
01:32:31.201 --> 01:32:31.201
<v Speaker 2>grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2174
01:32:31.201 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 2>if you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marcello Garcia,</v>

2175
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you watch a jock array or jake shields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who really goes after the finish</v>

2176
01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:40.560
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see that on television I think would </v>

2177
01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.380
<v Speaker 2>be really interesting for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2178
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:44.610
<v Speaker 2>but that's the part that we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most trouble translating May.</v>

2179
01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the part where people start </v>
<v Speaker 2>booing and you know,</v>

2180
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:52.080
<v Speaker 2>and I'm seeing something awesome and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd's booing and that's okay.</v>

2181
01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:55.030
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't make everybody happy.</v>

2182
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:58.930
<v Speaker 2>You can see what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is MMA,</v>

2183
01:32:58.931 --> 01:33:00.790
<v Speaker 2>which has a ton of action and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling,</v>

2184
01:33:01.230 --> 01:33:06.230
<v Speaker 2>the grapplers part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the people that have at least </v>

2185
01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:06.230
<v Speaker 2>attempts to meet with someone that's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling.</v>

2186
01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:10.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to do a real pro wrestling </v>

2187
01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:10.650
<v Speaker 2>which Kenny Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again finishing in that.</v>

2188
01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:13.780
<v Speaker 2>The difference I think is in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission.</v>

2189
01:33:13.781 --> 01:33:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Who watches Abu Dhabi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean guys like us,</v>

2190
01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:20.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2191
01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.440
<v Speaker 2>on Espn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's in the front of </v>

2192
01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:25.960
<v Speaker 2>sports illustrated who's the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangler on the planet earth.</v>

2193
01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.600
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's something that's missing.</v>

2194
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:33.601
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing and I think high level </v>

2195
01:33:33.601 --> 01:33:33.990
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing is the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like eye level kickboxing,</v>

2196
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.070
<v Speaker 2>like k one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know glory.</v>

2197
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Just put on a pay per view event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to do something in</v>

2198
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:40.650
<v Speaker 2>America this year and they might throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of money.</v>

2199
01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2200
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:43.090
<v Speaker 2>They might be able to pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

2201
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't down with their last thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had like,</v>

2202
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought the paper you,</v>

2203
01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:49.210
<v Speaker 2>but it was four fights in a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2204
01:33:49.211 --> 01:33:54.211
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were making the guys fight two </v>

2205
01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:54.211
<v Speaker 2>minute rounds for five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two minute rounds.</v>

2206
01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I was one out of Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2207
01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Was that in Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they had a new year's eve show,</v>

2208
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2209
01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was because it was in combination </v>

2210
01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:05.340
<v Speaker 2>with dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also,</v>

2211
01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.180
<v Speaker 2>they did both of them back to back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same place and it was incredible.</v>

2212
01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really fucking good fights,</v>

2213
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:14.550
<v Speaker 2>but to see Daniel Gita in the final </v>
<v Speaker 2>round against semi shell just exhausted </v>

2214
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:19.500
<v Speaker 2>having fought three fucking tough fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the third fight was against that big</v>

2215
01:34:19.661 --> 01:34:20.470
<v Speaker 2>giant dude.</v>

2216
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I forget the guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's 300 pounds,</v>

2217
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:28.140
<v Speaker 2>six foot eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker and he's he and </v>

2218
01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:28.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he beat up on [inaudible].</v>

2219
01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:33.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's like these guys are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through unbelievable punishment before </v>

2220
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:36.811
<v Speaker 2>they ever get to the final fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would way rather see individual </v>

2221
01:34:36.811 --> 01:34:36.811
<v Speaker 2>supernatural card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:34:36.811 --> 01:34:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't like tournament's man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's stupid because I think it's</v>

2223
01:34:39.881 --> 01:34:42.500
<v Speaker 2>unfair if one guy wins in a seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

2224
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:47.520
<v Speaker 2>don't take that personally at school to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on Solo tour tournaments where you </v>

2225
01:34:49.331 --> 01:34:51.940
<v Speaker 2>fight multiple times in a night in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same night.</v>

2226
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It just too many variables that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can go through that.</v>

2227
01:34:54.650 --> 01:34:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a tournament format where you </v>

2228
01:34:59.650 --> 01:34:59.650
<v Speaker 2>build to one final</v>

2229
01:34:59.650 --> 01:34:59.690
<v Speaker 1>contender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

2230
01:34:59.691 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I liked what I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what [inaudible] does.</v>

2231
01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:07.301
<v Speaker 1>I like what a dream does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I used to do a couple of the </v>

2232
01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:11.900
<v Speaker 1>night opening two in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because you want to see</v>

2233
01:35:11.901 --> 01:35:16.901
<v Speaker 1>what happens when vandelay meets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know rampage and you want to see </v>

2234
01:35:16.901 --> 01:35:17.020
<v Speaker 1>what happens when they meet in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finals,</v>

2235
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is if you,</v>

2236
01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 1>if you fight more than one time at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

2237
01:35:22.311 --> 01:35:25.250
<v Speaker 1>you could be really busted up and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>can cuss.</v>

2238
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're fighting Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2239
01:35:27.630 --> 01:35:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll stop.</v>

2240
01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will let you fight.</v>

2241
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're concussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you got concussed in your first fight</v>

2242
01:35:33.381 --> 01:35:38.381
<v Speaker 1>and then you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll let you go off for the second </v>

2243
01:35:38.381 --> 01:35:38.381
<v Speaker 1>flight.</v>

2244
01:35:38.381 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had some people ask me about </v>

2245
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:42.450
<v Speaker 5>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would a mortar thing like glory be </v>

2246
01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:42.450
<v Speaker 5>successful?</v>
<v Speaker 5>United States,</v>

2247
01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:44.950
<v Speaker 5>I think mmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>May Have paved the road where people are</v>

2248
01:35:44.951 --> 01:35:49.951
<v Speaker 5>used to seeing more Thai and kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and MMA and appreciating it and we'll </v>

2249
01:35:49.951 --> 01:35:52.870
<v Speaker 5>obviously throw the dollars toward a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good Moitai promotion.</v>

2250
01:35:52.871 --> 01:35:54.250
<v Speaker 5>I think it can work and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

2251
01:35:54.251 --> 01:35:56.800
<v Speaker 5>the MMA fans that have gotten used to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of striking.</v>

2252
01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.050
<v Speaker 5>That's what paved the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a few years ago didn't work.</v>

2253
01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:04.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it never did in the United </v>

2254
01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:04.150
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We never been big on Kik.</v>

2255
01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:06.900
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what it is as the PKA karate </v>

2256
01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:06.900
<v Speaker 5>shit ruined it for everybody because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was so bad.</v>

2257
01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:07.810
<v Speaker 5>It was so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was awful.</v>

2258
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:09.370
<v Speaker 5>It was so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't watch that.</v>

2259
01:36:09.371 --> 01:36:11.110
<v Speaker 5>If you guys listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what we're talking about.</v>

2260
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to watch it.</v>

2261
01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Just to see what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to have this rule where you </v>

2262
01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.580
<v Speaker 1>had to throw a certain amount of kicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>in around,</v>

2263
01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.760
<v Speaker 1>so you had like these sloppy kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you had bad boxing and you had </v>

2264
01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:24.950
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just.</v>

2265
01:36:24.951 --> 01:36:27.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were inferior athletes.</v>

2266
01:36:27.291 --> 01:36:32.291
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't that good and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever looked at the best of the PKA guys </v>

2267
01:36:32.291 --> 01:36:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2268
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:35.150
<v Speaker 1>that guy could fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Hagler.</v>

2269
01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.800
<v Speaker 1>No one thought they knew that Marvin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hagler was just going to jump all over </v>

2270
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.660
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't in the same quality.</v>

2271
01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:45.330
<v Speaker 5>I saw some boxers who got into it for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the money and literally went,</v>

2272
01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 5>went to a different mindset through like</v>
<v Speaker 5>six kicks to get the number they needed </v>

2273
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 5>in the round and then they'd box the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rest of the round,</v>

2274
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:53.020
<v Speaker 1>beat the guys at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2275
01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:58.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad style because they didn't </v>

<v Speaker 1>veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real crafty guy like Anderson to </v>

2390
01:42:17.821 --> 01:42:20.671
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on a mistake or the open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open a door by setting some traps and </v>

2391
01:42:20.951 --> 01:42:25.951
<v Speaker 1>open the door for him to land a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson knows how to put that </v>

2392
01:42:25.951 --> 01:42:26.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking hand on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to do it.</v>

2393
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He might not be technical in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like Cyril,</v>

2394
01:42:30.011 --> 01:42:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Dod Bhate who sets things up in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow through a wide variety of punches.</v>

2395
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:35.110
<v Speaker 1>It overhand right and good left hook.</v>

2396
01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:38.290
<v Speaker 1>But if he hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucks Ville and going out.</v>

2397
01:42:38.530 --> 01:42:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And he does it in training a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like.</v>

2398
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:45.790
<v Speaker 1>So he's developed a way to that works </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his body type,</v>

2399
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:49.140
<v Speaker 1>with his style of fighting and with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling ability to.</v>

2400
01:42:49.141 --> 01:42:52.390
<v Speaker 1>He's developed a way you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't sleep on that.</v>

2401
01:42:52.391 --> 01:42:57.391
<v Speaker 1>And I would have thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was a very interesting </v>

2402
01:42:57.391 --> 01:42:58.980
<v Speaker 1>first round really to see what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2403
01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:02.500
<v Speaker 1>how the fight shapes up and whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not John takes him down.</v>

2404
01:43:02.501 --> 01:43:04.570
<v Speaker 1>If John gets on top of him and wears </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

2405
01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was.</v>

2406
01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering like how would this play</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and what do you get clipped coming </v>

2407
01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:10.760
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2408
01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and Dan Henderson clips you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who you are,</v>

2409
01:43:13.631 --> 01:43:18.280
<v Speaker 1>you've got a really big problem on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and that is a career changer.</v>

2410
01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.900
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's a career changer.</v>

2411
01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he blasted out fader,</v>

2412
01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:24.040
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2413
01:43:24.041 --> 01:43:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2414
01:43:24.851 --> 01:43:29.851
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have beaten fader and bigfoot </v>

2415
01:43:29.851 --> 01:43:32.100
<v Speaker 1>even stopped him in between rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a brutal slow beat down.</v>

2416
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Dan Henderson's was sudden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent as fuck.</v>

2417
01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:41.220
<v Speaker 1>He ducks under and clips him with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper cut under his armpit and just </v>

2418
01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.660
<v Speaker 1>starches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just stiffens him up and then boom,</v>

2419
01:43:43.670 --> 01:43:46.360
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple hammers to the side of the head</v>

2420
01:43:46.361 --> 01:43:47.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2421
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:49.330
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Dan gets you hurt,</v>

2422
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.320
<v Speaker 1>he fucking jumped on and they're never </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

2423
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Never says</v>

2424
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson fought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

2425
01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cro cop probably beat the crap out of </v>

2426
01:43:59.620 --> 01:43:59.620
<v Speaker 2>annually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But after,</v>

2427
01:43:59.620 --> 01:43:59.620
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the,</v>

2428
01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:00.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>den Henderson fight,</v>

2429
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 2>when he lost his belt and pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty much it.</v>

2430
01:44:02.630 --> 01:44:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay was never that old vander Lee </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2431
01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2432
01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:06.970
<v Speaker 2>I think cro cop beat the crew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam Cro,</v>

2433
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:08.890
<v Speaker 2>cro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop speed to Kao.</v>

2434
01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:11.150
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they first fought cro,</v>

2435
01:44:11.151 --> 01:44:13.220
<v Speaker 2>cop cro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop beat his body up,</v>

2436
01:44:13.221 --> 01:44:18.221
<v Speaker 2>but some of the most vicious fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>left kicks to the body where that </v>

2437
01:44:18.221 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 2>footprint ribs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole ribs were lit up.</v>

2438
01:44:19.701 --> 01:44:23.750
<v Speaker 2>But he was so inexperienced that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>timing was a bit off.</v>

2439
01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:28.751
<v Speaker 2>He was worried about the takedown and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even instilled some weird law or rule </v>

2440
01:44:28.751 --> 01:44:29.990
<v Speaker 2>rather where you can only find in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground for like 30 seconds.</v>

2441
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Remember those old mixed k ones with </v>
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>

2442
01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:36.920
<v Speaker 2>And the rule was that if no one got </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out,</v>

2443
01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:37.700
<v Speaker 2>it would be a draw.</v>

2444
01:44:37.770 --> 01:44:42.770
<v Speaker 2>So wound up being a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the second fight you saw cro cop </v>

2445
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:46.640
<v Speaker 2>where to have quite a few mma fights and</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a few days in the gym.</v>

2446
01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Working on a sprawl and his take down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fence and that was when he was in </v>

2447
01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:51.820
<v Speaker 2>his athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at his best.</v>

2448
01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:54.650
<v Speaker 2>He was at his best and when he fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shinde him in the head man,</v>

2449
01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:55.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Geez.</v>

2450
01:44:55.881 --> 01:45:00.881
<v Speaker 2>And you saw it vandelay just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>backwards with his arms up in the air </v>

2451
01:45:00.881 --> 01:45:01.680
<v Speaker 2>completely in dreamland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2452
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:06.700
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think we'd see vandelay like </v>

2453
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:06.700
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see enough fights,</v>

2454
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.630
<v Speaker 2>especially somebody with a long career </v>
<v Speaker 2>like vandelay or cro cop,</v>

2455
01:45:08.631 --> 01:45:12.920
<v Speaker 2>and then you guys can always say one </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight where you kind of go.</v>

2456
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:14.730
<v Speaker 2>That was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2457
01:45:14.731 --> 01:45:18.290
<v Speaker 2>and I think was the high point for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Mark Hunt really.</v>

2458
01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I think Mark Hunt hurt him and he lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>

2459
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.370
<v Speaker 2>We thought he won that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if anyone that fit,</v>

2460
01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I thought he wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a close fight.</v>

2461
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Mark Hunt hurt him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him down.</v>

2462
01:45:28.710 --> 01:45:33.710
<v Speaker 2>And Mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Mark Hunt took some of the wind </v>

2463
01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:37.421
<v Speaker 2>out of his sails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay always thought of himself as a </v>

2464
01:45:37.421 --> 01:45:40.631
<v Speaker 2>striker and that was the first time he </v>
<v Speaker 2>faced a guy who is like ridiculously </v>

2465
01:45:40.631 --> 01:45:41.240
<v Speaker 2>pedigreed striker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>

2466
01:45:41.241 --> 01:45:44.320
<v Speaker 2>one Grand Prix champion and Mark Hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were standing,</v>

2467
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Mark Hunt was putting it on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:45:45.621 --> 01:45:50.621
<v Speaker 2>I think vandelay realizing its head like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even close to the best striker </v>

2469
01:45:50.621 --> 01:45:53.981
<v Speaker 2>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that fight shattered his </v>

2470
01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:53.981
<v Speaker 2>confidence a little bit without </v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences.</v>

2471
01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Got like generally can't do any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2472
01:45:54.291 --> 01:45:56.270
<v Speaker 2>because that was the first fight when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw him,</v>

2473
01:45:56.271 --> 01:46:01.271
<v Speaker 2>like consistently not able to do what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do with his stand up and </v>

2474
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:03.870
<v Speaker 2>getting teed off on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got tagged a couple of times.</v>

2475
01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't just take down a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we never saw him before that he </v>

2476
01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:12.221
<v Speaker 2>tried to turn it into an mma fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we thought from vandelay that he would </v>

2477
01:46:12.221 --> 01:46:16.391
<v Speaker 2>welcome a brawl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did not welcome abroad with that </v>

2478
01:46:16.391 --> 01:46:16.391
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was one of those fights</v>

2479
01:46:16.391 --> 01:46:20.441
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at like a guy operating like </v>

2480
01:46:20.441 --> 01:46:23.201
<v Speaker 2>vander Lee did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many Rpms like hit the folks who've </v>

2481
01:46:23.201 --> 01:46:25.991
<v Speaker 2>never seen beverly's fights is his name </v>
<v Speaker 2>is spelled Wanderlei w a n d e r Lei,</v>

2482
01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:31.610
<v Speaker 2>and he was like ridiculous to her with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this nickname.</v>

2483
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Does it already that nicknamed him that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

2484
01:46:35.091 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty.</v>

2485
01:46:35.781 --> 01:46:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Had a bunch of great nicknames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

2486
01:46:37.821 --> 01:46:39.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever it was,</v>

2487
01:46:39.011 --> 01:46:42.650
<v Speaker 2>that nickname that was perfect because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he would fight like a murderer.</v>

2488
01:46:42.651 --> 01:46:44.990
<v Speaker 2>He would just come charging at you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking animal.</v>

2489
01:46:44.991 --> 01:46:49.991
<v Speaker 2>He scared the shit out of everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>being like he was the most aggressive </v>

2490
01:46:49.991 --> 01:46:50.350
<v Speaker 2>guy ever in a sport</v>

2491
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:52.810
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievably aggressive from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive camp.</v>

2492
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Box for that.</v>

2493
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.720
<v Speaker 1>And he was like the poster boy for shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>

2494
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

2495
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:58.420
<v Speaker 1>When he was in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was insane.</v>

2496
01:46:58.630 --> 01:47:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Watch if you want to watch him in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime watch vandelay Silva versus </v>

2497
01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:07.591
<v Speaker 1>Quintin Jackson and pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see vandelay Silva versus </v>

2498
01:47:07.591 --> 01:47:11.131
<v Speaker 1>Quintin in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd already been flatlined a couple </v>

2499
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:11.131
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cro Cop at Kod,</v>

2500
01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson and coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him fighter can only take so many shots </v>

2501
01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:17.530
<v Speaker 1>to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only so many you have in you and</v>

2502
01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:19.780
<v Speaker 1>vandelay eats up a lot of those in </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

2503
01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:22.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like vandelay and training is calling</v>

2504
01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:27.780
<v Speaker 5>a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes that shoe box mentalities you </v>

2505
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:27.780
<v Speaker 5>use all your juice up training spawn </v>
<v Speaker 5>with guys.</v>

2506
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:28.810
<v Speaker 5>This is the other one.</v>

2507
01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Trainings are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a bet to see who would win a </v>

2508
01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.790
<v Speaker 1>fight for a pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay wanted to buy a pit bull from a</v>

2509
01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Shogun shogun wanted too much money or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they thought vandelay knocked </v>

2510
01:47:42.251 --> 01:47:47.251
<v Speaker 1>him out and took his pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knocked his friend for a fucking </v>

2511
01:47:47.251 --> 01:47:49.300
<v Speaker 1>puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like that shoot box man.</v>

2512
01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And even in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2513
01:47:50.811 --> 01:47:52.900
<v Speaker 1>to this day Shogun even talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2514
01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:55.390
<v Speaker 1>that kind of training that they don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that anymore.</v>

2515
01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.400
<v Speaker 1>That kind of training is bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

2516
01:47:57.401 --> 01:48:00.440
<v Speaker 1>So shogun is not participating in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of training as much.</v>

2517
01:48:00.441 --> 01:48:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

2518
01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:03.020
<v Speaker 5>I think hearkening back to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about about it's a sport,</v>

2519
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:08.060
<v Speaker 5>athletes now there's that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence of we are professional </v>

2520
01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 5>athletes and I want to have a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>career to make money.</v>

2521
01:48:10.261 --> 01:48:13.380
<v Speaker 5>It isn't so much the pride of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial artists like it used to be,</v>

2522
01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:18.381
<v Speaker 5>which has its ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but part of the good side is they're </v>

2523
01:48:18.381 --> 01:48:21.261
<v Speaker 5>athletes and they're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>their career and I think about the </v>

2524
01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:21.720
<v Speaker 5>longterm of training and rest and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't always a factor.</v>

2525
01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:22.560
<v Speaker 5>Needless to say,</v>

2526
01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the most important aspect of MMA for </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress is analysis,</v>

2527
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:31.930
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectivity and intelligence focus,</v>

2528
01:48:31.931 --> 01:48:33.520
<v Speaker 1>dedication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work and techniques.</v>

2529
01:48:33.521 --> 01:48:38.521
<v Speaker 1>Having all of those info in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to analyze what you </v>

2530
01:48:38.521 --> 01:48:42.781
<v Speaker 1>need to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need to adjust and what you </v>

2531
01:48:42.781 --> 01:48:42.781
<v Speaker 1>need to put in and what you need to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2532
01:48:42.781 --> 01:48:44.200
<v Speaker 1>That's all technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's being technical,</v>

2533
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:49.350
<v Speaker 1>that's being intelligent and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to a point where you're ultimately </v>

2534
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:52.621
<v Speaker 1>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like Anderson Silva who's </v>

2535
01:48:52.621 --> 01:48:54.190
<v Speaker 1>technique is so evolved and so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind or so far ahead of everybody that</v>

2536
01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:59.191
<v Speaker 1>he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody shit like standing with his back </v>

2537
01:48:59.191 --> 01:48:59.191
<v Speaker 1>up against the cage and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

2538
01:48:59.191 --> 01:48:59.191
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>

2539
01:48:59.191 --> 01:49:03.250
<v Speaker 1>come fight with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Stephan Bonner was so far beyond his</v>

2540
01:49:03.251 --> 01:49:08.251
<v Speaker 1>reach with it in terms of technique that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson can get away with that kind of </v>

2541
01:49:08.251 --> 01:49:10.220
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stand right in front of you dodger,</v>

2542
01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:12.190
<v Speaker 1>your obvious punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a president,</v>

2543
01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:16.100
<v Speaker 5>there's a point every fighter goes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>where that you don't want to go there.</v>

2544
01:49:16.130 --> 01:49:21.130
<v Speaker 5>It's a dark place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to face sometimes to know </v>

2545
01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:22.870
<v Speaker 5>here's the best and here's where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:24.990
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not there and I'm never going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be there.</v>

2547
01:49:25.050 --> 01:49:26.370
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how it is.</v>

2548
01:49:26.371 --> 01:49:28.350
<v Speaker 5>And you see every there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are a lot of fighters.</v>

2549
01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.840
<v Speaker 5>The whole point of fighting any athletic</v>
<v Speaker 5>competitions to go,</v>

2550
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:33.770
<v Speaker 5>how good can I be at this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How far can I get with everything I get?</v>

2551
01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.740
<v Speaker 5>There was a point where you go this far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:40.740
<v Speaker 5>the Anderson Silva is the best and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>making me look like an idiot.</v>

2553
01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.440
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty far below.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a hard thing to see</v>

2554
01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:44.990
<v Speaker 1>was just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2555
01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>like everyone likes to say you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything you set your mind to.</v>

2556
01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>

2557
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Unless John Jones is set in his mind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it too and then doing it alone,</v>

2558
01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:58.180
<v Speaker 1>just what you might not be able to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because John John's my fuck you up.</v>

2559
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

2560
01:49:58.961 --> 01:50:00.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be the champion.</v>

2561
01:50:00.191 --> 01:50:02.040
<v Speaker 1>You can go and set your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

2562
01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.210
<v Speaker 1>John John's centers might do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2563
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:09.211
<v Speaker 1>and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's way ahead of you and the physical </v>

2564
01:50:09.211 --> 01:50:11.200
<v Speaker 1>curve and that physical curve is so real</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have the physical gifts</v>

2565
01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:14.500
<v Speaker 1>to go along with the dedication and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>athleticism and the training,</v>

2566
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful anymore.</v>

2567
01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:19.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a different era now.</v>

2568
01:50:19.690 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as the old days,</v>

2569
01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:27.480
<v Speaker 1>but the key to getting anything out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts is to maximize what you're </v>

2570
01:50:27.971 --> 01:50:31.720
<v Speaker 1>personally capable of and maximize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>human potential.</v>

2571
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:36.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that everybody who gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>into martial arts has to be a UFC or a </v>

2572
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>belt or champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking stupid.</v>

2573
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2574
01:50:39.191 --> 01:50:41.080
<v Speaker 1>So to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2575
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:44.620
<v Speaker 1>it's sad that someone can't make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career as a UFC fighter.</v>

2576
01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people can't make a career as a UFC</v>

2577
01:50:47.231 --> 01:50:49.720
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone can be champion.</v>

2578
01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can't.</v>

2579
01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a combination of you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be prepared from the right point in your</v>

2580
01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:59.830
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the correct way,</v>

2581
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:04.831
<v Speaker 1>and managed in the right forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition so you experienced defeat </v>

2582
01:51:04.831 --> 01:51:09.631
<v Speaker 1>and experience all the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing adversity or you might not.</v>

2583
01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:12.220
<v Speaker 1>You might hurt your back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2584
01:51:12.221 --> 01:51:17.221
<v Speaker 1>you might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live fucking me up and you can't </v>

2585
01:51:17.221 --> 01:51:19.171
<v Speaker 1>compete anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to take whatever energy </v>

2586
01:51:19.171 --> 01:51:22.681
<v Speaker 1>that allowed you to get very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and use that in some other </v>

2587
01:51:22.681 --> 01:51:24.280
<v Speaker 1>way and learn and let you've developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools.</v>

2588
01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.280
<v Speaker 1>You have a whole box full of shit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've developed through overcoming </v>

2589
01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.481
<v Speaker 1>adversity that the average person </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't and you can apply that to </v>

2590
01:51:33.481 --> 01:51:34.210
<v Speaker 1>anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sporting life.</v>

2591
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is six to 10 years if you are real </v>

2592
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.310
<v Speaker 1>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you aren't sure Josh Barnett,</v>

2593
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:41.380
<v Speaker 1>unless you're in forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

2594
01:51:41.630 --> 01:51:46.060
<v Speaker 1>v toward knocks out bisping and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started out 1997,</v>

2595
01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 1>1997 and he's still at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

2596
01:51:49.170 --> 01:51:52.090
<v Speaker 1>A long prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 13 years and he's a striker,</v>

2597
01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.820
<v Speaker 1>which is even crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian even make any sense.</v>

2598
01:51:55.130 --> 01:52:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I could be that that deep in the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>still keep his chin and still start </v>

2599
01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:03.460
<v Speaker 1>people on a regular basis and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had hand problems,</v>

2600
01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's broken his hand like eight blocks.</v>

2601
01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.200
<v Speaker 1>He's moved to kick and people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's head kicking people.</v>

2602
01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with the same kind of speed known as</v>

2603
01:52:10.001 --> 01:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>a punter.</v>

2604
01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2605
01:52:11.141 --> 01:52:13.510
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that you're like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic prime,</v>

2606
01:52:13.511 --> 01:52:18.511
<v Speaker 1>unless you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a brown hopkins or </v>

2607
01:52:18.511 --> 01:52:18.511
<v Speaker 1>something is generally 10 years is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

2608
01:52:18.511 --> 01:52:19.900
<v Speaker 1>How much hgh has he taken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>

2609
01:52:20.170 --> 01:52:23.520
<v Speaker 1>There has to be some hgh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little testosterone cream.</v>

2610
01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Not out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just.</v>

2611
01:52:24.701 --> 01:52:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't see unless he some genetic freak</v>
<v Speaker 1>specimen,</v>

2612
01:52:28.211 --> 01:52:33.211
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't make any sense anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you'd be athletically </v>

2613
01:52:33.211 --> 01:52:36.061
<v Speaker 1>competitive in his age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the last guy to do it legit was </v>

2614
01:52:36.061 --> 01:52:39.301
<v Speaker 1>George Foreman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think George Foreman and and not want </v>

2615
01:52:39.301 --> 01:52:40.150
<v Speaker 1>to cast aspersions on anybody for taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing supplements,</v>

2616
01:52:40.151 --> 01:52:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but we know that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that they do.</v>

2617
01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

2618
01:52:45.451 --> 01:52:48.150
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in boxing or MMA or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2619
01:52:48.330 --> 01:52:52.050
<v Speaker 1>This Lance Armstrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man drives me fucking crazy.</v>

2620
01:52:52.330 --> 01:52:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I say that the real issue with Lance </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong was it,</v>

2621
01:52:56.221 --> 01:53:01.221
<v Speaker 1>he's a hypocrite Douche bag and he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douche bag to the people that were </v>

2622
01:53:01.221 --> 01:53:03.540
<v Speaker 1>riding with him and he was a Douche bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the people that held at</v>

2623
01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.760
<v Speaker 2>grits about blood doping and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken to who's dealt with them </v>

2624
01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:08.760
<v Speaker 2>terrible human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a cunt.</v>

2625
01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 2>So we all say</v>

2626
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Lance Armstrong's a con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is he illegit and the other </v>

2627
01:53:15.881 --> 01:53:16.900
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they legit?</v>

2628
01:53:16.901 --> 01:53:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Like if you take away his title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wins?</v>

2629
01:53:19.091 --> 01:53:20.000
<v Speaker 1>That thing is</v>

2630
01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 2>no winner of the Tour de France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2631
01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:23.900
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't find anyone.</v>

2632
01:53:23.901 --> 01:53:25.460
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was they went down,</v>

2633
01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 2>they had all dope too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they went,</v>

2634
01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:28.810
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no winner for these.</v>

2635
01:53:28.890 --> 01:53:32.480
<v Speaker 2>17 said for the year and you had to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way back.</v>

2636
01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:37.680
<v Speaker 1>10th place to a guy who is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Kalyan dude who had never been accused</v>

2637
01:53:38.081 --> 01:53:43.060
<v Speaker 1>or thought of as a doper and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested positive 10th place 10th.</v>

2638
01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You have a legitimate sport man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's some doctors say ready</v>

2639
01:53:46.721 --> 01:53:51.721
<v Speaker 1>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that it's healthy to take epo </v>

2640
01:53:51.721 --> 01:53:55.740
<v Speaker 1>and to take blood transfusions and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take human growth hormone and take </v>

2641
01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:56.170
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do something like the</v>

2642
01:53:56.170 --> 01:53:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Tour de France because it's unhealthy,</v>

2643
01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>do it without those things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling your body to go way beyond its </v>

2644
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>normal limits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way Beyond.</v>

2645
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling your body to go way </v>

2646
01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:07.400
<v Speaker 2>beyond its normal way beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's boring as fuck.</v>

2647
01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:11.800
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody ride a bike or what?</v>

2648
01:54:11.801 --> 01:54:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Riding a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's thrilling.</v>

2649
01:54:13.421 --> 01:54:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great</v>

2650
01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.810
<v Speaker 1>to to enforce your willpower and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>determination and the amount of time you</v>

2651
01:54:19.811 --> 01:54:24.811
<v Speaker 1>spend on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pushing and checking your heart </v>

2652
01:54:24.811 --> 01:54:24.820
<v Speaker 1>rate monitor and to know that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating this guy with your discipline,</v>

2653
01:54:24.821 --> 01:54:26.920
<v Speaker 1>your hard work and your will to win and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that good.</v>

2654
01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.230
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to watch that shit.</v>

2655
01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:31.210
<v Speaker 1>You're riding a fucking bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2656
01:54:31.211 --> 01:54:33.360
<v Speaker 1>You little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2657
01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Putting breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's,</v>

2658
01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:36.600
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to watch a sport where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2659
01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:37.780
<v Speaker 1>your bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like this.</v>

2660
01:54:39.730 --> 01:54:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Do not have those bells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have those bells.</v>

2661
01:54:43.410 --> 01:54:48.410
<v Speaker 2>She'd have this baseball cards and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheels and they should all have those </v>

2662
01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:49.810
<v Speaker 2>bells bringing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a little child,</v>

2663
01:54:49.811 --> 01:54:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the old guy on a bike.</v>

2664
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:54.320
<v Speaker 2>What's cheating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If everybody's doing it,</v>

2665
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:57.750
<v Speaker 2>everybody's doing it was cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a very real question.</v>

2666
01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is at what is allowed.</v>

2667
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Can you take vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2668
01:55:04.511 --> 01:55:05.000
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2669
01:55:05.001 --> 01:55:10.001
<v Speaker 1>why can you take vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why shouldn't you just get everything </v>

2670
01:55:10.001 --> 01:55:12.841
<v Speaker 1>you need through your healthy diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what are you getting out of </v>

2671
01:55:12.841 --> 01:55:15.631
<v Speaker 1>those vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you taking more vitamin C than you </v>

2672
01:55:15.631 --> 01:55:18.931
<v Speaker 1>could ever get by eating food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a benefit in that and what </v>

2673
01:55:18.931 --> 01:55:18.931
<v Speaker 1>isn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it show up athletically?</v>

2674
01:55:18.931 --> 01:55:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And why should you be able to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2675
01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just using that as an example,</v>

2676
01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:22.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2677
01:55:22.451 --> 01:55:23.200
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2678
01:55:23.201 --> 01:55:24.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

2679
01:55:24.251 --> 01:55:29.251
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement that mark mcgwire they found </v>

2680
01:55:29.251 --> 01:55:29.710
<v Speaker 2>in his locker when he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on what you guys remember,</v>

2681
01:55:29.711 --> 01:55:30.600
<v Speaker 2>that it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diane,</v>

2682
01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody,</v>

2683
01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:35.740
<v Speaker 2>an Olympic athlete got banned for life </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that stuff,</v>

2684
01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:38.470
<v Speaker 2>but baseball didn't recognize it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>banned substance.</v>

2685
01:55:38.471 --> 01:55:39.460
<v Speaker 2>So he was taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was saying,</v>

2686
01:55:39.730 --> 01:55:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I can totally take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were called pro hormones,</v>

2687
01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:42.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was,</v>

2688
01:55:42.761 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of them that</v>

2689
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:49.100
<v Speaker 1>will totally work legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them was called Mag 10 and they </v>

2690
01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:52.440
<v Speaker 1>made this shit illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do this was fucking steroids.</v>

2691
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It was steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took it,</v>

2692
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:57.020
<v Speaker 1>my nipples hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got way bigger,</v>

2693
01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.770

<v Speaker 1>maybe two months,</v>

2694

<v Speaker 1>two months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds of muscle.</v>

2695
01:56:03.811 --> 01:56:06.630
<v Speaker 1>And it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you got it at GNC.</v>

2696
01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:09.720
<v Speaker 1>The only problem was when you got off </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your Dick said cyanotic.</v>

2697
01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.930
<v Speaker 1>My Dick was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2698
01:56:12.931 --> 01:56:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take about a month or start</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in a inverted.</v>

2699
01:56:16.201 --> 01:56:17.280
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

2700
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I remember beating off with a half hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deck.</v>

2701
01:56:19.531 --> 01:56:24.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have in common like four days and I </v>

2702
01:56:24.531 --> 01:56:24.531
<v Speaker 1>still can't get a boner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dick was done for.</v>

2703
01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took a while.</v>

2704
01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Took like it was like at least a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks,</v>

2705
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:34.990
<v Speaker 1>like before I felt like normal again </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were so elevated that your </v>

2706
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:36.120
<v Speaker 1>balls are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2707
01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to take and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought a GNC.</v>

2708
01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:45.260
<v Speaker 1>GNC used to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to sell 'em that date rape </v>

2709
01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:45.780
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ghb.</v>

2710
01:56:45.810 --> 01:56:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to this stuff that's built by </v>

2711
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:51.850
<v Speaker 1>people overdose on and people throw in </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls drinks and molest them.</v>

2712
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Used to be able to buy that at GNC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GNC has had some legit shit there.</v>

2713
01:56:57.421 --> 01:56:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That button,</v>

2714
01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I never took anything that was as strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>as that mag 10 stuff.</v>

2715
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:04.560
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to take a lot of pills to like.</v>

2716
01:57:04.561 --> 01:57:09.561
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't be even remotely confused </v>
<v Speaker 1>as to whether or not you're doing </v>

2717
01:57:09.561 --> 01:57:13.131
<v Speaker 1>something healthy because you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking like 10 of these foul pills a </v>

2718
01:57:13.131 --> 01:57:13.860
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a lot of pills.</v>

2719
01:57:13.861 --> 01:57:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the oral toxicity of this stuff?</v>

2720
01:57:15.841 --> 01:57:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it doing to my liver?</v>

2721
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

2722
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Just make you giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got rid of that.</v>

2723
01:57:22.981 --> 01:57:24.390
<v Speaker 1>That became illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

2724
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I think probably a good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody like me can just go in and buy </v>

2725
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it and like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know like if you're like an 18</v>

2726
01:57:32.431 --> 01:57:37.431
<v Speaker 1>year old guy and you take that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I took it for what it said to take </v>

2727
01:57:37.431 --> 01:57:38.190
<v Speaker 1>on the package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took it for like six weeks or whatever</v>

2728
01:57:38.191 --> 01:57:39.900
<v Speaker 1>it said to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if you're an idiot?</v>

2729
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:44.160
<v Speaker 1>What if you take it every day for a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden you're,</v>

2730
01:57:44.170 --> 01:57:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you have like cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your body shuts down.</v>

2731
01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

01:57:47.701 --> 01:57:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you have like liver issues or you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>get asked to get a transplant.</v>

2733
01:57:50.890 --> 01:57:55.890
<v Speaker 1>One of prescription medication is that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor tells you how often to take it </v>

2734
01:57:55.890 --> 01:57:56.160
<v Speaker 1>and he can only take it for a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>

2735
01:57:56.160 --> 01:58:01.160
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be able to just buy </v>

2736
01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:02.760
<v Speaker 1>something in Gnc that can jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

2737
01:58:02.761 --> 01:58:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be like buying calcium.</v>

2738
01:58:06.031 --> 01:58:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take it,</v>

2739
01:58:06.901 --> 01:58:10.200
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you take too much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2740
01:58:10.230 --> 01:58:12.000
<v Speaker 1>like who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be fine,</v>

2741
01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:15.240
<v Speaker 1>but if you take like some of those like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mag 10 type things,</v>

2742
01:58:15.241 --> 01:58:17.670
<v Speaker 1>like you could shut your whole endocrine</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2743
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2744
01:58:18.511 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 1>You're whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking pituitary glands.</v>

2745
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:25.281
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing asshole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your body doesn't know what to do </v>

2746
01:58:25.281 --> 01:58:28.431
<v Speaker 1>without your gonads shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know a dude who is maybe in his </v>

2747
01:58:28.431 --> 01:58:32.721
<v Speaker 1>thirties and he cannot have a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to have a child with his </v>

2748
01:58:32.721 --> 01:58:35.100
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and his wife now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>

2749
01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:40.130
<v Speaker 1>They can't have a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they went to the doctor and the </v>

2750
01:58:40.130 --> 01:58:43.041
<v Speaker 1>doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have a sperm count of a 70 year </v>

2751
01:58:43.041 --> 01:58:43.041
<v Speaker 1>old man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

2752
01:58:43.041 --> 01:58:44.980
<v Speaker 2>you broke your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you broke it.</v>

2753
01:58:45.110 --> 01:58:48.820
<v Speaker 2>It's all broken now because he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilder when he was young.</v>

2754
01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it was gigantic at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That candle that Burns twice as bright </v>

2755
01:58:53.850 --> 01:58:54.460
<v Speaker 2>burns half as long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>

2756
01:58:54.461 --> 01:58:55.350
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No candle.</v>

2757
01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>If you make yourself do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary,</v>

2758
01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:01.810
<v Speaker 2>it makes your body go beyond its limits </v>
<v Speaker 2>for too long.</v>

2759
01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:04.900
<v Speaker 2>It comes back way lower than it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it went in.</v>

2760
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:07.030
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's fast in the natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way it goes,</v>

2761
01:59:07.031 --> 01:59:12.031
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Bodybuilding change from like the </v>

2763
01:59:12.031 --> 01:59:14.920

<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] or Steve Back in the day.</v>

2764
01:59:14.921 --> 01:59:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were like,</v>

2765
01:59:16.530 --> 01:59:17.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were built like,</v>

2766
01:59:17.781 --> 01:59:19.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you have a comic books,</v>

2767
01:59:19.091 --> 01:59:20.700
<v Speaker 2>so they went like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be able to like,</v>

2768
01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:22.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles Atlas?</v>

2769
01:59:22.721 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like solid,</v>

2770
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful looking men.</v>

2771
01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:31.410
<v Speaker 2>But they weren't like these weird skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>tight vascular freak alien looking dudes</v>

2772
01:59:33.881 --> 01:59:38.881
<v Speaker 2>that you see today where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a picture of this guy flexing </v>

2773
01:59:38.881 --> 01:59:39.530
<v Speaker 2>his ass and his ass looks like.</v>

2774
01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:42.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like ropes.</v>

2775
01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:47.700
<v Speaker 2>It looks like someone's taken some giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shipyard rope and made an ass out </v>

2776
01:59:48.071 --> 01:59:51.340
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's all coordinated and if the guy</v>

2777
01:59:51.341 --> 01:59:54.180
<v Speaker 2>has no body fat on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it can't be healthy there,</v>

2778
01:59:54.181 --> 01:59:56.320
<v Speaker 2>but I probably can't even walk up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight of stairs.</v>

2779
01:59:56.321 --> 01:59:57.400
<v Speaker 2>He was ready to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2780
01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't get about bodybuilding </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

2781
01:59:59.441 --> 02:00:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2782
02:00:00.150 --> 02:00:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mentality of bodybuilding kind of is</v>

2783
02:00:03.071 --> 02:00:08.071
<v Speaker 2>when is it okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good now because it's like finding </v>

2784
02:00:08.071 --> 02:00:11.611
<v Speaker 2>is my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I train hard enough to beat this guy </v>

2785
02:00:11.611 --> 02:00:11.611
<v Speaker 2>and if I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I train hard enough.</v>

2786
02:00:11.611 --> 02:00:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's my ass doesn't look enough like </v>

2787
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:18.121
<v Speaker 2>a rope or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when there's no clinical and the </v>

2788
02:00:18.121 --> 02:00:18.190
<v Speaker 2>bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do a drop.</v>

2789
02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your bar barking.</v>

2790
02:00:19.241 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Just go up and up and up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that.</v>

2791
02:00:20.710 --> 02:00:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go back and look at all arnold who </v>

2792
02:00:25.710 --> 02:00:28.560
<v Speaker 2>was a fucking petri dish of chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like self admitted that he took steroids</v>

2793
02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:34.740
<v Speaker 2>and you look at it when you see him but </v>
<v Speaker 2>was nowhere near big enough to compete </v>

2794
02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:34.740
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2795
02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Dorian Yates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

2796
02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 2>all those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just unbelievably big.</v>

2797
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:47.270
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's guys today that they don't even </v>

2798
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.590
<v Speaker 2>look real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't look real.</v>

2799
02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:50.320
<v Speaker 2>So you look at our old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like back in the day when he was.</v>

2800
02:00:50.321 --> 02:00:52.540
<v Speaker 2>He was more like a Greek God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2801
02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:55.750
<v Speaker 2>It was way lean but still filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>roids.</v>

2802
02:00:55.780 --> 02:01:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the changing of the </v>

2803
02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:02.890
<v Speaker 2>perspective of like what we think of is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big muscular man.</v>

2804
02:01:02.891 --> 02:01:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Like now it's like cartoonish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unachievable Shit,</v>

2805
02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:10.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like you saw like Franco Columbo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfect example.</v>

2806
02:01:10.421 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Like that is reachable I think without </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>

2807
02:01:13.031 --> 02:01:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I think with great genetics or Frank </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zane even better example.</v>

2808
02:01:16.721 --> 02:01:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frank Zane was.</v>

2809
02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:20.260
<v Speaker 2>He looked like a lean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic,</v>

2810
02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:23.590
<v Speaker 2>muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well proportioned guy.</v>

2811
02:01:23.890 --> 02:01:26.740
<v Speaker 2>He looked achievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a normal size neck.</v>

2812
02:01:26.741 --> 02:01:29.470
<v Speaker 2>He had a normal sized set of shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was achievable.</v>

2813
02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a guy like Dorian Yates looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was going to expose us.</v>

2814
02:01:33.850 --> 02:01:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Look like the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2815
02:01:35.291 --> 02:01:40.291
<v Speaker 2>I just explode onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flex sport freaks me out of all the </v>

2816
02:01:41.361 --> 02:01:44.090

2817
02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:47.630

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2818
02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:52.660
<v Speaker 2>because I just wait for that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which does happen sometimes when the </v>

2819

2908
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:12.501
<v Speaker 2>all these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would just rather have them all </v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2914
02:06:23.761 --> 02:06:25.500

02:07:58.310 --> 02:08:03.310
<v Speaker 5>they call a one foot rule.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An alligator eat anything a foot bigger </v>

2955
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.850
<v Speaker 5>than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're bigger than that,</v>

2956
02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:05.860
<v Speaker 5>it can't swallow you so it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really attack you,</v>

2957
02:08:06.190 --> 02:08:08.170
<v Speaker 5>but if you're five foot and you're six </v>
<v Speaker 5>foot,</v>

2958
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:13.260
<v Speaker 5>it will eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just crazy to think about </v>

2959
02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:13.600
<v Speaker 5>because I saw a lot of five foot </v>
<v Speaker 5>alligators.</v>

2960
02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:14.500
<v Speaker 5>I saw a lot of them</v>

2961
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>even creepier than an alligator's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Komodo Dragon.</v>

2962
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was.</v>

2963
02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It was bite the super toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you remember what the fuck is her </v>

2964
02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>name from</v>

2965
02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:27.500
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>

2966
02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sharon stone.</v>

2967
02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:30.710
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2968
02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Basic instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Share House by a Komodo dragons.</v>

2969
02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:35.340
<v Speaker 5>Dumb ass</v>

2970
02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:40.420
<v Speaker 1>went into a Komodo dragon cage barefoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>with socks on and they saw the white </v>

2971
02:08:41.361 --> 02:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>sock and they thought it was a rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they feed them rabbits,</v>

2972
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:49.330
<v Speaker 1>so he jumped on his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clamped down is a fucking real live </v>

2973
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 feet long.</v>

2974
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the biggest lizards on the </v>

2975
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.470
<v Speaker 1>planet earth and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got botulism and its saliva.</v>

2976
02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>

2977
02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:02.200
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably toxic saliva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much so that they kill animals by </v>

2978
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:02.300
<v Speaker 1>biting them and then following it.</v>

2979
02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:05.080
<v Speaker 5>They wait around until they die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible to watch</v>

2980
02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:07.510
<v Speaker 1>water buffalo video where they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2981
02:09:07.570 --> 02:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Komodo dragon sneaks up on his </v>

2982
02:09:12.570 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 1>water buffalo and just gets it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg just a little.</v>

2983
02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And the water buffalo gets away a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and then you see him like,</v>

2984
02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they see in trying to get away a </v>

2985
02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>little more and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

2986
02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And then later on they edit the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Komodo dragon just eating its </v>

2987
02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>guts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pulling chunks of meat off of its </v>

2988
02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>carcass and like,</v>

2989

02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:29.130
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as an athlete,</v>

2991
02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:31.070

<v Speaker 5>It was a guy who trains in,</v>

2992

<v Speaker 5>around on the street.</v>

2994
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:42.730
<v Speaker 5>Anybody smaller than me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't know how to fight exactly</v>

<v Speaker 1>youtube will take our videos down </v>

3045
02:11:40.141 --> 02:11:40.390
<v Speaker 1>because we just started uploading them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to youtube.</v>

3046
02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>If we use videos that are from youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's like youtube a little,</v>

3047
02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The snake eating its own tail for a </v>

3048
02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:55.591
<v Speaker 1>copyright issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you use a video that you got from </v>

3049

<v Speaker 1>Youtube and then you upload that to </v>

<v Speaker 2>You might die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just going to torture you </v>

3182
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:50.611
<v Speaker 2>and rip you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A chimpanzee is seven times stronger </v>

3183
02:17:50.611 --> 02:17:51.550
<v Speaker 2>than a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me seven times stronger.</v>

3184
02:17:51.670 --> 02:17:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I did a thing with the chimp once and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a baby and it was really weird.</v>

3185
02:17:54.970 --> 02:17:59.970
<v Speaker 2>It was only like two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like on my back and shit and </v>

3186
02:17:59.970 --> 02:17:59.970
<v Speaker 2>he was hitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was for news radio.</v>

3187
02:17:59.970 --> 02:18:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think we wound up using it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the chip I swatted me on the bag of </v>

3188
02:18:04.530 --> 02:18:07.960
<v Speaker 2>leaves a little baby and I was feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>so sing and then I was like,</v>

3189
02:18:07.961 --> 02:18:09.220
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so soft.</v>

3190
02:18:09.221 --> 02:18:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm so mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in comparison to him,</v>

3191
02:18:11.381 --> 02:18:16.381
<v Speaker 2>like he was sinewy like they're made out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a different thing and he was still a </v>

3192
02:18:16.381 --> 02:18:16.970
<v Speaker 2>little sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3193
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.210
<v Speaker 2>he's like a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would hug him and stuff and he was.</v>

3194
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:24.270
<v Speaker 2>He was a baby basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was already getting ridiculously </v>

3195
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:27.391
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a show called American </v>

3196
02:18:27.391 --> 02:18:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Ninja Warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that that thing he's been on g </v>

3197
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:31.550
<v Speaker 2>four thing where it's like the hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition and one thing we always </v>

3198
02:18:31.631 --> 02:18:32.880
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and Nicole is going to man.</v>

3199
02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I's more like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see a chimp go through.</v>

3200
02:18:34.781 --> 02:18:39.781
<v Speaker 2>This would almost be insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just watching chimpanzees will fly </v>

3201
02:18:39.781 --> 02:18:39.781
<v Speaker 2>through this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these humans are fallen and can't do</v>

3202
02:18:39.781 --> 02:18:39.940
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

3203
02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:43.120
<v Speaker 2>well they did that maybe minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that thing?</v>

3204
02:18:43.121 --> 02:18:48.121
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a show like it was like man </v>

3205
02:18:48.121 --> 02:18:51.010
<v Speaker 2>versus nature where they did like a dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>with sprint next to a Giraffe,</v>

3206
02:18:51.011 --> 02:18:54.130
<v Speaker 2>a giraffe with sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did a empathetic.</v>

3207
02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compared to the chimp and a navy seal.</v>

3208
02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that dude,</v>

3209
02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:04.831
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who fucking one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the chimp might've got bored </v>

3210
02:19:04.831 --> 02:19:04.831
<v Speaker 2>somewhere along the way and not figuring</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what the fuck.</v>

3211
02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like the chimp one but I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not sure.</v>

3212
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like if they knew what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were trying to do,</v>

3213
02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:14.400
<v Speaker 2>like get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3214
02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:19.740
<v Speaker 2>they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you serious like you are you really </v>

3215
02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:19.900
<v Speaker 2>trying to go as hard as you thought we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were playing?</v>

3216
02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand.</v>

3217
02:19:21.521 --> 02:19:23.680
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to motivate to do certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3218
02:19:23.681 --> 02:19:28.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would he go like to go as hard </v>

3219
02:19:28.681 --> 02:19:31.831
<v Speaker 2>as he can for survival sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would he do that when you're </v>

3220
02:19:31.831 --> 02:19:33.050
<v Speaker 2>essentially doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like on your mom did set go,</v>

3221
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:38.110
<v Speaker 2>you're going with every fiber of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>being and this champ is just kinda like </v>

3222
02:19:38.110 --> 02:19:39.500
<v Speaker 2>lazy swinging on whenever he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3223
02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Does he understand competition now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those kinds of survival,</v>

3224
02:19:43.690 --> 02:19:46.430
<v Speaker 2>it led to people going for it's food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3225
02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outrun that thing.</v>

3226
02:19:47.481 --> 02:19:52.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might know that asked to get there </v>

3227
02:19:52.481 --> 02:19:52.481
<v Speaker 2>faster than you to get a cookie or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3228
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you're not going to </v>

3229
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.630
<v Speaker 2>really see what he could do and he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off the fucking ladder and beat your</v>

3230
02:19:58.630 --> 02:20:01.460
<v Speaker 2>ass here to compare to the animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom.</v>

3231
02:20:01.461 --> 02:20:03.200
<v Speaker 2>We are physically pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3232
02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:06.920
<v Speaker 2>You're lucky that chimp doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really talk shit.</v>

3233
02:20:06.921 --> 02:20:08.090
<v Speaker 2>He'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we swinging?</v>

3234
02:20:08.091 --> 02:20:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll just come over there and bite your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers off.</v>

3235
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one good thing about that.</v>

3236
02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:18.760
<v Speaker 2>The most recent a planet of the apes as </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were kind of realistic about </v>

3237
02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:21.710
<v Speaker 2>chimp behavior and the Cim holds up </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes down and bites his finger off.</v>

3238
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

3239
02:20:22.890 --> 02:20:25.490
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real move.</v>

3240
02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Screw that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking creepy ass fighting.</v>

3241
02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Pull your dick off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull your feet off.</v>

3242
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Pull your nose off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even try to kill you.</v>

3243
02:20:34.791 --> 02:20:37.010
<v Speaker 2>At least a tiger just kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight over you.</v>

3244
02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3245
02:20:37.930 --> 02:20:40.910
<v Speaker 2>so you go to some use chimp would </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably eat you.</v>

3246
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:43.490
<v Speaker 2>They're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3247
02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not meaning or something like.</v>

3248
02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What size?</v>

3250
02:20:49.491 --> 02:20:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Chimp would eat a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never seen that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've been on orangutans.</v>

3253
02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Orangutans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees.</v>

3259
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:10.030
<v Speaker 2>They tried to get them like hip first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grabbed him by the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>octopus.</v>

3267
02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.050
<v Speaker 2>The octopus is like fighting and trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get out of your mouth and that's just</v>

3268
02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:36.080

3274
02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Sushi.</v>

<v Speaker 2>smart as fuck.</v>

3278
02:22:00.020 --> 02:22:05.020
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people get kind of bummed out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people kill an octopus because </v>

3279
02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:05.750
<v Speaker 2>octopus have like a really high level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

3280
02:22:05.751 --> 02:22:07.180
<v Speaker 2>It makes them delicious and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

3286
02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:23.270
<v Speaker 2>They chased these chimps down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are these chimps?</v>

3287
02:22:23.271 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Chase these monkeys down and cut them </v>
<v Speaker 2>off at the pass and then</v>

3288
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:31.100
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

3291
02:22:34.011 --> 02:22:36.621
<v Speaker 1>start pulling it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These dudes are running to try to film </v>

3292
02:22:36.621 --> 02:22:37.980

<v Speaker 1>that anybody had ever observed this back</v>

3293
02:22:37.981 --> 02:22:42.981
<v Speaker 1>before they observed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that chimps were just </v>

3294
02:22:42.981 --> 02:22:46.580
<v Speaker 1>eating berries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never knew that they the the </v>

3295
02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:46.580
<v Speaker 1>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see it?</v>

3296
02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>That part where it tears them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't show.</v>

3297
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:49.350
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't show them.</v>

3298
02:22:49.351 --> 02:22:52.710
<v Speaker 1>That one does a censored one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the same video.</v>

3299
02:22:52.711 --> 02:22:54.750
<v Speaker 1>There's the full version of fried </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>

3300
02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:59.860
<v Speaker 1>He's grabbing it in the monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going like this shit and he's </v>

3301
02:22:59.911 --> 02:23:04.911
<v Speaker 1>literally eating him hip first sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're mean,</v>

3302
02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:10.350
<v Speaker 1>they're mean little motherfuckers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kick your ass or they're closely</v>

3303
02:23:10.351 --> 02:23:11.670
<v Speaker 1>related to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3304
02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:16.840
<v Speaker 1>that explains a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if during like the Roman days </v>

3305
02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:16.840
<v Speaker 1>they ever had human versus chimp fights.</v>

3306
02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:18.380
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3307
02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:23.680
<v Speaker 5>I do have a history degree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember reading it as soon as the </v>

3308
02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:24.010
<v Speaker 5>rest of the lines a lot and they would </v>
<v Speaker 5>put humans versus various,</v>

3309
02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:27.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fought against lines or whatever.</v>

3310
02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:31.700
<v Speaker 5>What would they let them use a from </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that I've seen,</v>

3311
02:23:31.701 --> 02:23:36.701
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would have like a like pike type </v>

3312
02:23:36.701 --> 02:23:36.701
<v Speaker 5>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like spirit type stuff.</v>

3313
02:23:36.701 --> 02:23:40.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was fucking fucked up where people.</v>

3314
02:23:40.420 --> 02:23:43.040
<v Speaker 5>The ones that actually made the Asian </v>
<v Speaker 5>line,</v>

3315
02:23:43.041 --> 02:23:48.041
<v Speaker 5>the north,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a European lion at one point </v>

3316
02:23:48.041 --> 02:23:48.041
<v Speaker 5>and it's extinct now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They made an advantage.</v>

3317
02:23:48.041 --> 02:23:50.890
<v Speaker 5>They took so many of them and use them </v>
<v Speaker 5>for various purposes that they're,</v>

3318
02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:51.740
<v Speaker 5>they're extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They.</v>

3319
02:23:51.890 --> 02:23:54.200
<v Speaker 5>There was a European line and South </v>
<v Speaker 5>Europe and now it's gone.</v>

3320
02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:57.660
<v Speaker 1>This is the full version where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see the chimp tear it apart.</v>

3321
02:23:58.110 --> 02:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Then they start screaming and yelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and making noises and all the other ones</v>

3322
02:24:03.900 --> 02:24:04.390
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3323
02:24:04.430 --> 02:24:06.940
<v Speaker 1>they run in and watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch other pulling this fucking.</v>

3324
02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:12.500
<v Speaker 1>They're just ripping this thing apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a different video because this </v>

3325
02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:15.420
<v Speaker 1>one is on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most disturbing one was the,</v>

3326
02:24:15.421 --> 02:24:16.110
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3327
02:24:16.111 --> 02:24:21.111
<v Speaker 1>Looking at me eating the fucking monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most disturbing one was there was a </v>

3328
02:24:21.111 --> 02:24:24.771
<v Speaker 1>video of the monkey in the tree and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp has the monkey up in the tree and </v>

3329
02:24:24.771 --> 02:24:26.640
<v Speaker 1>he's tearing apart while he's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like</v>

3330
02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:30.330
<v Speaker 5>the monkeys phase going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

3331
02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:31.820
<v Speaker 5>there's so much</v>

3332
02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:33.290
<v Speaker 1>close to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3333
02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>a little monkey faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3334
02:24:34.681 --> 02:24:37.580
<v Speaker 1>you really feel bad for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really feel bad when it's good.</v>

3335
02:24:37.581 --> 02:24:42.581
<v Speaker 1>It's limbs ripped off and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting eaten by another thing that has </v>

3336
02:24:42.581 --> 02:24:42.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of a people face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3337
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3338
02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:46.230
<v Speaker 1>this is the closest animal to us</v>

3339
02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:51.340
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People I think have a very kind of </v>

3340
02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:51.950
<v Speaker 5>Disney view of nature in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it doesn't work that way.</v>

3341
02:24:51.951 --> 02:24:54.560
<v Speaker 5>Man is vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human beings are vicious to.</v>

3342
02:24:54.561 --> 02:24:56.630
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been talking about that in my act</v>

3343
02:24:56.810 --> 02:25:01.810
<v Speaker 1>recently about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone got mad at me for a </v>

3344
02:25:01.810 --> 02:25:04.660
<v Speaker 1>jacket with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a fake fur jacket and some </v>

3345
02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 1>woman actually said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3346
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like what you're tracking </v>

3347
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.070
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost like fake for.</v>

3348
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.070
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3349
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like what it represents.</v>

3350
02:25:10.821 --> 02:25:11.420
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3351
02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Killing fake animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3352
02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I started talking about this on stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it really is true.</v>

3353
02:25:15.951 --> 02:25:17.180
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

3354
02:25:17.181 --> 02:25:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not a real cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not a real animal.</v>

3355
02:25:20.121 --> 02:25:25.121
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that you shouldn't for well </v>

3356
02:25:25.121 --> 02:25:27.500
<v Speaker 1>do you know what happens to animals if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't kill them?</v>

3357
02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:31.880
<v Speaker 1>If the human doesn't turn them into for </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get eaten by wolves,</v>

3358
02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:37.970
<v Speaker 1>they get eaten alive by wool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get ripped apart.</v>

3359
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Guts first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they chew them apart and then they eat </v>

3360
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.971
<v Speaker 1>them and they eat their feet and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat their head and then they ship them </v>

3361
02:25:45.971 --> 02:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>out in a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not afer and hair,</v>

3362
02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:53.260
<v Speaker 1>teeth and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to you if you </v>

3363
02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>don't get turned into a jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our idea that these,</v>

3364
02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:59.080
<v Speaker 1>these beautiful within creatures are </v>
<v Speaker 1>then taken and turned into terrible </v>

3365
02:25:59.661 --> 02:26:04.661
<v Speaker 1>things that people wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a god he representation of our </v>

3366
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:05.300
<v Speaker 1>cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3367
02:26:05.301 --> 02:26:06.860
<v Speaker 1>You'd rather get eaten by a wolf.</v>

3368
02:26:06.970 --> 02:26:07.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fee,</v>

3369
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:12.510
<v Speaker 5>there's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a great book called the </v>

3370
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.710
<v Speaker 5>Omnivore's dilemma and it's about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy tries to.</v>

3371
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:17.960
<v Speaker 5>It's about food and where food comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>from and he goes hunting and he kills a </v>

3372
02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:17.960
<v Speaker 5>pig and eats it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

3373
02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:19.810
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

3374
02:26:19.811 --> 02:26:24.811
<v Speaker 5>I felt bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I realized because he wasn't a </v>

3375
02:26:24.811 --> 02:26:26.921
<v Speaker 5>hunter guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I kinda grew up my family hunts and </v>

<v Speaker 5>ever going to get in a wild river by </v>

3379
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:35.440
<v Speaker 5>some animal.</v>

3380
02:26:35.441 --> 02:26:38.290
<v Speaker 5>and rots from the inside break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So terribly pleasant.</v>

3381
02:26:38.291 --> 02:26:38.680
<v Speaker 5>Death.</v>

3382

<v Speaker 2>That's my great grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3466
02:29:52.161 --> 02:29:54.320
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because there's this big age </v>
<v Speaker 2>gap in my family,</v>

3467
02:29:54.321 --> 02:29:56.260
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my great grandfather could have been.</v>

3468
02:29:56.260 --> 02:30:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they from American tucking back </v>

3470
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:04.680
<v Speaker 2>One was poor as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe they had slave.</v>

3474
02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:13.310
<v Speaker 2>My family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Kentucky is a strange place,</v>

3475
02:30:13.311 --> 02:30:15.560
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You telling me so strange that the,</v>

3476
02:30:15.561 --> 02:30:18.380
<v Speaker 2>they call the Cincinnati airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's in Kentucky.</v>

3477
02:30:19.530 --> 02:30:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3478
02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:25.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to call it the Kentucky </v>
<v Speaker 2>Airport because Kentucky's got such a </v>

3479
02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.660
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pink people have such a low opinion of</v>

3480
02:30:26.661 --> 02:30:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky that they call the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cincinnati area.</v>

3481
02:30:29.151 --> 02:30:30.170
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can say it,</v>

3482
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:35.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's in Kentucky that it's like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>land in Kentucky and they call the </v>

3483
02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Cincinnati airport and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive to Cincinnati and like,</v>

3484
02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:39.860
<v Speaker 2>why are you pretending that shit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going down in Cincinnati?</v>

3485
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a border and this is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>border,</v>

3486
02:30:42.081 --> 02:30:47.081
<v Speaker 2>but I guess the land was cheaper to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking airport and conducted must've </v>

3487
02:30:47.081 --> 02:30:47.081
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

3488
02:30:47.081 --> 02:30:48.260
<v Speaker 2>And then they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just call the Cincinnati airport.</v>

3489
02:30:48.261 --> 02:30:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

3490
02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because there's a massive </v>

3542
02:32:54.300 --> 02:32:56.700
<v Speaker 2>when something socially acceptable,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Get ready for this.</v>

3638
02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:54.720
<v Speaker 5>He's not going to wrestle like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>been asking him.</v>

3639
02:36:54.810 --> 02:36:56.040
<v Speaker 5>He's just weird shit.</v>

3640
02:36:56.060 --> 02:36:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When everybody goes to the right,</v>

3641
02:36:57.711 --> 02:36:59.660
<v Speaker 1>he goes to the left and then it goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>under you and you're like,</v>

3642
02:36:59.661 --> 02:37:00.770

<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3644
02:37:02.211 --> 02:37:07.211
<v Speaker 1>he's deceptively strong too and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot like guys to like physically </v>

3645
02:37:07.211 --> 02:37:09.370
<v Speaker 1>they look like these beasts and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked Lima.</v>

3646
02:37:09.650 --> 02:37:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3647
02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:11.390
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To the moon.</v>

3648
02:37:11.391 --> 02:37:16.391
<v Speaker 5>And you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he told me and everybody keeps </v>

3649
02:37:16.391 --> 02:37:16.391
<v Speaker 5>telling me the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're gonna fight,</v>

3650
02:37:16.391 --> 02:37:16.910
<v Speaker 5>Ben have to understand you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get taken down.</v>

3651
02:37:16.911 --> 02:37:18.310
<v Speaker 5>You spend some time on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3652
02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:20.930
<v Speaker 5>They make this line in the sand where </v>
<v Speaker 5>Douglas,</v>

3653
02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:21.470
<v Speaker 5>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

3654
02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:23.000
<v Speaker 5>I felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3655
02:37:23.001 --> 02:37:24.060
<v Speaker 5>there's no way this guy's gonna take me </v>
<v Speaker 5>an hour.</v>

3656
02:37:24.350 --> 02:37:27.050
<v Speaker 5>And he threw me and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>

3657
02:37:27.450 --> 02:37:30.290
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be a long night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dan Hormonal told us,</v>

3658
02:37:30.291 --> 02:37:35.291
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to stop his take down for two </v>

3659
02:37:35.291 --> 02:37:35.291
<v Speaker 5>minutes and then I'm going to beat his </v>
<v Speaker 5>ass up.</v>

3660
02:37:35.291 --> 02:37:38.530
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't stop it for 10 seconds and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just mentally kind of give up </v>

3661
02:37:38.530 --> 02:37:38.530
<v Speaker 5>because I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

3662
02:37:38.530 --> 02:37:39.320
<v Speaker 5>I was supposed to stop this and I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>stop this at all.</v>

3663
02:37:39.470 --> 02:37:41.480
<v Speaker 5>You have to accept I'm going to be on </v>
<v Speaker 5>my.</v>

3664
02:37:41.481 --> 02:37:43.710
<v Speaker 5>But at some point in this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he can get married.</v>

3665
02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those guys are very important to</v>

3666
02:37:47.010 --> 02:37:52.010
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to figure out what is the best </v>

3667
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:55.161
<v Speaker 1>way to approach any situation and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think if you look at like the kind of </v>

3668
02:37:55.161 --> 02:37:59.210
<v Speaker 1>textbooks that they have available now </v>
<v Speaker 1>in football where they've got every </v>

3669
02:37:59.210 --> 02:38:03.861
<v Speaker 1>fucking play documented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all these variations on the </v>

3670
02:38:03.861 --> 02:38:07.371
<v Speaker 1>plays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that have changed </v>

3671
02:38:07.371 --> 02:38:08.310
<v Speaker 1>during plays that have made them more </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful or errors that were committed</v>

3672
02:38:08.311 --> 02:38:13.311
<v Speaker 1>during these players and they have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken down in a real scientific </v>

3673
02:38:13.311 --> 02:38:16.080
<v Speaker 1>professional way and I think for a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ben Aspirin,</v>

3674
02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that exposes this new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new level of of wrestling ability,</v>

3675
02:38:22.681 --> 02:38:27.681
<v Speaker 1>this really unusual Olympic quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling that nobody seems to be able </v>

3676
02:38:27.681 --> 02:38:28.440
<v Speaker 1>to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3677
02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you solve it.</v>

3678
02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:32.100
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

3679
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:35.280
<v Speaker 1>is it another wrestler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a kickboxer?</v>

3680
02:38:35.370 --> 02:38:40.370
<v Speaker 1>What do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it a guy who's got a nasty </v>

3681
02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:42.651
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shinya Yogi type guy will let them take </v>

3682
02:38:42.651 --> 02:38:45.171
<v Speaker 1>them down and then just trap some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you have to do to get </v>

3683
02:38:45.171 --> 02:38:47.100
<v Speaker 1>past that style because that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>style,</v>

3684
02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you think it's boring or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

3685
02:38:49.170 --> 02:38:51.870
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think it's boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super effective,</v>

3686
02:38:51.871 --> 02:38:56.871
<v Speaker 1>and the reality of a fight is that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is effective is what's good and </v>

3687
02:38:56.871 --> 02:38:58.950
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna have to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop that.</v>

3688
02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:01.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's super important to have a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

3689
02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:05.310
<v Speaker 1>a guy who couldn't do shit to everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one wants them to do to them.</v>

3690
02:39:05.310 --> 02:39:09.330
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is is that Demian Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a 40 fought Weidman,</v>

3691
02:39:09.331 --> 02:39:13.440
<v Speaker 5>he said I'm the best mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>artist I've ever been any last.</v>

3692
02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:15.900
<v Speaker 5>Like it's almost like when you started </v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming a mixed martial artist,</v>

3693
02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:21.080
<v Speaker 5>he kind of got away from what made him </v>
<v Speaker 5>good and he started losing fights and </v>

3694
02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:21.210
<v Speaker 5>Ben never does that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

3695
02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:22.380
<v Speaker 5>Bingos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a wrestler.</v>

3696
02:39:22.430 --> 02:39:23.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take you down.</v>

3697
02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:24.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm a ground and Patty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm using my Jujitsu.</v>

3698
02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:26.850
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting all these other skills,</v>

3699
02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:28.440
<v Speaker 5>but I don't take it until you can stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

3700
02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:33.610
<v Speaker 5>He also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stanford gets away from that mentality </v>

3701
02:39:33.610 --> 02:39:36.320
<v Speaker 5>of a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He never get the strength is the </v>

3702
02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:36.320
<v Speaker 5>takedown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3703
02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:39.020
<v Speaker 5>that's the key to that description.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Damien Maia is not a strong takedown </v>

3704
02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:40.110
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he has done some things like when</v>

3705
02:39:40.111 --> 02:39:42.930
<v Speaker 5>he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hit that lateral drop on Chael Sonnen</v>

3706
02:39:42.931 --> 02:39:46.080
<v Speaker 5>and wound up triangle and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful take down,</v>

3707
02:39:46.081 --> 02:39:48.330
<v Speaker 5>but the reality is he could not take </v>
<v Speaker 5>down Anderson,</v>

3708
02:39:48.331 --> 02:39:52.290
<v Speaker 5>so he's got whooped on for five rounds </v>
<v Speaker 5>or at least three and then two rounds of</v>

3709
02:39:52.291 --> 02:39:53.440
<v Speaker 5>chasing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

3710
02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:57.260
<v Speaker 1>do you watch that and then you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them move around.</v>

3711
02:39:57.261 --> 02:39:58.000
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3712
02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any scenario or Damien Maia </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take down Anderson Silva,</v>

3713
02:40:02.261 --> 02:40:04.830
<v Speaker 1>unless Anderson's injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson's takedowns,</v>

3714
02:40:05.260 --> 02:40:07.690
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his defense to good speed is too good.</v>

3715
02:40:07.691 --> 02:40:11.320
<v Speaker 1>His technique is too good and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking is too fucking scary and you're</v>

3716
02:40:11.321 --> 02:40:16.321
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your timing's going to be off because </v>

3717
02:40:16.321 --> 02:40:16.321
<v Speaker 1>you didn't worry eating a flying</v>

3718
02:40:16.321 --> 02:40:16.380
<v Speaker 2>knee that you didn't think anybody could</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever reach you with.</v>

3719
02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Anderson reaches him with a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that fight,</v>

3720
02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:24.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a flying knee that he hits </v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia with where he leaps halfway </v>

3721
02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:26.340
<v Speaker 2>across the Octagon and connects with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>chin.</v>

3722
02:40:26.341 --> 02:40:28.410
<v Speaker 2>And you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did he get that far?</v>

3723
02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:33.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Michael Jordan type jump </v>

3724
02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:36.740
<v Speaker 2>where you see them jumping to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did he cover that much </v>

3725
02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:36.740
<v Speaker 2>distance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlos Newton,</v>

3726
02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:38.750
<v Speaker 2>the timing of his flying knee calls </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in and pride.</v>

3727
02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaned his ass,</v>

3728
02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:45.200
<v Speaker 2>caught them clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was after getting really </v>

3729
02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:47.451
<v Speaker 2>dominated on the ground and Carlos </v>
<v Speaker 2>mounted them and you know Carlos really </v>

3730
02:40:47.451 --> 02:40:49.200
<v Speaker 2>was eating him up [inaudible] the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

3731
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:53.820
<v Speaker 2>But it's that combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3732
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:58.910
<v Speaker 2>the abilities is what makes Anderson so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking spooky said he can defend </v>

3733
02:40:58.910 --> 02:41:03.471
<v Speaker 2>himself on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you get to standing up </v>

3734
02:41:03.471 --> 02:41:03.471
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

3735
02:41:03.471 --> 02:41:05.880
<v Speaker 2>you're in deep shit now he can do shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you that you can't do to him.</v>

3736
02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:08.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's his ability to evade physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

3737
02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:11.150
<v Speaker 2>You can see that bond or tried to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should try to do it.</v>

3738
02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Kind of put physical pressure on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's so elusive and invasive.</v>

3739
02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:16.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the hard part is trying to kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pin him.</v>

3740
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:21.950
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get them out a pin </v>
<v Speaker 2>him down and make them feel the </v>

3741
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.950
<v Speaker 2>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to do.</v>

3742
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Only she'll send it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affect effect and we need a guy in </v>

3743
02:41:26.370 --> 02:41:28.200
<v Speaker 2>that division like Ventura was a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat before that fight.</v>

3744
02:41:28.201 --> 02:41:28.650
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3745
02:41:28.651 --> 02:41:33.651
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] has some fucking serious </v>

3746
02:41:33.651 --> 02:41:33.651
<v Speaker 2>hand speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's putting,</v>

3747
02:41:33.651 --> 02:41:36.420
<v Speaker 2>putting knuckles to a lot of dudes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know anybody that stands in front of</v>

3748
02:41:36.421 --> 02:41:38.440
<v Speaker 2>him when he catches him with that same </v>
<v Speaker 2>blitz,</v>

3749
02:41:38.441 --> 02:41:42.930
<v Speaker 2>he hit vandelay width or rich Franklin </v>
<v Speaker 2>or Akiyama,</v>

3750
02:41:42.931 --> 02:41:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3751
02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:44.820
<v Speaker 2>you know that he could do that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

3752
02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:49.820
<v Speaker 2>But after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after Anderson knocked him out with a </v>

3753
02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:49.820
<v Speaker 2>front kick to the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3754
02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:50.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll.</v>

3755
02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

3756
02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:56.050
<v Speaker 2>who's scary for him now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no been scary for them right </v>

3757
02:41:56.050 --> 02:41:56.050
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Weidman.</v>

3758
02:41:56.050 --> 02:41:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Weidman's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a tough.</v>

3759
02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One's well rounded and physical and.</v>

3760
02:41:58.580 --> 02:41:59.580
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't.</v>

3761
02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:00.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3762
02:42:00.541 --> 02:42:04.350
<v Speaker 2>this is the tool he's going to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily like at least a tough dude.</v>

3763
02:42:04.410 --> 02:42:06.330
<v Speaker 2>It'd be as wrestling but have to be as </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>

3764
02:42:06.510 --> 02:42:08.460
<v Speaker 2>It'd be beating them once again or </v>
<v Speaker 2>submitting.</v>

3765
02:42:08.461 --> 02:42:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to submit them and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking cock strong.</v>

3766
02:42:11.221 --> 02:42:16.221
<v Speaker 2>Let that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why been totally so big boy has a real </v>

3767
02:42:16.221 --> 02:42:19.101
<v Speaker 2>struggle to get 85,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about you have three </v>

3768
02:42:19.101 --> 02:42:21.801
<v Speaker 2>divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think UFC one 71 and five and tool </v>

3769
02:42:21.801 --> 02:42:22.020
<v Speaker 2>five where the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the battle to see who gets the title</v>

3770
02:42:22.021 --> 02:42:27.021
<v Speaker 2>shot is a lot more interesting than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>title fight itself because you have </v>

3771
02:42:27.021 --> 02:42:27.021
<v Speaker 2>dominant champion.</v>

3772
02:42:27.021 --> 02:42:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Those divisions away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited about a few different</v>

3773
02:42:29.641 --> 02:42:31.690
<v Speaker 2>fights at one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm.</v>

3774
02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited.</v>

3775
02:42:32.971 --> 02:42:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Every time I see Johnny Hendricks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking did obese,</v>

3776
02:42:36.090 --> 02:42:39.240
<v Speaker 2>he is just listen on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hitting due to these punches.</v>

3777
02:42:39.241 --> 02:42:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Were you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are there like,</v>

3778
02:42:41.290 --> 02:42:44.320
<v Speaker 2>is this like a stun gun at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his hand or something?</v>

3779
02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Like what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If only he could wrestle.</v>

3780
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3781
02:42:47.521 --> 02:42:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

3782
02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

3783
02:42:49.351 --> 02:42:54.351
<v Speaker 2>the thing that people don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Hendricks is fucking Jujitsu is </v>

3784
02:42:54.351 --> 02:42:55.890
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He taps people like crazy in the gym.</v>

3785
02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:58.560
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hit so hard that he doesn't even fuck</v>

3786
02:42:58.561 --> 02:42:59.820
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to a fight.</v>

3787
02:42:59.970 --> 02:43:00.540
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3788
02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:02.110
<v Speaker 2>he's a scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's.</v>

3789
02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:05.370
<v Speaker 2>He's got the skill set to really give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be problems.</v>

3790
02:43:05.371 --> 02:43:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3791
02:43:06.481 --> 02:43:11.481
<v Speaker 2>If there's one thing I think might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>his Kryptonite is when you put it on GSP</v>

3792
02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:13.130
<v Speaker 5>tends ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

3793
02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:16.640
<v Speaker 5>he tends to have that backup button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes to his take down,</v>

3794
02:43:16.641 --> 02:43:17.060
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3795
02:43:17.061 --> 02:43:22.061
<v Speaker 5>and goes to his take down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might not be there against Johny </v>

3796
02:43:22.061 --> 02:43:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Hendricks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why he might have the capability </v>

3797
02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:24.700
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

3798
02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:24.700
<v Speaker 5>to actually give you a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>troubles.</v>

3799
02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:27.500
<v Speaker 5>No one has so far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If GSP can take down Johnny Hendricks,</v>

3800
02:43:27.501 --> 02:43:30.050
<v Speaker 5>people are going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

3801
02:43:30.051 --> 02:43:33.590
<v Speaker 5>How is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>His timing is awesome.</v>

3802
02:43:34.510 --> 02:43:36.850
<v Speaker 5>Struggled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>struggled with I shields.</v>

3803
02:43:36.980 --> 02:43:38.130
<v Speaker 5>Really didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3804
02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:40.020
<v Speaker 5>granted he did get poked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Fitch,</v>

3805
02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:42.770
<v Speaker 5>fitch down some good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Josh Koscheck</v>

3806
02:43:42.850 --> 02:43:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck John Fitch up on the feet though </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had him hurt from,</v>

3807
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:48.970
<v Speaker 1>from punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fitch is another guy that's like man,</v>

3808
02:43:48.971 --> 02:43:51.220
<v Speaker 1>what heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what determination?</v>

3809
02:43:51.221 --> 02:43:54.270
<v Speaker 1>But his physical prowess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3810
02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:58.630
<v Speaker 1>his athletic ability lags slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind guys like GSP.</v>

3811
02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's worked hard on that.</v>

3812
02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:06.240
<v Speaker 1>That was something that he like looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at after that fight and try to improve </v>

3813
02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:09.781
<v Speaker 1>upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how much can you improve upon how </v>

3814
02:44:09.781 --> 02:44:10.420
<v Speaker 1>much of a Mesomorph you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at a guy like gsp,</v>

3815
02:44:10.421 --> 02:44:15.421
<v Speaker 1>like especially after he came back from </v>
<v Speaker 1>his knee injury and he started doing </v>

3816
02:44:15.421 --> 02:44:16.310
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics to get swole</v>

3817
02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.110
<v Speaker 5>strong as shit and can't get great </v>
<v Speaker 5>timing.</v>

3818
02:44:20.380 --> 02:44:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Timing between striking and grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know what the Fox coming.</v>

3819
02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:29.190
<v Speaker 1>He mixes it all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not predictable and he's smart and </v>

3820
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:30.190
<v Speaker 1>he's always in shape and after that Matt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serra fight.</v>

3821
02:44:30.191 --> 02:44:33.850
<v Speaker 1>He's never gonna fuck off again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know he fucked off one time.</v>

3822
02:44:33.851 --> 02:44:35.650
<v Speaker 1>He gets starched and you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3823
02:44:35.651 --> 02:44:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you got to take every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent serious you.</v>

3824
02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:40.480
<v Speaker 1>That was the wake up call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3825
02:44:40.481 --> 02:44:42.400
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

3826
02:44:42.730 --> 02:44:47.260
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about June junior dos </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santos in Cain Velasquez.</v>

3827
02:44:47.261 --> 02:44:48.300
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about that fight?</v>

3828
02:44:48.810 --> 02:44:51.210
<v Speaker 5>I thought junior dos Santos got years </v>
<v Speaker 5>beating off his career.</v>

3829
02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:52.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>

3830
02:44:52.411 --> 02:44:57.411
<v Speaker 5>I looked at that and I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please can just hit him hard enough one </v>

3831
02:44:57.411 --> 02:45:01.281
<v Speaker 5>time for them to stop this [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's was a few times ref was going </v>

3832
02:45:01.281 --> 02:45:02.640
<v Speaker 5>give me a reason to stop this fight and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Desantos to his credit,</v>

3833
02:45:03.970 --> 02:45:06.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say stayed in the fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he didn't.</v>

3834
02:45:06.091 --> 02:45:11.091
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't competitive but didn't go </v>

3835
02:45:11.091 --> 02:45:11.091
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't get finished,</v>

3836
02:45:11.091 --> 02:45:12.720
<v Speaker 5>but it would've been better for him if </v>
<v Speaker 5>that had been stopped in a second round.</v>

3837
02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:18.020
<v Speaker 5>Quite honestly he got beat so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you go back to the drawing </v>

3838
02:45:18.020 --> 02:45:18.020
<v Speaker 5>board,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a junior,</v>

3839
02:45:18.020 --> 02:45:18.720
<v Speaker 5>dos Santos has camp and you go back to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the drawing board.</v>

3840
02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:21.120
<v Speaker 5>He got taken down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got beat up on the feet.</v>

3841
02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:23.250
<v Speaker 5>He got outworked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his cardio wasn't there,</v>

3842
02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:24.060
<v Speaker 5>so it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3843
02:45:24.061 --> 02:45:26.610
<v Speaker 5>we have six things we've got to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like he took it,</v>

3844
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:29.730
<v Speaker 5>like when when he knocked out cane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could go cane,</v>

3845
02:45:29.731 --> 02:45:31.830
<v Speaker 5>keep your damn hand up or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he had a knee injury,</v>

3846
02:45:31.950 --> 02:45:33.510
<v Speaker 5>but there are things you could fix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a tweak.</v>

3847
02:45:33.511 --> 02:45:38.511
<v Speaker 5>You can make there about seven tweaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got to make the junior dos Santos </v>

3848
02:45:38.511 --> 02:45:38.900
<v Speaker 5>after that fight will pass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not He's his.</v>

3849
02:45:38.970 --> 02:45:43.970
<v Speaker 1>The latest is that he's going through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce and that's why he was not in the</v>

3850
02:45:44.161 --> 02:45:47.100
<v Speaker 1>right frame of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't make any difference.</v>

3851
02:45:47.101 --> 02:45:49.920
<v Speaker 1>What kind did cain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain was a monster.</v>

3852
02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:51.810
<v Speaker 1>He was a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dropped me.</v>

3853
02:45:51.811 --> 02:45:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Crack them with that right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the super aids back there.</v>

3854
02:45:54.541 --> 02:45:55.890
<v Speaker 1>You hear that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to stay away from.</v>

3855
02:45:55.891 --> 02:45:57.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the exact opposite of what junior</v>
<v Speaker 1>dos.</v>

3856
02:45:57.631 --> 02:46:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Santos and Cain Velasquez having life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3857
02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're super aids.</v>

3858
02:46:02.110 --> 02:46:03.990
<v Speaker 1>You're the polar opposite of those guys.</v>

3859
02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:09.060
<v Speaker 5>Little esther logged into Amazon on my </v>
<v Speaker 5>ipad and so now I've adding all these </v>

3860
02:46:09.801 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 5>things</v>

3861
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.460
<v Speaker 2>to her wishlist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like black anal beads and dildos and sex</v>

3862
02:46:13.470 --> 02:46:16.070
<v Speaker 2>and what a sweetheart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a good guy.</v>

3863
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:21.350
<v Speaker 2>While we're here talking about fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking weird.</v>

3864
02:46:21.410 --> 02:46:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I was bummed out that Alistair overeem </v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed off because I really wanted to </v>

3865
02:46:26.410 --> 02:46:29.120
<v Speaker 2>see that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that.</v>

3866
02:46:29.121 --> 02:46:34.121
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about steroids before and the </v>

3867
02:46:34.131 --> 02:46:39.131
<v Speaker 2>tone of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody said what you just said right </v>

3868
02:46:39.131 --> 02:46:39.410
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just thought we're not going to see that</v>

3869
02:46:39.411 --> 02:46:41.630
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tone wasn't that dirty.</v>

3870
02:46:41.631 --> 02:46:46.631
<v Speaker 2>Cheater at Oberlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one got on their moral high horse </v>

3871
02:46:46.631 --> 02:46:46.631
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just went,</v>

3872
02:46:46.631 --> 02:46:47.030
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go see that fight.</v>

3873
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

3874
02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:50.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to see that.</v>

3875
02:46:50.690 --> 02:46:53.720
<v Speaker 2>And it confirmed what everybody always </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspected about Alastar.</v>

3876
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:57.590
<v Speaker 2>How's it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That big?</v>

3877
02:46:57.770 --> 02:47:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Well then Paul Harris just pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3878
02:47:00.290 --> 02:47:02.750
<v Speaker 2>and the other guy we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous physique.</v>

3879
02:47:02.751 --> 02:47:07.751
<v Speaker 2>He just pissed hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when Vito got into UFC </v>

3880
02:47:07.751 --> 02:47:07.751
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3881
02:47:07.751 --> 02:47:10.910
<v Speaker 2>like the muscle was glued onto him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always one 85.</v>

3882
02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Your frame holds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3883
02:47:13.641 --> 02:47:18.641
<v Speaker 2>I walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walk around like one 85 to 35 pounds </v>

3884
02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:24.760
<v Speaker 2>of that muscle to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is ridiculous.</v>

3885
02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:29.360
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 55 pounds.</v>

3886
02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:33.230
<v Speaker 2>That's 35 pounds of muscle that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>belong there.</v>

3887
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:36.230
<v Speaker 2>That's inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he gas against Randy.</v>

3888
02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

3889
02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:43.420
<v Speaker 2>C'Mon dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a backpack with 50 pounds and it </v>

3890
02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:45.050
<v Speaker 2>you can earn 55 fucking pounds of muscle</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>

3891
02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Having a hard time believing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

3892
02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he fought randy,</v>

3893
02:47:50.241 --> 02:47:53.060
<v Speaker 2>he looked like a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was unbelievable.</v>

3894
02:47:55.070 --> 02:47:58.560
<v Speaker 2>His head looked like a zit on top of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain Atlantic.</v>

3895
02:47:58.610 --> 02:48:00.750
<v Speaker 2>He was gigantic back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3896
02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:05.800
<v Speaker 2>one 85 is the right way class for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never had knocked out power to a </v>

3897
02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:06.590
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he could stun you with the speed,</v>

3898
02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:11.980
<v Speaker 2>but at one point five hits your wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't know where you are and he </v>

3899
02:48:11.980 --> 02:48:14.951
<v Speaker 2>never had that until five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like a blitzer but you know </v>

3900
02:48:14.951 --> 02:48:17.630
<v Speaker 2>down him training now down in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that Blackzilians team,</v>

3901
02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Vito has always been a sensational </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete and being with the black </v>

3902
02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:26.531
<v Speaker 2>civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got that Henry who's guy who's </v>

3903
02:48:26.531 --> 02:48:27.650
<v Speaker 2>really tacked on gold dust style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutch style striking and that guy is the</v>

3904
02:48:27.651 --> 02:48:32.651
<v Speaker 2>one who's been training all those guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>where tyrone spong and I think that </v>

3905
02:48:32.651 --> 02:48:35.900
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be really good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vittorio to elevate the technical aspect</v>

3906
02:48:35.901 --> 02:48:38.810
<v Speaker 2>of his game because you saw it in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with bisping.</v>

3907
02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:43.100
<v Speaker 2>He's still got ridiculous abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that fucking left high kick.</v>

3908
02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:44.760
<v Speaker 2>That was very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3909
02:48:44.930 --> 02:48:48.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at since 1997,</v>

3910
02:48:48.501 --> 02:48:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting from 1997.</v>

3911
02:48:49.941 --> 02:48:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Now here he is in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3912
02:48:52.161 --> 02:48:57.161
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about almost a 20 year </v>

3913
02:48:57.161 --> 02:48:57.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking career and the guy still lending</v>
<v Speaker 2>high kicks like that.</v>

3914
02:48:58.130 --> 02:48:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3915
02:48:58.821 --> 02:49:00.710
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible physical abilities.</v>

3916
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:03.050
<v Speaker 2>His problem is always been eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>

3917
02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:04.930
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting them mentally into the fight and</v>

3918
02:49:04.940 --> 02:49:09.940
<v Speaker 2>has always been hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been fights where he's looked </v>

3919
02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:09.940
<v Speaker 2>the second randy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

3920
02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:10.750
<v Speaker 2>third one fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>

3921
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:12.180
<v Speaker 2>didn't even look interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

3922
02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:14.040
<v Speaker 2>fight it to a fight in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he like,</v>

3923
02:49:14.041 --> 02:49:15.150
<v Speaker 2>he didn't even look interested in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

3924
02:49:15.151 --> 02:49:16.280
<v Speaker 2>He was mentally beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3925
02:49:16.290 --> 02:49:21.290
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been his problem in the past has </v>

3926
02:49:21.290 --> 02:49:24.321
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got a lot of mental issues </v>

3927
02:49:24.321 --> 02:49:24.321
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully he's getting over those.</v>

3928
02:49:24.321 --> 02:49:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's adding more dimension to </v>

3929
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:29.010
<v Speaker 2>his game and that's certainly scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly gotten better.</v>

3930
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3931
02:49:30.690 --> 02:49:35.690
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could conceivably challenge Anderson </v>

3932
02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:38.580
<v Speaker 2>and make things very interesting if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could avoid getting cracked again,</v>

3933
02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:40.080
<v Speaker 2>like he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3934
02:49:40.081 --> 02:49:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3935
02:49:40.711 --> 02:49:41.520
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3936
02:49:41.521 --> 02:49:46.521
<v Speaker 2>you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their scrap on the ground where he was </v>

3937
02:49:46.521 --> 02:49:47.070
<v Speaker 2>throwing these wild punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them landed on Anderson.</v>

3938
02:49:47.470 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if one of them did?</v>

3939
02:49:48.930 --> 02:49:50.070
<v Speaker 2>It could've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things could've been,</v>

3940
02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:53.580
<v Speaker 2>and that's a big flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If obviously things could have been very</v>

3941
02:49:53.581 --> 02:49:58.581
<v Speaker 2>interesting because it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was quite a go until that front kick </v>

3942
02:49:58.581 --> 02:49:59.760
<v Speaker 2>landed to the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3943
02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:01.260
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many dudes are throwing that now,</v>

3944
02:50:01.261 --> 02:50:02.680
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's strong.</v>

3945
02:50:03.370 --> 02:50:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody through that before every throws </v>

3946
02:50:08.370 --> 02:50:08.370
<v Speaker 2>it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't set it up properly.</v>

3947
02:50:08.370 --> 02:50:12.771
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like the whole reason it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works is that not a lot of people throw </v>

3948
02:50:12.771 --> 02:50:13.230
<v Speaker 2>it and you're not looking for it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it comes right up to the guard,</v>

3949
02:50:13.710 --> 02:50:15.630
<v Speaker 2>but people don't set it up and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it by itself and you're like,</v>

3950
02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:19.470
<v Speaker 2>what was the perfect technique to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>against Vituro in that circumstance too?</v>

3951
02:50:19.470 --> 02:50:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Because Vito or had to close the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance on Anderson to use his hands.</v>

3952
02:50:23.010 --> 02:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>So he was like more inclined to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward and more inclined to not give up</v>

3953
02:50:28.441 --> 02:50:30.450
<v Speaker 2>ground and box is really heavy on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>front leg.</v>

3954
02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:34.500
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of leaning over that and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably thought it was coming to the</v>

3955
02:50:34.501 --> 02:50:39.501
<v Speaker 2>gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just going to tighten up real quick and </v>

3956
02:50:39.501 --> 02:50:41.541
<v Speaker 2>just get pushed back a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dome and hit some time riding the </v>

3957
02:50:41.541 --> 02:50:41.541
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3958
02:50:41.541 --> 02:50:45.450
<v Speaker 2>what a highlight reel shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson is just a fucking career.</v>

3959
02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.910
<v Speaker 2>It's just a series of highlight reel </v>
<v Speaker 2>shots,</v>

3960
02:50:47.970 --> 02:50:48.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freak.</v>

3961
02:50:49.470 --> 02:50:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3962
02:50:50.330 --> 02:50:52.030
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to have a guy like that around</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

3963
02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he beat Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Sakkara.</v>

3964
02:50:53.540 --> 02:50:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all fricking old school.</v>

3965
02:50:56.190 --> 02:50:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Old School.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am everyone Takahashi.</v>

3966
02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Was it Takahashi that condom condom in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the triangle was um,</v>

3967
02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:04.680
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a desert,</v>

3968
02:51:04.690 --> 02:51:05.070
<v Speaker 2>the Casa.</v>

3969
02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:08.580
<v Speaker 2>The Casa trying shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3970
02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then was considered by some at the </v>

3971
02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:13.900
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best grappler in Japan.</v>

3972
02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grounder rated,</v>

3973
02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

3974
02:51:15.541 --> 02:51:18.000
<v Speaker 2>super technical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just came at the wrong time.</v>

3975
02:51:18.001 --> 02:51:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I never really get it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that real children flying,</v>

3976
02:51:21.481 --> 02:51:26.160
<v Speaker 2>he'll hook that he caught Anderson with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the most insane moves of</v>

3977
02:51:26.161 --> 02:51:28.200
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lozan loves that.</v>

3978
02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:30.230
<v Speaker 2>He dives that you've won some fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

3979
02:51:30.270 --> 02:51:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you submit Jason Chamber with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Inverted Hill again?</v>

3980
02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:36.810
<v Speaker 2>It's back quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3981
02:51:36.811 --> 02:51:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at him and was like,</v>

3982
02:51:38.611 --> 02:51:40.370
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3983
02:51:40.371 --> 02:51:40.970
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3984
02:51:40.971 --> 02:51:42.720
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good one.</v>

3985
02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Your shit up was your meniscus up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes guys don't come back from </v>

3986
02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially meniscus because the inside's</v>

3987
02:51:49.381 --> 02:51:50.320
<v Speaker 2>all fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3988
02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:52.780
<v Speaker 2>they got to put it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>

3989
02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:54.870
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they use cadaver meniscus.</v>

3990
02:51:55.430 --> 02:51:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Really just started stuffing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuffing dead,</v>

3991
02:51:59.730 --> 02:52:00.740
<v Speaker 2>dead peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3992
02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I have a cadaver bones and ligaments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3993
02:52:02.970 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>One of my acs they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it actually becomes a scaffolding.</v>

3994
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:07.360
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

3995
02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Science is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3996
02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Madison?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

3997
02:52:10.730 --> 02:52:15.730
<v Speaker 1>They put you back together again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have both my knees put back together </v>

3998
02:52:15.730 --> 02:52:15.730
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the right one,</v>

3999
02:52:15.730 --> 02:52:17.530
<v Speaker 1>they use a cadaver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left one was a Patella tendon graft.</v>

4000
02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:19.600
<v Speaker 1>So what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the cadaver graft.</v>

4001
02:52:19.601 --> 02:52:22.630
<v Speaker 1>It sits in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then your body starts building cells</v>

4002
02:52:22.631 --> 02:52:27.631
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works as a scaffolding for your body </v>

4003
02:52:27.631 --> 02:52:28.000
<v Speaker 1>to kind of replace all the cells in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with its own natural cells.</v>

4004
02:52:28.210 --> 02:52:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It actually becomes stronger than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial acl that got blown out once it's</v>

4005
02:52:32.681 --> 02:52:34.120
<v Speaker 1>fully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely healed.</v>

4006
02:52:34.370 --> 02:52:35.420
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank God.</v>

4007
02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:37.280
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no new problems.</v>

4008
02:52:37.310 --> 02:52:38.390
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4009
02:52:38.391 --> 02:52:42.740
<v Speaker 5>Well I did lose a minor stabilizer in my</v>
<v Speaker 5>knee when I was fighting.</v>

4010
02:52:42.741 --> 02:52:44.010
<v Speaker 5>James Wilkes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4011
02:52:44.250 --> 02:52:46.880
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an MCL minor?</v>

4012
02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:47.210
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4013
02:52:47.220 --> 02:52:52.220
<v Speaker 5>On the sides of your knee cap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically these two tendons that Kinda </v>

4014
02:52:52.220 --> 02:52:54.741
<v Speaker 5>like button your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your top and bottom bone together and </v>

4015
02:52:54.741 --> 02:52:55.640
<v Speaker 5>mine just popped and just came off so </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have one.</v>

4016
02:52:55.641 --> 02:52:57.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't have one there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a doctor told me,</v>

4017
02:52:57.621 --> 02:52:59.060
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a major stabilizer.</v>

4018
02:52:59.070 --> 02:53:00.650
<v Speaker 5>You're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's funny story.</v>

4019
02:53:00.651 --> 02:53:05.651
<v Speaker 5>I was fighting James Wilson and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>going for a knee bar on him and we're </v>

4020
02:53:05.651 --> 02:53:08.681
<v Speaker 5>rolling around and I hear this loud pop </v>
<v Speaker 5>come from my knee and James had really </v>

4021
02:53:08.681 --> 02:53:11.450
<v Speaker 5>good Thai and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't stand up limping period.</v>

4022
02:53:11.930 --> 02:53:14.960
<v Speaker 5>So I'm rolling for his knee bar and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted in any way but in my head I went,</v>

4023
02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:16.730
<v Speaker 5>well either I get this knee bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty screwed.</v>

4024
02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:18.530
<v Speaker 5>So we're rolling around and rolling </v>
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>

4025
02:53:18.531 --> 02:53:23.531
<v Speaker 5>We'll run it and I get this knee bar and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I crank it and he taps and I stood up </v>

4026
02:53:23.531 --> 02:53:23.590
<v Speaker 5>and I went and raised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

4027
02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:26.900
<v Speaker 5>I walked out of the cage and I got a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of steps and I can't walk anymore</v>

4028
02:53:26.901 --> 02:53:31.901
<v Speaker 5>and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if all the adrenaline I have in my </v>

4029
02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:31.901
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't walk right now.</v>

4030
02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:32.960
<v Speaker 5>This is really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I couldn't get to the car,</v>

4031
02:53:32.961 --> 02:53:34.790
<v Speaker 5>but they never surgically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't.</v>

4032
02:53:35.090 --> 02:53:37.670
<v Speaker 5>They repair that one or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they can,</v>

4033
02:53:37.671 --> 02:53:39.590
<v Speaker 5>but it gets a big deal and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4034
02:53:39.591 --> 02:53:40.550
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll be all right.</v>

4035
02:53:40.551 --> 02:53:42.050
<v Speaker 5>And it's never given me a problem since </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4036
02:53:42.051 --> 02:53:45.890
<v Speaker 5>so it healed up in like three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then every body I know the trains or</v>

4037
02:53:45.891 --> 02:53:46.730

4041
02:53:55.751 --> 02:53:55.751

<v Speaker 1>boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belfort or mean between Bella tour in </v>
