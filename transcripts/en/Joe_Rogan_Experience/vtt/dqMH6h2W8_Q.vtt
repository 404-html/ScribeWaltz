<v Speaker 1>You find those cracks.</v>

16
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Gunnison,</v>

17
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.571
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

18
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you got your volume on.</v>

19
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>We're echoing Gudnason Gudnason where's that?</v>

20
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>That's down south.</v>

21
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about all that shit about the Denver airport?</v>

22
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anything about the conspiracy behind the Denver airport is the</v>

23
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.201
<v Speaker 1>Denver airport.</v>

24
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:43.651
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

25
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>they moved way more dirt than needed to and so there's this,</v>

26
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>all this thought that there's some sort of subterranean tunnel tunnel system and</v>

27
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>it's all based on the end of the world.</v>

28
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Like shelters.</v>

29
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.241
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up.</v>

30
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Stapled to that point was a brilliant,</v>

31
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>what it was like Burbank,</v>

32
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you could smuggle a fucking dead fucking key coconut.</v>

33
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.194
<v Speaker 1>Nobody said nothing.</v>

34
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden they came up with a bright idea.</v>

35
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's fucking make an airport 90 miles farther out by Kansas.</v>

36
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So when it snows,</v>

37
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>we really get fucking buried.</v>

38
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>We have no protection.</v>

39
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a bunch of cowboys,</v>

40
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:13.681
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

41
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Making decisions.</v>

42
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>And then trust me,</v>

43
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>they're too stupid to,</v>

44
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>even though the conspiracy theory is they had an array,</v>

45
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>but the people that built it may be,</v>

46
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>but if the government was really truly behind it,</v>

47
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>like all these people think what it is,</v>

48
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>is that they made an airport there.</v>

49
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>But in constructing the airport,</v>

50
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>they also built some sort of underground safeguard oh three strongest stance.</v>

51
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>So there's gotta be some Kinky Shit.</v>

52
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:35.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:35.941
<v Speaker 1>if it's close,</v>

55
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would be a move,</v>

56
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>No hills in the airport and then build some shelters.</v>

58
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:39.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>that airport is bike fucking Kansas.</v>

60
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>When you go on to the Kansas during dick out,</v>

61
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.911
<v Speaker 1>that's what they call it.</v>

62
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>The hip was,</v>

63
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.231
<v Speaker 1>it was easy,</v>

64
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:46.411
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

65
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>When I lived in Denver or in boulder,</v>

66
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

67
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>it was easy to drive there.</v>

68
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>How far was the drive?</v>

69
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hour.</v>

70
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.481
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

71
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.291
<v Speaker 1>Never any traffic.</v>

72
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>It'd be 25 minutes.</v>

73
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.211
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal though,</v>

74
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

75
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no traffic out that don't matter.</v>

76
00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>It used to be 25 minutes with no traffic on fucking tones.</v>

77
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Crack the window a little bit.</v>

78
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>They built this monster to spend money.</v>

79
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>They built this bond,</v>

81
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>this monster to to,</v>

82
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.781
<v Speaker 1>to just,</v>

83
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:07.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>like when I went to fucking Newark to see the fight with you,</v>

85
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.961
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

86
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>we did Newark.</v>

87
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>They built a soccer stadium and soccer stadium in Newark that spending money</v>

88
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:16.014
<v Speaker 1>left and right,</v>

89
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but they still can't put in a left hand turning signal.</v>

90
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got to make a left 29 fucking miles and people got a male,</v>

91
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to keep up their reputation as the car Jack Capitol of the world.</v>

92
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And if felt like some left turn signals,</v>

93
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you've got some outlet people can escape,</v>

94
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>can escape the drama.</v>

95
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:33.901
<v Speaker 1>Fucking amazed.</v>

96
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about that.</v>

97
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

98
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>they think that's a,</v>

100
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>there's something really going on inside that Denver airport.</v>

101
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>There's all these documentaries,</v>

102
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to it.</v>

104
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons for it is because,</v>

105
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

106
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.641
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

107
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>these crazy murals that they're painted up in the Denver airport and they're</v>

108
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>really disturbing man.</v>

109
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Their apocalyptic,</v>

110
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>like one guy's got a fucking gas mask on with a giant sword and there's like</v>

111
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>pictures of children and coffins and there's fire in the background.</v>

112
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Have you</v>

113
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>ever seen that shit?</v>

114
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

115
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.511
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

116
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.210
<v Speaker 2>we've actually talked about it on this podcast before we,</v>

117
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

118
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that has anything to do with,</v>

119
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>with that thinking you putting the two together?</v>

120
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it does,</v>

121
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:10.631
<v Speaker 2>definitely,</v>

122
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting,</v>

123
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:12.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

125
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't have opinion one way or another.</v>

126
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to the people talk about how it's some great escape base and that</v>

127
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>2012 there's going to be,</v>

128
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 2>fucking asteroid's gonna hit that they're tracking,</v>

130
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>it's going to kill everybody except the people that are in this underground</v>

131
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:26.884
<v Speaker 2>bunker.</v>

132
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.341
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

133
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

134
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I watched a TV show on those dudes,</v>

135
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>those dudes that have,</v>

136
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 2>they've bought like fucking condos out in these shelters out in like death</v>

<v Speaker 2>condo inside this underground bunker thing.</v>

142
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>It's out in the middle of fucking nowhere.</v>

143
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>You have to drive.</v>

144
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 2>And he'd go out there and they had these shows,</v>

145
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I forgot who was the host of the show,</v>

146
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.100

198
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.100
<v Speaker 3>West Florida that's primarily hooked up horse riding guys off and creating heat</v>

199
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 3>burning that they put in the fucking beach during CSI Miami.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like it just like playing quake online when you got lag.</v>

<v Speaker 3>lost our money.</v>

304
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Nobody liked the black people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The shit we got now as bombs and stuff is off the charts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

342
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:43.910
<v Speaker 2>I saw that it was really crazy.</v>

343
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 2>They got this rover,</v>

344
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:45.751
<v Speaker 2>this a,</v>

345
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 2>this a remote controlled drone rover that's moving around that can jump in the</v>

346
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.234
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

347
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.870
<v Speaker 2>It gets up to a fence and I think you can go like eight or nine feet in the</v>

348
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 2>fucking air and it moves up to the fence and then it just goes and flies to the</v>

349
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

350
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Landsdale the side and it looks like basically it's like like some sort of a</v>

351
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 2>flat box,</v>

352
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 2>you know where all the electronics is with like two tractor to rubber tractor</v>

353
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 2>things on the side of it I guess.</v>

354
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 2>And the fucking thing flies through the air.</v>

355
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

356
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.943
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

357
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 2>what's next?</v>

358
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:16.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

359
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing that people are thinking about.</v>

360
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the shit that's going down in Afghanistan.</v>

361
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the shit that's going down in the Middle East period and said the CIA</v>

362
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.560
<v Speaker 2>has got all kinds of shit going on.</v>

363
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of little tiny little drones and explosives.</v>

364
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.670
<v Speaker 2>It blowing up in convenient spots of spark action.</v>

365
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

366
00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:33.701
<v Speaker 3>that's what they'd do.</v>

367
00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:33.851
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

368
00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:35.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do is bark war and get,</v>

369
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:36.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

370
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:37.143
<v Speaker 3>they've always done that.</v>

371
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.380
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line of this,</v>

372
00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:38.680
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

373
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is really going on?</v>

374
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.680
<v Speaker 3>They figured out some Libyan doctor figuring out a way how to grow 50 kilos of</v>

375
00:10:44.681 --> 00:10:47.050
<v Speaker 3>heroin in your bath tub in the United States.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but the United States is Jacqueline.</v>

380
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.750
<v Speaker 3>This guy's got something to do with age.</v>

381
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.810
<v Speaker 3>It's got something to do with fucking why we're over there in the fucking first</v>

382
00:10:58.811 --> 00:10:59.380
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

383
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.000
<v Speaker 3>The whole nucleus of this thing.</v>

384
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.520
<v Speaker 3>People are dying in Detroit from heroin.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

417
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:54.020
<v Speaker 2>is it a fucking coincidence that for whatever reason we decide to attack instead</v>

418

<v Speaker 2>of going to Mexico and straighten out that bullshit that's right next door.</v>

422
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 2>because there's not a lot of shit to offer.</v>

423
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.010

00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:13.474
<v Speaker 2>It's a big part of it.</v>

431
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to make everything legal.</v>

432
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to,</v>

433
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.650
<v Speaker 2>you know they did.</v>

434
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.231
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>

435
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:17.511
<v Speaker 2>They you,</v>

436
00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 2>here's a little known fact.</v>

437
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Mexico has decriminalized everything,</v>

438
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.391
<v Speaker 2>small amounts.</v>

439
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:23.224
<v Speaker 2>When you're not selling it,</v>

440
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.011
<v Speaker 2>everything's legal.</v>

441
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:24.191
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

442
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 2>You could get acid in Mexico,</v>

443
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 2>you can get mushrooms in Mexico.</v>

444
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>They did decriminalize everything just because they had to allocate resources to</v>

445
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 2>fight in these fucking drug lords.</v>

446
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a,</v>

447
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 2>that's a gone country.</v>

448
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.021
<v Speaker 2>That country is gone.</v>

449
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 2>The country doesn't have a government anymore.</v>

450
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 2>That's right next door,</v>

451
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>right next door.</v>

452
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.441
<v Speaker 2>Right next door.</v>

453
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Right next door.</v>

454
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 2>The fucking drug army is,</v>

455
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like going to war with someone who lives in your country.</v>

456
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like if we were fighting al Qaeda,</v>

457
00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 2>but al Qaeda had billions of dollars and it was way more armed and they were</v>

458
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:50.254
<v Speaker 2>living here.</v>

459
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.123
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like.</v>

460
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like being a fucking comes in Mexico.</v>

461
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Here's the crazy thing.</v>

462
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:55.900

<v Speaker 2>They'll come out of their hunting blinds and kill you is all,</v>

475
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a chance here.</v>

476
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.351
<v Speaker 2>He lives there.</v>

477
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Ted Nugent lives in Waco now.</v>

478
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:18.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

479
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>You can't fuck with text.</v>

480
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

481
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.120
<v Speaker 2>He's got a high fence.</v>

482
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I've always admired what I think he's a retard,</v>

483
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 2>but I think he does a lot of things that I really agree with.</v>

484
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I agree with is when he lived in Michigan,</v>

485
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 2>he had this bad ass compound.</v>

486
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 2>We let 2000 acres or something like that and it was all fenced in and he had all</v>

487
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 2>these animals living inside his compound and he would just go and Jack Him and</v>

488
00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 2>that's where he got all this food from.</v>

489
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.230
<v Speaker 2>He got all his food from hunting on his own property and I'm like,</v>

490
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:44.801
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

491
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking brilliant.</v>

492
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 2>That's how I want to live.</v>

493
00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I would love to live like that.</v>

494
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Just eat what you hunt.</v>

495
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

496
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why I was into moving to Colorado.</v>

497
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why I was up there,</v>

498
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

513
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Oregon's one of those,</v>

514
00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:21.290
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to have a good fucking time.</v>

515
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Oregon's one of those states has been under grid for years,</v>

516
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:24.271
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

522
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:30.783
<v Speaker 2>Ashlyn,</v>

523
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Eugene Bend,</v>

524
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Oregon's a Hippie flubbing foundation over there and,</v>

525
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 2>but Portland's a pretty hippie place too,</v>

526
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 2>isn't very hippy now he's up to at girls have dirty feet.</v>

527
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 2>They have dirty feet.</v>

528
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Make them put socks on,</v>

529
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 2>fuck socks and say sign and dump breathing my mouth.</v>

530
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Portland was the place that I went to last year and we were at trying to find</v>

531
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 2>the most person in a Costco for like a half hour meeting.</v>

532
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 2>The girl is with Amy cannot,</v>

533
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.000
<v Speaker 2>who'd you fuck?</v>

534
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And we couldn't find anyone.</v>

536
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 2>So Costco though,</v>

537
00:14:58.941 --> 00:14:59.241
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

538
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 2>go to a Costco in Burbank and even with a bunch of cripples there too.</v>

539
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.211
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

540
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:05.600
<v Speaker 2>but that's a pack Dasko I usually watch time one string.</v>

541
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 2>You need to go to better places.</v>

542
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.710
<v Speaker 2>So it was a smaller amount.</v>

543
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Smaller amount of people you'd want to fuck.</v>

544
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 2>That's okay dude.</v>

545
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.233
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go,</v>

546
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.333
<v Speaker 2>I'll be okay.</v>

547
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Got to live somewhere with this.</v>

548
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 2>If this place falls apart.</v>

549
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I went to this too many humans here.</v>

550
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Too many.</v>

551
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.610
<v Speaker 2>We keep on saying that,</v>

552
00:15:21.611 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 2>but we're not doing anything about it.</v>

553
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.231
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

554
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I fucking moved,</v>

555
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

556
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why I came back cause Mrs. Reagan got pregnant and because the</v>

557
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>dog had eaten by mountain,</v>

558
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for that,</v>

559
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.250
<v Speaker 2>went to the suburbs then or stuff.</v>

560
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.173
<v Speaker 2>That's my next move.</v>

561
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Almost not like I'm already talking to real estate agents.</v>

562
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:38.893
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

564
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 2>But the move to move is you go and he'd get a summer place and you try it out</v>

565
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 2>and lived there for a summer.</v>

566
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.293
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

567
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 2>You'd be super nice while you're there.</v>

568
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes on the [inaudible] just every time we're there I'll just bring</v>

569
00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 2>home flowers and shit and then we come back to la and then it's all Jujitsu and</v>

570
00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 2>loud music and too much pot smoke.</v>

571
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.750

573
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Daddy just wants to fight and smoke pot and he's walking around naked.</v>

574
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

575
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.421
<v Speaker 2>in Colorado.</v>

576
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Daddy wants to go get ice cream and daddy's bringing flowers home.</v>

577
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:16.190
<v Speaker 2>See you just train them.</v>

578
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Brown got blowing farts on her.</v>

579
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.291
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem.</v>

580
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:21.811
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan,</v>

581
00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Scott,</v>

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan's got a great wife and Joe Rogan.</v>

583
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I went to his home last week and that was one of the first times Mrs Rogan was</v>

584
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 3>home and a couple of times,</v>

585
00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 3>and I'd been up there like four times.</v>

586
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.020
<v Speaker 3>This is Roldan likes to rock the house</v>

587
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 3>and the quantum was up where you live now.</v>

588
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 3>All you gotta do is go down and who she'd get,</v>

589
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:41.040
<v Speaker 3>the party started where you put it before motherfuckers.</v>

590
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a witness relocation play.</v>

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 3>She had to drive 90 miles before she even seen a daddy's girl who was another 20</v>

592
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:47.391
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>

593
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 3>She was from all the weapon boulder,</v>

594
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 3>the first mall that she cares about his cherry fucking creek.</v>

595
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.001
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

596
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:54.590
<v Speaker 3>So you had a two foils at Denver?</v>

597
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

598
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.490
<v Speaker 3>Was groups out away from the more</v>

599
00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 3>you got to keep a closer to the wall,</v>

600
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 3>you had a 90 fucking miles dog.</v>

601
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I slipped on the almost blew up.</v>

602
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 3>What am I loved the most living up there.</v>

603
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 3>That was that.</v>

604
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 3>There was a small amount of people,</v>

605
00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

606
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.350
<v Speaker 3>smaller boulders only got a hundred thousand plus people.</v>

607
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Not that much man.</v>

608
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.301
<v Speaker 3>And people are friendly.</v>

609
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I like that there's a more relaxed vibe.</v>

610
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 3>And I think that shit is healthy.</v>

611
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something exciting about living in a big city,</v>

612
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're,</v>

613
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

614
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 3>you're involved in the hustle and bustle and you're really trying to make</v>

615
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:27.770
<v Speaker 3>something happen and you know,</v>

616
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

617
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

618
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 3>but Casey,</v>

619
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.261
<v Speaker 3>that New York are real.</v>

620
00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:31.094
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good,</v>

621
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 3>if you got the voice,</v>

622
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 3>you probably get married again after a week.</v>

623
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:34.364
<v Speaker 3>You dumb fuck.</v>

624
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Talking to a real rogue is going to shut that far yet.</v>

625
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 3>You've got to figure out a way to get a fucking coffee hut to the mall of</v>

626
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:43.480
<v Speaker 3>America where the action is.</v>

627
00:17:43.481 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 3>Any of that.</v>

628
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.491
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>

629
00:17:44.491 --> 00:17:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got to move a little closer.</v>

630
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.453
<v Speaker 3>That was too much</v>

631
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.060
<v Speaker 2>and he just needed to move to Texas.</v>

632
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.191
<v Speaker 2>Texas is cool.</v>

633
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:51.024
<v Speaker 2>This is the answer.</v>

634
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.991
<v Speaker 2>I like Austin.</v>

635
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that.</v>

636
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:53.191
<v Speaker 2>Austin,</v>

637
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:53.581
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

638
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:54.121
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>

639
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I'd lived there if I was going to live,</v>

640
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 2>but more lane is not legal there.</v>

641
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Colorado is it's just like California.</v>

642
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.660
<v Speaker 2>You could just go rockweed everywhere and people will move to Austin.</v>

643
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

644
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

647
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.390
<v Speaker 2>The shit hits the fan.</v>

648
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:07.201
<v Speaker 2>Anything can happen.</v>

649
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:07.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

650
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:07.580
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

651
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.140
<v Speaker 2>when the shit hits the fan and everybody gets scared and then you start making,</v>

652
00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:10.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

653
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 2>survival choices.</v>

654
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 2>You can live in Kansas,</v>

655
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

656
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 2>and you'd rather be healthy in Kansas,</v>

657
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

658
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:15.571
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

659
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:15.970

680
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:43.260
<v Speaker 2>It was like a gift shop and they were doing do it struggling and they were doing</v>

684
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:49.200
<v Speaker 2>back of the gift shop legal.</v>

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:50.941
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

689
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:53.370

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Their one place they opened up in boulder is supposedly,</v>

691
00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's open yet,</v>

692
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.030

693
00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be three floors.</v>

694
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they went through with it.</v>

695
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I need to find out if they did because that's just the most ridiculous shit I've</v>

696
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 2>ever heard.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We can get weed.</v>

702
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I got some no problem.</v>

703
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.070
<v Speaker 1>We two days ago in Hollywood,</v>

704
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>it's 31% THC level.</v>

705
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 1>You'll leave.</v>

706
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.570
<v Speaker 1>This shit ain't even necessary,</v>

707
00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:21.440
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

708
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 1>it's Matt.</v>

709
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I've been smoking Matt since 2006 and you got to figure that every year it gets</v>

710
00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:27.990
<v Speaker 1>a little stroller.</v>

711
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's dead straight week.</v>

713
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to bring up,</v>

714
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like one of the Martians from Independence Day.</v>

715
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 1>You can see the sativa and indica grown around it.</v>

716
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.543

<v Speaker 1>two black guys got shoulder to shoulder and he was grappling their shoulders.</v>

867
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weird things about people that are retarded or down syndrome</v>

868
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:34.880
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

869
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to know.</v>

870
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

871
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.170
<v Speaker 1>they just kind of are,</v>

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.001
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

875

877
00:23:40.951 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 1>A book is mom and they're not like that.</v>

878
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 1>They just themselves.</v>

879
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:45.761
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

00:23:45.761 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what</v>

881
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean?</v>

882
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like that must be a strange,</v>

883
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 2>strange existence where,</v>

884
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:50.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

885
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 2>that's part of being dumb is that you're too dumb to realize you're dumb.</v>

886
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:53.871
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

887
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying dumb,</v>

888
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 2>like there's like they're lazy.</v>

889
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:57.441
<v Speaker 2>Like they have an issue,</v>

890
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a mental issues and the mental imbalance or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

891
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:00.900
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

892
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.280
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

893
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.090
<v Speaker 2>they're impaired,</v>

894
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.050
<v Speaker 2>but there's so impaired,</v>

895
00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:04.070
<v Speaker 2>they don't know they're impaired.</v>

896
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Like they've lost the ability to see that they're impaired.</v>

897
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

898
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.230
<v Speaker 2>what a strange thing,</v>

899
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.380
<v Speaker 5>what if they all have it in her voice that that's completely normal.</v>

900
00:24:11.381 --> 00:24:11.740
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

901
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 5>but they can't take a to be like,</v>

902
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

903
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.800
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

904
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.610
<v Speaker 5>So the whole time there's this,</v>

905
00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:15.970
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

906
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.200
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe how much they treat me so horrible and I wish I,</v>

907
00:24:20.201 --> 00:24:20.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

908
00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:21.190
<v Speaker 5>but they can't,</v>

909
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.001
<v Speaker 5>when they tried to say it,</v>

910
00:24:22.001 --> 00:24:23.160
<v Speaker 5>it's like we're married for them.</v>

911
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

912
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.113
<v Speaker 2>there's probably,</v>

913
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.800
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a lot of that.</v>

914
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

915
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a bunch of different types of,</v>

916
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:30.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

917
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>being fucked up.</v>

918
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

919
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

920
00:24:31.691 --> 00:24:32.800
<v Speaker 2>for sure there's that too.</v>

921
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

922
00:24:33.281 --> 00:24:33.581
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

923
00:24:33.581 --> 00:24:34.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not just simple as,</v>

924
00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:35.494
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

925
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.490
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

926
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.200
<v Speaker 2>there's varying degrees.</v>

927
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

928
00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:40.480
<v Speaker 2>There's varying degrees along the way that are,</v>

929
00:24:40.481 --> 00:24:40.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:24:40.691 --> 00:24:40.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

931
00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking crazy thing,</v>

932
00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:43.091
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

933
00:24:43.091 --> 00:24:43.241
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

934
00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 2>to have your mind impaired.</v>

935

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

937
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.060
<v Speaker 2>our minds are impaired in comparison.</v>

938
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.080
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this fucking 12 year old kid is autistic kid with 170 Iq doing</v>

939
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.040
<v Speaker 2>his take on the theory of relativity and he's writing out equations on this</v>

940
00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:58.900
<v Speaker 2>fucking window and I'm watching this kid.</v>

941
00:24:58.901 --> 00:24:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

942
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.870
<v Speaker 2>this kid might as well be a fucking alien.</v>

943
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:02.441
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

944
00:25:02.441 --> 00:25:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's doing.</v>

945
00:25:03.461 --> 00:25:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

946
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.370
<v Speaker 2>He's explained this like this is all simple,</v>

947
00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:07.204
<v Speaker 2>simple shit.</v>

948
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.900
<v Speaker 2>When this is so far beyond my capacity to him,</v>

949
00:25:10.901 --> 00:25:11.800
<v Speaker 2>to this artistic kid,</v>

950
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I am retarded.</v>

951
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.451
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

952
00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I am this guy who he has to humor because I can't understand a fucking word,</v>

953
00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:18.790
<v Speaker 2>a letter,</v>

954
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.560
<v Speaker 2>a singular part of his equation.</v>

955
00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on up there.</v>

956
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.290
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos to me.</v>

957
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.820
<v Speaker 2>But to him it's so clear.</v>

958
00:25:24.821 --> 00:25:25.541
<v Speaker 2>It's a language.</v>

959
00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:25.781
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

960
00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:25.931
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

961
00:25:25.931 --> 00:25:29.170
<v Speaker 2>quite simply you have to move this and this becomes x equals y equals two.</v>

962
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.210
<v Speaker 2>We are the retards to that kid.</v>

963
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.313
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

00:25:36.011 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 2>they feel bad when people don't have down syndrome.</v>

969
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's just like us and we feel bad with people who have autism cause poor</v>

970
00:25:41.591 --> 00:25:42.490
<v Speaker 2>kid's got autism,</v>

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.710
<v Speaker 2>He was never progressed to the bag when my dog,</v>

1013
00:26:41.711 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Michael Allen Bradley.</v>

1014
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 2>But this kid</v>

1015
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 1>knew nothing when we came off a boat January in the sixth grade,</v>

1016
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but the eighth grade knew three fucking language.</v>

1017
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:51.270

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.300
<v Speaker 1>talk to you in English like nothing and get A's.</v>

1022
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.260
<v Speaker 1>they have this insane work ethic and people would get a chance to come to</v>

1023
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:02.094
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1024
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so much different than being born in America.</v>

1025
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any fucking idea.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're kind of fucked man.</v>

1035
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in America,</v>

1036
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:18.691
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:21.961
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're putting all your fucking ship and cargo planes and you're all sitting</v>

1045
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:29.881

00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 1>eating fruit out of your mom's purse and just hoping that when you get there</v>

1049
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 1>things are going to be better and you don't know anybody there.</v>

1050
00:27:37.771 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>And how scary is this?</v>

1051
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So when those motherfuckers get to school,</v>

1052
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 1>they come out guns blazing.</v>

1053
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:42.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1054
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:44.580
<v Speaker 1>they appreciate the fact that Holy Shit,</v>

1055
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I used to live in Italy.</v>

1056
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Now here I am in the land of the free,</v>

1057
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 1>the home of the brave.</v>

1058
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:49.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1059
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm in America and I'm in school and I'm learning English and I'm just going to</v>

1060
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 1>go fucking crazy over here.</v>

1061
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 1>They're just so happy and she'll be open.</v>

1062
00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the one half of it because I didn't to leave Cuba corner.</v>

1063
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 1>We moved to,</v>

1064
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I woke up on 89th street in Riverside drive.</v>

1065
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I had all the fucking things that a rich kid would have,</v>

1066
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:11.100
<v Speaker 1>rite aid and here I was walking around this fucking city but I didn't know</v>

1067
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 1>English and all you want to do when your heart is just fit in and you have no</v>

1068
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 1>idea this is not trying to fit in when you were in grammar school and you should</v>

1069
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:19.401
<v Speaker 1>get a tattoo,</v>

1070
00:28:19.401 --> 00:28:20.234
<v Speaker 1>a long hair,</v>

1071
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.180
<v Speaker 1>all you want to know is for them not to know that you came from somewhere else.</v>

1072
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't describe it to you.</v>

1073
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't even fucking start to tell you like sometimes I have this anger at me</v>

1074
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:34.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's because I was so lucky.</v>

1075
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.340
<v Speaker 1>We were so lucky.</v>

1076
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I think if three of us could have been born one of those black kids and fucking</v>

1077
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Haiti would flies on you.</v>

1078
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I need three of us and we have so many fucking opportunities and sometimes I</v>

1079
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 1>wake up in the morning and this really hits me.</v>

1080
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I go home and fucking lucky am I that my mother came here and here I</v>

1081
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:50.900
<v Speaker 1>am sitting here smoking dope.</v>

1082
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I got to go mug somebody.</v>

1083
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.011
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1084
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:53.460
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1085
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.001
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>

1086
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:55.340
<v Speaker 1>that's what an immigrant was like.</v>

1087
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling him for a long time I've been writing this thing and that's how it</v>

1088
00:28:58.981 --> 00:28:59.814
<v Speaker 1>starts with,</v>

1089
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember anything.</v>

1091
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the plane ride from Cube.</v>

1092
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.073
<v Speaker 1>I remember nothing.</v>

1093
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 1>All I remember is crossing the fucking street on 89th and Broadway up to</v>

1094
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 66 and thinking to myself,</v>

1095
00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:12.571
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

1096
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a fucking American.</v>

1097
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.600
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1098
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Looking at that flag,</v>

1099
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.630
<v Speaker 1>really believe in something dog.</v>

1100
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a piece of fucking rag looking at that flag and going,</v>

1101
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1102
00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Like looking at the wind blowing that flag and going,</v>

1103
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.690
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck that flag is the answer to all my fucking problem.</v>

1104
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer right there.</v>

1105
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.630
<v Speaker 1>But even at that age,</v>

1106
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I knew my mother was fucking crazy,</v>

1107
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 1>so I do.</v>

1108
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a full fledged American,</v>

1109
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:38.610
<v Speaker 1>but looking at that flag,</v>

1110
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 1>when you look at that flag and you just come here that they have a scene in the</v>

1111
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 1>beginning of Scarface when they were on the boat and they finally see land and</v>

1112
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 1>they show the American flag and the director,</v>

1113
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 1>whoever the guy is brilliant enough to show,</v>

1114
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 1>he showed it from a different angle.</v>

1115
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.350
<v Speaker 1>What that flag it looks like.</v>

1116
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not just we overlooked that flag every fucking day.</v>

1117
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 1>We overlooked that flag.</v>

1118
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what it is to look at that flag when you first come here and to</v>

1119
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>know that that's your fucking,</v>

1120
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.060
<v Speaker 1>that's you're a magic carpet.</v>

1121
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest ideal in the world.</v>

1122
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest ideal.</v>

1123
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:10.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so infuriating when politicians are fucking corrupt.</v>

1124
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:11.501
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so,</v>

1125
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:11.711
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1126
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

1127
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 1>why do you criticize what America does overseas?</v>

1128
00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't you love America?</v>

1129
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:15.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:16.481
<v Speaker 1>If you love it,</v>

1131
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 1>you want to tell the fucking truth about what it's doing.</v>

1132
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:19.030
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1133
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:19.631
<v Speaker 1>If you love it,</v>

1134
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to stand up and go,</v>

1135
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1136
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't love it by letting it get away with stupid shit because</v>

1137
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:27.190
<v Speaker 1>there's some corrupt content.</v>

1138
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 1>The wheel that's not,</v>

1139
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you don't love the idea of America.</v>

1140
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love the idea of America for sure.</v>

1141
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm always remember we only see the one side of that flag.</v>

1142
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 1>We never see both sides together gentlemen,</v>

1143
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's a point we never,</v>

1144
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 1>we only see that one side of the flag right now.</v>

1145
00:30:42.221 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 1>You've discussed at the CIA is setting up things in Libya.</v>

1146
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.600
<v Speaker 1>What are they setting up?</v>

1147
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.041
<v Speaker 1>Let's start.</v>

1148
00:30:47.041 --> 00:30:47.400
<v Speaker 1>No War,</v>

1149
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 1>let's start in business.</v>

1150
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.900
<v Speaker 1>They're getting things going.</v>

1151
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the other side of that flag that were never able to see.</v>

1152
00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:55.400
<v Speaker 1>We always see once you put a mirror on the other side of the flag,</v>

1153
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.081
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1154
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the one side of the flag that we have.</v>

1155
00:30:57.911 --> 00:30:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Since we accept this side of the flag,</v>

1156
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Speaker 1>we got to accept that.</v>

1157
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 1>So the only way that side this side is possible where it's easy to drive around</v>

1158
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 1>as if they're doing all this creepy shit.</v>

1159
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.390
<v Speaker 1>You got to break.</v>

1160
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Unless we bring the whole world together in on everything and that's just not</v>

1161
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:13.310
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and we've done creepy fucking shit.</v>

1162
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do creepy shit to trust them.</v>

1163
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:16.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1164
00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:16.750
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1165
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.280
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust people to be cool.</v>

1166
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:18.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1167
00:31:18.701 --> 00:31:19.121
<v Speaker 1>the look,</v>

1168
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 1>the natural instinct,</v>

1169
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 1>if someone can get into a position of power is to be Kadafi.</v>

1170
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the natural instinct.</v>

1171
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.800
<v Speaker 1>That natural instinct is to get botox.</v>

1172
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 1>When you're 80 you have this big stupid looking rubber face,</v>

1173
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.620
<v Speaker 1>wear goofy clothes and just be running shit.</v>

1174
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're this old con,</v>

1175
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:34.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1176
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:37.270
<v Speaker 1>living in some fucking castle with billions of dollars.</v>

1177

1179
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:39.390
<v Speaker 1>can you tell me why is he doing it?</v>

1180
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we put that billions of dollars for money.</v>

1181
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 1>That other side of that flag is money.</v>

1182
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

1183
00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of people never had comprehend,</v>

1184
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.810
<v Speaker 1>but that's the reality of it.</v>

1185
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Standup is a beautiful thing to do.</v>

1186
00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Some guys are brilliant and some guys aren't brilliant.</v>

1188
00:31:52.141 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 1>A millionaires.</v>

1189
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 1>The other fall between the crack,</v>

1190
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.380
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the standup,</v>

1191
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a business.</v>

1192
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 1>It really is a fucking business guys.</v>

1194
00:31:58.241 --> 00:31:59.051
<v Speaker 1>And it's like anything else.</v>

1195
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:01.720
<v Speaker 1>The other side of that flag is a business guys,</v>

1196
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 1>and the same way we want social security one was 65 a country.</v>

1197
00:32:05.651 --> 00:32:05.861
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1198
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:06.100
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1199
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.670
<v Speaker 1>sell a couple kilos every once in a while to replenish those fucking phones.</v>

1200
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.533
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1201
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's a side of the American public.</v>

1202
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:13.264
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to know.</v>

1203
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 1>That's the side that included Kennedy.</v>

1204
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 1>That's aside the Alex Jones talks about whether it's true or not,</v>

1205
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a side we not supposed to see what's supposed to be focused on the other</v>

1206
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 1>side on what that machine is supposed to mean to us.</v>

1207
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 1>And for guys like you and I,</v>

1208
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I like looking behind the curtain,</v>

1209
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:29.344
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

1210
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't because I grew up in a,</v>

1211
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:35.410
<v Speaker 1>in a corrupt hometown and I seen what politics is at a minute level.</v>

1212
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't even dream of what it is and and national fucking level.</v>

1213
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.020
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1214
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1215
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking political contributions but I'm going to pass your fucking bills so</v>

1216
00:32:43.071 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you could pass that law.</v>

1217
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 1>That will make people's hands grow back,</v>

1218
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 1>but they're also going to give him cancer when the eyeballs,</v>

1219
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:50.023
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>

1220
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.893
<v Speaker 1>It grows.</v>

1221
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.190
<v Speaker 1>When I grew up in it,</v>

1222
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 1>when it was in the micro process,</v>

1223
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.030
<v Speaker 1>now it's in the national level of corruption isn't a macro process and it starts</v>

1224
00:32:59.031 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 1>with little things and townships where if it's a macro smaller than my micro</v>

1225
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:03.991
<v Speaker 1>macro,</v>

1226
00:33:03.991 --> 00:33:04.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little high.</v>

1227
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:05.354
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry guys,</v>

1228
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.820
<v Speaker 1>but you understand my pill.</v>

1229
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.641
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what you're saying.</v>

1230
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1231
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.230
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting.</v>

1232
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.131
<v Speaker 1>Corruption.</v>

1233
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:11.510
<v Speaker 1>If not checked grows.</v>

1234
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It all just keeps getting bigger.</v>

1235
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they go,</v>

1236
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:13.761
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1237
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 1>we got to cut the shit.</v>

1238
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I know we've been making millions of dollars on the sneak tip,</v>

1239
00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's got to stop right now and I'm not kidding.</v>

1240
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Why are you still making money?</v>

1241
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.560
<v Speaker 2>These wiki leak things are pretty cool for the country.</v>

1242
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why these assholes want to put that guy in jail.</v>

1243
00:33:26.801 --> 00:33:28.360
<v Speaker 2>They want to say compromises Americans.</v>

1244
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:28.691
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1245
00:33:28.691 --> 00:33:29.261

1246
00:33:29.261 --> 00:33:29.501
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1247
00:33:29.501 --> 00:33:31.870
<v Speaker 2>he did exactly what the New York Times was supposed to do.</v>

1248
00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:33.040
<v Speaker 2>If they got that information.</v>

1249
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.750
<v Speaker 5>They should have done that on Twitter though.</v>

1250
00:33:34.751 --> 00:33:37.090
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if there was just like this Twitter address that everyone</v>

1251
00:33:37.091 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Speaker 5>followed that tweet later.</v>

1252
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:39.731
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1263
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 2>parts of the American economy are influenced by genetically modified foods and</v>

1264
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:57.230
<v Speaker 2>how we're trying to force them on other countries.</v>

1265
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.210
<v Speaker 2>And then where you're like fucking with other countries,</v>

1266
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:01.580
<v Speaker 2>if they don't go into the genetically modified food,</v>

1267
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 2>if they don't start growing like Monsanto corn,</v>

1268
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:04.940
<v Speaker 2>shit like that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1273

<v Speaker 2>that those,</v>

1274
00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:09.380
<v Speaker 2>these giant companies are way too embedded into the political system.</v>

1275
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing stuff for the greater good of people there doing stuff for the</v>

1276
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:15.710
<v Speaker 2>profitability of giant corporations that moved him into position in the first</v>

1277
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:16.130
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1278
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing has been corrupted.</v>

1279
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Like to sit down and pretend that that,</v>

1280
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:20.470
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1281
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:21.261
<v Speaker 2>that it's real.</v>

1282
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:22.280
<v Speaker 2>It's insulting.</v>

1283
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:23.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1284
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like a stupid argument.</v>

1285
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like people argue about pro wrestling,</v>

1296
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:42.374

<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting.</v>

1305
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:55.370
<v Speaker 2>How deep the corruption is.</v>

1306
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:56.091

00:34:58.581 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1312
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.350

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 2>a normalized economy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everything was running smooth people.</v>

1358
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:49.560
<v Speaker 2>We're hard workers.</v>

1359
00:36:49.561 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 2>People got shit done.</v>

1360
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.010
<v Speaker 2>They lived a life of relative prosperity.</v>

1361
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Now that fucked everybody lost everything.</v>

1362
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's fucked.</v>

1364
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.230

00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:02.010
<v Speaker 2>what does this bailout?</v>

1367
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:02.221
<v Speaker 2>What did,</v>

00:37:02.221 --> 00:37:02.750
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

1369
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.200
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

1370
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.450
<v Speaker 2>how did these people get money when,</v>

1371
00:37:05.451 --> 00:37:06.530
<v Speaker 2>when their banks failed,</v>

1372
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:06.711
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1373
00:37:06.711 --> 00:37:06.851
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1374
00:37:06.851 --> 00:37:07.161
<v Speaker 2>they will,</v>

1375
00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:07.411
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:09.320
<v Speaker 2>they have bonuses in their contract bonuses.</v>

1377
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.460
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck do you get a bonus when the bank feels like the idea that you have</v>

1378
00:37:13.461 --> 00:37:15.440
<v Speaker 2>to respect them and that they can't lose?</v>

1379
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.570
<v Speaker 2>That's just [inaudible].</v>

1380
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.640
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool.</v>

1381
00:37:17.641 --> 00:37:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Ropy the size,</v>

1382
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:19.910
<v Speaker 2>the bonuses,</v>

1383
00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.710
<v Speaker 2>millions and millions of dollars,</v>

1384
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>and this is from banks.</v>

1385
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.250
<v Speaker 2>What we would check to pay them.</v>

1386
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.010
<v Speaker 2>We gave them money and they're giving out money.</v>

1387
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:28.881
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>

1388
00:37:28.881 --> 00:37:30.580
<v Speaker 2>If your bank fucking failed,</v>

1389
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.300
<v Speaker 2>you can't get a bonus.</v>

1390
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't get a bonus.</v>

1391
00:37:33.291 --> 00:37:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly as big bank fucking failed.</v>

1392
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you take no pump personal responsibility?</v>

1393
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Like who takes responsibility?</v>

1394
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Somebody and it you shouldn't it be the guy that stands to make a bonus?</v>

1395
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.790
<v Speaker 2>If the bank does well,</v>

1396
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.740
<v Speaker 2>that should be the guy who takes personal responsibility.</v>

1397
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.360
<v Speaker 2>So when the bank fucking fails,</v>

1398
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.010
<v Speaker 2>you don't get your bonus comp face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's it.</v>

1400
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:50.630
<v Speaker 2>It's that simple.</v>

1401
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:50.941
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1402
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck he had the president say that is the studies like we're going to,</v>

1403

1404
00:37:54.521 --> 00:37:56.450

1405
00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:01.280
<v Speaker 2>half a million fucking dollars for a bonus when your bank fails,</v>

1406
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.880
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>

1408
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.230
<v Speaker 2>these cons costs so many fucking people.</v>

1409
00:38:09.231 --> 00:38:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Their life savings and they have to get their bonuses and the president was</v>

1410
00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:12.501
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1411
00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1412
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.730
<v Speaker 2>we have to give them to them.</v>

1413
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.530
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1414
00:38:15.531 --> 00:38:16.670
<v Speaker 2>You have to give it to them.</v>

1415
00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:17.840

1416
00:38:17.841 --> 00:38:18.920
<v Speaker 2>They'll cut the shit.</v>

1417
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.570

<v Speaker 2>You can't get $30 million after your fucking bank fails.</v>

1420
00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:24.591
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1421
00:38:24.591 --> 00:38:28.010
<v Speaker 2>In the middle of a crazy down to economy where billions of dollars from</v>

1422
00:38:28.011 --> 00:38:31.190
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers while he'd been funneled to fucking banks to keep them afloat.</v>

1460
00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>they're spending too much money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the same goddamn thing.</v>

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.610
<v Speaker 1>That was a great scene,</v>

1464
00:39:45.611 --> 00:39:46.210
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

1465
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.590
<v Speaker 1>When you realized the guy came in,</v>

1466
00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 1>his wife had a fucking beautiful fur coat on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1468
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:51.571
<v Speaker 1>And then they did.</v>

1469
00:39:51.571 --> 00:39:53.130
<v Speaker 1>They know they have to kill this guy and then the,</v>

1470
00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:55.330
<v Speaker 1>it's photos of him and his wife shot in the car.</v>

1471

1473
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.480
<v Speaker 1>But you got to think of that whole scene that Barbara had a knife to stab this</v>

1474
00:40:07.481 --> 00:40:08.314
<v Speaker 1>guy in the car.</v>

1475
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Me One while they're eating the guys in the trunk of the fucking car and</v>

1476
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:11.810
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everything about it,</v>

1489
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.300

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1538
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They just pass out from the [inaudible] side.</v>

1539
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:16.311
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

1540
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:17.144

<v Speaker 1>Great fucking movie,</v>

1545
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.040

<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1547
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.910
<v Speaker 1>When he uses the car and he thought it was over it.</v>

1548
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:31.940
<v Speaker 1>He's getting rid of guns,</v>

1549
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:32.211
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1552
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:37.280
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what it is to get coked up in this little room and look out</v>

1553
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 1>that window by the blonde.</v>

1554
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.830

<v Speaker 1>what do you call those things?</v>

1557
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:44.264
<v Speaker 1>A fire hydrant,</v>

1558
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.630
<v Speaker 2>but in your mind it becomes a dog.</v>

1559
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if you've got like Osama bin Ladin coked up.</v>

1560
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if you've got someone,</v>

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:47.470
<v Speaker 2>They'd go for fucking throw down,</v>

1706
00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:48.573
<v Speaker 2>pull your tongue out.</v>

1707
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.240
<v Speaker 2>They wanted,</v>

1708
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.710
<v Speaker 2>they wanted an intimidation at the maximum under the fucking savages,</v>

1709
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.300
<v Speaker 2>and that's right next door to us,</v>

1710
00:46:55.301 --> 00:46:55.830
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

1711
00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:56.200
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1712
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.870
<v Speaker 2>that's just like what's going on in Mexico that's happening right now.</v>

1713
00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.561
<v Speaker 2>But in a bigger,</v>

1714
00:46:59.561 --> 00:47:00.790
<v Speaker 2>even bigger scale,</v>

1715
00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:01.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1716
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:02.170
<v Speaker 2>because the Colombians,</v>

1717
00:47:02.171 --> 00:47:04.930
<v Speaker 2>even though they had like they were selling drugs and they were bringing drugs</v>

1718
00:47:04.931 --> 00:47:07.720
<v Speaker 2>and they weren't getting that much resistance from their government.</v>

1719
00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:08.481
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1720
00:47:08.481 --> 00:47:09.400
<v Speaker 2>There's Kinda correct.</v>

1721
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 2>It was part of their,</v>

1722
00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:10.791
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1723
00:47:10.791 --> 00:47:10.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1724
00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.711
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of corrupt.</v>

1725
00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:13.780
<v Speaker 2>But in Mexico it's not the same man.</v>

1726
00:47:13.781 --> 00:47:14.201
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>

1727
00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:15.400
<v Speaker 2>they get a lot of resistance,</v>

1728
00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:16.311
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1729
00:47:16.311 --> 00:47:17.144
<v Speaker 2>Still was doing it.</v>

1730
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:17.831
<v Speaker 2>They're still doing it.</v>

1731
00:47:17.831 --> 00:47:21.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's scarier because it's more like it's more militaristic,</v>

1732
00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:22.204
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1733
00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.410
<v Speaker 1>action in Spanish.</v>

1734
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.850
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] below more or Blanca.</v>

1736
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a silver fish.</v>

1737
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a finished from the rubber guard.</v>

1738
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 1>The Lomo or blind log this call,</v>

1739
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 1>either bullets or money.</v>

1740
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Which one do they just show up and which ones?</v>

1741
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:41.014
<v Speaker 1>Bullets.</v>

1742
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 1>A global plumber is bullets.</v>

1743
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1744
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Blanca is a lot of times cash.</v>

1745
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.360
<v Speaker 1>So plot that they just show up at your house,</v>

1746

<v Speaker 1>but a gun down when an envelope,</v>

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 1>a little more block that she would get a new rap song</v>

1748
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 1>and your bitch,</v>

1749
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:55.960
