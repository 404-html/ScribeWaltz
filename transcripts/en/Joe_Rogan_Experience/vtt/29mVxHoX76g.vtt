37
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.920

<v Speaker 1>that was one of my favorite examples of</v>

56
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 1>a show that could have been a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny show written by really funny guys</v>

57
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 1>and the network's juice all over it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Even filming anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was still,</v>

<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.300
<v Speaker 2>He had his shirt Kinda Kreidie shirt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was enough.</v>

84
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.310

<v Speaker 2>You started poking questions for him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You were like asking is teligent you</v>

88
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 2>we'll get you into karate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would go something like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the martial arts.</v>

90
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 2>And then you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

91
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>you should take this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think karate guy would win it.</v>

93
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 2>And then I saw you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking crush it.</v>

95
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 2>But the point of that conversation was I</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't,</v>

96
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I just never saw anyone like you and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

97
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like a fucking that moment we go,</v>

98
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 2>the sky is so he's an he didn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were fearless.</v>

99
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen anyone so fearless in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and I've always looked up to you</v>

100
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.740
<v Speaker 2>for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bag.</v>

101
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I definitely never been fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a feel of the person just took</v>

102
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

103
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.154
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

104
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.193
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

105
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.633
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

106
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've never been fearless.</v>

107
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is how you,</v>

108
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you respond to it.</v>

109
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 2>It's how you respond to fear whether or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you're scared of some of the</v>

110
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people shy away from the unknown,</v>

111
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.633
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

112
00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

113
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 2>That is very true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to get honest because</v>

114
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's a lot of deeper</v>
<v Speaker 2>factors in is a lot of eyes on you.</v>

115
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't think your kids are eyes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>on you,</v>

116
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you to expose him to stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a little like,</v>

117
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a feared to be,</v>

118
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I fear being aleut too honest at times.</v>

<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

152

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

153
00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 2>So we would go in the basement and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn on and bornite when I heard,</v>

154
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.890

<v Speaker 2>and I dunno if that's another weird part</v>

159
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.140
<v Speaker 1>for a young guy that's the music that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of represents your hormones.</v>

160
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

173
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:38.310
<v Speaker 2>But I fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my biggest fear as a dad getting</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that everybody faces when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>

178
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

179
00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>and also biologically everybody faces it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like with pills.</v>

180
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I know so many people that have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to pills.</v>

181
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an epidemic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>all the people that I've been close</v>

184

187
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a dozen have been hooked on pills</v>

188
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>and I know three people that have died</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

189
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

191
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.600
<v Speaker 1>kids did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't happen.</v>

192
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.600
<v Speaker 1>They didn't exist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would hear like,</v>

193
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:25.390
<v Speaker 1>some people get in like vicodins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that,</v>

194
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.050
<v Speaker 1>but those were always like crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think kind of though</v>

195
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

199
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:36.591
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

200

201
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they're prescribed,</v>

202
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.450
<v Speaker 2>does it seem as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

203
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 2>they figured out how to legalize really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad trucks down?</v>

204
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely did.</v>

205
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.360
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a build trust does more</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we'll wear these white lab coats</v>

206
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 2>and we had to tell them and we write out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little card and just take three of</v>

207
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.634
<v Speaker 2>these a week</v>

208
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and be able to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another suppressed guy.</v>

209
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>But that guy listened to some death</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal from feminine,</v>

210
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get this fucking car after</v>

211
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>selling heroin all day with a lab coat</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

212
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>that's a dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article about this one.</v>

213
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article about this one</v>

214
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:24.830
<v Speaker 1>family that has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

215
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>has like a giant steak in that market</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've made billions and billions</v>

216
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>of dollars and it was breaking down like</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money they made and how many</v>

217
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>people are hooked on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many prescriptions there are.</v>

218
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're drug dealers like the legalized.</v>

219
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Well if you looked at this in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

220
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>like when they look back and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

221
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 1>remember those opium dens and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboys had remembered from Wyatt earp,</v>

222
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 1>was it wider wild bill Hickok one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them fucking movies.</v>

223
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>They went to the opium den that Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>people got them all fucked up on opium</v>

224
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 1>and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

225
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>those are dark times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way worse than that.</v>

226
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's happening underneath our noses.</v>

227
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.853
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you see?</v>

228
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>How do you stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

229
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can talk about it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

230
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I think you've talked about enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even brought up to people and it's,</v>

231
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.080
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of the old again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You face it.</v>

232
00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 1>What do you do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about it forever,</v>

233
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 1>but what do you actually do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teachers just talk about it and let</v>

234
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>people live seep into people and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>think he's telling the truth or you</v>

235
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>think they know what they're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

236
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 1>That why things decide for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>

237
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that you're going to let your</v>

238
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 1>kid figure out for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like depriving them of</v>

239
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

240
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.260
<v Speaker 1>So I think what you gotta do is be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really honest about it.</v>

241
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And I'm with my oldest daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young girls don't know that I smoked</v>

242
00:10:45.281 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 1>the weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just had conversations about it.</v>

243
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

244
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 1>there are some things that are dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are some things that are just</v>

245
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 1>not dangerous at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pod is the one that's not dangerous</v>

246
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:56.600
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>

247
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.660
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I had a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>her about it and you know,</v>

248
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird sort of a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're,</v>

249
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to someone who on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>verge of being an adult,</v>

250
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of bullshitting them</v>

251
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>still but not really course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if they were an adult you'd be</v>

252
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look Pot's not hurting anybody.</v>

253
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I smoked pot before I go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

254
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody would laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hahaha.</v>

255
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from here on,</v>

256
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I like it right before her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

257
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have these little conversations with</v>

258
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>people with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with adults,</v>

259
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 1>but when the kid that about th that come</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and don't,</v>

260
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:26.883
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell him.</v>

261
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to keep somehow or another this</v>

262
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>innocuous thing from the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile you'll sip a glass of wine</v>

263
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.280
<v Speaker 1>in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink a glass of wine from my kids</v>

264
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:37.110
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've let them try wine.</v>

265
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I've let him try a sip of wine and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gas tank and then it becomes a</v>

266
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>funny thing they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that time I tried to wine?</v>

267
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So grabs.</v>

268
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.910
<v Speaker 1>But it's socially accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 1>To let them taste how disgusting adults</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasting beverages are.</v>

270
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but smoking pot in</v>

271
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 2>front of them or around them would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific.</v>

272
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It's so foolish sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

273
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Did you know anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I knew a kid and he was up</v>

274
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:08.150
<v Speaker 2>the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he smoked pot when his parents and</v>

275
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 2>his salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go in there and smoke pot</v>

276
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 2>when the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my initial,</v>

277
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.773
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

278
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 2>my instinct was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

279
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.160
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>

280
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I can't hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

281
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

282
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

283
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:25.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

284
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 2>if having a drink with your dad's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>

285
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 2>how come you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a beer with your dad is not</v>

286
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you for instance.</v>

287
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

288
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 2>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

289
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 2>he never drank with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never said,</v>

290
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else would say,</v>

291
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 2>sky's fucking like brewers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dead.</v>

292
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 2>This guy's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my father's nuts.</v>

293
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that side of him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not until it was my 21st birthday.</v>

294
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Like I just knew him as his fucking Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

295
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 2>World War Two vet and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serious guy.</v>

296
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Very serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never left.</v>

297
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:05.281
<v Speaker 2>And I think he left twice the filthy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny and his laugh was just like,</v>

298
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was killing him that you fucking</v>

299
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.120
<v Speaker 2>corona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

300
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

301
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:18.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 21,</v>

302
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go have a beer.</v>

303
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:24.890
<v Speaker 2>You're a man now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went to his place,</v>

304
00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:29.891
<v Speaker 2>swamp water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>als when I was in Florida and one out</v>

305
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 2>and have a couple of beers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying some ca he doesn't talk,</v>

306
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 2>he'll say stupid jokes and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand.</v>

307
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go outside,</v>

308
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:45.391
<v Speaker 2>catch a buzz and we got this will help</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking night I come back and catch</v>

309
00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 2>a buzz means smoke a little weed.</v>

310
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come back in.</v>

311
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

312
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a crowd around him and I swear</v>
<v Speaker 2>to God because he was older,</v>

313
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I thought he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was down.</v>

314
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was looking at the old man up</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

315
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Go there and he's fucking holding court</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the whole bar and he's,</v>

316
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 2>he's killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's destroying.</v>

317
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>And so then I turned around like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is this fucking guy?</v>

318
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to hire him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking hilarious.</v>

319
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 2>And I just couldn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw this man.</v>

320
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.590
<v Speaker 2>So I had a beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a beer,</v>

321
00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 2>we caught buses and we had the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw,</v>

322
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 2>my father was funny and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

323
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 2>why didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you show me this side</v>

324
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:28.210
<v Speaker 2>earlier?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hear this from all my friends.</v>

325
00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't fucking ready.</v>

326
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:40.350
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I kind of feel that way with certain</v>

327
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:41.650
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

328
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 2>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fucker,</v>

329
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 2>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say,</v>

330
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this kid,</v>

331
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.220
<v Speaker 2>you know what if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they go in that direction,</v>

332
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I think they'll be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>

333
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much donut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this one against stop.</v>

334
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do have different personalities</v>

335
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:02.534
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

336
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've seen like,</v>

337
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a,</v>

338
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna let you out of the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't listen.</v>

339
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't go pass f fucking tree during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>

340
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Walker went nowhere did I not say don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into fuck it.</v>

341
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 1>He's in the woods and then they come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

342
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

343
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fear this one's going to go some kids</v>

344
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 1>freedom is super intoxicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to wonder what it is.</v>

345
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it anything that we set up in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids when they were young?</v>

346
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Did we suppress him too much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they just had this intense desire</v>

347
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:39.680
<v Speaker 1>to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think there's something to that.</v>

348
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this desire to protect someone.</v>

349
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>It kind of backfires when you're raising</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids in some ways because if you try to</v>

350
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:48.750
<v Speaker 1>protect him too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they,</v>

351
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.090
<v Speaker 1>they resent you.</v>

352
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pushed back the other way.</v>

353
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.860

<v Speaker 1>really strict parents when it comes to</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was getting visual flashbacks of where</v>

404
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 4>it really started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My sister,</v>

405
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I remember my sister got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh right.</v>

408
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 4>So I just remember mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mom getting those phone calls and</v>

<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

412
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 4>so I remember going there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd go in the middle of night,</v>

413
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:34.740

<v Speaker 4>she'd be bruised.</v>

414

<v Speaker 4>You could tell she was hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is already,</v>

417
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 4>you witnessed the violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

418
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:51.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the fucker came at the house,</v>

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.320
<v Speaker 4>And my dad was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>be a man.</v>

422
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.480

<v Speaker 4>your dad,</v>

425
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.550
<v Speaker 4>and he's trying to get out in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

426
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.810
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

428
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.470

<v Speaker 4>and then I,</v>

429
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.350
<v Speaker 4>that's how I discovered fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>metallica.</v>

431
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.040

<v Speaker 4>that aggression.</v>

432
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:24.930
<v Speaker 4>I needed something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would go in my basement tear shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

436
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:41.700
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a lot of internal</v>
<v Speaker 4>arguments like I should have said I</v>

437
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:45.000
<v Speaker 4>would have is I should have said they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would go on for hours.</v>

438
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in my fucking car and traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo You,</v>

439
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.200
<v Speaker 4>if you fucking thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this word,</v>

440
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.240
<v Speaker 4>you know like you don't come come up</v>
<v Speaker 4>with some better thing that you could</v>

441
00:19:52.241 --> 00:19:56.130
<v Speaker 4>have said or some some slicker thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you could have said.</v>

442
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 4>Well I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still do that though.</v>

443
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:01.560
<v Speaker 4>You still gave up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forced it out.</v>

444
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.790
<v Speaker 4>We'd it like it's a weed in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

445
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.270
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it for a good half hour bathroom</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the road.</v>

446
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try not to man.</v>

447
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 4>I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to,</v>

448
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:17.810
<v Speaker 4>as much as I can focus my thoughts on</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are actually beneficial to</v>

449
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if it's something like that</v>

450
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:21.540
<v Speaker 4>where I know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what it is,</v>

451
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.480
<v Speaker 4>so I ran into some fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what it is.</v>

452
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to dwell on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

453
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.560
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just I'm going to move by instead of</v>

454
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 4>like making that a part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to anybody's goofy behavior</v>

455
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 4>to be a part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so exhausting.</v>

456
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 4>It's exhausting and it's not necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could figure out a way.</v>

457
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 4>It's an exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy to do,</v>

458
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.810
<v Speaker 4>but when you get frustrated by someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to learn how to just concentrate</v>

459
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 4>and things that you want to concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just don't let the other</v>

460
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>things in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after a while you get stronger</v>

461
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a weight or it's like a</v>

462
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather you lift weights with it,</v>

463
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it gets stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like putting your intention on things</v>

464
00:20:57.881 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 1>that you actually enjoy instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>festering on some fucking stupid</v>

465
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 1>argument you might've had with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend two months ago or with your</v>

466
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:09.100
<v Speaker 1>boss last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or retard in twitter or someone on</v>

467
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:09.761
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

468
00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Or someone you ran into the gas station</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said something fucking stupid you</v>

469
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:15.460
<v Speaker 1>for no reason and you said I should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking smack that guy.</v>

470
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just</v>

471
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.480
<v Speaker 1>close it up because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

472
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

473
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 1>She can't let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't let those things grow.</v>

474
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you feed them,</v>

475
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 1>they grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do grow and then it goes easier for</v>

476
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 1>them to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they've set the fucking</v>

477
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:36.514
<v Speaker 1>seeds.</v>

478
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.210
<v Speaker 1>A matrix of seeds in your head or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other retarded thought would just</v>

479
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 1>fucking sprout wings and fly away real</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick and don't let them.</v>

480
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 1>It happens to most to when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're growing like as a person</v>

481
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.600
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I think I'm growing like,</v>

482
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm expanding in life to bring him down.</v>

483
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Show him his weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Say he can handle twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to me.</v>

485
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a fucking tweet from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who this person is.</v>

486
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who this person is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can hear it.</v>

487
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.650
<v Speaker 1>It took me a little while to get over</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

488
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

489
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to blame them and I still make</v>

490
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:15.340
<v Speaker 1>fun of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a t,</v>

491
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:20.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is that is too weird and tiered</v>

492
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's never been,</v>

493
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 1>it's never existed before.</v>

494
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 1>There's never been this ability with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous name to just be shitty to</v>

495
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:32.050
<v Speaker 1>someone or just communicate with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even have any kind of contact with</v>

496
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:34.510
<v Speaker 1>someone positive or negative because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's a lot of people out there</v>

497
00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 1>that are addicted to the positive too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like girls,</v>

498
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 1>girls on instagram that had taken yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>booty pictures and by the way,</v>

499
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.240
<v Speaker 1>don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying stop.</v>

500
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden.</v>

501
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Just balance it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those pictures are wonderful.</v>

502
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Keep them common girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying don't,</v>

503
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:52.150
<v Speaker 1>don't take pictures of your well</v>
<v Speaker 1>sculpted,</v>

504
00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but you should enjoy the praise that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get from your Labor in the gym.</v>

505
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think definitely people they get</v>

506
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 1>that becomes addictive to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start gravitating towards it.</v>

507
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Of course they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like war of the,</v>

508
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a war of the mines.</v>

509
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Mines all coupon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 to fourth episode conspiracy.</v>

510
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what a conspiracy.</v>

511
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if they'd created twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they knew.</v>

512
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:17.741
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

513
00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 1>we have to figure out where to control</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the age of information.</v>

514
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

515
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Let them just communicate with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other freely.</v>

516
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.750
<v Speaker 1>They'll start so much conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be able to deal with us</v>

517
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.390
<v Speaker 1>taking over the world every time they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get along.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just tear the pot just a little bit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everything's always going to be chaos.</v>

521

<v Speaker 1>Show them someone getting beaten by an</v>
<v Speaker 1>office out immediately and you have that</v>

<v Speaker 4>them upset that me nothing.</v>

526
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.660

529
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.430

<v Speaker 4>We need more restricted words.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but pushing too hard.</v>

<v Speaker 4>because we all know everybody talks</v>

539
00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:38.990
<v Speaker 4>about that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

540
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:41.310
<v Speaker 4>We can never resolve gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need it.</v>

541
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not peace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We must move it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>social construct.</v>

545
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a little kid,</v>

546
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.230
<v Speaker 1>we argued about gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I moved from San Francisco to</v>

547
00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was probably like,</v>

548
00:25:00.971 --> 00:25:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I think I was 11 years old and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that was a big thing that</v>

549
00:25:04.901 --> 00:25:06.490
<v Speaker 1>people were upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to make gay marriage</v>

550
00:25:06.491 --> 00:25:09.190
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was like 1970 something.</v>

551
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Speaker 1>There's still arguing about it.</v>

552
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.360
<v Speaker 4>It's the same cycles every and nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody,</v>

553
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.480

<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

554

<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the debates.</v>

<v Speaker 4>gay marriage,</v>

558
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.670

<v Speaker 1>portion stick.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tissue at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>them out of there?</v>

<v Speaker 1>People feel so good that nobody wants to</v>

573
00:26:06.071 --> 00:26:07.900
<v Speaker 1>have this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's like,</v>

574
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.310
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just keep it around.</v>

575
00:26:09.311 --> 00:26:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Just keep it around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop describing it and the uncomfortable</v>

576
00:26:13.361 --> 00:26:15.910
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like I'm describing it.</v>

577
00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:20.911
<v Speaker 1>It is like fucking mellow and bland and</v>
<v Speaker 1>factual way as possible and it's</v>

578
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:22.960
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

579
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.130
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck like what abortion actually is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that you shouldn't be</v>

580
00:26:27.131 --> 00:26:29.170
<v Speaker 1>able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hundred percent pro choice.</v>

581
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100% a woman has a right to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever she wants with her body and I</v>

582
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.720
<v Speaker 1>definitely don't think a man should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to tell you what to do with your</v>

583
00:26:34.721 --> 00:26:37.540
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% but the end of the day,</v>

584
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a little baby and you're using a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacuum to suck it out of your body.</v>

585
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Like it's odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

586
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's not odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a judgment because I agree</v>

587
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he should be able to do it.</v>

588
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 1>But isn't there an up to a point because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

589
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:54.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like three cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was enough cells to fit on the</v>

590
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 1>very tip of a pin and it just gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked out of the vacuum.</v>

591
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really see the issue.</v>

592
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

593
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're like a tribal guy in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woods,</v>

594
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.460
<v Speaker 2>are guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the girl pregnant,</v>

595
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:12.710
<v Speaker 2>they realize we're not going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fucking before this one and you're</v>

596
00:27:12.711 --> 00:27:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Charlie's wife or boot booze wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to get rid of.</v>

597
00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:19.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell me they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not eating berries or</v>

598
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.640
<v Speaker 1>fucking running hard into a tray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I mean like I have a abortion</v>

599
00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:34.270
<v Speaker 1>stomped at this angle and this is where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run.</v>

600
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.690
<v Speaker 1>If the calming your body and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to baby,</v>

601
00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:46.420
<v Speaker 1>you run towards the abortion had dumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking take one right in the gut.</v>

602
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like a perfectly shaped tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

603
00:27:52.341 --> 00:27:52.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

604
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Somebody must've figured out somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the line there's gotta be a way to</v>

605
00:27:55.371 --> 00:27:58.460
<v Speaker 1>stop this fucking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is</v>

606
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 2>you're a sex edge that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had that as sex education in fifth</v>

607
00:28:06.521 --> 00:28:08.530
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've thought everything a lot</v>

608
00:28:08.531 --> 00:28:09.520
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My head,</v>

609
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.280
<v Speaker 2>you come in and describe it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

610
00:28:12.281 --> 00:28:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I know you guys getting into it and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

611
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.710
<v Speaker 2>these are the risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said everything you just said</v>

612
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.330
<v Speaker 1>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have changed my whole</v>

613
00:28:22.331 --> 00:28:25.000
<v Speaker 1>perspective on moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

614
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you know the egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the egg shoots into this.</v>

615
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what they teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the teaching nonsense coming and</v>

616
00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 1>people feels awesome and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that nature.</v>

617
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to get you to make more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because nature is still the same</v>

618
00:28:37.871 --> 00:28:41.290
<v Speaker 1>setup that was around when we died real</v>
<v Speaker 1>young when there wasn't that many of us.</v>

619
00:28:41.291 --> 00:28:43.120
<v Speaker 1>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could wipe out some,</v>

620
00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:45.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were shitting in the street so people</v>

621
00:28:45.461 --> 00:28:47.740
<v Speaker 1>were getting plague and how they'd have</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>

622
00:28:47.741 --> 00:28:52.741
<v Speaker 1>they would carry these diseases and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleas and not deaf.</v>

623
00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Fought like a gene off from tossing her</v>
<v Speaker 1>own feces.</v>

624
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.670
<v Speaker 1>A gene off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

625
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do we have to come a lot?</v>

626
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I've got to make a lot of people just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the fucking party rolling.</v>

627
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on today when you're seeing</v>

628
00:29:07.541 --> 00:29:10.870
<v Speaker 1>people become more of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of men are gravitating towards</v>

629
00:29:10.871 --> 00:29:12.070
<v Speaker 1>being more feminine.</v>

630
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear the phrases like toxic</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity,</v>

631
00:29:15.851 --> 00:29:18.490
<v Speaker 1>like phrases that we never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were young that almost like</v>

632
00:29:18.491 --> 00:29:22.660
<v Speaker 1>denigrates the concept of masculinity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some sort of a weird abstract way.</v>

633
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.940
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's because we realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

634
00:29:24.941 --> 00:29:28.360
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to fuck as much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to go to war as much</v>

635
00:29:28.361 --> 00:29:29.320
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

636
00:29:29.321 --> 00:29:31.600
<v Speaker 1>like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're progressing into some sort of a</v>

637
00:29:31.601 --> 00:29:35.350
<v Speaker 1>digital universe that we're moving into</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not going her car,</v>

638
00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:38.200
<v Speaker 1>so much chimp meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:29:38.201 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>so much chaos in blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I as a culture,</v>

640
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 1>people were sort of moving away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when something like the UFC</v>

641
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 1>comes around or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or heavy metal or something,</v>

642
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:53.941
<v Speaker 1>like something just openly aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like guys like you or I will go,</v>

643
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:59.671
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me be me.</v>

644
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Then me being me.</v>

645
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've trying to drag me to the future.</v>

646
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 1>That should be politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be,</v>

647
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I would see that as politics one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy who was in the room,</v>

648
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 1>you want to be the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess he's in the ring summit.</v>

649
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.850
<v Speaker 1>There was a fucking photo that I took</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of a twitter today.</v>

650
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I think somebody put it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out who put it up.</v>

651
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a,</v>

652
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.680
<v Speaker 1>just a little sign that was outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>someplace in Texas that said,</v>

653
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having a president,</v>

654
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.930
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just all agree really hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be cool.</v>

655
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I saw that.</v>

656
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:40.981
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

657
00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:44.500
<v Speaker 1>That's so that's so fucking simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that going to be what it is</v>

658
00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 1>one day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like isn't it kind of moving into that</v>

659
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>sort of a direction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what going to be one day?</v>

660
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just everybody be cool.</v>

661
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's we're,</v>

662
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:57.900
<v Speaker 1>we're moving away from all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

663
00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.940
<v Speaker 1>the weird base physical needs that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly have to feed.</v>

664
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving away from those.</v>

665
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think whoever is aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that anticipates that</v>

666
00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 1>and they're already counteract during</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean though?</v>

667
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Like the powers that be the pal is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>became the the evil cabal</v>

668
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.920
<v Speaker 1>and an old room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what I mean?</v>

669
00:31:26.921 --> 00:31:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leather bound books in the wall.</v>

670
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 1>If you have a leather bound book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an asshole.</v>

671
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're one of those guys with a</v>

672
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:37.660
<v Speaker 1>bunch of books behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polish tradition in gold,</v>

673
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Speaker 1>fleeting pleading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can manipulate it</v>

674
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>nearly as much as we think they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they definitely manipulate the</v>

675
00:31:45.701 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 1>things they can and I think this world</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gotten so out of hand that it's on</v>

676
00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's working on some kind of crazy</v>

677
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:57.570
<v Speaker 1>instinctual momentum towards progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those old dudes for sure killed</v>

678
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the arguments for,</v>

679
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the arguments against somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed Kennedy and it wasn't just Lee</v>

680
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Oswald to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got this either or thing.</v>

681
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 1>You know [inaudible] Harvey Oswald acted</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone?</v>

682
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's definitely was in on it</v>

683
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a gang of people in on</v>

684
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:18.880
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was one of the people that</v>

685
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 1>was in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's highly likely that Lee Harvey</v>

686
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Oswald was out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy asshole working for the government</v>

687
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.250
<v Speaker 1>doing some weird shit and Russia comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>back over here.</v>

688
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Mary's a Russian lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of wackiness to it,</v>

689
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:35.960
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

690
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 1>good opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just rambling,</v>

691
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 1>but what is all that</v>

692
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 4>that that was back in the 60s that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is all that manipulation.</v>

693
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to [inaudible] and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were trying to figure out how to retain</v>

694
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:50.460
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy wanted to break up better</v>

695
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.530
<v Speaker 4>reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

696
00:32:51.531 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

697
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to get rid of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to get rid of the NSA.</v>

698
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to get rid of a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>agencies.</v>

699
00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Do the CIA or the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those.</v>

700
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to get rid of the Internal</v>

701
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.030
<v Speaker 4>Revenue Service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to get rid of the federal</v>

702
00:33:05.031 --> 00:33:08.090
<v Speaker 4>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Kennedy had some radical ideas.</v>

703
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to change a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the way the world was.</v>

704
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 4>And he also wanted posting and and mass.</v>

706
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.150
<v Speaker 4>But then the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the famous one he did.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but did you ever hear the whole speech?</v>

<v Speaker 4>What you're saying he was a bad mother</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>about secret societies?</v>

716
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Chuck Barris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

741
00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:47.330
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

742
00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 4>like a fake movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but pretending that he was at a hitman</v>

743
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.373
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

744
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.910

<v Speaker 4>It's one of those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

746
00:34:56.121 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 4>I would get exhausted with this talk is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be really,</v>

747
00:34:58.611 --> 00:35:02.450
<v Speaker 4>really</v>
<v Speaker 4>paranoid.</v>

748
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's listen to the heroin.</v>

749
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 4>I just did you go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do about all that?</v>

750
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>longer speech.</v>

751
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.831
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

752
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 4>The shorter version won't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

753
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 4>It's exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

754
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 4>This'll get off the shit out of you.</v>

755
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:21.270
<v Speaker 5>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the very word secrecy is repugnant in a</v>

756
00:35:21.461 --> 00:35:26.461
<v Speaker 5>free and open society and we are as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>people inherently and historically</v>

757
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.300
<v Speaker 5>opposed to secret societies to secret</v>
<v Speaker 5>oaths and a secret proceedings.</v>

758
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 5>We decided long ago that the dangers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excessive and unwarranted concealment of</v>

759
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:45.321
<v Speaker 5>pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are cited to justify it.</v>

760
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 5>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is little value in opposing the</v>

761
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 5>threat of a closed society by imitating</v>
<v Speaker 5>its arbitrary restrictions.</v>

762
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 5>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is little value in ensuring the</v>

763
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:04.521
<v Speaker 5>survival of our nation if our traditions</v>
<v Speaker 5>do not survive with it and there is very</v>

764
00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:10.911
<v Speaker 5>grave danger that an announced need for</v>
<v Speaker 5>increased security will be seized upon</v>

765
00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:17.511
<v Speaker 5>by those anxious to expand its meaning</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the very limits of official census</v>

766
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:22.690
<v Speaker 5>ship and concealment that I do not</v>
<v Speaker 5>intend to permit to the extent that it's</v>

767
00:36:22.921 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 5>in my control and no official of my</v>
<v Speaker 5>administration,</v>

768
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.940
<v Speaker 5>whether his rank is high or low,</v>
<v Speaker 5>civilian or military should interpret my</v>

769
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:32.580
<v Speaker 5>words.</v>

770
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 5>He had a night as an excuse to sense of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the news,</v>

771
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.360
<v Speaker 5>to stifle dissent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to cover up our mistakes or to withhold</v>

772
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:46.491
<v Speaker 5>from the press and the public the facts</v>
<v Speaker 5>they deserve to know for we are opposed</v>

773
00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:52.371
<v Speaker 5>around the world by a monolithic and</v>
<v Speaker 5>ruthless conspiracy that relies</v>

774
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:58.191
<v Speaker 5>primarily on Kubot means for expanding</v>
<v Speaker 5>its sphere of influence on infiltration</v>

775
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:05.030
<v Speaker 5>instead of invasion on severity one</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of elections on intimidation</v>

776
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:11.690
<v Speaker 5>instead of free choice on guerrillas by</v>
<v Speaker 5>night instead of armies by day.</v>

777
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:17.900
<v Speaker 5>It is a system which has conscripted</v>
<v Speaker 5>vast human and material resources into</v>

778
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:24.111
<v Speaker 5>the building of a tightly knit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>highly efficient machine that combines</v>

779
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 5>military,</v>
<v Speaker 5>diplomatic intelligence,</v>

780
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.370
<v Speaker 5>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific</v>

781
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.250
<v Speaker 4>and politically was about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>

782
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.820
<v Speaker 4>We could just listen to that whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>speech and just bail on this podcast.</v>

783
00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:39.850
<v Speaker 4>But</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does everyone give the trophy to?</v>

784
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:45.010
<v Speaker 4>What does it say on every poster?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does he most famous for?</v>

785
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.120
<v Speaker 4>Not that's all they took was that last</v>
<v Speaker 4>end of the speech.</v>

786
00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:54.530
<v Speaker 4>You said ask not what your country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't who remain,</v>

787
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.400
<v Speaker 4>who that all should have been on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that is also a part of the same</v>

788
00:37:58.401 --> 00:38:02.290
<v Speaker 4>speech is that same spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same garden</v>

789
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.450
<v Speaker 4>that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to act like I'm a</v>

790
00:38:05.451 --> 00:38:08.450
<v Speaker 4>historian here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is the same guy who said that and you</v>

791
00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:09.980
<v Speaker 4>never hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spend some shows here.</v>

792
00:38:09.981 --> 00:38:12.190
<v Speaker 4>The other part can be never heard that</v>
<v Speaker 4>said that.</v>

793
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.110
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the sickest speech I've ever</v>

794
00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:18.080
<v Speaker 4>heard by any president ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then again,</v>

795
00:38:18.081 --> 00:38:19.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't listen to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a two minutes in,</v>

796
00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:22.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's hard to listen to them because</v>

797
00:38:22.851 --> 00:38:24.560
<v Speaker 4>you know it's horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horse shit.</v>

798
00:38:24.561 --> 00:38:27.770
<v Speaker 4>And they all talk like presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

799
00:38:27.771 --> 00:38:31.280
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't just talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll talk to you in this.</v>

800
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a pattern there.</v>

801
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 4>They're locked into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't read</v>

802
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:41.730
<v Speaker 1>when someone talks to you as if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person in the audience.</v>

803
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a pattern and the way he's</v>

804
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:48.280
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't reveal much about their</v>

805
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:50.950
<v Speaker 1>actual motions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put on a mask you put on,</v>

806
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.080
<v Speaker 1>when you do a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pelt politician,</v>

807
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you're putting on a verbal mask and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowing people to see much</v>

808
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:00.370
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when we see a little bit,</v>

809
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you know like when Hillary Clinton's</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrieks and people like why,</v>

810
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 1>why is everybody concentrating on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're getting to see a little</v>

811
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 1>bit of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

812
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you see a little bit of her through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mask,</v>

813
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got this two inch thick political</v>

814
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:18.091
<v Speaker 1>mask that she's put coats of paint that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have now hit two inches thick from all</v>

815
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 1>the years of doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear a shriek,</v>

816
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than if you watch a</v>
<v Speaker 1>third grader and a play.</v>

817
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When those kids come out,</v>

818
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it's the same monotone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

819
00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't know their lives.</v>

820
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about their lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

821
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:40.240
<v Speaker 1>when I watched the politicians talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different or paint.</v>

822
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's more fucking painful to watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then my third graders,</v>

823
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 1>horrifying play every single year they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do well.</v>

824
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that bummed me</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the most about Obama.</v>

825
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 1>When I first saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was first in office,</v>

826
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.810
<v Speaker 1>when he was first running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

827
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:57.490
<v Speaker 1>this guy is going to be like a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy.</v>

828
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy's going to be like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who changes everything with the way</v>

829
00:40:02.411 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 1>he talks and the policies that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates.</v>

830
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:09.520
<v Speaker 1>He's a young articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's essentially close to our</v>

831
00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like three years older than us.</v>

832
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he grew up in our age,</v>

833
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 1>grew up in our era.</v>

834
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.440
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's putting that situation somewhere</v>

835
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:22.660
<v Speaker 1>along the line to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

836
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

837
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 1>You get to have a nice little run here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's some other rules you need to</v>

838
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 1>abide by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understand?</v>

839
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I can I say that with southern accent</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern as you know,</v>

840
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I pitch southern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

841
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:40.171
<v Speaker 1>it sounded scary but meaner and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>scares me more if a northerner gives me</v>

842
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.740
<v Speaker 1>a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

843
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:45.880
<v Speaker 1>for some reason southern or scares me</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cause I really,</v>

844
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:47.830
<v Speaker 1>it's more medicine that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

845
00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:49.870
<v Speaker 1>it was a burt reynolds movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

846
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>The fuck was that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the swamp as first movie</v>

847
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>deliverance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliverance squeal like a pig.</v>

848
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Remember that scary fuck traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was our,</v>

849
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.430
<v Speaker 1>when people grew up in the east coast or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in the northeast,</v>

850
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.520
<v Speaker 1>when you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard those movies,</v>

851
00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 1>you saw those movies around there.</v>

852
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 1>That was like our introduction to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary southern people.</v>

853
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think Obama,</v>

854
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>would you want Obama come on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was,</v>

855
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at the future.</v>

856
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was looking at someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to change everything.</v>

857
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

858
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.830
<v Speaker 1>here's this guy who's like everything we</v>
<v Speaker 1>always wanted.</v>

859
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 1>He was a Bush was like this guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost anti intellectual in a way.</v>

860
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like he would take these like</v>
<v Speaker 1>real shortcuts to the way he thought and</v>

861
00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:34.670
<v Speaker 1>the way he expressed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real obvious shortcuts.</v>

862
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't express himself in a way where</v>

863
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to get really intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to say,</v>

864
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is well thought out when he was</v>

865
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 1>doing was he was expressing himself in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way where he was trying to get like</v>

866
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:50.990
<v Speaker 1>really dumb people to think he's one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

867
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.000
<v Speaker 1>And there's two different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

868
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

869
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 1>there's someone like Obama when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>running for office.</v>

870
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a good,</v>

871
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 1>here's a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron Paul's great example,</v>

872
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron Paul is obviously very intelligent</v>

873
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.830
<v Speaker 1>and he speaks to both the intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and talk to the people that might</v>

874
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:12.980
<v Speaker 1>not understand all the concepts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's discussing when it comes to big</v>

875
00:42:12.981 --> 00:42:17.870
<v Speaker 1>government or intervention and foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy intervention intervening in a</v>

876
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 1>foreign countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he does it,</v>

877
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:25.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like very clear and concise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly well chosen words.</v>

878
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So Obama was that guy like to me it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Obama was like the opposite of the</v>

879
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 1>guy who was appealing to her dumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

880
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:34.731
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 1>he's appealing towards Obama was</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing towards youth and hope,</v>

882
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope and change was like the big part of</v>

883
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all these years later,</v>

884
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really changed that much joe?</v>

885
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Just think about this though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

886
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.040
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to that part.</v>

887
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you 1000%,</v>

888
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the realistic,</v>

889
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.100
<v Speaker 2>like a realistic view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

890
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Where you look at every great hero and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that fear of death.</v>

891
00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:04.664
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

892
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I like salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These concepts.</v>

893
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 2>You talking about the key kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice kids look real nice over there.</v>

894
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.840
<v Speaker 2>So he wanted to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

895
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you a little video of Mr</v>

896
00:43:18.591 --> 00:43:23.591
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy's last guy had that big dump</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking speech to remember John Lennon.</v>

897
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't he cute?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

898
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they killed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine all they send Dad Wacko.</v>

899
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking Wacko.</v>

900
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 2>She son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it more likely that people are</v>

901
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:38.900
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with John Lennon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because these ladies are amazing</v>

902
00:43:38.901 --> 00:43:41.090
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be like that little girl that got</v>

903
00:43:41.091 --> 00:43:43.190
<v Speaker 2>shot in Florida last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrifying.</v>

904
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that she was a part of</v>

905
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:45.644
<v Speaker 2>the Illuminati?</v>

906
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Was there like some sort of a plan to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop her and her,</v>

907
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.970
<v Speaker 2>her message of freedom or was it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy?</v>

908
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:52.530
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

909
00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't in love with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a young girl was the singer I went</v>

910
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 2>for what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

911
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 2>most likely it could be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

912
00:43:58.551 --> 00:44:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I know that a lot of crazy fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying I th I think everyone</v>

913
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:05.650
<v Speaker 2>wanted that from any politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

914
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 2>But the mid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that politician,</v>

915
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:08.230
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

916
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.960
<v Speaker 2>you can't denied it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first guy to actually has free reign</v>

917
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 2>and he faked everyone out and he got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

918
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.160
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be nearly impossible to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen if they shut off the phone,</v>

919
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.570
<v Speaker 2>if they shut all communication down</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now it's cause they don't like</v>

920
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:27.920
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

921
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Until you have that brutal honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine going to happen?</v>

922
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Hero man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd he gets out of office and tells</v>

923
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>everybody exact what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he say that when he was president?</v>

924
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Because it would kill us kids.</v>

925
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.833
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

926
00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's very sick.</v>

927
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.030
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>

928
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.980
<v Speaker 1>they're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're listening to everything we say.</v>

929
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.630
<v Speaker 1>The NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they recorded.</v>

930
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that really funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're blower watching me.</v>

931
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do different?</v>

932
00:44:55.711 --> 00:44:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Board watch me.</v>

933
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Here he goes again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another fucking speech.</v>

934
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:01.110
<v Speaker 1>She was 17 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This another thing,</v>

935
00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:04.440
<v Speaker 1>people think that there's this like</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic conspiracy to watch over</v>

936
00:45:04.441 --> 00:45:05.760
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to bring up the,</v>

937
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:07.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who broke into the White House.</v>

938
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:09.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story broke in the White House and</v>

939
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.200
<v Speaker 1>no guy broke in the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got arrested a couple months before.</v>

940
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only two people have ever broken</v>

941
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:16.740
<v Speaker 1>into why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember this one was from like</v>

942
00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 1>1912.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy broke in.</v>

943
00:45:18.871 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 1>They tackle them quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one was from a year and a half ago</v>

944
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and the guy who broke in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got arrested,</v>

945
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in an in September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got,</v>

946
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 1>he got pulled over in July with four</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifles,</v>

947
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.820
<v Speaker 1>two handguns and a fucking machete in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his car plus a map of Washington with an</v>

948
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 1>x where the fucking White House is.</v>

949
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So he gets pulled over with that two</v>
<v Speaker 1>months before he winds up breaking into</v>

950
00:45:46.681 --> 00:45:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how poorly they're watching</v>

951
00:45:50.401 --> 00:45:53.340
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea that there's this a bunch</v>

952
00:45:53.341 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 1>of evil geniuses that are watching 300</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people's every moves.</v>

953
00:45:56.761 --> 00:45:59.580
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't watch anything.</v>

954
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that are watching,</v>

955
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:04.200
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to go home.</v>

956
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy broke into the White House and</v>

957
00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ran across the lawn and the guy who</v>

958
00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:14.220
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to be watching the dogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>took his earpiece out cause he was</v>

959
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 1>talking to his girlfriend on cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

960
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.410
<v Speaker 1>He had a second radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep it back up.</v>

961
00:46:18.411 --> 00:46:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh he forgot that in his locker.</v>

962
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:23.010
<v Speaker 1>This is the kind of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarding the world.</v>

963
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:27.330
<v Speaker 1>So like this idea that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>these super geniuses that are in control</v>

964
00:46:27.331 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 1>of every move and they hired a hit man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hypnotized him.</v>

965
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Manchurian candidate style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No are you?</v>

966
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my girlfriend hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be to talk someone into killing</v>

967
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 1>someone for you and then getting shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killed himself or getting locked up</v>

968
00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:43.860
<v Speaker 1>in jail for the rest of her life to how</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hard.</v>

969
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:48.030
<v Speaker 1>That would be really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be almost impossible to count</v>

970
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 1>on that kind of pulling it off to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you would have to get someone</v>

971
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 1>who's probably never killed somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and that's going to be their</v>

972
00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Speaker 1>first killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go kill John Lennon and</v>

973
00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 1>then get locked up in jail for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the life.</v>

974
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You convince this guy's going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

975
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Like how are you going to get this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this?</v>

976
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are going to fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how we're all the fuck ups,</v>

977
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:05.941
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come,</v>

978
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:09.330
<v Speaker 1>how come a bunch of people haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and missed and not pulled it</v>

979
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:11.230
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're always successful because</v>

980
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>there are just fucking crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just fucking crazy people.</v>

981
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I agree for all those ones that we think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some grand conspiracy,</v>

982
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:23.280
<v Speaker 1>it's much more likely that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>retarded way more could be,</v>

983
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but there's a few fucking real ones like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Kennedy speech where he must,</v>

984
00:47:28.031 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 1>didn't know he was in deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must have known,</v>

985
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:35.340
<v Speaker 1>he knew about Scotland bones and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those crazy little fraternities and</v>

986
00:47:35.341 --> 00:47:39.370
<v Speaker 1>those guys belong to where they fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and take polaroids and</v>

987
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 1>blackmail each other for the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

988
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 1>If we don't go to war with Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain cache of photos won't be</v>

989
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 1>released to the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

990
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>

991
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It probably probably compromise them</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're young in some sort of a</v>

992
00:47:57.701 --> 00:48:02.701
<v Speaker 1>weird way and get them to do gay stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

993
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

994
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.070
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no clue if you're running,</v>

995
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she were funded like one of those</v>

996
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Yale clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

997
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:13.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to shut them all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he it,</v>

998
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

999
00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It get some gay porn on them,</v>

1000
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:18.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1001
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:23.851
<v Speaker 1>And it starts your religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 millimeter and some dark dungeon in</v>

1002
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>

1003
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:28.534
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie?</v>

1004
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 1>They got the fraternity logo on what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skull and bones logo look like?</v>

1005
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.910
<v Speaker 1>So fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something death metal,</v>

1006
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe even all the skull and bones shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out of the same pressure.</v>

1007
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think of it then all those</v>

1008
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich guys that are rich fucking dads who</v>

1009
00:48:49.001 --> 00:48:52.120
<v Speaker 1>aren't paying attention to them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to boarding schools it.</v>

1010
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

1011
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1012
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make a t shirt with that on it</v>

1013
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 1>with your name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would be so upset.</v>

1014
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.060
<v Speaker 1>So what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what this is.</v>

1015
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Is this cell phones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I butcher.</v>

1016
00:49:04.931 --> 00:49:06.970
<v Speaker 1>It would be here too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I butcher it too.</v>

1017
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fraternity or a group that,</v>

1018
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:11.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of former presidents belonged to.</v>

1019
00:49:11.561 --> 00:49:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Like John Kerry belonged to it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush and,</v>

1020
00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a Yale fraternity,</v>

1021
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:21.520
<v Speaker 1>like our club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A secret club of many,</v>

1022
00:49:21.521 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 1>many people who wind up being leaders in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free world.</v>

1023
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:25.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1024
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:27.280
<v Speaker 1>pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I stopped butchering it,</v>

1025
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>point to when they look at evidence.</v>

1026
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:35.710
<v Speaker 1>The 15 what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 15 most powerful what members of</v>

1027
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:38.200
<v Speaker 1>skull and bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most famous secret society and</v>

1028
00:49:38.201 --> 00:49:40.600
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skull and bones was cofounded Yale in</v>

1029
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:43.510
<v Speaker 1>1832 by the father of a future</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1030
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's come to signify everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracts and repulses the public about</v>

1031
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and quotes the elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rumor has it that Yale Junior class</v>

1032
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:56.080
<v Speaker 1>members are tapped for membership each</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall by some measure of leadership,</v>

1033
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 1>influence and breeding among the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business titans,</v>

1034
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:01.780
<v Speaker 1>poets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians in three us,</v>

1035
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Speaker 1>presidents that are rumored to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>

1036
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.480
<v Speaker 1>We've picked out our honor roll poets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fucking poets and what they're</v>

1037
00:50:07.481 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 1>talking to other ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things.</v>

1038
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1039
00:50:10.481 --> 00:50:11.800

<v Speaker 1>He keeps figuring out a way to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>

1139
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.570
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a Duncan trussell podcast he</v>

1140
00:55:04.571 --> 00:55:06.880
<v Speaker 1>did receive recently with Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi Decker and Tim.</v>

1141
00:55:06.881 --> 00:55:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Hi Decker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was from Tim and Eric.</v>

1142
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing guy.</v>

1143
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.560
<v Speaker 1>He nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he said that</v>

1144
00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:16.770
<v Speaker 1>just really resonated in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1145
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:21.190
<v Speaker 1>he said there's always been this desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have to identify with the</v>

1146
00:55:21.191 --> 00:55:26.191
<v Speaker 1>strong man and two to give in to submit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the strong man and that that's what</v>

1147
00:55:26.681 --> 00:55:27.190
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>

1148
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:30.820
<v Speaker 1>He's the strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super confident man and that guy over</v>

1149
00:55:30.821 --> 00:55:33.880
<v Speaker 1>his shoulder is the kind of guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like,</v>

1150
00:55:33.881 --> 00:55:35.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably probably a nice guy.</v>

1151
00:55:35.671 --> 00:55:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I probably sweetheart maybe eat a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than he should and it doesn't go to</v>

1152
00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:42.870
<v Speaker 1>the gym when he should and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alarm clock goes off.</v>

1153
00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.790
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for him to get motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's just not,</v>

1154
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:49.480
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a lot of get up and go</v>

<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

1166
00:56:16.511 --> 00:56:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Like what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>

1169
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 4>And</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what you've done is you've used</v>

1170
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 4>some sort of chemicals to concoct</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like you've concocted this,</v>

1171
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.630
<v Speaker 4>this resemblance of what your hair used</v>
<v Speaker 4>to look like and his face.</v>

1172
00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:40.740
<v Speaker 4>Is it really that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the lighting or is that orange</v>

1173
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:44.620
<v Speaker 4>or is it really that red and orange?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do him up that he's got some people</v>

1174
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 4>to do him up and the kind of people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>do him up or probably like the kind of</v>

1175
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:50.230
<v Speaker 4>people that really like him and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like some orange skin,</v>

1176
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 4>they want to fight both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's war paint.</v>

1177
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:54.103
<v Speaker 4>They want to fight.</v>

1178
00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:00.120
<v Speaker 4>It's white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Warpaint</v>

1179
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 4>well why doesn't he do the under eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're going to do your whole,</v>

1180
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.840
<v Speaker 4>your face like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he wears like giant goggles</v>

1181
00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 4>when he gets in a tanning booth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what's going on?</v>

1182
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.580
<v Speaker 4>Like why is this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just white.</v>

1183
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.510
<v Speaker 4>Surely he knows what he looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1184
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.580
<v Speaker 4>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you look at his hair and you</v>

1185
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well why is he doing that?</v>

1186
00:57:22.661 --> 00:57:26.380
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why isn't he just Jason stayed it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>sense of confidence in some weird way.</v>

1190
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:41.710
<v Speaker 4>People are attracted to confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1274
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a comedy.</v>

1275
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a horror movie about big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Blair witch,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1287

<v Speaker 1>I think he was playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1288
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we talk about this,</v>

1289
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I get fucking hate tweets from big foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovers,</v>

01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 1>just big foot lovers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1294
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>They're all trump supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1295
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.063
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1296
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.990

<v Speaker 1>Bob Cat really is a big foot believer.</v>

1297
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's odd to me.</v>

1298
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't see him as really thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1299
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

1300
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>My used do it my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I realize my mom was a little</v>

1301
01:02:35.911 --> 01:02:40.911
<v Speaker 1>dopey cause as a kid not being serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've lost the bigfoot show and I'm</v>

1302
01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>thinking as a little kid I believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would interview literally people on</v>

1303
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>a rock like a hippy and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1304
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>he was just hanging out and he was kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of in his head and my mom go ice,</v>

1305
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father is gone.</v>

1306
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1307
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>There probably was something at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point until there was,</v>

1308
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was definitely an animal called</v>

1309
01:03:00.301 --> 01:03:02.160
<v Speaker 1>gigantic [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about that?</v>

1310
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.270
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1311
01:03:03.271 --> 01:03:04.104
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Brewer.</v>

1312
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:06.450
<v Speaker 1>What does it all up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The photo of John Carroll Pythius next</v>

1313
01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>to a human being.</v>

1314
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge bipedal hominid that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>found bones of in Asia.</v>

1315
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:17.660
<v Speaker 1>In the 1920s there was an apothecary</v>
<v Speaker 1>shop and China and an anthropologist was</v>

1316
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>in there and it was studying some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth that they had any recognize this</v>

1317
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 1>enormous teeth tooth to be a primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth of unknown origin.</v>

1318
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.530
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is way too large to be a gorilla.</v>

1319
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where'd you get it?</v>

1320
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.650
<v Speaker 1>So the people brought him to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>apothecary shop.</v>

1321
01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a photo of a recreation of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic Pacific is next to a guy,</v>

1322
01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:39.820
<v Speaker 1>the orangutan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1323
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1324
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:41.214
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1325
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.013
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1326
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 1>just go back to the images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please go back to images.</v>

1327
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.561
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1328
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>you'll definitely find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gigantic.</v>

1329
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Pithy gets next to a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>

1330
01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I just shows you in scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a,</v>

1331
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.640
<v Speaker 1>so they found bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1332
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And they found lower job bones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would indicate it was a bipedal ape.</v>

1333
01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess it's the position of the jaw</v>

1334
01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're on all fours,</v>

1335
01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>then if you stand up so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it right there.</v>

1336
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:08.730
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this thing lived as recently as a</v>

1337
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe more soon.</v>

1338
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 1>But this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even know about it until</v>

1339
01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:17.541
<v Speaker 1>1920 when they got these bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 1920 they had those bones and they</v>

1340
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:21.240
<v Speaker 1>had them once carbon dating was</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented,</v>

1341
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.340
<v Speaker 1>they dated those bones to a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years ago.</v>

1342
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So that was a real animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I just tell you,</v>

1343
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to change the whole edge.</v>

1344
01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I would go to school every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this was school</v>

1345
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like learned about big foot and we know</v>

1346
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.660
<v Speaker 1>we went</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere we went today we just sat</v>

1347

<v Speaker 1>back to school tomorrow.</v>

1349
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's cool shit to learn man.</v>

1350
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:49.170
<v Speaker 1>This is cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is cool.</v>

1351
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I deny it though because</v>

1352
01:04:51.901 --> 01:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a tid.</v>

1353
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real animal.</v>

1354
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmed animal.</v>

1355
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just found it.</v>

1356
01:05:01.381 --> 01:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who founded archeologists,</v>

1357
01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>they dug up and anthropologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they studied these bonuses.</v>

1358
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>We're getting $400,000 of shares and</v>
<v Speaker 1>funds.</v>

1359
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>If we don't find a goddamn tooth or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1360
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 1>we got to file out like Dag every</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking place.</v>

1361
01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>We can't Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's place.</v>

1362
01:05:17.561 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I know PRC interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just another way to get money.</v>

1363
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have the bone,</v>

1364
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.970
<v Speaker 1>so you can go see the bones and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologists studying the bones.</v>

1365
01:05:25.971 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>The bones get the guys to white coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We approximately say that.</v>

1366
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I would say estimated 13 myths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13,000 possibly upside.</v>

1367
01:05:37.711 --> 01:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>That's 130,000 years ago.</v>

1368
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>This thing roamed the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't have</v>

1369
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>putting it out in the real special one</v>
<v Speaker 1>time magazine and the,</v>

1370
01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.160
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the fucking monkey call?</v>

1371
01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Gigantic Shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to pick a pickup and a stress</v>

1372
01:05:55.630 --> 01:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>discolored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read all about it and pay $10 you don't</v>

1373
01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:02.830
<v Speaker 1>mother fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is it any weirder than a gorilla</v>

1374
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:04.930
<v Speaker 1>grill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see,</v>

1375
01:06:04.931 --> 01:06:07.930
<v Speaker 1>and we physically can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost not,</v>

1376
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even know mountain gorillas</v>

1377
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:14.230
<v Speaker 1>existed until the 20th century because</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people never went that way.</v>

1378
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1379
01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:17.230
<v Speaker 1>And when they first got photos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain gorillas,</v>

1380
01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>

1381
01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Find out when they found,</v>

1383
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 1>when they first discovered the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla,</v>

1384
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was the early 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and uh,</v>

1385
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an animal that we just take for</v>

1386
01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:32.680
<v Speaker 1>granted is definitely being real.</v>

1387
01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:35.260
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot of those gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those.</v>

1388
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy who's been dedicated his</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life to trying to find a giant</v>

1389
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:42.880
<v Speaker 1>sloths in the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is convinced that the giant</v>

1390
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:46.540
<v Speaker 1>sloths in the Amazon still live mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl was first discovered by a German</v>

1391

<v Speaker 1>officer in 1902 nine two oh two captain</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Vaughn Beringia.</v>

1392
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Prior to this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only lowland gorillas were known to</v>

1393
01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.700
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mountain gorillas subspecies is</v>

1394
01:06:57.701 --> 01:07:00.100
<v Speaker 1>derived from the captain Robert Vaughn</v>
<v Speaker 1>bearings.</v>

1395
01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Last name gorilla bearing g Barend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's his name.</v>

1397
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Robert Vaughn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prng what?</v>

1398
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Why they have to have it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gorilla Benji,</v>

1399
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Benji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's around in 1902 like what's going</v>

1400
01:07:16.601 --> 01:07:17.650
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot.</v>

1401
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Photos are only 40 years old thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that before that they were drawing shit.</v>

1402
01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.160
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how crazy that is.</v>

1403
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Like sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.060
<v Speaker 1>And drawing and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean painting.</v>

1405
01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Michelangelo and all that,</v>

1406
01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 1>all that's trip was before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was how you got images back</v>

1407
01:07:32.231 --> 01:07:34.450
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to paint them when we don't,</v>

1408
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>we don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take photographs for granted so much.</v>

1409
01:07:37.991 --> 01:07:42.280
<v Speaker 1>We don't realize that the photograph was</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented in the 18 hundreds.</v>

1410
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1411
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Now why was this guy even think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1412
01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:49.420
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds you didn't really have great</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>

1413
01:07:49.421 --> 01:07:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you just going up in an area?</v>

1414
01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Why theirs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's nowhere near from Africa</v>

1415
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:56.080
<v Speaker 1>where it was the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there was a lot of explorers back</v>

1416
01:07:56.081 --> 01:08:00.010
<v Speaker 1>there in Africa because they had found</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they started to colonize certain</v>

1417
01:08:00.011 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Africa,</v>

1418
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:05.620
<v Speaker 1>like the colonized South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they all use a nice word</v>

1419
01:08:05.621 --> 01:08:06.454
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slaving.</v>

1420
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch.</v>

1421
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch came to Africa and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they enslaved people and they made these</v>

1422
01:08:11.481 --> 01:08:15.130
<v Speaker 1>settlements and they tried to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements in the Congo itself.</v>

1423
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>But the jungle just</v>

1424
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 4>swallowed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>

1425
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:20.870
<v Speaker 4>They would make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would spend all this money and have</v>

1426
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 4>boats go down there and they built these</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful mansions in the Congo,</v>

1427
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 4>but the Congo always ate it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just too wild.</v>

1428
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:29.270
<v Speaker 4>They just couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't tame the Congo.</v>

1429
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:31.030
<v Speaker 4>They thought they were going to go there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1430
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:34.540
<v Speaker 4>and figured out how to tame that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Teach them all about,</v>

1431
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noah's Ark and things like that and</v>

1432
01:08:37.861 --> 01:08:40.190
<v Speaker 4>their abcs and they just couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>

1433
01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:42.830
<v Speaker 4>Six months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can survive in the jungle itself.</v>

1434
01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Like the jungle itself was just so</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking wild.</v>

1435
01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 4>There's no taming the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you would have to have like a full</v>

1436
01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:53.630
<v Speaker 4>scale Western invasion to tame the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congo.</v>

1437
01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:58.631
<v Speaker 4>We would have to clear cut and start</v>
<v Speaker 4>chopping down giant swaths of the forest</v>

1438
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:02.510
<v Speaker 4>and putting up malls and blowing coal</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the air and lighting everything on</v>

1439
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

1440
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.420
<v Speaker 4>And we still wouldn't win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just too much of it.</v>

1441
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.710
<v Speaker 4>It's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had been able to shows the Congo</v>

1442
01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:10.620
<v Speaker 4>gets all the shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1443
01:09:10.621 --> 01:09:13.490
<v Speaker 4>What's so shows where the true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they throw you out there naked and</v>

1444
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:15.030
<v Speaker 4>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't go to the Congo.</v>

1445
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.290
<v Speaker 4>It's the one place that I haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

1446
01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.710
<v Speaker 4>He ain't gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have enough insurance to cover</v>

1447
01:09:21.711 --> 01:09:24.620
<v Speaker 4>you in Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nagin and Fred means eaten.</v>

1448
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:28.370
<v Speaker 4>You get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But can you imagine it's 1902 think of</v>

1449
01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've seen your life at that moment,</v>

1450
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a whole lot to see</v>

1451
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:37.880
<v Speaker 4>and you're going up the mountains and</v>
<v Speaker 4>surely there was a tribe guy or</v>

1452
01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.150
<v Speaker 4>something that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1453
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.100
<v Speaker 4>it Booboo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give him that little term like don't go</v>

1454
01:09:43.101 --> 01:09:44.540
<v Speaker 4>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know what he was saying.</v>

1455
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:45.523
<v Speaker 4>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go up there.</v>

1456
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Imagine first time encountering a</v>
<v Speaker 4>gorilla.</v>

1457
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've never seen anything like that and</v>

1458
01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:56.880
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a fucking huge,</v>

1459
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.240
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1460
01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I've seen maybe a hippo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a hippa?</v>

1461
01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:05.130
<v Speaker 4>Like can you imagine just squaring off</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if that thing you ever see,</v>

1462
01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:09.500
<v Speaker 4>like when a gorilla charges</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus and that guy,</v>

1463
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:11.660
<v Speaker 4>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have flipped out.</v>

1464
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:14.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine being in a time when there was</v>

1465
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:19.010
<v Speaker 4>no photographs and visiting the jungle</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Africa and seeing all the wildlife.</v>

1466
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.810
<v Speaker 4>Seeing a lion sees a fucking line and</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you win that's going to protect</v>

1467
01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:26.660
<v Speaker 4>you from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys had been eating who was</v>

1468
01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:28.220
<v Speaker 4>this shame?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's supposedly the picture.</v>

1469
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:30.290
<v Speaker 4>I was just reading a story about when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they found it.</v>

1470
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.000
<v Speaker 4>This is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his encounter.</v>

1471
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:36.020
<v Speaker 4>The first one they shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going up a volcano or something that</v>

1472
01:10:36.021 --> 01:10:37.110
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1473
01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.630
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were tracking them and it took</v>

1474
01:10:38.631 --> 01:10:42.560
<v Speaker 4>them hours to even find it on a high and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a half the body by the time they got</v>

1475
01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:43.394
<v Speaker 4>some of it or something.</v>

1476
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a picture shot.</v>

1477
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:47.420
<v Speaker 4>The gorilla body by the time they got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1478
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:48.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1479
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm not quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said they had shot two.</v>

1480
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.810
<v Speaker 4>They killed to the shot too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if how they killed it.</v>

1481
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:56.330
<v Speaker 4>It didn't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they retrieved it by rope and they</v>

1482
01:10:56.331 --> 01:10:58.640
<v Speaker 4>found that it was about 200 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one they found.</v>

1483
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa is still crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>summer,</v>

1486
01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:06.380
<v Speaker 4>but I heard that you have to take all</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of crazy shots.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a tribe there that you can</v>

1498
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>follow for like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days.</v>

1499
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.050
<v Speaker 1>They take your hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1500
01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's Kronos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

1501
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 1>there was a part of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got really spooked out because the guy</v>

1502
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:42.390
<v Speaker 1>we were with who just has a spear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just sitting there with a spear and</v>

1503
01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:43.280
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1504
01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:44.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1505
01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:46.410
<v Speaker 1>stay here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was going after some low animal.</v>

1506
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:48.000
<v Speaker 1>It was just me and my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1507
01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:51.240
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we do with an African?</v>

1508
01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1509
01:11:52.551 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 1>We'll think of that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I am from Florida,</v>

1510
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.120
<v Speaker 1>now I'm spear hunting with some African</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude and my kid.</v>

1511
01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.670
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

1512
01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was awesome.</v>

1513
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.190
<v Speaker 1>It was really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should go on it or shows your mind</v>

1514
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 1>now I should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who went there and he</v>

1515
01:12:07.711 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 1>was on a hunting trip and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poachers were in the area and when they</v>

1516
01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 1>see poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just start shooting anthem shooting</v>

1517
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:18.240
<v Speaker 1>at the poachers to shooting at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1518
01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to shoot them when you see them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will shoot you and they</v>

1519
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:22.770
<v Speaker 1>will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were getting shot at by</v>

1520
01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.431
<v Speaker 1>poachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1521
01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:26.040
<v Speaker 1>so you were in a gun fight poachers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1522
01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:29.250
<v Speaker 1>cause they want that Tusk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't kill anybody but Simon Tusk,</v>

1523
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.400
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is just meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like these people just starving to</v>

1524
01:12:32.401 --> 01:12:34.170
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy like that.</v>

1525
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Who's coming in to get all this ball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of different various variables</v>

1526
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:41.140
<v Speaker 1>that you got people that are poaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like Rhino Horn,</v>

1527
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.960
<v Speaker 1>ivory tusks and stuff like that.</v>

1528
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.880
<v Speaker 1>That's all you really hear about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you got people that are</v>

1529
01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:47.970
<v Speaker 1>poaching just for meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go on someone's private land and</v>

1530
01:12:47.971 --> 01:12:50.190
<v Speaker 1>they kill the animals and they call them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poacher.</v>

1531
01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>What they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking poor people.</v>

1532
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.330
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1533
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.890
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

1534
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the poachers were shooted them</v>

1535
01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 1>and they shoot at the poachers and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're asking,</v>

1536
01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do if you shoot one of</v>

1537
01:13:01.681 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 1>these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1538
01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.730
<v Speaker 1>most of the time we let the Hyena sorted</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1539
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the hyenas sorted out.</v>

1540
01:13:09.091 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Like Cue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm managing your shooting people and</v>

1541
01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:14.850
<v Speaker 1>just leaving them for [inaudible] is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

1542
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:19.320
<v Speaker 1>You've got human eating hyenas in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard essentially,</v>

1543
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:22.350
<v Speaker 1>and you're watching it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1544
01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and you're accustomed to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must have seen it at least once,</v>

1545
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1546
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>It must have come upon a guy that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shot,</v>

1547
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:33.180
<v Speaker 1>checked on the body and seeing the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>end is tearing it apart with that noise.</v>

1548
01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the creeps.</v>

1549
01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 1>The green there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creepiest,</v>

1550
01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.710
<v Speaker 1>they're so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So weird looking with their big back</v>

1551
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:46.710
<v Speaker 1>legs or the big front legs and shorter</v>
<v Speaker 1>back legs.</v>

1552
01:13:46.711 --> 01:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>They look there there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're mysteriously dark.</v>

1553
01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:52.290
<v Speaker 1>They're all lopsided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not like flat.</v>

1554
01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dog is flat,</v>

1555
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyenas or like like a ramp.</v>

1556
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1557
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.930
<v Speaker 1>they slope down this slope downward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really big jaw.</v>

1558
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that fucking thing.</v>

1559
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of the God hyena</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry and some interesting facts.</v>

1560
01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:10.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

1561
01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to that picture again.</v>

1562
01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Please look at the fucking mouth on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

1563
01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And they don't fear law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go after lions to look at the</v>

1564
01:14:20.141 --> 01:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>teeth on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1565
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even look real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if that was in a movie,</v>

1566
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:25.541
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1567
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa's is so gangster.</v>

1568
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the real deal.</v>

1569
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's weird is like,</v>

1570
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>that is where life started and where</v>
<v Speaker 1>life started.</v>

1571
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It's where it's the most ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about all the different animals</v>

1572
01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:43.721
<v Speaker 1>that we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1573
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 1>that there was a lot of animals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this that lived in North America.</v>

1574
01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:53.290
<v Speaker 1>And there was a Hyena that was like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast running Hyena,</v>

1575
01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:58.291
<v Speaker 1>a type of Hyena here in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy named Dan Flores.</v>

1576
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.970
<v Speaker 1>He's got this book on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1577
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:05.650
<v Speaker 1>American Serengeti and he was on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy Steven Ellis podcast talking about</v>

1578
01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:05.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1579
01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:07.690
<v Speaker 1>He's a wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a historian,</v>

1580
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.980
<v Speaker 1>a nature of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1581
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about how crazy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals were in North America,</v>

1582
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:14.591
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1583
01:15:14.591 --> 01:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>a hundred thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know what,</v>

1584
01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what caused the mass extinction.</v>

1585
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 1>But there was a bunch of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a lion here,</v>

1586
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:24.190
<v Speaker 1>there was bigger than the African lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a step line.</v>

1587
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.470
<v Speaker 1>So is this from the divide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'd even realize that too,</v>

1588
01:15:28.471 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 1>until I was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The content and the bering strait.</v>

1589
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was also like just mass</v>

1590
01:15:34.211 --> 01:15:35.830
<v Speaker 1>extinctions here for some strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1591
01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And they really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

1592
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:37.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

1593
01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Horses like native Americans didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>horses.</v>

1594
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:44.360
<v Speaker 1>The Europeans brought the horses to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>native amount.</v>

1595
01:15:44.361 --> 01:15:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1596
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:49.060
<v Speaker 1>But here's where it gets really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horse has evolved in North America.</v>

1597
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Horses evolved in North America and went</v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct and the only horses had survived</v>

1598
01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:57.220
<v Speaker 1>with the horses that had been captured</v>
<v Speaker 1>or had gone across the bering strait and</v>

1599
01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 1>made it into Asia.</v>

1600
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Those are the horses that survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then when like Arabian stallions and</v>

1601
01:16:02.201 --> 01:16:04.960
<v Speaker 1>shit came back from there into North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America again,</v>

1602
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:07.780
<v Speaker 1>they had literally originally evolved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America.</v>

1603
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.990
<v Speaker 1>All the canines evolved in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1604
01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:13.540
<v Speaker 1>like wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyenas,</v>

1605
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>

1606
01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:15.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1607
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.420
<v Speaker 1>what of those dingoes all those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally came from North America.</v>

1608
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not dingoes is that an Australian?</v>

1609
01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:25.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a strain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think they brought them on as</v>

1610
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:27.760
<v Speaker 1>part of something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought a lot of shit over to</v>

1611
01:16:27.761 --> 01:16:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is filled with animals that</v>

1612
01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:33.250
<v Speaker 1>don't belong there and they don't belong</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>

1613
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all bald is a lot of,</v>

1614
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>well there's like kangaroos which are</v>
<v Speaker 1>only there.</v>

1615
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 1>His real hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's panda bear,</v>

1616
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Panda bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the heads.</v>

1617
01:16:40.871 --> 01:16:42.220
<v Speaker 1>A better the Free Koala bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1618
01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Koala bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koala bear got some weird shit man.</v>

1619
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.510
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also have like,</v>

1620
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.680
<v Speaker 1>they have a ridiculous amount of animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in there.</v>

1621
01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.770
<v Speaker 1>And then they brought in cats to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the animals and then the cats</v>

1622
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.080
<v Speaker 1>got out of control and now they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>feral cat problem.</v>

1623
01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.360
<v Speaker 1>They also have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1624
01:16:58.361 --> 01:17:02.950
<v Speaker 1>it scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never have too many things you</v>

1625
01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>can eat and kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1626
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I think more than Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't swim in the ocean and they get</v>

1627
01:17:07.181 --> 01:17:08.680
<v Speaker 1>the saltwater crocs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1628
01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 1>the saltwater crocs</v>

1629
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.160
<v Speaker 4>and the worst outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shark attacks South South Africa in</v>

1630
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Australia have like the worst shark</v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks.</v>

1631
01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get the worst snakes,</v>

1632
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:22.400
<v Speaker 4>bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spiders,</v>

1633
01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.760
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll fade house them.</v>

1634
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.350
<v Speaker 4>But the people are cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Australian people are some of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>coolest fucking people you'll ever meet.</v>

1636
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Fan of Australian people.</v>

1637
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:37.520
<v Speaker 4>If you had a move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that where you'd go?</v>

1638
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a good spot to move because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's on the other side of the world.</v>

1639
01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 4>So if we blow this thing up and we need</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody with a greenhouse and Sydney,</v>

1640
01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:46.970
<v Speaker 4>that's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if,</v>

1641
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.410
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we don't make it,</v>

1642
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:51.410
<v Speaker 4>if America doesn't make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like save yellowstone blows.</v>

1643
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 4>If don't blows up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kills everybody in the continent.</v>

1644
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:58.040
<v Speaker 4>You got to have to go somewhere where</v>
<v Speaker 4>the transition would not be that that</v>

1645
01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 4>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Australia I think is the furthest</v>

1646
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 4>away with a transition would be easy.</v>

1647
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:07.010
<v Speaker 4>What if it got too crazy and it was way</v>
<v Speaker 4>too many people in Australia,</v>

1648
01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:07.581
<v Speaker 4>they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

1649
01:18:07.581 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were cutting the border.</v>

1650
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 4>It's say do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know in Australia.</v>

1651
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:13.940
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why Australia</v>
<v Speaker 4>so awesome when a bunch of immigrants</v>

1652
01:18:13.941 --> 01:18:16.550
<v Speaker 4>show up in a boat then like not so fast</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck face.</v>

1653
01:18:16.551 --> 01:18:18.920
<v Speaker 4>They turn them around and they sent it</v>
<v Speaker 4>to some shitty island.</v>

1654
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.320
<v Speaker 4>We got home real was here and to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>him eat bugs.</v>

1655
01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not good.</v>

1656
01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:25.280
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not kidding man.</v>

1657
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:26.390
<v Speaker 4>They're brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

1658
01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:29.000
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're anti immigration policy is like</v>

1659
01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 4>widely criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of the reasons why</v>

1660
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:33.290
<v Speaker 4>apparently it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1661
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.620
<v Speaker 4>so who was it that told us about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Josh has apps.</v>

1662
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Was he the one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first one to tell us about that?</v>

1663
01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 4>So some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the guests who was from</v>

1664
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:40.790
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1665
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:45.790
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was josh was explaining how</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy they are about stopping</v>

1666
01:18:45.891 --> 01:18:46.530
<v Speaker 4>immigration.</v>

1667
01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:49.130
<v Speaker 4>They just illegal immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a no,</v>

1668
01:18:49.131 --> 01:18:50.720
<v Speaker 4>no over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just won't let it happen.</v>

1669
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 4>That wood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wood,</v>

1670
01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.670
<v Speaker 4>that's like a scene of a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something goes down here.</v>

1671
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1672
01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 4>These are people going down there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then not letting you in.</v>

1673
01:18:59.721 --> 01:19:00.610
<v Speaker 4>Now there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1674
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.360
<v Speaker 4>there's so many [inaudible] world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's only 20 million people in</v>

1675
01:19:05.361 --> 01:19:08.480
<v Speaker 4>all of Australia or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Australia itself,</v>

1676
01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:12.110
<v Speaker 4>the whole continent of Australia has the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same amount of people is California.</v>

1677
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:14.413
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1678
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 4>And it's as big as the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't live on a lot.</v>

1679
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Is there a lot of desert there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1680
01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 4>you can't if you're a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you're fucking man,</v>

1681
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:25.190
<v Speaker 4>just move out in the 23 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's probably less than California.</v>

1682
01:19:25.191 --> 01:19:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>California is probably like 30 million.</v>

1683
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.930
<v Speaker 4>If I had to guess how many people are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>California?</v>

1684
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 4>No official population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably gonna be a little under,</v>

1685
01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:34.010
<v Speaker 4>but easily that money.</v>

1686
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not counting Mexicans either.</v>

1687
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.370
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Friends of my Mexican friends.</v>

1688
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:41.420
<v Speaker 4>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have my fucking paperwork</v>

1689
01:19:41.421 --> 01:19:42.470
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

1690
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:45.790
<v Speaker 4>38 million of Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just calc.</v>

1691
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's not even including illegal</v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens.</v>

1692
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1693
01:19:50.091 --> 01:19:53.930
<v Speaker 4>another fucking crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody brought this up somewhere</v>

1694
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:55.520
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget who it was.</v>

1695
01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.590
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I read it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1696
01:19:58.130 --> 01:20:01.340
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about what percentage</v>
<v Speaker 4>of native Americans,</v>

1697
01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in Ra in Mexico,</v>

1698
01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:08.981
<v Speaker 4>like Mexico has a lot of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a percentage of their genes are native</v>

1699
01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same as the people that came from</v>

1700
01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in Mexico.</v>

1701
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1702
01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 4>That I believe that genetic differences</v>
<v Speaker 4>between Mexicans and native Americans is</v>

1703
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:21.660
<v Speaker 4>like very small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1704
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:24.780
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not to offend anyone,</v>

1705
01:20:24.781 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm just being honest where I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see that a lot.</v>

1706
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:30.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't tell.</v>

1707
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that person Mexican or is that person</v>
<v Speaker 4>a native American?</v>

1708
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:36.920
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just did the other day at Frickin</v>

1709
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:40.880
<v Speaker 4>citywalk</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to be racist and I wasn't sure</v>

1710
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.820
<v Speaker 4>which way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we culturally appropriate that's</v>

1711
01:20:44.821 --> 01:20:49.280
<v Speaker 4>a barrel or a feather</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know it.</v>

1712
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:52.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes sense.</v>

1713
01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all came down from Asia</v>

1714
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.060
<v Speaker 4>along with all these fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

1715
01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:58.770
<v Speaker 4>And this Guy Dan Flores is talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1716
01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:01.710
<v Speaker 4>they had a single,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a short face bear.</v>

1717
01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:02.760
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie?</v>

1718
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:08.010
<v Speaker 4>Short face bear is fucking enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying bear that they think was one</v>

1719
01:21:08.011 --> 01:21:11.160
<v Speaker 4>of the reasons why people didn't come to</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America sooner because there were</v>

1720
01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:13.290
<v Speaker 4>so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were huge like bigger than</v>

1721
01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:17.250
<v Speaker 4>grizzlies and super predatory and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when people were coming across the</v>

1722
01:21:17.251 --> 01:21:19.170
<v Speaker 4>bering strait there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably just getting picked off.</v>

1723
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:24.330

<v Speaker 4>down a buffalo in this photo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some youtube videos.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Chrissy just chasing the moose down</v>

<v Speaker 4>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1728
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:37.350
<v Speaker 4>he knows he's going to get them loose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is half eaten,</v>

1729
01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 4>still running?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just looking back.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to catch up to you.</v>

1731
01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:45.630
<v Speaker 4>It's fricking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's horrifying.</v>

1732
01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 4>It's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also real god,</v>

1733
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:51.270
<v Speaker 4>these things still exist and can eat you</v>
<v Speaker 4>at any moment.</v>

1734
01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:53.520
<v Speaker 4>We still part of the wild and all we</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1735
01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:56.700
<v Speaker 4>we've just made cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's one that's the one I'm talking</v>

1736
01:21:56.701 --> 01:22:00.510
<v Speaker 4>about chasing this buffalo giant ass</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzlies chasing the buffalo.</v>

1737
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:05.540
<v Speaker 4>He's half torn up already so big and say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that buffalo got burned in some</v>

1738
01:22:07.471 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 4>sort of a volcanic fire or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1739
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.960
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was an already injured buffalo.</v>

1740
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.510
<v Speaker 4>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's already had enough.</v>

1741
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:17.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so terrifying.</v>

1742
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Look at his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's foaming is foaming.</v>

1743
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got an air.</v>

1744
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in the air dude.</v>

1745
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:28.940
<v Speaker 4>And he probably weighs 500 pounds and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>leased and he's booking it done street</v>

1746
01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:30.870
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He probably was more than 500 pounds.</v>

1747
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:34.200
<v Speaker 4>That's a buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably like six or 700 pounds.</v>

1748
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:35.730
<v Speaker 4>What am I guessing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you wait,</v>

1749
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.280
<v Speaker 4>what am I fat shaming a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why might,</v>

1750
01:22:39.281 --> 01:22:40.114
<v Speaker 4>why don't care?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1751
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm obsessed with a number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see,</v>

1752
01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:44.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're watching this.</v>

1753
01:22:44.761 --> 01:22:46.970
<v Speaker 4>I just watched it on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1754
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 4>what's the Leonardo Dicaprio one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where he gets told the revenant?</v>

1755
01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1756
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.480
<v Speaker 4>did you see the scene?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1757
01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:56.040
<v Speaker 4>the bear scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 4>That's the first time I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you think of it,</v>

1759
01:23:00.571 --> 01:23:04.890
<v Speaker 4>but that's the first time where I saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>how quick that can ha they,</v>

1760
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 4>I thought they made it real how a bear</v>
<v Speaker 4>can just,</v>

1761
01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within a second he's on,</v>

1762
01:23:09.101 --> 01:23:13.150
<v Speaker 4>he was over there so big and they move</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much faster than a person can.</v>

1763
01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:13.900
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1764
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.120
<v Speaker 4>we judge everything based on what we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1765
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:19.480
<v Speaker 4>Like we see an animal way like okay via</v>
<v Speaker 4>to run towards him right now.</v>

1766
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 4>How long would it take?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the timeline that an animal can</v>

1767
01:23:22.361 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 4>close in on you versus what you can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them is so goddamn different.</v>

1768
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:28.600
<v Speaker 4>Like you just don't understand how fast</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

1769
01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Spat all my rage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am still just a rat cage where you</v>

1770
01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:39.390
<v Speaker 4>live in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey got a crazy bear problem.</v>

1771
01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:41.700
<v Speaker 4>They're overrun with bears in some</v>
<v Speaker 4>areas.</v>

1772
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:42.683
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1773
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:47.520
<v Speaker 4>there's bears but they're black bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:51.360
<v Speaker 4>No one not as scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get spooked out really easily.</v>

1775
01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:54.510
<v Speaker 4>They're scavengers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just looking for garbage.</v>

1776
01:23:54.511 --> 01:23:56.790
<v Speaker 4>They don't care about you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are for the most part.</v>

1777
01:23:57.810 --> 01:24:00.240
<v Speaker 4>They definitely do term predatory though</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they get really hungry.</v>

1778
01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:04.320
<v Speaker 4>Some of them are predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy who was camping with some</v>

1779
01:24:04.321 --> 01:24:06.270
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was his first hunting trip and he got</v>

1780
01:24:06.271 --> 01:24:10.140
<v Speaker 4>attacked in his tent by a 500 pound</v>
<v Speaker 4>predatory black bear.</v>

1781
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Huge hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>older black bear.</v>

1782
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Just took a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went in the tent,</v>

1783
01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.800
<v Speaker 4>just try to Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in his tent.</v>

1784
01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.100
<v Speaker 4>His friends shot the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot through the bear and hit him in the</v>

1785
01:24:20.101 --> 01:24:22.380
<v Speaker 4>wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he wound up getting a broken wrist</v>

1786
01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:24.540
<v Speaker 4>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the rifle and they,</v>

1787
01:24:24.541 --> 01:24:27.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chase the bear out of the tent and shot</v>

1788
01:24:27.331 --> 01:24:29.490
<v Speaker 4>it in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1789
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.220
<v Speaker 4>How about that for your first fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>camping trip?</v>

1790
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.470
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1791
01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:40.470
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to see animals bears</v>
<v Speaker 4>here of these fine.</v>

1792
01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:42.810
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time they run away,</v>

1793
01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.270
<v Speaker 4>but they killed that kid at rutgers was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a year and a half ago.</v>

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.230
<v Speaker 4>There's two wacky black ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's um,</v>

1838
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:39.070
<v Speaker 4>there's a good video in my nephew's</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood where the two black bears</v>

1839
01:26:39.771 --> 01:26:40.790
<v Speaker 4>are going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1840
01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:41.830
<v Speaker 4>far rockaway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1841
01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:46.890
<v Speaker 4>the one that we played that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's one in Jersey that</v>

1842
01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:48.740
<v Speaker 4>walks on its hind legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1843
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1844
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:50.803
<v Speaker 4>it's big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>

1845
01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:56.660
<v Speaker 4>That's a big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big foot video for you.</v>

1846
01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.300
<v Speaker 4>I think that's exactly what those were</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

1847
01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.130
<v Speaker 4>Bears can do that apparently all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1848
01:27:01.190 --> 01:27:03.920
<v Speaker 4>They can walk on their hind legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just don't do it very often.</v>

1849
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's weird.</v>

1850
01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he walks through the neighborhood</v>

1851
01:27:08.331 --> 01:27:11.150
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were like at dusk,</v>

1852
01:27:11.290 --> 01:27:12.123
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1853
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 4>And it was really dark out and you saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing walking through buck glint of</v>

1854
01:27:16.401 --> 01:27:18.680
<v Speaker 4>moonlight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would swear it was a giant gorilla.</v>

1855
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's big foot.</v>

1856
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 4>I listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1857
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:26.000
<v Speaker 4>I know him before I joked at big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I saw him last night.</v>

1858
01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like a dead thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for real,</v>

1859
01:27:28.251 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 4>like a black bear can easily get to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven feet.</v>

1860
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>

1861
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.640
<v Speaker 4>if you got a seven foot black bear it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you see it walking through the</v>

1862
01:27:34.641 --> 01:27:36.290
<v Speaker 4>woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or even a fucking six and a half foot</v>

1863
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:38.680
<v Speaker 4>black bear when she get her pants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1864
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.450
<v Speaker 4>you're going to swear it's way bigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>than it was just walking on his hind</v>

1865
01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:42.200
<v Speaker 4>legs.</v>

1866
01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 4>Nobody ever underestimates or giant two</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot to walking on two legs.</v>

1867
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't underestimate the size of the</v>

1868
01:27:49.081 --> 01:27:50.180
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You overestimate it.</v>

1869
01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1870
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:52.580

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.860
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey is pretty rural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't realize that.</v>

1874
01:28:00.861 --> 01:28:05.861
<v Speaker 4>They think of New Jersey as being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like were Tony Soprano loved or they</v>

1875
01:28:06.261 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 4>think it's Newark Airport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hoboken.</v>

1887
01:28:44.601 --> 01:28:49.601
<v Speaker 4>one night my wife and I were sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 4>and on the roof.</v>

<v Speaker 4>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was me,</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1896
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Jersey devil doesn't scare me as much as</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking alligator that pulls babies</v>

1897
01:29:08.401 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 4>out of a Disneyland and drags them into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lagoon.</v>

1898
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:13.290
<v Speaker 4>That's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1899
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.450
<v Speaker 4>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine a,</v>

1900

<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in that with my kids.</v>

<v Speaker 4>signs.</v>

1902

<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1905
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.640

<v Speaker 4>to lie for them.</v>

1906
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.100

1917
01:29:55.861 --> 01:29:58.380
<v Speaker 4>have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is so scary,</v>

1918
01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.620
<v Speaker 4>but I talked about this in the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently when I was a kid and we lived</v>

1919
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:03.750
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were endangered and so you couldn't</v>

1920
01:30:03.751 --> 01:30:04.950
<v Speaker 4>hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody hunted them.</v>

1921
01:30:05.490 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 4>And now they have so many of them that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they give out hunting tags.</v>

1922
01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Like for that swamp people show you ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch that show?</v>

1923
01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:14.660
<v Speaker 4>The kill alligators?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy had 500 tax.</v>

1924
01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.060
<v Speaker 4>He could kill $500 how many fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>alligators do they have when you give</v>

1925
01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.440
<v Speaker 4>someone 500 tags?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

01:30:20.441 --> 01:30:21.810
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a real problem.</v>

1927
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:23.520
<v Speaker 4>Then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so look at this guy.</v>

1928
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 4>He's climbing a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:31.110
<v Speaker 4>Look at that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is straight out of,</v>

1930
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.700

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a dinosaur.</v>

1932
01:30:34.111 --> 01:30:37.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they've changed in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred million years or something crazy</v>

1933
01:30:37.051 --> 01:30:39.690
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some nutty number.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like 50 million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1935
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:46.500

<v Speaker 4>with the Mama dear and you go,</v>

1977
01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:37.300
<v Speaker 1>when I was living there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm trying to figure out what year I</v>

1978
01:32:37.301 --> 01:32:42.040
<v Speaker 1>was born in 67 we lived in Florida until</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a law.</v>

1979
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:44.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in San Francisco from age seven</v>

1980
01:32:44.081 --> 01:32:48.640
<v Speaker 1>to 11 so I was 11 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around then what year was</v>

1981
01:32:48.641 --> 01:32:49.060
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.250
<v Speaker 1>What year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 73 I'm way too stupid.</v>

1983
01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:53.650
<v Speaker 1>If it was 73 probably about five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

1984
01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>

1985
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:58.980
<v Speaker 1>73 Oh six yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So swimming on,</v>

1986
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 1>so somewhere around some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking somewhere around 1977</v>

1987
01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:04.061
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>prime ready to go.</v>

1989
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>So just think about this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1977 now think about 2016 so in 77</v>

1990
01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:15.460
<v Speaker 1>they're protected.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is it going to be like 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>years from now?</v>

2080
01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:59.070

<v Speaker 4>attraction with anybody.</v>

<v Speaker 4>programmed America and fed them</v>

2086
01:38:12.691 --> 01:38:14.700
<v Speaker 4>alligators.</v>

2087
01:38:14.701 --> 01:38:16.230
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No they don't.</v>

2088
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2089
01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:19.560
<v Speaker 4>What makes you say that you've eaten</v>
<v Speaker 4>them in flow?</v>

2090
01:38:19.570 --> 01:38:20.940
<v Speaker 4>At least that's what they said they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

2091
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you've had like those alligator</v>

2092
01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:25.400
<v Speaker 4>tail and fried gator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Got to eat it fresh and say gotta eat it</v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh,</v>

2094
01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:32.730
<v Speaker 4>but apparently has more protein per</v>
<v Speaker 4>pound of meat than any other wild game.</v>

2095
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:36.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like his is up there as high as</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else,</v>

2097
01:38:36.151 --> 01:38:41.151
<v Speaker 4>like higher than even like elk and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and buffalo and bison and things like</v>

2098
01:38:41.371 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hated it.</v>

2099
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

2100
01:38:43.090 --> 01:38:43.710
<v Speaker 4>find the find out.</v>

2101
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:45.480
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want a lot of people it was,</v>

2102
01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:47.790
<v Speaker 4>it was added to he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2103
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:49.440
<v Speaker 4>I thought it tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

2104
01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's because it's prepared</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

2105
01:38:51.930 --> 01:38:55.140
<v Speaker 4>I think you're getting it from some sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a like a fucking Fridays or something</v>

2106
01:38:55.141 --> 01:38:56.430
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like kind of a chain.</v>

2107
01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:01.640
<v Speaker 4>They say if you get it the right way</v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh and then cook it like the correct</v>

2108
01:39:01.801 --> 01:39:04.290
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's apparently very delicious or</v>

2109
01:39:04.291 --> 01:39:05.580
<v Speaker 4>probably just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2110
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're probably right.</v>

2111
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.500
<v Speaker 4>I might've get it cause I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the restaurant was like a</v>

2112
01:39:10.501 --> 01:39:11.700
<v Speaker 4>special,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was fine.</v>

2113
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Like a trial run in some guy's cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like trust me,</v>

2114
01:39:14.951 --> 01:39:16.490
<v Speaker 4>you just cut these up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2115
01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 4>you fry them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're amazing.</v>

2116
01:39:18.061 --> 01:39:22.140
<v Speaker 4>46 grams of protein per serving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so holy shit,</v>

2117
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:25.260
<v Speaker 4>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's start eating them.</v>

2118
01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:27.810
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's way more than anything</v>

2119
01:39:27.811 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's okay,</v>

2120
01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:32.490
<v Speaker 4>I'll find something new and meet the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other meat.</v>

2121
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.440
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

2122
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:40.780
<v Speaker 4>Well this is only 3.2 ounces for 3.2</v>
<v Speaker 4>ounces.</v>

2123
01:39:40.781 --> 01:39:43.900
<v Speaker 4>It's 46 grams of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

2124
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:46.721
<v Speaker 4>That is what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2125
01:39:46.721 --> 01:39:48.090
<v Speaker 4>It says 3.2 ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2126
01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.900
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's incredible.</v>

2127
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:54.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the main,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense.</v>

2128
01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.340
<v Speaker 4>You're reading a goddamn dinosaur</v>
<v Speaker 4>dinosaur.</v>

2129
01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:00.770
<v Speaker 4>You eating its tail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you eat.</v>

2130
01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.990
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2131
01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.270
<v Speaker 4>it's all muscle to cut it up into like</v>
<v Speaker 4>steaks.</v>

2132
01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.240
<v Speaker 4>That'd be prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good though.</v>

2133
01:40:07.450 --> 01:40:08.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

2134
01:40:08.141 --> 01:40:09.460
<v Speaker 4>I would like to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2135
01:40:09.461 --> 01:40:11.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm just talking out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

2136
01:40:11.021 --> 01:40:15.640
<v Speaker 4>Much as a domestic beef and for the city</v>
<v Speaker 4>twice as much as domestic beef.</v>

2137
01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:17.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't we feed people fucking</v>

2138
01:40:17.741 --> 01:40:19.150
<v Speaker 4>alligators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't we give it a run?</v>

2139
01:40:19.210 --> 01:40:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gives all these people worried about,</v>

2140
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:25.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a large scale consuming of beef and</v>

2141
01:40:25.031 --> 01:40:28.120
<v Speaker 4>the harm on the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to kill these goddamn alligators,</v>

2142
01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.860
<v Speaker 4>so why don't we just start fucking eaten</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

2143
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:31.900
<v Speaker 4>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow alligator farms and kill these</v>

2144
01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:36.370
<v Speaker 4>fuckers and you'll lose weight because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're eating pure protein.</v>

2145
01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.090
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're right.</v>

2146
01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:39.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it probably,</v>

2147
01:40:39.850 --> 01:40:42.310
<v Speaker 4>you probably get all ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet if you eat that stuff,</v>

2148
01:40:42.311 --> 01:40:44.740
<v Speaker 4>it's probably a soup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Primal for Eaton,</v>

2149
01:40:44.741 --> 01:40:46.600
<v Speaker 4>an alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your Dick probably gets hard as a rock.</v>

2150
01:40:51.490 --> 01:40:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever thought that?</v>

2151
01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.393
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2152
01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.100
<v Speaker 1>it's got to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That only make sense.</v>

2153
01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Like why else would do eat like mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions?</v>

2154
01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you know people eat mountain lions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2155
01:41:03.201 --> 01:41:05.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Loin,</v>

2156
01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:09.640
<v Speaker 1>the muscles in the back straps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the muscles that are on the outside of</v>

2157
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:12.870
<v Speaker 1>the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where like the tenderloin is on a</v>

2158
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.940
<v Speaker 1>beef cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like inside connected to the spine.</v>

2159
01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:20.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the same that does the same meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to get off of mountain lions,</v>

2160
01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:25.000
<v Speaker 1>but I mean why would anybody eat that</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you were a really hungry or be,</v>

2161
01:41:25.001 --> 01:41:30.001
<v Speaker 1>it makes your tent cards crowbar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine if we all found out there's</v>

2162
01:41:31.721 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 1>like a type of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you rock hard and they're</v>

2163
01:41:35.321 --> 01:41:38.680
<v Speaker 1>trying to give you pills were actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the answer and she needed</v>

2164
01:41:38.681 --> 01:41:42.220
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions need to study math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles and shit.</v>

2165
01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think we're just so disconnected</v>

2166
01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:51.400
<v Speaker 1>from these animals that we have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a weird fairytale idea what</v>

2167
01:41:51.401 --> 01:41:55.570
<v Speaker 1>these things are just wandering around</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland like they should have guys</v>

2168
01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:57.850
<v Speaker 1>that they hire to go kill these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2169
01:41:58.090 --> 01:41:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you letting these things live?</v>

2170
01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Because we're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many of them.</v>

2171
01:42:02.651 --> 01:42:04.540
<v Speaker 1>They're going to keep breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat everything.</v>

2172
01:42:04.541 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 1>They eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogs and cats and children.</v>

2173
01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.020
<v Speaker 1>The gators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2174
01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:11.440
<v Speaker 1>They're going to fucking keep eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like you guys and this idea that</v>

2175
01:42:11.441 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 1>all life is sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life is fucking sacred.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't he damn.</v>

2178
01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to eat you.</v>

2179
01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.730
<v Speaker 1>They're definitely going to eat you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat you.</v>

2180
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:24.070
<v Speaker 1>If you don't eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to be so many of them</v>

2181
01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:25.420
<v Speaker 1>that they're definitely gonna eat you.</v>

2182
01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep simple wildlife biologist strategy.</v>

2183
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Do I have just kill everything mallee or</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand there?</v>

2184
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:36.580
<v Speaker 1>They help the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that.</v>

2185
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.340
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing about coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody hates the coyotes out</v>

2186
01:42:39.341 --> 01:42:41.620
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many rats we would have?</v>

2187
01:42:41.621 --> 01:42:43.450
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't for these fucking cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

2188
01:42:43.451 --> 01:42:45.900
<v Speaker 1>what would you rather have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather,</v>

2189
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I think cody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're cool.</v>

2190
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I lost the chicken and one</v>

2191
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.100
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you really?</v>

2192
01:42:51.101 --> 01:42:52.210
<v Speaker 1>You got chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me chickens,</v>

2193
01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:54.460
<v Speaker 1>your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got five new ones of God.</v>

2194
01:42:54.461 --> 01:42:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you just want to any for now for</v>

2195
01:42:56.351 --> 01:42:57.970
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like pets.</v>

2196
01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.080
<v Speaker 1>So do you let them walk around the food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they eat fleas and ticks and all</v>

2197
01:43:02.081 --> 01:43:03.220
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had everything.</v>

2198
01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 1>They had all kinds of bugs there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a little dinosaurs man.</v>

2199
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:08.840
<v Speaker 1>They were really cool but you can pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>them up and,</v>

2200
01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.230
<v Speaker 1>but I got the new ones.</v>

2201
01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:13.000
<v Speaker 1>They're a little chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've actually gotten pretty big</v>

2202
01:43:13.001 --> 01:43:16.420
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy how quick they turn from a</v>

2203
01:43:16.421 --> 01:43:19.540
<v Speaker 1>chicken to like a little chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you start?</v>

2204
01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:21.480
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with the other chicks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>

2205
01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:23.500
<v Speaker 1>when the glory introduced?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's my checks.</v>

2206
01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:24.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the new ones.</v>

2207
01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.690
<v Speaker 1>These are the farm I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2208
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.150
<v Speaker 1>a large hen house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really big.</v>

2209
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 1>So they can wander around in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all protected from the coyotes.</v>

2210
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:38.710
<v Speaker 1>It's an enormous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I also let them out in the</v>

2211
01:43:38.711 --> 01:43:41.080
<v Speaker 1>yard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got to keep him away from my dog.</v>

2212
01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:44.420
<v Speaker 1>He's decided that he can kill them cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coyote talked to him.</v>

2213
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Coyote honey dictum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2214
01:43:47.651 --> 01:43:50.970
<v Speaker 1>The coyote became friends with them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then talk to them and to go in and break</v>

2215
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:53.570
<v Speaker 1>into a one of the side coops and kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>him on the chickens.</v>

2216
01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.130
<v Speaker 1>So hearsay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2217
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:57.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to take chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brewed sometimes,</v>

2218
01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:00.080
<v Speaker 1>which is they get this thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no rooster if they're not</v>

2219
01:44:00.081 --> 01:44:01.590
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2220
01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the laying these eggs for no reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's no chickens ever going to</v>

2221
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.870
<v Speaker 1>come out of those eggs and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>fertilized.</v>

2222
01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.330
<v Speaker 1>So these eggs are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just free food.</v>

2223
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It's basically the product of you giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>them food.</v>

2224
01:44:11.871 --> 01:44:13.800
<v Speaker 1>They lay an egg and you eat that egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2225
01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2226
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.900
<v Speaker 1>But the hen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they get crazy because these</v>

2227
01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.040
<v Speaker 1>eggs never become chicks so they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to like sit on the egg</v>

2228
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:24.770
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes a check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they start pulling their feathers</v>

2229
01:44:24.771 --> 01:44:27.590
<v Speaker 1>off and they do what's called brooding</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'll take a long cycle.</v>

2230
01:44:27.591 --> 01:44:29.420
<v Speaker 1>It takes like 28 days for them to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>

2231
01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Unless you catch them early in the brood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you separate them from the rest of</v>

2232
01:44:33.681 --> 01:44:35.630
<v Speaker 1>the chickens and you put them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand,</v>

2233
01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:38.060
<v Speaker 1>like were they a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put them in a smaller cage where</v>

2234
01:44:38.061 --> 01:44:39.800
<v Speaker 1>they have to stand on a bar.</v>

2235
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:42.290
<v Speaker 1>And once they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not in a nasty,</v>

2236
01:44:42.291 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 1>not sitting in a nesting box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2237
01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 1>it goes through the cycle and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

2238
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:48.590
<v Speaker 1>they're little simple little reptile</v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

2239
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.560
<v Speaker 1>And then you bring them back into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken coop and they act like a regular</v>

2240
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But otherwise they think it's like a</v>

2241
01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 1>health problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't eat.</v>

2242
01:44:54.710 --> 01:44:55.820
<v Speaker 1>They start pulling their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2243
01:44:55.821 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2244
01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:58.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feathers off of their body.</v>

2245
01:44:58.611 --> 01:45:00.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets really weird.</v>

2246
01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So I had them separated and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog,</v>

2247
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I have a huge dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coyote talk the dog and to knocking</v>

2248
01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:08.300
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2249
01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:11.270
<v Speaker 1>the chicken coop to get out the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the kyle probably wouldn't be able</v>

2250
01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 1>to do it on its own because it's not big</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2251
01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.860
<v Speaker 1>But my dog is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the,</v>

2252
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:19.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Dichter my fucking dumb ass dog.</v>

2253
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:23.720
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came and he's like,</v>

2254
01:45:23.721 --> 01:45:24.890

<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2256
01:45:26.051 --> 01:45:29.300
<v Speaker 1>you're a coyote technically just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>house pet.</v>

2257
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:30.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got fun too.</v>

2258
01:45:30.471 --> 01:45:33.230
<v Speaker 1>They can fuck dogs and coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all the time.</v>

2259
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He duked them.</v>

2260
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:45:36.081 --> 01:45:36.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2262
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.230
<v Speaker 1>we ran into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was filming fear factor wants,</v>

2263
01:45:39.231 --> 01:45:42.540
<v Speaker 1>we're filming on this real rural area</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2264
01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:46.700
<v Speaker 1>these people had a bunch of puppies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were half coyote and have labrador.</v>

2265
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2266
01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Coyote came over and fuck their dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2267
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:52.710
<v Speaker 1>that was out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Like a dirty criminal sneaking into yard</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucking your daughter like,</v>

2269
01:45:56.391 --> 01:45:58.850
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little escape convict.</v>

2270
01:45:59.080 --> 01:45:59.913
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

2271
01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you hanging out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] it was cold out too.</v>

2272
01:46:04.271 --> 01:46:06.250
<v Speaker 1>And these puppies were all huddled up</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and we were like,</v>

2273
01:46:06.251 --> 01:46:09.280
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is now what are you</v>

2274
01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:10.660
<v Speaker 1>guys going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to give them away and</v>

2275
01:46:10.661 --> 01:46:12.750
<v Speaker 1>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have fuck fucking Eddie.</v>

2276
01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is that kind of eat my</v>

2277
01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:17.590
<v Speaker 1>newborn too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing because they really</v>

2278
01:46:17.591 --> 01:46:19.030
<v Speaker 1>are all bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>

2279
01:46:19.031 --> 01:46:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Everything's a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they can all breed with each</v>

2280
01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:22.660
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>

2281
01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:24.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2282
01:46:24.131 --> 01:46:29.131
<v Speaker 1>a hippo can't breathe with an elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a wolf can fuck a Chihuahua and may</v>

2283
01:46:30.661 --> 01:46:33.040
<v Speaker 1>get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero dogs.</v>

2284
01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all dogs come from wolves.</v>

2285
01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.070
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if a,</v>

2286
01:46:39.071 --> 01:46:41.200
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a wolf could figure out how to fit</v>

2287
01:46:41.201 --> 01:46:45.130
<v Speaker 1>his dick and a Chihuahua and shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 1>load in that Chihuahua,</v>

2288
01:46:45.970 --> 01:46:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the Chihuahua,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could conceivably have wolf Chihuahua</v>

2289
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.500
<v Speaker 1>puppies.</v>

2290
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2291
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And what would it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's again,</v>

2292

<v Speaker 1>real common with animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get it's Mites and the Mites.</v>

2317
01:47:52.711 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 1>That's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>

2318
01:47:53.791 --> 01:47:56.820
<v Speaker 1>they developed this horrible skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease and they lose all their hair and</v>

01:47:56.821 --> 01:48:01.050
<v Speaker 1>their skin becomes black and fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gets burnt by the sun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:14.940

<v Speaker 1>wolf bear rather that has manged to</v>

2332
01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:35.400
<v Speaker 1>chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it sometimes too.</v>

2333

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2335
01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:40.020
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times that's what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them too.</v>

2336
01:48:40.021 --> 01:48:42.480
<v Speaker 1>They've got mange.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she had mange and um,</v>

01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:50.210
<v Speaker 1>they gave me this like ointment to get,</v>

<v Speaker 1>of shampoo.</v>

2341
01:48:54.871 --> 01:48:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And then within like a couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the mains was gone,</v>

2342
01:48:57.931 --> 01:48:59.850

<v Speaker 1>If you saw that man,</v>

2347
01:49:09.271 --> 01:49:11.040
<v Speaker 1>if you saw something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't sign person,</v>

2348
01:49:11.041 --> 01:49:12.570
<v Speaker 1>but if I saw something that freak out.</v>

2349
01:49:12.690 --> 01:49:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think it is a market spinsters</v>

2350
01:49:14.401 --> 01:49:15.430
<v Speaker 1>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2351
01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why the Mexicans believe in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>troop of Cobra.</v>

2352
01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:19.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's there.</v>

2353
01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:24.360
<v Speaker 1>But they can see that where big foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>though because the coyotes will fucking</v>

2354
01:49:24.361 --> 01:49:25.980

<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2355
01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably the he kill a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2356
01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:29.580
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2357
01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:30.683
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2358
01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:33.690
<v Speaker 1>they killed this girl in Toronto a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years back.</v>

2359
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:37.650
<v Speaker 1>It was a 19 year old singer from when</v>
<v Speaker 1>she should a country music singer.</v>

2360
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:43.070
<v Speaker 1>It was really promising young artists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto and she's going for a walk and</v>

2361
01:49:43.461 --> 01:49:46.080
<v Speaker 1>they killed her in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2362
01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:48.700
<v Speaker 1>during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad way to die too,</v>

2363
01:49:48.701 --> 01:49:49.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2364
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:52.210
<v Speaker 1>because they you asshole first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2365
01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tear you apart,</v>

2366
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.860
<v Speaker 1>it tear you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if for some reason coyotes,</v>

2367
01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.450
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they kill a deer,</v>

2368
01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.300
<v Speaker 1>and I'm assuming they do the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they kill a human being,</v>

2369
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:02.490
<v Speaker 1>they start with your asshole.</v>

2370
01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.570
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure that they tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffocate.</v>

2371
01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2372
01:50:07.391 --> 01:50:08.224
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2373
01:50:08.530 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 1>They just started tearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might just start ripping you apart</v>

2374
01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:12.580
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they felt like it could</v>

2375
01:50:12.581 --> 01:50:15.190
<v Speaker 1>hold you down because wolves do that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals all the time.</v>

2376
01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 1>They just chew what their legs bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>them down and then you start pulling</v>

2377
01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:21.940
<v Speaker 1>them apart while they're still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:50:21.941 --> 01:50:26.290
<v Speaker 1>My buddy found a moose that was getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked by wolves and they found it,</v>

2379
01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it looked like it had been getting</v>

2380
01:50:28.841 --> 01:50:32.350
<v Speaker 1>chewed on for over a day and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>still alive.</v>

2381
01:50:32.670 --> 01:50:35.230
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moose was all fucked up and half of its</v>

2382
01:50:35.231 --> 01:50:37.210
<v Speaker 1>hindquarters were chewed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these wolves,</v>

2383
01:50:37.211 --> 01:50:40.900
<v Speaker 1>we're just pulling it apart slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had been eating it for a day.</v>

2384
01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still alive.</v>

2385
01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2386
01:50:46.130 --> 01:50:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a settler just going around and</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really did.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2439
01:53:32.010 --> 01:53:33.920

<v Speaker 4>opportunity to go and view any culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the past?</v>

2442
01:53:40.821 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Like if you could be completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>invisible and walk around amongst the</v>

2443
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:48.791

<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2481
01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:43.320
<v Speaker 4>When the people came from Spain and</v>
<v Speaker 4>landed in the West indies,</v>

2482
01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:44.010

<v Speaker 1>The West indies and they encountered the</v>

2485
01:55:49.921 --> 01:55:53.700
<v Speaker 1>people that were living there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The native people that I think that I</v>

2486
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:56.640

<v Speaker 1>future of the world and I want to know</v>

2489
01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:07.650
<v Speaker 1>the why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we wanted spices and shit.</v>

2490
01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It was what they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted gold and salt.</v>

2491
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:13.740

2496
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:23.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen overnight where you</v>

2497
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:26.820
<v Speaker 1>wear your running after something with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick or you just eat any farming than</v>

2498
01:56:26.821 --> 01:56:28.470
<v Speaker 1>wall somewhere in a classroom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like the fittest one tribe is now</v>
<v Speaker 1>starving and now I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2504
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:49.920
<v Speaker 1>The king wants to bring back more gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he commissioned a fleet and he</v>

2505
01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:53.610
<v Speaker 1>hires a captain and he promises that</v>
<v Speaker 1>captain riches beyond his wildest</v>

2506
01:56:53.611 --> 01:56:55.950
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to these foreign lands,</v>

2507
01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.890
<v Speaker 1>bring back salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these fucking people would get in</v>

2508
01:56:58.891 --> 01:57:03.891
<v Speaker 1>these wooden crafts that barely had</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough food for them to survive and make</v>

2509
01:57:04.561 --> 01:57:07.110
<v Speaker 1>it across that goofy ass ocean where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>idea what the fuck was coming.</v>

2512
01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:16.260

<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them didn't make it</v>

2513
01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:21.240

<v Speaker 1>People find them all the time and they</v>

2517
01:57:27.721 --> 01:57:29.940

<v Speaker 1>they found like Roman coins are men and</v>

2520
01:57:36.241 --> 01:57:40.080
<v Speaker 1>a gold worth $1 billion or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that off the coast of this place or</v>

2521
01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:43.120
<v Speaker 1>that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The power of grade.</v>

2522
01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought back too much gold and</v>

2523
01:57:46.041 --> 01:57:47.660
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking raft saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of that.</v>

2524
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:51.780
<v Speaker 1>How desperate are you to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2525
01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:53.880
<v Speaker 1>we're running out of places to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold.</v>

2526
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just fucking,</v>

2527
01:57:55.891 --> 01:57:58.020
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard people who've died who</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives a fuck,</v>

2528
01:57:58.021 --> 01:58:00.300
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's be headed fucking people,</v>

2529
01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:03.120
<v Speaker 1>but kind of get them gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how desperate,</v>

2530
01:58:03.121 --> 01:58:05.760
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how desperate you got to be to go,</v>

2531
01:58:06.150 --> 01:58:08.280
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start hitting other</v>

2532
01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:11.340
<v Speaker 1>countries and fucking fight and Hindu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we got to do.</v>

2533
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Think about how terrifying it must be to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a boat filled with gold and you're</v>

2534
01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:19.890
<v Speaker 1>trying to bring it back to Spain and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize you brought too much gold and</v>

2535
01:58:19.891 --> 01:58:22.890
<v Speaker 1>the boat starts going under and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the ocean,</v>

2536
01:58:22.891 --> 01:58:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but you can't throw the gold overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's discussions saw,</v>

2537
01:58:26.250 --> 01:58:30.450
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get rid of some of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold and you're looking out and it's</v>

2538
01:58:30.451 --> 01:58:31.350
<v Speaker 1>dark out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2539
01:58:31.351 --> 01:58:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just the blackening of sea and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water is slowly leaking into the panels</v>

2540
01:58:36.091 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the galley at the bottom of the boat.</v>

2541
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 1>We can't keep taking this on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got</v>

2542
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 4>to get rid of this fucking gold and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a sword fight and there and they</v>

2543
01:58:45.611 --> 01:58:49.450
<v Speaker 4>duke it out and they all wind up dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All chopped up and bleeding in the</v>

2544
01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:51.580
<v Speaker 4>fucking boat just sinks to the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they had,</v>

2545
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:54.370
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't make a decision whether or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not they should throw the gold</v>

2546
01:58:54.371 --> 01:58:58.080
<v Speaker 4>overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pawned it</v>

2547
01:58:59.950 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 4>even today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could drop a gps pin,</v>

2548
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:03.610
<v Speaker 4>but what are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the guarantees?</v>

2549
01:59:03.611 --> 01:59:06.310
<v Speaker 4>You could go back to that location and</v>
<v Speaker 4>retrieve it.</v>

2550
01:59:06.490 --> 01:59:10.300
<v Speaker 4>What if you dropped it at the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Marianas trench and it's a mile and</v>

2551
01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.133
<v Speaker 4>a half down?</v>

2552
01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:14.350
<v Speaker 4>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

2553
01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Good luck fishing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to,</v>

2554
01:59:15.850 --> 01:59:16.271
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool,</v>

2555
01:59:16.271 --> 01:59:17.260
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got a treble hook.</v>

2556
01:59:17.261 --> 01:59:20.170
<v Speaker 4>My Dad's kind of like a deep sea salt</v>
<v Speaker 4>water set up.</v>

2557
01:59:21.110 --> 01:59:26.110
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dad's got the ultimate set of tools</v>

2558
01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:30.330
<v Speaker 4>to the fishing pole and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>

2559
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 4>If I hold my breath like a champ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to get under that water</v>

2560
01:59:33.341 --> 01:59:37.090
<v Speaker 4>and bring up one coin at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2561
01:59:37.091 --> 01:59:41.260
<v Speaker 4>like they died because they were greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They died because their boats sank with</v>

2562
01:59:41.261 --> 01:59:43.090
<v Speaker 4>too much gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man,</v>

2563
01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.810
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe the boat just sank and it just</v>

2564
01:59:46.811 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 4>so happens and a lot of gold on board</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of times they made it with</v>

2565
01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:50.770
<v Speaker 4>that much coal on board.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2566
01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there weren't any fucking engineers</v>

2567
01:59:53.861 --> 01:59:57.880
<v Speaker 4>that had done stress tests on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2568
01:59:57.881 --> 01:59:58.880
<v Speaker 4>How much water to go.</v>

2569
01:59:59.830 --> 02:00:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and under pressure.</v>

2570
02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we live in such easy times.</v>

2571
02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Just carry credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2572
02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.120
<v Speaker 4>But I liked that whole concept at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals are coming back.</v>

2573
02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:11.500
<v Speaker 4>They're coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2574
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:14.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at Florida,</v>

2575
02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:16.000
<v Speaker 4>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2576
02:00:16.090 --> 02:00:19.900
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about living there in 1977</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about a very short period</v>

2577
02:00:19.901 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 4>of time between now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not that long.</v>

2578
02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:24.490
<v Speaker 4>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not,</v>

2579
02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:29.860
<v Speaker 4>no 40 years is not long at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you talking about biology to short</v>

2580
02:00:29.861 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 4>amount of time for a radical change like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that for an animal to go from endangered</v>

2581
02:00:34.241 --> 02:00:37.840
<v Speaker 4>to ultra prevalent and eating people on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a regular basis.</v>

2582
02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of even this,</v>

2583
02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:42.310
<v Speaker 4>the girl that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2584
02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.010
<v Speaker 4>I guess she's an African,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that,</v>

2585
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:48.370
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know if that just kept it</v>
<v Speaker 4>quiet or secret or whatever.</v>

2586
02:00:48.850 --> 02:00:50.680
<v Speaker 4>And maybe it's happened many times in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the past,</v>

2587
02:00:50.681 --> 02:00:53.740
<v Speaker 4>but this one particular time the chick</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in the front seat,</v>

2588
02:00:54.230 --> 02:00:58.270
<v Speaker 4>she's taking pictures and their windows</v>
<v Speaker 4>down and the lion just,</v>

2589
02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:01.780
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lily would have grabbed her and pulled</v>

2590
02:01:01.781 --> 02:01:03.800
<v Speaker 4>her out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just killed in front of everybody</v>

2591
02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.740
<v Speaker 4>had done that was the game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 4>editor</v>

2592
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:08.620
<v Speaker 4>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2593
02:01:08.621 --> 02:01:10.180
<v Speaker 4>She was an editor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2594
02:01:10.181 --> 02:01:12.250
<v Speaker 4>my game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2595
02:01:13.670 --> 02:01:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they told her not to roll the</v>
<v Speaker 4>window down to,</v>

2596
02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:17.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's just so tempting.</v>

2597
02:01:17.861 --> 02:01:20.740
<v Speaker 4>You feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in that car with the lions saw</v>

2598
02:01:20.741 --> 02:01:22.810
<v Speaker 4>that opening and there's a female lion</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2599
02:01:23.250 --> 02:01:24.610
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>

2600
02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tell you when you go over there.</v>

2601
02:01:27.610 --> 02:01:28.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tell you,</v>

2602
02:01:28.841 --> 02:01:29.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

2603
02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:33.810
<v Speaker 4>they think it's just a big animal so</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not really gonna.</v>

2604
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:37.240
<v Speaker 4>He's just got to stay still and don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>

2605
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Don't make any checking what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2606
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:41.330
<v Speaker 4>and he'll think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2607
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:44.750
<v Speaker 4>a big animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's your sales pitch.</v>

2608
02:01:44.751 --> 02:01:49.751
<v Speaker 4>You're sitting there in the open and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lines looking at you going,</v>

2609
02:01:50.590 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 4>he's just thinks he's not going to jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 4>they told me they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would have told me if people have</v>

2611
02:01:55.521 --> 02:01:56.510
<v Speaker 4>been eating before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I would want to be in the back of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>helicopter.</v>

2613
02:01:59.270 --> 02:02:02.090
<v Speaker 4>Like that scene in Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're Jesse Ventura has got the gun</v>

2621
02:02:24.981 --> 02:02:25.400
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing.</v>

2622
02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.600
<v Speaker 4>It's sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pictures later,</v>

2623
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:29.360
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

2626
02:02:34.461 --> 02:02:38.450

<v Speaker 4>It's horrifying.</v>

2633
02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:02.660
<v Speaker 4>You sitting there with you fucking mets</v>
<v Speaker 4>shirt on and listen to some good music</v>

2634
02:03:02.661 --> 02:03:07.520
<v Speaker 4>on your ipod and it just pause through</v>
<v Speaker 4>that window and digs those closet deep</v>

2635
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:11.840
<v Speaker 4>into the fucking bones in your ribs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>carries you off like,</v>

2636
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:15.290
<v Speaker 4>like when you pick up a little pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shashimi where the chopstick,</v>

2637
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:17.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that simple.</v>

2638
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:18.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2639
02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Does even you come right out of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>window in a second would take you 10</v>

2640
02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:26.360
<v Speaker 4>minutes to climb out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's why we all need guns.</v>

2641
02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.880
<v Speaker 4>The lineups are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that after shootings</v>

2642
02:03:36.051 --> 02:03:39.770
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sales in guns go up?</v>

2643
02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:40.671
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2644
02:03:40.671 --> 02:03:41.660
<v Speaker 4>100% guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2645
02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:44.390
<v Speaker 4>People get scared too when all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rhetoric starts getting around about</v>

2646
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:46.910
<v Speaker 4>ending the second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking away people's rights to guns.</v>

2647
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the best thing in the world for</v>

2648
02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:50.690
<v Speaker 4>ammunition companies and rifle</v>
<v Speaker 4>companies.</v>

2649
02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:52.790
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a video that people are throwing</v>

2650
02:03:52.791 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 4>around on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2651
02:03:54.951 --> 02:03:56.360
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is true.</v>

2652
02:03:56.630 --> 02:03:58.970
<v Speaker 4>There's a a peep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people from another country,</v>

2653
02:03:58.971 --> 02:04:01.460
<v Speaker 4>they're speaking a foreign language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're talking in front of a lion</v>

2654
02:04:01.461 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 4>carcass and they've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're taking a photo and then another</v>

2655
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:06.380
<v Speaker 4>line comes in Jackson off camera.</v>

2656
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:08.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it looks so fake.</v>

2657
02:04:09.050 --> 02:04:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks so convenient.</v>

2658
02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:13.940
<v Speaker 4>Like the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the framing of it where the lion gets</v>

2659
02:04:13.941 --> 02:04:17.380
<v Speaker 4>into frame and then jumps over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>camera to get the persons,</v>

2660
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:20.150
<v Speaker 4>they scream and you hear the noises in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the background.</v>

2661
02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.500
<v Speaker 4>I watched.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2662
02:04:21.501 --> 02:04:23.720

<v Speaker 4>this is a way to theatrical.</v>

2663
02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:26.540
<v Speaker 4>It's way too well framed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This has gotta be bullshit.</v>

2664
02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:30.470
<v Speaker 4>That was my initial instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but was interesting.</v>

2665
02:04:30.590 --> 02:04:31.730

<v Speaker 4>I can't replay it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll,</v>

2688
02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:29.740
<v Speaker 4>it'll replay itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ran straight to the person who had</v>

2689
02:05:29.741 --> 02:05:32.440
<v Speaker 4>the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is their house and nobody can cross</v>

2690
02:05:32.441 --> 02:05:34.030
<v Speaker 4>that line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so hilarious.</v>

2691
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:39.550
<v Speaker 4>See the line comes back into focus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that at all.</v>

2692
02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.440
<v Speaker 4>I just think that's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I see it again?</v>

2693
02:05:41.441 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I think you're going to see shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see her.</v>

2694
02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:46.250
<v Speaker 4>I got to watch her yet.</v>

2695
02:05:49.810 --> 02:05:52.470
<v Speaker 7>I'll just check the Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hi Kay.</v>

2696
02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:56.240
<v Speaker 7>It's what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can I be good stuff?</v>

2697
02:05:58.710 --> 02:06:00.960
<v Speaker 4>No did she would have never.</v>

2698
02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:05.410
<v Speaker 10>All</v>
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>

2699
02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Lion comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he all those things.</v>

2700
02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:20.460
<v Speaker 4>There's so much off their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all why did the line just</v>

2701
02:06:20.461 --> 02:06:22.050
<v Speaker 4>abandon these people that are shooting</v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

2702
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:24.540
<v Speaker 4>Did it kill them and walk off real</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick?</v>

2703
02:06:24.570 --> 02:06:26.790
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make sense cause there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>two of them.</v>

2704
02:06:27.090 --> 02:06:30.370
<v Speaker 4>If it killed two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it would have killed one and rag</v>

2705
02:06:30.371 --> 02:06:32.670
<v Speaker 4>doll that around a little bit and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>God to the second one.</v>

2706
02:06:32.850 --> 02:06:36.780
<v Speaker 4>It would have taken longer than 10 or 15</v>
<v Speaker 4>seconds and you can add that side effect</v>

2707
02:06:36.781 --> 02:06:38.510
<v Speaker 4>and it's a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2708
02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:41.550
<v Speaker 4>And then the rifle went off and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just nothing happened and that they</v>

2709
02:06:41.551 --> 02:06:42.570
<v Speaker 4>missed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

2710
02:06:42.630 --> 02:06:45.690
<v Speaker 4>They miss twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff seems fake.</v>

2711
02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:49.320
<v Speaker 4>Just the framing is the big one and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're acting.</v>

2712
02:06:49.321 --> 02:06:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Seems like shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought they were speaking another</v>

2713
02:06:51.121 --> 02:06:53.820
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently the speaking English,</v>

2714
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.280
<v Speaker 4>but that goes back to in order to think</v>
<v Speaker 4>about things like that show,</v>

2715
02:06:58.290 --> 02:07:03.120
<v Speaker 4>I literally sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humans will believe anything.</v>

2716
02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:05.910
<v Speaker 4>We're not even a thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The will just believe it.</v>

2717
02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2718
02:07:06.781 --> 02:07:08.670
<v Speaker 4>it's the video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw it,</v>

2719
02:07:08.850 --> 02:07:10.110
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2720
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:13.020
<v Speaker 4>That's also like a smart video to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause that's what people want to see.</v>

2721
02:07:13.021 --> 02:07:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Like people hate trophy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hate this idea that people go over</v>

2722
02:07:16.021 --> 02:07:20.520
<v Speaker 4>there and shoot these lines and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>prop them up and look big smile on their</v>

2723
02:07:20.521 --> 02:07:24.300
<v Speaker 4>face next to some weird animal that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>just shot some majestic beast.</v>

2724
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>

2725
02:07:25.741 --> 02:07:27.540
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all weird.</v>

2726
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:31.670
<v Speaker 4>What's weird too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people are celebrating that this is</v>

2727
02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:35.590
<v Speaker 4>fucking lion came by and jacked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went after the lady with the gun.</v>

2728
02:07:35.770 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2729
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.680
<v Speaker 1>like everybody's like all happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comments,</v>

2730
02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:42.490
<v Speaker 1>comments are all happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not into killing lions,</v>

2731
02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:45.190
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not in the lions killing</v>

2732
02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>people and I don't think that it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2733
02:07:47.351 --> 02:07:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not a revenge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2734
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:51.580
<v Speaker 1>that line would have killed them no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what they,</v>

2735
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:53.950
<v Speaker 1>they killed their lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

2736
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2737
02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

2738
02:07:58.451 --> 02:08:03.451
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit there and I'll go like hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me fee like hunting,</v>

2739
02:08:06.110 --> 02:08:10.000
<v Speaker 1>finding out like teas on a reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you aren't going lion hunting or</v>

2740
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:11.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone owns the land,</v>

2741
02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:12.611
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2742
02:08:12.611 --> 02:08:16.510
<v Speaker 1>most of these things are a high fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>operations where they have these lines</v>

2743
02:08:16.511 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 1>are fenced in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2744
02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And they go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a cheap shot.</v>

2745
02:08:20.051 --> 02:08:22.380
<v Speaker 1>To me it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2746
02:08:22.570 --> 02:08:27.570
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like shooting Ligo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous pet that someone has.</v>

2747
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But technically they're free.</v>

2748
02:08:30.071 --> 02:08:33.120
<v Speaker 1>But are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are not free.</v>

2749
02:08:33.130 --> 02:08:34.330
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some sanding and Africa.</v>

2750
02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:35.960
<v Speaker 1>They'd been caught and they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2751
02:08:35.961 --> 02:08:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we really breed them in the wild in</v>

2752
02:08:38.981 --> 02:08:39.461
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2753
02:08:39.461 --> 02:08:41.770
<v Speaker 1>these enclosures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not in the wild.</v>

2754
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 1>In captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they breed them and then they release.</v>

2755
02:08:44.441 --> 02:08:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they release them and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions have a very specific area that the</v>

2756
02:08:49.230 --> 02:08:51.670
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they release him the lines on</v>

2757
02:08:51.671 --> 02:08:52.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to go.</v>

2758
02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:54.940
<v Speaker 1>So they just hang out and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they release him,</v>

2759
02:08:54.941 --> 02:08:58.930
<v Speaker 1>then in the morning the hunter in quotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out and sees this line just</v>

2760
02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:01.030
<v Speaker 1>hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the line doesn't have anywhere to</v>

2761
02:09:01.031 --> 02:09:02.410
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't belong there.</v>

2762
02:09:02.411 --> 02:09:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not as territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exactly know what to do.</v>

2763
02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:07.810
<v Speaker 1>So he just finds a place to lie down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he'll go under a tree and just lay</v>

2764
02:09:07.811 --> 02:09:10.210
<v Speaker 1>there and then walk over and shoot these</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions.</v>

2765
02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:13.090
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2766
02:09:13.091 --> 02:09:14.410
<v Speaker 1>what is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2767
02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>that is barely hunting under the loosest</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible definition of the term bear.</v>

2768
02:09:21.131 --> 02:09:25.600
<v Speaker 1>It's barely hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Know Lion Lions?</v>

2769
02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Video's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2770
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I knew it so he can't get me bitch.</v>

2771
02:09:32.710 --> 02:09:35.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a real person is Yolanda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2772
02:09:35.831 --> 02:09:39.190
<v Speaker 1>that's why it looked odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I thought it was almost like a fake</v>

2773
02:09:39.191 --> 02:09:44.191
<v Speaker 1>line deadline might be in the faith part</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they might've actually moving line</v>

2774
02:09:44.201 --> 02:09:45.040
<v Speaker 1>might've been real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2775
02:09:45.130 --> 02:09:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll read more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

2776
02:09:47.111 --> 02:09:48.850
<v Speaker 1>But you know what's weird about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing?</v>

2777
02:09:48.851 --> 02:09:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after Cecil the lion got killed in</v>

2778
02:09:50.651 --> 02:09:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they have to kill 200 lions because</v>

2779
02:09:54.491 --> 02:09:57.640
<v Speaker 1>they have an excess of lions because</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to go there.</v>

2780
02:09:57.670 --> 02:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to hunt lines anymore</v>

2781
02:10:00.401 --> 02:10:03.970
<v Speaker 1>because the blow back that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced from this cecil thing.</v>

2782
02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a sas in the cecil thing.</v>

2783
02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.070
<v Speaker 1>You know that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dentist that killed that famous</v>

2784
02:10:09.071 --> 02:10:09.910
<v Speaker 1>lion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2785
02:10:09.911 --> 02:10:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cecil the lion.</v>

2786
02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that whole outrage was really</v>

2787
02:10:14.021 --> 02:10:16.090
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody got nuts about that.</v>

2788
02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:19.490
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted to go there to hunt so</v>

2789
02:10:19.491 --> 02:10:22.780
<v Speaker 1>that they have the lines that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>decimating the undulate population.</v>

2790
02:10:23.110 --> 02:10:28.110
<v Speaker 1>So they had to kill 200 lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 lines that would have brought them,</v>

2791
02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:32.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they get $50,000 a lion when,</v>

2792
02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 1>when hunter comes and pays</v>

2793
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.530
<v Speaker 4>to hunt the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So think about that shit.</v>

2794
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:38.720
<v Speaker 4>They like losing my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucked up place.</v>

2795
02:10:38.721 --> 02:10:42.550
<v Speaker 4>Man is a crazy place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis Theroux has a beautiful document,</v>

2796
02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 4>if you've never heard me Yap about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

2797
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:47.270
<v Speaker 4>but it's a documentary about him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's he,</v>

2798
02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.050
<v Speaker 4>it's on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Him going on this African hunting</v>

2799
02:10:51.051 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 4>expedition with all these Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really strange,</v>

2800
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:57.980
<v Speaker 4>really strange jungle street wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the same that not some sentence.</v>

2801
02:10:57.981 --> 02:11:00.740
<v Speaker 4>So it sounds like fricking jungles treat</v>
<v Speaker 4>wars with the animals,</v>

2802
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:02.630
<v Speaker 4>but if you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2803
02:11:02.631 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 4>people get mad here because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>live like that.</v>

2804
02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:08.930
<v Speaker 4>They haven't seen well until like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lando,</v>

2805
02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:14.060
<v Speaker 4>you haven't seen a wild animal snatch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A family member,</v>

2806
02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:15.530
<v Speaker 4>a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2807
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:19.310
<v Speaker 4>A child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're accustomed to like whatever</v>

2808
02:11:19.311 --> 02:11:21.620
<v Speaker 4>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing tears me to pieces.</v>

2809
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:24.920
<v Speaker 4>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember my mom getting eaten by that</v>

2810
02:11:24.921 --> 02:11:25.580
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so yeah.</v>

2811
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:27.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no problem selling him off.</v>

2812
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:29.300
<v Speaker 4>Taking that thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2813
02:11:29.301 --> 02:11:30.250
<v Speaker 4>there was a recent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2814
02:11:30.270 --> 02:11:33.050
<v Speaker 4>there's this guy named Jim shockey and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got this great show called</v>

2815
02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:35.390
<v Speaker 4>uncharted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just sort of an adventure,</v>

2816
02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:39.560
<v Speaker 4>travels all over the world and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>hired him to go to Mozambique because</v>

2817
02:11:39.561 --> 02:11:41.870
<v Speaker 4>all these people were getting killed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>crocodiles.</v>

2818
02:11:42.170 --> 02:11:44.120
<v Speaker 4>So he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes to Mozambique to hunt</v>

2819
02:11:44.121 --> 02:11:45.590
<v Speaker 4>crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And while they were there,</v>

2820
02:11:45.591 --> 02:11:47.930
<v Speaker 4>someone in the camp got killed and eaten</v>
<v Speaker 4>by a crocodile.</v>

2821
02:11:47.931 --> 02:11:50.630
<v Speaker 4>Some woman was washing clothes and get</v>
<v Speaker 4>dragged into the water.</v>

2822
02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:54.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talked to them and like those,</v>

2823
02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:56.960
<v Speaker 4>those people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have any problem with someone</v>

2824
02:11:56.961 --> 02:11:59.180
<v Speaker 4>coming over and shooting a crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2825
02:11:59.510 --> 02:12:01.460
<v Speaker 4>Cause they said this said they see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2826
02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:02.930
<v Speaker 4>There'll be no protests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2827
02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:05.960
<v Speaker 4>We don't make movies about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an article in the New York</v>

2828
02:12:05.961 --> 02:12:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Times after the cecil thing by someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Zimbabwe that said in Zimbabwe we</v>

2829
02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:11.570
<v Speaker 4>do not cry for lions.</v>

2830
02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:14.840
<v Speaker 4>And it talked about how all the family</v>
<v Speaker 4>members that had been terrorized,</v>

2831
02:12:14.841 --> 02:12:17.360
<v Speaker 4>all the people they knew that had been</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually killed by lions.</v>

2832
02:12:17.361 --> 02:12:21.110
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you guys have this fucking lions</v>

2833
02:12:21.111 --> 02:12:23.360
<v Speaker 4>king version of what's going on over</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

2834
02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:24.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even then,</v>

2835
02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:26.390
<v Speaker 4>still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want anybody to shoot a lion.</v>

2836
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:28.180
<v Speaker 4>Just seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like anything.</v>

2837
02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Then they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what weren't they move?</v>

2838
02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know the conditions they are.</v>

2839
02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:34.290
<v Speaker 4>You don't know how far they have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they got to go across the desert or</v>

2840
02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.300
<v Speaker 4>where you can't say anything to you live</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that to live that way of life that</v>

2841
02:12:40.611 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 4>tries me nuts and people just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you know it's going on over there.</v>

2842
02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:47.870
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't send far away.</v>

2843
02:12:47.910 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 4>It's so different than anything we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever even possibly imagine happening in</v>

2844
02:12:52.251 --> 02:12:53.930
<v Speaker 4>North America did.</v>

2845
02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm just worried about my teenagers get</v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnant and my mom's kind of been an id</v>

2846
02:13:00.381 --> 02:13:01.430
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so wow.</v>

2847
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:05.060
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to kick her out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of her assistant living.</v>

2848
02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because she's running out of money and</v>

2849
02:13:08.091 --> 02:13:11.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her medicare kicked in and all of a</v>

2850
02:13:11.691 --> 02:13:12.351
<v Speaker 4>sudden they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>wait till you medicare so you gotta find</v>

2852
02:13:15.471 --> 02:13:16.510

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2853
02:13:16.530 --> 02:13:17.780
<v Speaker 4>she'd been here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2854
02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.380
<v Speaker 4>that's why sometimes when I go in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>direction,</v>

2855
02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:24.260
<v Speaker 4>I love going there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the end of the day,</v>

2856
02:13:24.590 --> 02:13:27.440
<v Speaker 4>my stance is always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I,</v>

2857
02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:30.530
<v Speaker 4>so now watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2858
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 4>just what I love the fascination of</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking of it all.</v>

2859
02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 4>A crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It always,</v>

2860
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to take out the garbage.</v>

2861
02:13:39.931 --> 02:13:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Now let's talk to this kid about fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing this and see if I can find some</v>

2862
02:13:44.071 --> 02:13:47.610
<v Speaker 4>way for my mother alive for another</v>
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>

2863
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:50.370
<v Speaker 4>It just shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2864
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be worried about Cecil.</v>

2865
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:54.180
<v Speaker 4>So that worried about fucking cecil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:13:54.670 --> 02:13:58.170
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel horrible and bad events at the</v>

2867
02:13:58.170 --> 02:14:00.270
<v Speaker 4>end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't control this.</v>

2868
02:14:00.271 --> 02:14:02.630
<v Speaker 4>It's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe I can,</v>

2869
02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:04.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2870
02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:07.620
<v Speaker 4>But I like thinking about all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2871
02:14:07.621 --> 02:14:09.150
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual variables,</v>

2872
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 4>when you stopped thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>

2873
02:14:11.370 --> 02:14:14.910
<v Speaker 4>they get real grim and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to to get better.</v>

2874
02:14:14.911 --> 02:14:16.220
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not even that,</v>

2875
02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:18.870
<v Speaker 4>like your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as I'm getting older,</v>

2876
02:14:18.871 --> 02:14:20.250
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I'm realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2877
02:14:20.251 --> 02:14:22.800
<v Speaker 4>get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if I work out hard,</v>

2878
02:14:23.010 --> 02:14:25.350
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking harder and harder to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2879
02:14:25.770 --> 02:14:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Like slowly but surely my body's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to do all this stuff</v>

2880
02:14:29.161 --> 02:14:30.180
<v Speaker 4>that I wanted to do anymore.</v>

2881
02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:33.120
<v Speaker 4>But it's just not going to work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter how much discipline I</v>

2882
02:14:33.121 --> 02:14:34.680
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how well I eat,</v>

2883
02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.980
<v Speaker 4>it just there's gonna come a point in</v>
<v Speaker 4>time where things just don't work</v>

2884
02:14:37.981 --> 02:14:41.160
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the fact that's the reality of</v>

2885
02:14:41.161 --> 02:14:41.994
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2886
02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:45.750
<v Speaker 4>You wake up stiff like Oh and everyday</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to wake up a little more</v>

2887
02:14:45.751 --> 02:14:47.340
<v Speaker 4>stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little more stiff,</v>

2888
02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:52.540
<v Speaker 4>a little more stiff than the monster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little more and it doesn't go away in</v>

2889
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:55.950
<v Speaker 4>a day or how many times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the chiropractor and now I'm going to</v>

2903
02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:41.490
<v Speaker 4>completely trustworthy.</v>

2910
02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:56.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she would,</v>

2911
02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:01.050
<v Speaker 4>she would take the other thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would bounce her out and she went there</v>

2912
02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:07.220
<v Speaker 4>and they gave her the wrong thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrong dose and she came home and she</v>

2913
02:16:09.421 --> 02:16:12.070
<v Speaker 4>looked like she looked like the creature</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the black lagoon.</v>

2914
02:16:12.071 --> 02:16:14.880
<v Speaker 4>She started getting lumps all over her</v>
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

2915
02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:17.190
<v Speaker 4>all over her hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

2916
02:16:17.191 --> 02:16:17.881
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

02:16:17.881 --> 02:16:19.920
<v Speaker 4>that's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2918
02:16:19.921 --> 02:16:20.820
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's normal.</v>

2919
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:22.170
<v Speaker 4>That's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2920
02:16:22.171 --> 02:16:23.490
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>

2921
02:16:23.491 --> 02:16:24.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

2922
02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:27.240
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had this side effect yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is freaking me out.</v>

2923
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Some of the things were going on with</v>
<v Speaker 4>her and charity.</v>

2924
02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 4>She had</v>

2925
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.880
<v Speaker 2>no fucking hair ready and know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awful when people go through it,</v>

2926
02:16:33.881 --> 02:16:35.160
<v Speaker 2>it looked like aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People stare.</v>

2927
02:16:35.161 --> 02:16:36.030
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my Gosh,</v>

2928
02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:41.440
<v Speaker 2>dad</v>
<v Speaker 2>can Jesus Christ,</v>

2929
02:16:41.950 --> 02:16:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I support her because she wears the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pants.</v>

2930
02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:45.660
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2931
02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:50.540
<v Speaker 2>you got that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the end of the week they</v>

2932
02:16:50.541 --> 02:16:52.210
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2933
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:54.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

2934
02:16:54.690 --> 02:16:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I just realized you got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2935
02:16:57.430 --> 02:17:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dosage was wrong and that's why,</v>

2936
02:17:00.241 --> 02:17:04.290
<v Speaker 1>and the good news is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good news is you won't need it next</v>

2937
02:17:04.291 --> 02:17:09.090
<v Speaker 1>time because you already met your needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that type of thing.</v>

2938
02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:10.920
<v Speaker 1>But it's good because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2939
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:14.670
<v Speaker 1>what you got was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they try to do is avoid any sort</v>

2940
02:17:14.671 --> 02:17:17.670
<v Speaker 1>of malpractice lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll probably,</v>

2941
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:19.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

2942
02:17:19.771 --> 02:17:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Like here's what I gave you see the x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y clips and all that.</v>

2943
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand why their</v>
<v Speaker 1>handwriting would be so shitty.</v>

2944
02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Like unless they don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're writing a prescription</v>

2945
02:17:28.441 --> 02:17:30.330
<v Speaker 1>for someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to write a prescription</v>

2946
02:17:30.331 --> 02:17:35.050
<v Speaker 1>for Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Xanax was like a lot like Zana Lama</v>

2947
02:17:35.051 --> 02:17:37.650
<v Speaker 1>thin,</v>

2948
02:17:37.651 --> 02:17:41.310
<v Speaker 1>fucking sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is how you do it and you just</v>

2949
02:17:41.311 --> 02:17:44.550
<v Speaker 1>sort of x socials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at some of the writings</v>

2950
02:17:44.551 --> 02:17:48.210

<v Speaker 1>prescription wise and you're like,</v>

2951
02:17:48.211 --> 02:17:50.340
<v Speaker 1>no one can read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can understand that there's a</v>

2952
02:17:50.341 --> 02:17:53.070
<v Speaker 1>website that charts them like bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions,</v>

2953

<v Speaker 2>of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can someone tell me why when we sign</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cleaned them out when he got divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She and he fucking hated life after that</v>

2974
02:18:57.691 --> 02:18:58.524
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2975
02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>He was so angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bitter,</v>

2976
02:19:01.530 --> 02:19:02.910
<v Speaker 1>so crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2977
02:19:02.911 --> 02:19:05.580
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do you think you could just</v>
<v Speaker 1>get by with that crazy signature?</v>

2978
02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:07.013
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2979
02:19:07.350 --> 02:19:09.050
<v Speaker 1>which you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

2980
02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who liked,</v>

2981
02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:12.780
<v Speaker 1>wanted to simplify his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very smart guy.</v>

2982
02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.350
<v Speaker 1>He decided to simplify his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how he did it.</v>

2983
02:19:16.351 --> 02:19:16.771
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2984
02:19:16.771 --> 02:19:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this crazy sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She make me sign things.</v>

2985
02:19:18.811 --> 02:19:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I think signing things is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll just do that.</v>

2986
02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:23.850
<v Speaker 1>That's my signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote it on everything,</v>

2987
02:19:24.450 --> 02:19:26.060
<v Speaker 1>but he thought he was slick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2988
02:19:26.310 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Look at this doctor's prescription.</v>

2989
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2990
02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.950
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you just give me a bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot me right in the fucking head.</v>

2991
02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:37.580
<v Speaker 4>Just this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this reading that is insane.</v>

2992
02:19:37.581 --> 02:19:40.490
<v Speaker 4>Like no one can read that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet he can't even read that.</v>

2993
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:44.780
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>7,000 people annually die from bad</v>

2994
02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:47.450
<v Speaker 4>handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It used to be way worse though.</v>

2995
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:49.910
<v Speaker 4>This is a 2006 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2996
02:19:49.911 --> 02:19:51.590
<v Speaker 4>so that's probably what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They figured out.</v>

2997
02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:53.750
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much is it costing us in lawsuits</v>

2998
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:58.340
<v Speaker 4>and [inaudible] 14 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much have we made in the last two</v>

2999
02:19:58.341 --> 02:20:00.470
<v Speaker 4>years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that would be 50 trillion.</v>

3000
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:03.230
<v Speaker 4>All right then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not a battle then.</v>

3001
02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:05.660
<v Speaker 4>It's worth the over doses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I talked about Penny's think Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Schwartz maximum four hours a day.</v>

3003

<v Speaker 4>they should be well rested and taken</v>

3004
02:20:13.131 --> 02:20:16.400
<v Speaker 4>care of and they should be more of them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>elephant?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't ever need to kill an</v>

3141
02:27:17.971 --> 02:27:18.960
<v Speaker 4>elephant.</v>

<v Speaker 4>permit to kill the elephant.</v>

3146
02:27:29.581 --> 02:27:33.630
<v Speaker 4>Then that person pays like 50,000 bucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that and they'll come</v>

3147
02:27:33.631 --> 02:27:36.060
<v Speaker 4>and kill the elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So some guy like that,</v>

3203
02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:35.440
<v Speaker 1>You bite people and inject them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are literally a walking needle.</v>

3204
02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:37.030
<v Speaker 1>You're a needle.</v>

3207
02:30:43.931 --> 02:30:47.330
<v Speaker 1>just a hundred percent death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them it's 100% like the,</v>

3208
02:30:47.331 --> 02:30:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people get bitten to make enough</v>

3209
02:30:50.321 --> 02:30:51.970
<v Speaker 1>antivenom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to get it.</v>

3210

<v Speaker 1>Who's carrying that you carry with you</v>

3212
02:30:55.961 --> 02:30:58.060
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only lasts a little while.</v>

3213
02:30:58.110 --> 02:31:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Who is carrying that could keep making</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3214
02:31:00.220 --> 02:31:02.560
<v Speaker 1>They make it with horses too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that what?</v>

3215
02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Like rattlesnake venom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antivenom.</v>

3216
02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:07.270
<v Speaker 1>They shoot horses up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3217
02:31:07.390 --> 02:31:10.930
<v Speaker 1>they take a rattlesnake in Jack</v>
<v Speaker 1>rattlesnake venom and the horse,</v>

3218
02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:11.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3219
02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:15.970
<v Speaker 1>the horse curlex the antibodies produces</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibodies and they take those</v>

3220
02:31:15.971 --> 02:31:18.850
<v Speaker 1>antibodies out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like the serum entheos really</v>

3221
02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least they used to do</v>

3222
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:21.780
<v Speaker 4>it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure they still do though.</v>

3223
02:31:22.050 --> 02:31:22.890
<v Speaker 4>I know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3224
02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:26.460
<v Speaker 4>it's an issue for vegans because if</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegans don't want to use any animal</v>

3225
02:31:26.461 --> 02:31:30.210
<v Speaker 4>products and they get bitten by a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they have to compromise.</v>

3226
02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:34.740
<v Speaker 4>That has to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there has to be some compromise here.</v>

3227
02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:39.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get,</v>

3231
02:31:43.860 --> 02:31:45.480

<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be a good person.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is it the fight for matter?</v>

3233
02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:52.170

02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:17.370
<v Speaker 4>The only way to keep the Mexicans out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>each individual state is wall to wall</v>

<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was all wild quick apps.</v>

3345
02:36:42.381 --> 02:36:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting to see them touring</v>

3348
02:36:48.610 --> 02:36:49.270
<v Speaker 4>Sitting out there.</v>

3349
02:36:49.270 --> 02:36:50.500
<v Speaker 4>He had a broken foot,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're doing like the chair wiggle.</v>

3354
02:37:01.870 --> 02:37:06.460
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I went to professional</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling when I was 10 and it was</v>

3355
02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:09.970
<v Speaker 4>Andre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The giant was the ref and I already</v>

<v Speaker 4>bought my shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was bob backlund against dusty rose,</v>

3357
02:37:14.261 --> 02:37:17.870
<v Speaker 4>the American dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I noticed they weren't hitting each</v>

3358
02:37:17.871 --> 02:37:20.330
<v Speaker 4>other</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I,</v>

3359
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:23.330
<v Speaker 4>I noticed they were stumped and her</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot's every time the elbow.</v>

3360
02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:28.550
<v Speaker 4>And then I saw Andre the giant take a</v>
<v Speaker 4>chair and not really hit him and I was</v>

3361
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:31.790
<v Speaker 4>shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You saw it in real life and I went,</v>
