00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.101
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>

5
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:07.021
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

6
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:07.411
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

7
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>they just released the eight 15,</v>

8
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>like the Motorola flip phone,</v>

9
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>stupid phones.</v>

10
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>But I took a great fucking picture with that phone when the greatest pictures</v>

11
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>that ever took him out of the booker,</v>

12
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>the hooker when we're working in downtown La.</v>

13
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

14
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not the downtown La of today,</v>

15
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.070
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

16
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>what's that word?</v>

17
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>What's that word when they move into a neighborhood gentrify black cloud,</v>

18
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>black cloud or wipe out?</v>

19
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>This woman was walking by and she was heating a meatball sub and she had a wig</v>

20
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>on and she was an overweight African American hooker.</v>

21
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

22
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I looked at her and she goes,</v>

23
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

24
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.631
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

25
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:43.464
<v Speaker 1>what's up baby?</v>

26
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>And she pulls a tid out as I'm taking a picture of her with a meatball sub in</v>

27
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>one hand and a tit and the other.</v>

28
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's perfectly framed.</v>

29
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was a conspiracy theorist,</v>

30
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:55.411
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

31
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:55.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>this was fake.</v>

33
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously Photoshop.</v>

34
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>This never really took place.</v>

35
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's perfectly frank?</v>

36
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it's online,</v>

37
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>You find it,</v>

39
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.771
<v Speaker 1>pull it,</v>

40
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.604
<v Speaker 1>pull it up.</v>

41
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>with a woman's breast.</v>

43
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not even pornographic.</v>

44
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.793
<v Speaker 1>The wellness,</v>

45
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.531
<v Speaker 1>disturbing.</v>

46
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Looking like it can see a male's breasts.</v>

47
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you see a woman's for us?</v>

48
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what's fascinating?</v>

49
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 1>You can see Chazz Palminteri is brass.</v>

50
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:17.404
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>

51
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

52
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.171
<v Speaker 1>Not Chazz.</v>

53
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Palminteri Chaz Bono.</v>

54
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I get them confused.</v>

55
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>The Bronx style.</v>

56
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could see his as well.</v>

57
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:28.824
<v Speaker 1>He's a man.</v>

58
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.400
<v Speaker 1>No disrespect to Mr Palminteri.</v>

59
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It was just slip.</v>

60
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I meant Chaz Bono who used to be used to be chastity Bono and then it's a famous</v>

61
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>daughter of share and got a sex change while there was like these photos of her</v>

62
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>walking down the beach topless because now she's a man.</v>

63
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Now she's got like a beard,</v>

64
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>so she's allowed to walk topless,</v>

65
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>so she's taking advantage of that and she's walking topless and she's good.</v>

66
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.651
<v Speaker 1>That's her.</v>

67
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 1>That's her.</v>

68
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:53.814
<v Speaker 1>That's the girl.</v>

69
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the lady that is a real picture.</v>

70
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Pulled that shit up all the way.</v>

71
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>USTREAM was with us.</v>

72
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

73
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Brattle Brad will be fine with it.</v>

74
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.381
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

75
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:01.861
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it,</v>

76
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:02.694
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

77
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Just show them.</v>

78
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Show them the meatball sub,</v>

79
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>just the meatball sub and a hand.</v>

80
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

81
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>How does that happen?</v>

82
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Photos.</v>

83
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly framed.</v>

84
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

85
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.401
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

86
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>can you can Photoshop one,</v>

87
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>make a copy of that,</v>

88
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>make a copy of that and just put a little blurry on the nipple</v>

89
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>that only take you a second to do it right.</v>

90
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that Brian?</v>

91
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like five guys.</v>

92
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.130
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing picture.</v>

93
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Come on that as the picture and that you can see we had a block out the nipple</v>

94
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>because apparently it almost sunk CBS when Janet Jackson whipped went out.</v>

95
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what it could do to Ustream,</v>

96
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.771
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

97
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>this lady with her 10 out,</v>

99
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I did not ask her to do this.</v>

100
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:50.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>This was the universe giving me a gift.</v>

102
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

103
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:55.834
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>

105
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't cee lo green the whole time.</v>

106
00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:58.411
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>

107
00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It did not turn me on.</v>

108
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It did not turn me on sexually,</v>

109
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>but it did turn me on socially because I knew I was going to post this online</v>

110
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>and people are going to go bananas.</v>

111
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I was very excited.</v>

112
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

113
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I have to show people this is going to give them great joy.</v>

114
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the part where he started to lose his mind.</v>

115
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

116
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

117
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.613
<v Speaker 1>I remember</v>

118
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.603
<v Speaker 1>Ryan.</v>

119
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she's alive now?</v>

120
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause that was like 2005 if you had to guess,</v>

121
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>do you think that women's have meatball subs every day?</v>

122
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some Italians live forever.</v>

123
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Do they think God motherfuckers they live forever.</v>

124
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.493
<v Speaker 1>That's good to know,</v>

125
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>but that was a real moment for me.</v>

126
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

127
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.871
<v Speaker 1>it was a great,</v>

128
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>great moment for me.</v>

129
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I wish you had that on video though.</v>

130
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>

131
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

132
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>

133
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>It would be awesome.</v>

134
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>D G Galaxy s three video.</v>

135
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

136
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>but then she probably sue me.</v>

137
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if she knows the picture's out there.</v>

138
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.913
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

139
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if someone was like,</v>

140
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:00.431
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

141

144
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>That ain't even me.</v>

145
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>My wig don't look nothing like that.</v>

146
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.640
<v Speaker 1>That is not me.</v>

147
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.730
