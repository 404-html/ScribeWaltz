00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the other things that are of</v>

2
00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:10.921
<v Speaker 1>concern to you as a congresswoman that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing not addressed or that are</v>

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another still in place when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like they should have?</v>

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.151
<v Speaker 2>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:15.984
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a long laundry list of issues</v>

7
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 2>and I think you can go through each of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the major issues that a lot of folks are</v>

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 2>concerned about and pick those apart and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

9
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are the things that we need to</v>

10
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:33.021
<v Speaker 2>address and improve in each of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that the conversation that I</v>

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 2>hope more people start having is about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how w why aren't these things being</v>

12
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 2>fixed or addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that speaks directly to,</v>

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's unwillingness to actually talk</v>

14
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 2>to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop demonizing each other because</v>

15
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 2>you're from the other camp and actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>engage based on our common mission of</v>

16
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 2>serving the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serving the people of this country.</v>

17
00:00:58.231 --> 00:00:58.951
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

18
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 2>that's something I look back to during</v>
<v Speaker 2>my time,</v>

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in uniform serving the whole army</v>

20
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 2>national guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got diverse people,</v>

21
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 2>diverse opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diverse ideas,</v>

22
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

23
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 2>we were the same flag on our uniform and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are focused singularly on,</v>

24
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 2>on that same purpose and mission.</v>

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately that's what we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing a lot of in Congress's,</v>

26
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:25.341
<v Speaker 2>the hyper partisanship and the political</v>
<v Speaker 2>winds to often take precedence over,</v>

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why people in our districts</v>

28
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 2>hire us to go and work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that comes from not having</v>

29
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 2>a basic level of respect or Aloha for</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other as people.</v>

30
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 2>And instead just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

31
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 2>it's us against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick your label.</v>

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the battles are fought</v>
<v Speaker 2>and end.</v>

33
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Who suffers as a result of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who are suffering,</v>

34
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 2>who are dealing with a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges that we've been talking</v>

35
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something that,</v>

36
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to bring,</v>

37
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I try to bring Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zillow hot to Washington,</v>

38
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to bring that through in the</v>

39
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 2>work that I'm trying to do on these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different issues in the conversations</v>

40
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 2>that we're having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it means you talk with people</v>

41
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you disagree with,</v>

42
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 2>or you may have different ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 2>than they have about how you solve these</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

44
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 2>But if even if you're able to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>together on one thing,</v>

45
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 2>then we can start to see problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually being solved and,</v>

46
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 2>and delivering results.</v>

47
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he made sure I went to the place</v>

48
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>that they broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

49
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Huntington was designed as the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he raped another inmate,</v>

50
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>they sent you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first shoe program in</v>

51
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first [inaudible].</v>

52
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>What does shoe program?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A special housing unit or security</v>

53
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>housing unit were level five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supermax,</v>

54
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Pelican Bay.</v>

55
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.143
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>your punishment was that you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to speak in your cell.</v>

57
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>And if you got caught speaking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

58
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>they came in with a nurse and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after they beat you down,</v>

59
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>she jabbed you in the ass with thorazine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they knocked you off for a week and</v>

60
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>you lost your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was horrible.</v>

61
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I told the first two years of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>

62
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>every day I kept my mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care what was done around Muna.</v>

63
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You weren't allowed to say a God damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>word and a minute and you're not allowed</v>

64
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>to talk to other inmates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

65
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I dare you to sing happy birthday to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself like I did.</v>

66
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I paid for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucked me up too.</v>

67
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>But I don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

68
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I realized I was in a race.</v>

69
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I had to kill off the person that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person that I initially was upon</v>

70
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:42.120
<v Speaker 1>entering prison was a deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying,</v>

71
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>coward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no fortitude because no self respect</v>

72
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:49.710
<v Speaker 1>resided within me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in utter humbleness,</v>

73
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I took everything that they did to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I paid for every window.</v>

74
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I broke everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stole,</v>

75
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>rely auto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I started to love myself.</v>

76
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I figured I ain't getting nothing out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this but misery.</v>

77
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.330
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going out like the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a stand up and I'm gonna speak</v>

78
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>beautifully on the daily to execute me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a walk to that walk,</v>

79
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:14.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dude,</v>

80
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:18.180
<v Speaker 1>is I didn't kill that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I damn sure ain't no coward.</v>

81
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find out everything I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>about life.</v>

82
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm gonna face my death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a do it.</v>

83
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like I had this beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful speech ready for him to us</v>

84
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>going to lay it out and just be at peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I realized there was nothing</v>

85
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could fight.</v>

86
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't argue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter because God's in</v>

87
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>control of my life and I really believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had a choice,</v>

88
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.970
<v Speaker 1>either be a bitter pill and get sucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>dry by all the misery of mountain me or</v>

89
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>get my shit right and start loving</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

90
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.410
<v Speaker 3>And then when I'm out of fight camp</v>
<v Speaker 3>since like,</v>

91
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.810
<v Speaker 3>cause sometimes when you watch a tape in</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight camp,</v>

92
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.640
<v Speaker 3>like you can mess with people's heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

93
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 3>like the maybe maybe cal was getting too</v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous and then when he's white gives</v>

94
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 3>him anxiety to watch the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

95
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.080
<v Speaker 3>so you need to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case,</v>

96
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a coach that's willing to,</v>

97
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 3>that you trust to do that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

98
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Now cause let me do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mental,</v>

99
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 3>this fucking sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mental mind.</v>

100
00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah of course.</v>

101
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Whatever works the best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you got to figure out?</v>

102
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Is it better for you to fight someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cody that you have all this</v>

103
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 3>animosity and beef towards and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit talking cause you get super hyped</v>

104
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:31.610
<v Speaker 3>up and motivated every day?</v>

105
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 3>Or is it better to fight someone who you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of respect for was just a</v>

106
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:39.950
<v Speaker 3>good challenge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got to learn to live,</v>

107
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 3>like to be the same person for every</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

108
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like control those</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions.</v>

109
00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:46.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if there was all that coming in,</v>

110
00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:48.560
<v Speaker 3>like I'm nervous to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

111
00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 3>like forget all the bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

112
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:51.470
<v Speaker 3>And I had to learn that through my</v>
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

113
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.510
<v Speaker 3>I had to learn to take emotion out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

114
00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in sparring still,</v>

115
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:55.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like join the,</v>

116
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 3>he's telling me control my emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a controlled aggression,</v>

117
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you hit me,</v>

118
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 3>I want to hit you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very competitive.</v>

119
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 3>So it's something you have to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to control.</v>

120
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 3>And I've had to do that throughout my</v>
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

121
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think everyone has learned to</v>

122
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 3>control either to let go or to pull</v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

123
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really control that emotion to be</v>

124
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 3>the same person every fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

125
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally,</v>

126
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 3>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the same person every five and</v>

127
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 3>mentally in your own head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same person,</v>

128
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 3>but technically need to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>switch it up.</v>

129
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 3>That the mental aspect of it is probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that holds more people back</v>

130
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything like we all know of guys that</v>

131
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 3>are just monsters in the gym and for</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was when they would go to</v>

132
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 3>compete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just could never be their full</v>

133
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:37.994
<v Speaker 3>self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

134
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.330
<v Speaker 4>Tj does better in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

135
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.253
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the gym.</v>

136
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did better in the,</v>

137
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 4>in the gym then in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think it is</v>

138
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.300
<v Speaker 3>that makes you do better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

139
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've just taught myself to love</v>

140
00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 3>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>

141
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when I get out there it's</v>

142
00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:55.110
<v Speaker 3>just like I want to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

143
00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Like I know everyone's nervous and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

144
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.970
<v Speaker 3>it's the highest highs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I used to be so nervous that I</v>

145
00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:01.680
<v Speaker 3>forget like what happened in the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

146
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.840
<v Speaker 3>But throughout my career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think after the Mike Easton fights,</v>

147
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:06.720
<v Speaker 3>when I really started to like hone in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

148
00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:09.450
<v Speaker 3>during the Mike Easton fives when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>really started to hone in and have fun</v>

149
00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just realize like,</v>

150
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:11.970
<v Speaker 3>fuck this shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

151
00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst is going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need knocked out the rule for it.</v>

152
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so crazy subject,</v>

153
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.670
