<v Speaker 1>like kind of fading away thing,</v>

24
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>but there you'll find pockets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely do.</v>

25
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you stopped thinking about how many</v>

26
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>different languages that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you done much touring in Asia,</v>

27
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really only Japan.</v>

28
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.283
<v Speaker 1>I haven't hit crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to Korea and never been </v>

29
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.923
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never been in Indonesia or anything </v>

31
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>that's not written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.081
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

33
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:28.914
<v Speaker 1>Sorta Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been to Japan and only for a </v>

34
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

35
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

36
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:35.950
<v Speaker 1>The people are so nice and polite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

37
00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture works.</v>

38
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons I love it so much too</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's like you go to Europe,</v>

39
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel foreign necessarily.</v>

40
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the forerunner experience.</v>

41
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>When you're there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here I am now out obvious outsider.</v>

42
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm tollard most people and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian,</v>

43
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.224
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of places they're </v>

44
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.031
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to go to,</v>

45
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.864
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get the low down on a Sushi spot </v>

46
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>from somebody that I knew there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go there and be like,</v>

47
00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:59.251
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no guys,</v>

48
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't serve them.</v>

49
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>We don't serve you all here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like still places like that.</v>

50
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:03.654
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're trying to get the down low </v>

51
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>anthony bordain treatment like Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bourdain,</v>

52
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>you might not have no luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>show up at that 0.0 crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

54
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.573
<v Speaker 1>they're so different than us in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their culture that it's like this crazy </v>

56
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>immersion into like an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

57
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Like Japanese writing is so different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than American writing to sound.</v>

58
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Their languages is so different than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound of English.</v>

59
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Then when you go there you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

60
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

61
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:35.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally peering into a coexisting </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative world.</v>

62
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.654
<v Speaker 1>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if there was no different </v>

63
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just language.</v>

64
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody knew what everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke,</v>

65
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.983
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your language was the s the sounds </v>

66
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:45.894
<v Speaker 1>that they make and the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret things and the way they </v>

67
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>interpret things shapes the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at reality.</v>

68
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I sure that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a weird,</v>

69
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>like our culture is in a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like an operating system.</v>

70
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I think Terence Mckenna described that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and thinking kind of makes sense.</v>

71
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.290
<v Speaker 1>It is like an operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>We learn a basic set of parameters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules that we all kind of Obi yeah,</v>

73
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>we're all individuals within it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like there's,</v>

74
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

75
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:10.924
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this society this is what's </v>

76
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.080
<v Speaker 1>acceptable and this is what it isn't and</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how we peer it.</v>

77
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>And when you see something like we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this book,</v>

78
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>dear reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Milas who was on and a yesterday</v>

79
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.483
<v Speaker 1>who was just amazing podcast guest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was talking to us about North </v>

80
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a different,</v>

81
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>totally different operating system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit is going on right now.</v>

82
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Right now there's like a whole country </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's imprisoned.</v>

83
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing to me is that that many </v>

84
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>people can be subdued to me in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

85
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Like wears you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read throughout history.</v>

86
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:41.411
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>people got sick and tired of some shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a while and just bucked up.</v>

88
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are they?</v>

89
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>

90
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't mastery to these dudes have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

91
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I look at it and there's millions</v>

92
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.194
<v Speaker 1>of people that they're starving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>still accept and this dude's living in </v>

93
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>is whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>golden palace,</v>

94
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever kind of lifestyle.</v>

95
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Speaker 1>And nobody's really like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionize started revolution or buck</v>

96
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>up and make a cool would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think the old guys around him or</v>

97
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>even crazier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

98
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.173
<v Speaker 1>well malice was telling me why he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that the way that society is </v>

99
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:14.464
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody reports on everybody else </v>

100
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.003
<v Speaker 1>about what you did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you and I were hanging out </v>

101
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:20.914
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be forced to report at the end of </v>

102
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to report on everything you</v>

104
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:30.160

105
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.023
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like rules to the way you </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are not those all of them,</v>

118
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>but a high percentage of girls get their</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes changed.</v>

119
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>They get this crazy surgery that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyelids,</v>

120
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>they shrink your eyelids so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the Asian look.</v>

121
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's inner,</v>

122
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.413
<v Speaker 1>I tried it for a more of a round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they tried for a mortar of an </v>

123
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>anime thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

124
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>the big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen it?</v>

125
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

126
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was an Asian girl.</v>

127
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some girl on Internet who just trying to</v>

128
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>look really much talking about Barbie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lady.</v>

129
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The party leading.</v>

130
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

131
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that go do,</v>

132
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think like that?</v>

133
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:36.274
<v Speaker 1>How's your brain working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you're not looking in the </v>

134
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 1>mirror and seeing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is your,</v>

135
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>this is giving you satisfying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

136
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just body dysmorphia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as like a,</v>

137
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:45.364
<v Speaker 1>a person who's a bodybuilder who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get big enough or a woman who </v>

138
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>can't get fake enough breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they keep wanting to get bigger and</v>

139
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:51.601
<v Speaker 1>bigger ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

140
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't see yourself how everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else sees you.</v>

141
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I that um,</v>

142
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
<v Speaker 1>it's always funny cause I've always </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was a pretty fucking awesome </v>

143
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:02.714
<v Speaker 1>Well it's called self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She pulled those pictures up so the </v>

145
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>checkout what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you could see good ones.</v>

146
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Three reasons why one gin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic surgery for ice,</v>

147
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.483
<v Speaker 1>eyelid surgery shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but show some like before and afters </v>

148
00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:17.010
<v Speaker 1>because they kind of a little one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

149
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are kind of crazy.</v>

150
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Like they look like a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

151
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Like if you went to high school with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

152
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>you be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

153
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>That seems totally normal right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been some extreme ones.</v>

154
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>See if you could fire her whole face is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different shaped at that point.</v>

155
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>The one you just passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more than just eyes done there,</v>

156
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting seeing that younger and</v>

157
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 1>younger girls are having that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff done too.</v>

158
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

159
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one was very successful.</v>

160
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>That was a good decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

161
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it was an excellent decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do we know these are real?</v>

162
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing could be getting,</v>

163
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

164
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.294
<v Speaker 1>Look at that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something I wanted to talk to </v>

165
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

166
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.693
<v Speaker 1>How do we know what it's like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know what the fuck is true </v>

167
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>anymore?</v>

168
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to come because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's mastered the half truth.</v>

169
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean that I got a piece of the truth</v>

170
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>and then I spin it the way I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend it.</v>

171
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>So a certain amount of people are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see it that way.</v>

172
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:07.904
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they,</v>

173
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>they really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

174
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trip on this whole system.</v>

175
00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't give a fuck about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>

176
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:14.721
<v Speaker 1>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

177
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck all of them.</v>

178
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>They're all lying crooks as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

179
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.903
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But peep game on how they have blue </v>

180
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:24.200
<v Speaker 1>states red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like bloods and crips here,</v>

181
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.034
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're making it more like that </v>

182
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:26.714
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the hatred between this blue and </v>

183
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:28.971
<v Speaker 1>red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

184
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:30.760
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.633
<v Speaker 1>It's like people got along just six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago and now at each other's </v>

186
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>throats and there used to be a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were young,</v>

187
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.813
<v Speaker 1>when the new president was elected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he became president and we all kind of </v>

188
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 1>sat back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

189
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>that's our president.</v>

190
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

191
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we're not even gonna get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into dude.</v>

192
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you as a,</v>

193
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>as a just as a principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that exchange of,</v>

194
00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but we all sat back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

195
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give the guy a shot at least.</v>

196
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

197
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:56.624
<v Speaker 1>we're not even gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even interested in getting into </v>

198
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 1>all the individual in question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

199
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.903
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the minute this dude's </v>

200
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.753
<v Speaker 1>precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next fucking campaign starts and </v>

201
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fucking crazy.</v>

202
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Is it that as crazy as I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

203
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 1>or am I just sitting at home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is crazy dad world of,</v>

204
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>of taking care of these babies and going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on tour and I just turn on the TV and it</v>

205
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>blows my fucking mind blowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's mind,</v>

206
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.044
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a weird line that's </v>

207
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>happening now too and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't really even a criticism,</v>

208
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.910
<v Speaker 1>but Newsweek had an article that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted and the article shows how Molina</v>

209
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>rejects trump's hand.</v>

210
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was kind of awesome.</v>

211
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of locked it away.</v>

212
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of,</v>

213
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 1>but who knows what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she gets public gangs,</v>

214
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and she hasn't like holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands when she walks.</v>

215
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't necessarily have to mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

216
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.550
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's a fucking story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Newsweek tweets out is stir range.</v>

217
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>CNN had it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

218
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a whole article after hand.</v>

219
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Swat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

220
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they touch hands for a second,</v>

221
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>back it up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no trump supporter here,</v>

222
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newsweek,</v>

223
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong.</v>

224
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>He does anything wrong with what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

225
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with putting this up.</v>

226
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you put it up.</v>

227
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>You would watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not news though.</v>

228
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.353
<v Speaker 1>We are all part of the biggest reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>TV show ever created in the universe </v>

229
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

230
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like trump as the host.</v>

231
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it as and that's,</v>

232
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>and this man is actually living out his </v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn fantasy right now.</v>

233
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Like we have all given this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

234
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even gonna say,</v>

235
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love whatever.</v>

236
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

237
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>But this dude is like king of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking universe in his mind right now.</v>

238
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>There's nobody can fucking touch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the fucking,</v>

239
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 1>that's why the show is going to get so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

240
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

241
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not dot stupid.</v>

242
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.273
<v Speaker 1>Like he's aware that there's been a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of criticism and he's trying to iron </v>

243
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:53.514
<v Speaker 1>things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he's doing is he's taking this </v>

244
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>approach that he's made become this real</v>
<v Speaker 1>estate magnate,</v>

245
00:09:59.101 --> 00:09:59.881
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:02.370
<v Speaker 1>big tycoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big businessman,</v>

247
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.413
<v Speaker 1>which is why he was always this </v>
<v Speaker 1>rambunctious sort of flamboyant </v>

248
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

249
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.993
<v Speaker 1>He always put his name in gold letters </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these buildings and we didn't mind </v>

250
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:12.774
<v Speaker 1>that when he wasn't running the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just when you run the country and </v>

251
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you start doing the same stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the criticism that he's getting,</v>

252
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>his kind of each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't kind of do the same thing when</v>

253
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.530
<v Speaker 1>you're the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't like talk to him about it.</v>

254
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I was showing the number one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bigger than yourself thing.</v>

255
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.210
<v Speaker 1>You just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

256
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you have to let go of self to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

257
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be a good one.</v>

258
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:34.314
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying I'm not going to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you one guy has been better than the </v>

259
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know we have our opinions on that</v>

260
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:37.741
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

261
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:38.574
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honestly I grew up in an age where </v>

262
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>politics and religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether if it was going to be bad news,</v>

263
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.600
<v Speaker 1>you didn't bring it up with people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

264
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's just the,</v>

265
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.553
<v Speaker 1>the hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see like even from people I respect </v>

266
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the red and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red and blue hen they cripping and blood</v>

267
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>now here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard man,</v>

268
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.813
<v Speaker 1>hard for their parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's stupid because none of them </v>

269
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 1>care about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them want anything from you,</v>

270
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 1>but more of your tax money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much they're going to tell</v>

271
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to cut your taxes.</v>

272
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

273
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.470
<v Speaker 1>if they're going to find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking get that money,</v>

274
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.090
<v Speaker 1>they might make it look good to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

275
00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 1>guess what ms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class family and $36,000 a year,</v>

276
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We here's two grand.</v>

277
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:18.534
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to pay in taxes a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just seems a lot when you're in </v>

278
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 1>that level of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

279
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blow that on fucking sneakers.</v>

280
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm ashamed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

281
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:25.703
<v Speaker 1>But the point is they don't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they just stole it out the back </v>

282
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:30.574
<v Speaker 1>end of your health care or they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>took it off the top of not rebuilding </v>

283
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>all the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is their game.</v>

284
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:35.364
<v Speaker 1>They run the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these motherfuckers come up with </v>

285
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:39.090
<v Speaker 1>some shit where money comes out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

286
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.583
<v Speaker 1>I don't respect any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to think that some of them </v>

287
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:43.584
<v Speaker 1>have your best interest in mind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a crazy competitive system </v>

288
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 1>and that we may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just like what the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes like the system kind of corruption</v>

290
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>because of lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the way it's set up.</v>

291
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you can't pull it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

292
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with you that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty of good ones.</v>

293
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just like cops.</v>

294
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of cons and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>good guys.</v>

295
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>When the shit storms pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the shit storms pop up,</v>

296
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.123
<v Speaker 1>they don't bug out and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what that was wrong and go </v>

297
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>against what the group of cops are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians is saying either one.</v>

298
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I could be either one they side even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong times when they shouldn't.</v>

299
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Where are those voices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear him.</v>

300
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think there's way more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get respect.</v>

301
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

302
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

303
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.993
<v Speaker 1>but my point is there's a code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll use a code and that good cop will </v>

304
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking not shit on a backup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he will back him,</v>

305
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:32.224
<v Speaker 1>but he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a time when you got to shit on </v>

306
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that thing or person or that act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

307
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

308
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>and there's this code and politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

309
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:39.514
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cops where they don't call out the </v>

310
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

311
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.151
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

312
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I lose all the respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everything.</v>

313
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:45.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

314
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 1>and I just sit back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on some Carlin Shit,</v>

315
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:48.424
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a front row seat to the freak </v>

316
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch it go down.</v>

317
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>You're asking them to do the impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

318
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.993
<v Speaker 1>You're asking them to be around violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lying and danger and they're the </v>

319
00:12:58.871 --> 00:12:59.704
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asked him to be the professional </v>

320
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>enemy to professional criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're asking them to do all</v>

321
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:04.714
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like there's a reason why they </v>

322
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:10.150
<v Speaker 1>bond together like that because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all in the war together and it's</v>

323
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 1>us and them and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we on the outside,</v>

324
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they go through.</v>

325
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 1>That's why they have this bond with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

326
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>It's no doubt you wouldn't want that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will really would want,</v>

327
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>but there comes a time.</v>

328
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.773
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's been a few of them lately </v>

329
00:13:24.531 --> 00:13:24.931
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

330
00:13:24.931 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 1>in recent history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

331
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should have been an overwhelming </v>

332
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:31.280
<v Speaker 1>coming in condemnation by a group of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

333
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.150
<v Speaker 1>of a smaller group of that group's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

334
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:35.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples that Eric Gardner case in New </v>

335
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.900
<v Speaker 1>York where they choke that guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just selling cigarettes.</v>

336
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no reason to do that.</v>

337
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 1>That guy didn't even have any cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on him.</v>

338
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying he wasn't complying.</v>

339
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Why should he comply?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

340
00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

341
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 1>and you can't tell when you went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

342
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:56.080
<v Speaker 1>was he not complying enough to die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

343
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:56.914
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the dude had like an asthma </v>

344
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:01.680
<v Speaker 1>attack or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously the vote bark,</v>

345
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.660
<v Speaker 1>they have choke there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gas choke though.</v>

346
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It was more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

347
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:07.144
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a choke hold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was more like the way he was </v>

348
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>applying it was like a restraining thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than it was.</v>

349
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see it again.</v>

350
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm remembering it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without a doubt the forearm is under</v>

351
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.340
<v Speaker 1>the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was in a colony in a fight,</v>

352
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I would say this guy's getting choked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

353
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not even go down that road.</v>

354
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 1>But the point of this conversation I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe was just saying like,</v>

355
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.493
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that overwhelming larger number of good </v>

356
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's cops,</v>

357
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

358
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:35.614
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

359
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the majority of them are decent,</v>

360
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 1>good people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the shit hits the fan,</v>

361
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.530
<v Speaker 1>they don't collectively say that's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fucked up.</v>

362
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.440
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all band together and say like,</v>

363
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.280
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll try and bury this and hide it or,</v>

364
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 1>or just deny it kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that as a group loses you respect.</v>

365
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:56.534
<v Speaker 1>When people are seeing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are interested in justice and </v>

366
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 1>interested in fair and interest in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seed,</v>

367
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 1>these things happen.</v>

368
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.583
<v Speaker 1>They lose faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I think there's no faith in </v>

369
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 1>anything right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I see.</v>

370
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I see the way I see the division in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country on it,</v>

371
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.243
<v Speaker 1>there's no faith in anything open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a wave and it's going to come </v>

372
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>

373
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking that we're going to react </v>

374
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:17.140
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hope it doesn't come easy.</v>

375
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.830
<v Speaker 1>We really fucked up ways because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when that wave crashes,</v>

376
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.010
<v Speaker 1>it breaks shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

377
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't.</v>

378
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it's so easy to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're against each other.</v>

379
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.503
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to dig your heels in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue one side or argue the other or </v>

380
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 1>pick a team and be totally committed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

381
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue or whether it's black,</v>

382
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 1>white people get on these goddamn teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it.</v>

383
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Men and women.</v>

384
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets real divisive online with people</v>

385
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.750
<v Speaker 1>separating men and men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women like criticizing men,</v>

386
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.880
<v Speaker 1>all men in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing women,</v>

387
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>all women in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same shit it exists.</v>

388
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's Democrat versus Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

389
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 1>it's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegans versus carnivores.</v>

390
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.463
<v Speaker 1>It's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People pick a fucking team and they </v>

391
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:05.420
<v Speaker 1>fight for it and they think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and they have many,</v>

392
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:07.370
<v Speaker 1>many good reasons for thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

393
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:08.683
<v Speaker 1>but I think all of us or are way better </v>
<v Speaker 1>off if we're taught about these team </v>

394
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:14.984
<v Speaker 1>ideas early and recognize when you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in yourself and do something like </v>

395
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:23.861
<v Speaker 1>self governing and avoid those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid those and we'll find common ground</v>

396
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>on a lot more shit than we think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much,</v>

397
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 1>we can sum that up but like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think for yourself.</v>

398
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do,</v>

399
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're bombarded the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are now.</v>

400
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.953
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing about how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started this conversation is a how do </v>

401
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you know what the fuck is really true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to know what the fuck</v>

402
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 1>is true or at least get a good semblance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

403
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at more than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

404
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:47.144
<v Speaker 1>If you read some story on facebook that </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageous you and fucking makes you so </v>

405
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:52.220
<v Speaker 1>pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was intended to do that.</v>

406
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should go look further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look down the road,</v>

407
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:56.330
<v Speaker 1>look at a paper you would never look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

408
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to look when I,</v>

409
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.143
<v Speaker 1>when I get interested in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't as much as it used to be </v>

410
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:05.380
<v Speaker 1>because I have my own things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure we'll get into it.</v>

411
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

412
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.093
<v Speaker 1>I see CNN is on at my studio a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the sound because we'll be </v>

413
00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 1>making music and whatnot.</v>

414
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And mostly I just read the ticker </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if,</v>

415
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays news is on the ticker,</v>

416
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.870
<v Speaker 1>opinions are what are coming out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking speakers when the,</v>

417
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.093
<v Speaker 1>when the personalities are talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>News is just the facts that roll scroll </v>

418
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 1>along down on the bottom and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some spin on it and whatnot.</v>

419
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 1>But I try not to listen to the talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>heads cause they,</v>

420
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:32.894
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox has to pro Democrat guys that no </v>

421
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 1>matter what the Democrats do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to defend it.</v>

422
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And CNN has a couple of trump guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what goes on,</v>

423
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're playing a game.</v>

424
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

425
00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:43.370
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>

426
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 1>it's all a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

427
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.314
<v Speaker 1>it's a television show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching it that not too long ago </v>

428
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 1>when CNN came on after a commercial and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the studio was lit up,</v>

429
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:52.674
<v Speaker 1>red and Korean stars were everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nuclear missile launches like </v>

430
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 1>pictures in the background.</v>

431
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

432
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:02.030
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they just launched missiles and the,</v>

433
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:02.963
<v Speaker 1>and nothing like it had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just discussing the </v>

434
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:08.940
<v Speaker 1>possibility of the future of if they got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a missile that was capable and it's like</v>

435
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are tuned into this shit.</v>

436
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 1>And is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

437
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:14.994
<v Speaker 1>it's on in the background cause I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God forbid that breaking news and you </v>

438
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 1>want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's reality TV honestly.</v>

439
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.423
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what we're talking about people </v>

440
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 1>acting as groups and did above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It heals groups.</v>

441
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see too.</v>

442
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 1>It's entertaining to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my,</v>

443
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

444
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>my deeper self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

445
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:31.854
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whiskey starting to fucking talk to </v>

446
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Speaker 1>me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that has a conscious,</v>

447
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:37.540
<v Speaker 1>my conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my soul know,</v>

448
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>evaluates why I'm being entertained by </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and finds it disturbing a lot.</v>

449
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Like in wants to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

450
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.523
<v Speaker 1>we should all fucking take a step back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love you because you're the love </v>

451
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:51.180
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always have had love in my life.</v>

452
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I've been a very fortunate man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like coming in here has grown men.</v>

453
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>And when I first started doing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

454
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.053
<v Speaker 1>you would always be preaching love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know how many Joe Rogan's a </v>

455
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.684
<v Speaker 1>tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kicked the shit out of 90% of the </v>

456
00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking people around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not interested in it.</v>

457
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:10.611
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to love life is better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just hear about it started me down a</v>

458
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 1>pad dude where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've explored almost every religion,</v>

459

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

460
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.231
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

461
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really practice any,</v>

462
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:22.440
<v Speaker 1>but I have a philosophy that's taken its</v>
<v Speaker 1>own good parts from all right.</v>

463
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.363
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

464
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 1>lately I've been reading a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist stuff.</v>

465
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Buddhist at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like this tick not Han guy and a few</v>

466
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:30.444
<v Speaker 1>other things I've been reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these things are also kind of </v>

467
00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:37.260
<v Speaker 1>started here because connecting with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way,</v>

468
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.010
<v Speaker 1>it made me open my mind up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

469
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of things we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think alike at all on,</v>

470
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.970
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't,</v>

471
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.710
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't fucking matter.</v>

472
00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I know talking to people that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily exactly,</v>

473
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.250
<v Speaker 1>but I respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of my fit,</v>

474
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.650
<v Speaker 1>some of my favorite conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best kind you can get that.</v>

475
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.603
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point of what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep from happening in this </v>

476
00:19:58.621 --> 00:19:59.331
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it be,</v>

477
00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just this whole online shit has taken </v>

<v Speaker 1>happened from this,</v>

480
00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 1>but this social networking shit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything but social.</v>

481

<v Speaker 2>Three years now since we were,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when we hung out a couple of times,</v>

509
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 2>my mother was passing from Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when she did pass it was like I</v>

510
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:13.160
<v Speaker 2>was emotionally and capable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I would have to,</v>

511

00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 2>heart like on the road trying to make up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference for awhile.</v>

575
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.940
<v Speaker 2>And then my mother started going way </v>
<v Speaker 2>downhill kind of fast over two years,</v>

576
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like dealing with that is anybody</v>

577
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:22.900
<v Speaker 2>going through that is is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

578
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.743
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of things that go </v>

579
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:26.630
<v Speaker 2>on in my life that I'm getting my heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent out to those people.</v>

580
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 2>But watching somebody you love just </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappear.</v>

581
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.690
<v Speaker 2>It was tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

582
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 2>that was spective right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changes your perspective.</v>

583
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 2>You realize that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how it ends.</v>

584
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of guilt involved because </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a kid with cf,</v>

585
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't have my mom in home with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurse in any infections that she could.</v>

586
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 2>She was getting lung infections all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

587
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.910
<v Speaker 2>So I had her in a home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really beautiful home.</v>

588
00:24:46.911 --> 00:24:48.830
<v Speaker 2>They took a magnificent care of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

589
00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 2>But there was a lot of guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

590
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.763
<v Speaker 2>I was fricking for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with a lot of darkness that I was </v>

591
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 2>swimming through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as that guy,</v>

592
00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 2>he's just wasn't good for me to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

593
00:24:57.831 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

594
00:24:58.941 --> 00:24:59.774
<v Speaker 2>and then after cheap has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like layla has just been like a </v>

595
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:02.781
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm only just me and my wife now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

597
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 2>she's seven years old and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we got anything licked or</v>

598
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:13.280
<v Speaker 2>co,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the life we have to live,</v>

599
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.320
<v Speaker 2>we've been able to figure out with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>cystic fibrosis,</v>

600
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 2>cystic fibrosis.</v>

601
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh cause there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's heavy.</v>

602
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.903
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit you got to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about infections and any common cold </v>

603
00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:27.104
<v Speaker 2>cause senator to the hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like so much pressure on a person </v>

604
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

605
00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:33.130
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my wife and I like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I won't fucking make it funny.</v>

607
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.970
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been very close to the brink a few</v>

608
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:38.804
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've finally gotten to a stage </v>

609
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:41.054
<v Speaker 2>where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

610
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 2>none of that's going to break us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

611
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.574
<v Speaker 2>We're good and we're good and we're good</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this life and theirs and we accept </v>

612
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:48.320
<v Speaker 2>where we are and we're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure this,</v>

613
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.213
<v Speaker 2>this young lady is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to make it as deep and as far </v>

614
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:54.140
<v Speaker 2>into this life as she can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

615
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:56.430
<v Speaker 2>And it's been some medical innovations </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

616
00:25:56.431 --> 00:25:57.051
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

617
00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:58.310
<v Speaker 2>they're working on some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

618
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.143
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of drugs that aren't </v>

619
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:03.280
<v Speaker 2>quite for her yet because this drug has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

620
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 2>on the DNA level of the chain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

621
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:09.080
<v Speaker 2>there's mutations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Layla has two different mutations.</v>

622
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:14.081
<v Speaker 2>One's called the a D Delta f five five </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh eight I believe it is.</v>

623
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.040
<v Speaker 2>You've got me hiring a little drunk </v>
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>

624
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:16.940
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

625
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:17.650
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

626
00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.483
<v Speaker 2>People know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who know know it's easy to find </v>

627
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:21.410
<v Speaker 2>out what she has the most common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most common one.</v>

628
00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Like the Delta five Oh eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she has this other,</v>

629
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.840
<v Speaker 2>a weird kind of off shoot one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one for some people have a w.</v>

630
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they call a double delta.</v>

631
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.703
<v Speaker 2>There's a drug right now that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>working well for the people with the </v>

632
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Double Delta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're starting to experiment it on,</v>

633
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.453
<v Speaker 2>on it for people with the single now </v>
<v Speaker 2>does she have to be on a special diet </v>

634
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:41.740
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

635
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.320
<v Speaker 2>the only diet we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just need her to,</v>

636
00:26:43.321 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 2>she needs to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a problem gaining waves.</v>

637
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Cystic fibrosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they um,</v>

638
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't process fats properly.</v>

639
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:51.330
<v Speaker 2>They have to take enzymes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they eat.</v>

640
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Speaker 2>So gaining weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real serious issue.</v>

641
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laila actually has a g tube,</v>

642
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 2>a feeding tube that she gets sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shake protein shakes a day,</v>

643
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:01.370
<v Speaker 2>pumped into her stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

644
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.960
<v Speaker 2>She again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

645
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 2>my daughter very rarely is down about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

646
00:27:07.381 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 2>She'll have her moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

647
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:10.820
<v Speaker 2>where it's like frustration and anger </v>
<v Speaker 2>overheard it,</v>

648
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is life.</v>

649
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 2>She's never known anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like at the same time,</v>

650
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.420
<v Speaker 2>like we post a lot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've made a decision.</v>

651
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Layla has her own page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are free to try and follow it.</v>

652
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.104
<v Speaker 2>If my wife will approve you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can get by the security </v>

653
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.683
<v Speaker 2>clearance.</v>

654
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:29.784

<v Speaker 2>She wanted her own page because we </v>

655
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:32.694
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never posted anything without </v>

656
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 2>asking her.</v>

657
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.063
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when she was like barely able to </v>

658
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to be like,</v>

659
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:38.874
<v Speaker 2>can I post this picture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people will see it and she'll </v>

660
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.833
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay daddy.</v>

661
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:42.990
<v Speaker 2>And now she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.310
<v Speaker 2>she's sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

663
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>about a year or so ago she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my own instagram page.</v>

664
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to share my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cystic fibrosis with people.</v>

665
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:51.834
<v Speaker 2>And so she's doing that and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is may actually assisting fibrosis </v>

666
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:56.274
<v Speaker 2>awareness month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've been posting and she happened </v>

667
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:00.510
<v Speaker 2>to be in the hospital the last 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's home right now.</v>

668
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Recovering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

669
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.443
<v Speaker 2>Chelsea pneumonia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do an article on a cystic fibrosis </v>

670
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was that?</v>

671
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 2>It was a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

672
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 2>but my wife and I are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it involve CBDS?</v>

673
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.823
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember because I read a send </v>
<v Speaker 2>me things and we're investigating some </v>

674
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:17.694
<v Speaker 2>stuff on that level right now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of good things going </v>

675
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 2>along with this because it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

676
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.363
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best anti inflammatories</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are with no side effects and all </v>

677
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:27.180
<v Speaker 2>kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not using it all my daughter yet,</v>

678
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:30.090
<v Speaker 2>but we're investigating like what kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of uses there are you,</v>

679
00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:30.924
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have to go back through my </v>

680
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:34.080
<v Speaker 2>emails or whatnot and so I remember you </v>
<v Speaker 2>did send me something.</v>

681
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if it was cbds or stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells or some shit,</v>

682
00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:40.170
<v Speaker 2>but I just saw lapsed and now there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of levels they're working on,</v>

683
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.333
<v Speaker 2>on the stem cell level there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things going on where </v>

684
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like if they can create correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>things on a cellular level,</v>

685
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:47.940
<v Speaker 2>at some point it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

686
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>there's never going to be a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a genetic disease,</v>

687
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.710
<v Speaker 2>so you can't say cure in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

688
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Like the way it works is my w two p the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two people that are,</v>

689
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 2>that fathered a child have to each have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gene.</v>

690
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.530
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me and my wife are known as what,</v>

691
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 2>what are known as carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we never knew cause we've searched</v>

692
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 2>our whole history after we found out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody in my family's ever,</v>

693
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:09.920
<v Speaker 2>ever had this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody in her family ever,</v>

694
00:29:09.921 --> 00:29:12.660
<v Speaker 2>ever had this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're known as what's carriers.</v>

695
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So when we got together and we had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>

696
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a one in four chance that child </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to have cystic fibrosis,</v>

697
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a two and four chance that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be a carrier.</v>

698
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.383
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a one in four chance they have </v>

699
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 2>no nothing at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is our other daughter Sadie.</v>

700
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 2>So we kind of represent the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>

701
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like our family,</v>

702
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:32.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Layla,</v>

703
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.480
<v Speaker 2>her mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and Sadie.</v>

704
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another reason I go,</v>

705
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having six kids cause I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a dad,</v>

706
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's like two cystic fibrosis</v>

707
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.700
<v Speaker 1>children in the same household is even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people do it.</v>

708
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.930
<v Speaker 1>It's hard because they pass infections </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very,</v>

709
00:29:49.931 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 1>as it [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine how the people with</v>

710
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:53.194
<v Speaker 1>multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three kids with cystic fibrosis </v>

<v Speaker 1>with a lot of anger.</v>

717
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

721
00:30:18.911 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've explored a lot of religions.</v>

722
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something greater than us.</v>

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and let me tell you another thing,</v>

744
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>having to take my daughter to children's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals all the time,</v>

745
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I see people that have it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

746
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Angela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you not know?</v>

747
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him personally,</v>

748
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a huge fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great dude.</v>

749
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget,</v>

750
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when the secret was this</v>

751
00:31:29.861 --> 00:31:30.694
<v Speaker 1>big movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book traction and people are going </v>

752
00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 1>to manifest their own destiny and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to make it happen.</v>

753
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 1>And everything in your life you created </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your mind.</v>

754
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

755
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.220
<v Speaker 1>You're telling a young sick kid that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>made that herself.</v>

756
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 1>She made that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she made herself have leukemia.</v>

757
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 1>She made herself have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're telling me that fuck you.</v>

758
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he said that,</v>

759
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:54.311
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

760
00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's totally right.</v>

761
00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.680
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>

762
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.573
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a bunch of people </v>

763
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.080
<v Speaker 1>that have become successful and told you</v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

764
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause I saw it happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the people that saw it happen</v>

765
00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:11.500
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit or a far greater number</v>

766
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 1>by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of life.</v>

767
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not the whole key to manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>a life.</v>

768
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 1>It's an excellent like being a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

769
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>being healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a good vision and focus.</v>

770
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 1>All those things are like contributing </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>

771
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.973
<v Speaker 1>But kids that are sick or the monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrench in any idea that we've created </v>

772
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:31.310
<v Speaker 1>our own reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy,</v>

773
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't make a baby responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

774
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.733
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also can't make a god responsible </v>

775
00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:39.111
<v Speaker 1>for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

776
00:32:39.111 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>God has a plan.</v>

777
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's not a fucking plan.</v>

778
00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.053
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes there's a glitch in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn matrix and you just gotta deal </v>

779
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:48.980
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

780
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 2>you got to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more important thing for me,</v>

781
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.803
<v Speaker 2>that second most important thing in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life other than keeping layla is </v>

782
00:32:56.301 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 2>healthiest possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is making sure she knows that you know,</v>

783
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.333
<v Speaker 2>she can still achieve and all she can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's at an age now where like she </v>

784
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:07.190
<v Speaker 2>kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

785
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to have her hate me in 10</v>

786
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:12.110
<v Speaker 2>years if she ever hears this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're giving up her business,</v>

787
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 2>but like she's in a stage right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she's very resentful of Xi ix.</v>

788
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.320
<v Speaker 2>She expresses it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll say,</v>

789
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 2>she'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate this.</v>

790
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I hate that I have this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be normal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's like about being home made or all </v>

<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda how I tried to approach</v>

<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

882
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I've been through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:36.150
<v Speaker 2>you didn't want to see me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's like you don't want to see me </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowering in the foxhole now the battle's</v>

885
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.070
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

886
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.903
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cowered in the Fox hole for a little </v>

887
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:43.674
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we got out and we won the </v>

888
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 2>battle or you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

889
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>that's where I want it to be before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>came and I didn't have any,</v>

890
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 2>and I know I didn't need anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>promote,</v>

891
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:54.840
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden it's like I did this</v>
<v Speaker 2>free project and I was like,</v>

892
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I really just put it out in my fans have</v>
<v Speaker 2>found it,</v>

893
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.170
<v Speaker 2>but the response has been so good behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

894
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.003
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

895
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:04.620

<v Speaker 2>that's why it's art.</v>

<v Speaker 2>ain't,</v>

938
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's his war porn.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

941
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.270
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

942
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I was struggling to make my next singer </v>
<v Speaker 2>songwriter ish hip hop kind of.</v>

943
00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.233
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of revisiting the Whitey Ford</v>
<v Speaker 2>formula a little bit and expanding on </v>

944
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:00.394
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got kind of stuck halfway through </v>

945
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.063
<v Speaker 2>because I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after all of this stuff that I went </v>

946
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would be smart to judge.</v>

947
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing about cystic fibrosis,</v>

948
00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:12.574
<v Speaker 2>it's really isolating because you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>really protective of your child and </v>

949
00:39:15.851 --> 00:39:17.710
<v Speaker 2>other people who were sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

950
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I remember at first I used to come and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

951
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:20.560
<v Speaker 2>everybody's going to be all right at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>studio,</v>

952
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:21.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's sick.</v>

953
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

954
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I trust you now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

955
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:24.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you were sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd tell me.</v>

956
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still,</v>

957
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:28.263
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you live that life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get tired of asking your friends </v>

958
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:31.774
<v Speaker 2>every five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the invitations to hang out </v>

959
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.250
<v Speaker 2>become a little less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an intentional thing.</v>

960
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.770
<v Speaker 2>It's this slow kind of isolation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

961
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.200
<v Speaker 2>My friends didn't do it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it to myself.</v>

962
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:42.873
<v Speaker 2>And I'm coming out of that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm hanging out with a lot of my </v>

963
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Speaker 2>old friends and seeing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>

964
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like I was stuck in a studio,</v>

965
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 2>it was just me and like an engineer kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

966
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I had a guy that worked for me for many </v>
<v Speaker 2>years who moved up north and then I,</v>

967
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I had this new guy who's good at his </v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

968
00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 2>but it was like I w I there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're Kinda your own boss.</v>

969
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:02.764
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you decide when you're going </v>

970
00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:04.204
<v Speaker 2>to go into the studio?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you decide when you're going to </v>

971
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 2>write just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

972
00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:06.934
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know how you think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>life because we don't live by the </v>

973
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 2>paycheck rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

974

<v Speaker 2>cash ran out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone other stuff.</v>

977
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm always thinking six months.</v>

978
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:27.154

1188
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:08.530
<v Speaker 1>he's got the meanest fucking left hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the keys.</v>

1189
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Like he plays all his keys with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and the base is left.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like me and my,</v>

1192

<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1195
00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Gary Clark has got his own sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

1196
00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you hear his sound like Stevie Ray </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vaughan is a perfect example of that.</v>

1197
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.073
<v Speaker 1>Like I hear some Stevie Ray Vaughan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hear like one or two bars and I'd </v>

1198
00:49:28.671 --> 00:49:29.770
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Stevie Ray Vaughan.</v>

1199
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:31.063
<v Speaker 1>He's got that sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this is like a certainly </v>

1200
00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:35.140
<v Speaker 1>gibbons slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1202
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:37.084
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minute played on a album of mine on </v>

1203
00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 1>a couple of songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Warren,</v>

1204
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:41.884
<v Speaker 1>the ghost of Whitey Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he came in with this little crate </v>

1205
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.710
<v Speaker 1>amp head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which crate is not a fancy company.</v>

1206
00:49:47.711 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not cheaper,</v>

1207
00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I won't call it him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it wasn't like super hot.</v>

1208
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 1>It was like some regular fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this one pedal and live sound.</v>

1209
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did you get?</v>

1210
00:49:58.901 --> 00:50:01.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's just something that some guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a magic man.</v>

1211
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Some guys have a magic about the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

1212
00:50:04.241 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I play acoustic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm best at.</v>

1213
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I know how to make that sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1214
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I have electric guitars but I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>never get my,</v>

1215
00:50:10.511 --> 00:50:11.344
<v Speaker 1>I could have that same fucking guitar is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Clark Jr right there and the same </v>

1216
00:50:14.321 --> 00:50:19.321
<v Speaker 1>equipment and set it the same way and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably won't sound the same.</v>

1217
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the neighborhood,</v>

1218
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:22.804
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that just got to </v>

1219
00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.610
<v Speaker 1>inherit and magic about feel on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>

1220
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy amazing about someone who can</v>

1221
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:35.540
<v Speaker 1>play an instrument like that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making some sound,</v>

1222
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.380
<v Speaker 1>that it syncs up with our brains so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1223
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It syncs up with our hearing so well </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it just gives you pleasure,</v>

1224
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.321
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1225
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 1>folks that's with an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can microphone and camera.</v>

1226
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a terrible recording </v>
<v Speaker 1>device as far as like getting good audio</v>

1227
00:50:53.511 --> 00:50:54.880
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're there,</v>

1228
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I really fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more computing power in here.</v>

1229
00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Then there was it then when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly send people to the moon,</v>

1230
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the moon.</v>

1231
00:51:02.241 --> 00:51:03.074
<v Speaker 1>Alice supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they sent people on the </v>

1232
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.400
<v Speaker 1>moon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1233
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 1>That's one of them things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know the fucking truth?</v>

1234
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.120
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you one fucking thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1235
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 1>The earth is not flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1236
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.230
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets tricky,</v>

1237
00:51:15.231 --> 00:51:16.064
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know these scientists could </v>

1238
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:20.894
<v Speaker 1>all be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1239
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.320
<v Speaker 1>look at the mood that's Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wouldn't be interesting if so,</v>

1240
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 1>what is the only one that wasn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

1241
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:29.000
<v Speaker 1>that was why everybody was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1242
00:51:29.001 --> 00:51:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to see both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just asking questions.</v>

<v Speaker 1>next to big full moon landings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite aspect to me,</v>

1246

<v Speaker 2>all three of us will tell you it's,</v>

1433
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:47.850
<v Speaker 2>it's the energy that we create with each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1436
01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:51.990
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're addicted to this right now.</v>

1437
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.520

01:01:53.521 --> 01:01:57.060
<v Speaker 2>We're really working on the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that can't be overlooked man.</v>

1439
01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:57.894
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of the people that you're </v>

1440
01:02:00.361 --> 01:02:01.194
<v Speaker 2>around all the time and I think you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different person when you're around </v>

1441
01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:04.980
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1442
01:02:04.981 --> 01:02:06.390

<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1444
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:12.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think that being around a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad motherfuckers on a regular basis,</v>

1445
01:02:12.121 --> 01:02:12.954
<v Speaker 2>like you are in war porn,</v>

1447
01:02:16.411 --> 01:02:19.020
<v Speaker 2>everybody is also aware of the full body</v>
<v Speaker 2>of work.</v>

1448
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.010

<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1487
01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.730
<v Speaker 2>That's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they're few and far between,</v>

1488
01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.800
<v Speaker 2>but they've made big headlines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why this,</v>

1489
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:58.430
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be this disrespectful </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate for the young,</v>

1490
01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:00.260
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't got that because listen,</v>

1491

<v Speaker 2>I always said like I just don't ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to sound like that old fucking </v>

1492
01:04:04.581 --> 01:04:07.130
<v Speaker 2>bitter dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you I don't like that.</v>

1493
01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of that song or that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but get go do what you,</v>

1494
01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I might be old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I don't get what you're doing.</v>

1495
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.190
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1496
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.023
<v Speaker 8>As I've gotten older I give less of a </v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck about what other people enjoy and </v>

1497
01:04:18.401 --> 01:04:19.234
<v Speaker 8>when I was younger I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for some reason I felt like I had to </v>

1498
01:04:22.271 --> 01:04:23.104
<v Speaker 8>argue with I enjoy versus what you enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 8>and that doesn't make any sense to me </v>

1499
01:04:26.531 --> 01:04:27.364
<v Speaker 8>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like we're all so fucking </v>

1500
01:04:29.111 --> 01:04:29.944
<v Speaker 8>different.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The idea like you meet people and </v>

1501
01:04:31.481 --> 01:04:33.170
<v Speaker 8>personalities vary so much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They,</v>

1502
01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.013
<v Speaker 8>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to like to see that shit </v>

1504
01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.393

<v Speaker 2>cause really what I was talking about </v>

1505
01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>wasn't young people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be,</v>

1506
01:04:39.401 --> 01:04:40.234
<v Speaker 2>if I want to be perfectly clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was talking about was people my </v>

1507
01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:47.161
<v Speaker 2>age that I hear throwing a lot of hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of just like just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>rain.</v>

1509

<v Speaker 2>Maybe not to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really just sound old and </v>

1510
01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.210
<v Speaker 2>bitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't try to make a record that </v>

1513
01:05:00.491 --> 01:05:01.324
<v Speaker 2>designer or future or any of these cats </v>

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.073
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to admit it but I like our </v>

1598
01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:31.150
<v Speaker 2>cold coke one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I no one of those coke zero that what it</v>

1599
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:31.993
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1600
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 8>I call it coke one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know it's but sometimes that</v>

1601
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:39.150
<v Speaker 2>is what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That tastes good.</v>

1602
01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.080
<v Speaker 2>If that could get you drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh here's a funny story.</v>

1603
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:44.423
<v Speaker 2>So my wife gives me a present the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and it's like this key chain with </v>

1604
01:08:47.521 --> 01:08:48.354
<v Speaker 2>this elongated like metal tube looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing on it and I open it up and it's </v>

1605
01:08:52.351 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 2>just empty and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

1606
01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1607
01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:55.464
<v Speaker 2>if you smoked a joint you could put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and it wouldn't stink up your </v>

1608
01:08:57.451 --> 01:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a smart idea.</v>

1609
01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm looking at it and I'm looking at</v>

1610
01:09:00.631 --> 01:09:02.460
<v Speaker 2>it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Babe,</v>

1611
01:09:02.461 --> 01:09:05.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a coke file actually.</v>

1612
01:09:05.491 --> 01:09:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really the intention for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1613
01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:08.401
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1614
01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:10.500
<v Speaker 2>it's funny cause there were smaller ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1615
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought that's really small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that could be for now.</v>

1616
01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:16.110
<v Speaker 2>It totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got this bullet looking thing.</v>

1617
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I put joints in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like it's a coke vile dude.</v>

1618
01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.123
<v Speaker 2>You imagine what would have happened if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they made coke legal like a long time </v>

1619
01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:25.980
<v Speaker 2>ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how am I,</v>

1620
01:09:25.981 --> 01:09:26.814
<v Speaker 2>how much would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much would culture change of coke </v>

1621
01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:29.994
<v Speaker 2>was like beer</v>

1622
01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:34.630
<v Speaker 8>just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean he could drink yourself to death.</v>

1623
01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:36.910
<v Speaker 8>We all know someone who's drank </v>
<v Speaker 8>themselves to death.</v>

1624
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:38.643
<v Speaker 8>I think our obesity problem would </v>
<v Speaker 8>probably be John to be the weight I </v>

1625
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:47.260
<v Speaker 8>wanted to be,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1626
01:09:47.261 --> 01:09:49.980
<v Speaker 8>I might be closer to the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I really truly want to be,</v>

1627
01:09:49.981 --> 01:09:50.814
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have a theory and my theory is that </v>

1628
01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:55.083
<v Speaker 8>much like how we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you take sugar out of things and then </v>

1629
01:09:58.871 --> 01:10:00.580
<v Speaker 8>just have like processed sugar and you </v>
<v Speaker 8>eat.</v>

1630
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:02.500
<v Speaker 8>It's terrible for your body because it's</v>
<v Speaker 8>not as numb.</v>

1631
01:10:02.501 --> 01:10:05.200
<v Speaker 8>All the natural fibers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's very dangerous.</v>

1632
01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.210
<v Speaker 8>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like you get fat.</v>

1633
01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.210
<v Speaker 8>It's not dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not saying it's like nuclear power,</v>

1634
01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:14.950
<v Speaker 8>but my theory is that I bet those coca </v>
<v Speaker 8>leaves are exactly the same way.</v>

1635
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:15.993
<v Speaker 8>I bet if you just chew those coca leaves</v>
<v Speaker 8>like those people do up in the </v>

1636
01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:19.690
<v Speaker 8>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's great for you.</v>

1637
01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:22.720
<v Speaker 8>I think it's just like eating fruit is </v>
<v Speaker 8>really good for you right now.</v>

1638
01:10:22.721 --> 01:10:24.940
<v Speaker 8>Like if you have a bowl of fresh </v>
<v Speaker 8>blueberries,</v>

1639
01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.880
<v Speaker 8>that's not just because it had some </v>
<v Speaker 8>sugar in it that's really good for you.</v>

1640
01:10:27.881 --> 01:10:30.070
<v Speaker 8>Rich and antioxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 8>rich in vitamins,</v>

1641
01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.870
<v Speaker 8>strawberries.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Delicious.</v>

1642
01:10:31.871 --> 01:10:33.310
<v Speaker 8>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not Bad for you,</v>

1643
01:10:33.311 --> 01:10:36.520
<v Speaker 8>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But like spoons or sugar in arguably not</v>

1644
01:10:36.521 --> 01:10:37.390
<v Speaker 8>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1645
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:41.290
<v Speaker 8>I mean not the worst though.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What you're talking about right there is</v>

1646
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:43.570
<v Speaker 8>something process versus something </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's natural.</v>

1647
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.460
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's exactly the same thing.</v>

1648
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.570
<v Speaker 8>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would actually,</v>

1649
01:10:46.571 --> 01:10:49.120
<v Speaker 8>if I with all my heart issues,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got a heart valve.</v>

1650
01:10:49.121 --> 01:10:52.150
<v Speaker 8>If you sat two plates on and have played</v>
<v Speaker 8>a coke and you said you had to do one of</v>

1651
01:10:52.151 --> 01:10:53.590
<v Speaker 8>these and here's some cocoa leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd be like Oh fuck,</v>

1652
01:10:53.591 --> 01:10:54.424
<v Speaker 8>I'll chew those.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cocoa leaves all one and I want to </v>

1653
01:10:55.481 --> 01:10:56.314
<v Speaker 8>experience that man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to know what that's like because </v>

1654
01:10:58.090 --> 01:10:58.923
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>things I'm writing about are like pets </v>

1655
01:11:00.221 --> 01:11:02.230
<v Speaker 8>that work in those,</v>
<v Speaker 8>cause that's mountainous area.</v>

1656
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:04.450
<v Speaker 8>They liked chewing them all day and work</v>
<v Speaker 8>and do shit.</v>

1657
01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.460
<v Speaker 8>It's just like coffee to them in a weird</v>
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>

1658
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:07.300
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe a little,</v>

1659
01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:08.163
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it's stronger than coffee </v>

1660
01:11:09.731 --> 01:11:11.080
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it is.</v>

1661
01:11:11.081 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 8>I think from everybody that describes </v>
<v Speaker 8>the describe it as</v>

1662
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.240
<v Speaker 2>like just a mild stimulant and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel good and it also has like,</v>

1663
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:21.000
<v Speaker 2>what did they call flavell chewing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1664
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.280
<v Speaker 2>It's getting yourself so Lima is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissolving.</v>

1665
01:11:23.281 --> 01:11:24.114
<v Speaker 2>You're processing it through a digestive</v>
<v Speaker 2>system instead of just banging it </v>

1666
01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 2>straight to your brain in a power of </v>
<v Speaker 2>powder form.</v>

1667
01:11:28.891 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Prob,</v>

1668
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I'm speaking way out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>line here.</v>

1669
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it take to make a line?</v>

1670
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.520
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be 400 coca leaves.</v>

1671
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Like how many strawberries does it take </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a good tablespoon of sugar?</v>

1672
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good,</v>

1673
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.630
<v Speaker 2>that's a good analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1674
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 2>There's whiskeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Nice.</v>

1675
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:52.014
<v Speaker 2>So feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn this California marijuana is </v>

1676
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 2>also very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1677
01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Can't complain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't complain.</v>

1678
01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.710
<v Speaker 2>But we sparked up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1679
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole thing right there of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this whole new ae.</v>

1680
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I've smoked my share fair share of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>dabs and whatnot here,</v>

1681
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 2>but like now we're talking about let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to keep it 100% honest,</v>

1682
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.080
<v Speaker 2>we've always kind of sat around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoked joints and be like,</v>

1683
01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:14.790
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really do drugs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>processed into an actual work,</v>

1686
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:27.650
<v Speaker 2>potent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more compact form form to smoke.</v>

1687

<v Speaker 2>It's the math of weed dabs,</v>

1688
01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:32.430
<v Speaker 2>like phrase tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1723

<v Speaker 2>glasses of wine or do you do want to </v>

<v Speaker 2>You went too far into the dark land son.</v>

1727
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.370
<v Speaker 2>You met the shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how much weed you smoked,</v>

1728
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.300
<v Speaker 2>the orks you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong about that.</v>

1729
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right about it.</v>

1730
01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:09.024
<v Speaker 2>You're right about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the average Joe cat like that </v>

1731
01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:13.860
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you know how much we use smoke?</v>

1732
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.063
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that fucked up from a dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know I have smoked a lot of </v>

1733
01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:20.050
<v Speaker 2>weed for 20 fucking years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1734
01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.513
<v Speaker 2>But what it will do if you smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I don't want to do about that shit </v>

1735
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:27.640
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand is why I don't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ton of it is because it'll,</v>

1736
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you'll stop getting high from actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>weed if you do too much of that be,</v>

1737
01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 2>that'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's what the best way to be is get</v>

1738
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:36.263
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So often that you can be high and not </v>

1739
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:42.790
<v Speaker 2>even feel like your high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe that's the best place to be.</v>

1748
01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:10.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no point to me smoking if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting a buzz.</v>

1749
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.590
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1750
01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:16.591
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is achieve a perpetual </v>
<v Speaker 2>vibration of uh,</v>

1751
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:17.743
<v Speaker 2>let's call called elevation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's could not call it being high to </v>

1752
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.693
<v Speaker 2>achieve a perpetual state where it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>common and normal that you don't even </v>

1753
01:15:26.681 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 2>feel like you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we live?</v>

1754
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that how we live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty close.</v>

1755
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Pretty far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty close.</v>

1756
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I take days off though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you take days?</v>

1757
01:15:33.431 --> 01:15:34.264
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly more than I like since in the </v>

1758
01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:38.164
<v Speaker 2>last seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more than it used to because of my </v>

1759
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:42.190
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to give away before my kids,</v>

1760
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I was perpetually high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was high from the morning.</v>

1761
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.083
<v Speaker 2>I woke up to the moment I went to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't even look at that as a bad </v>

1762
01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:51.180
<v Speaker 2>thing or like I like smoked weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1763
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.690
<v Speaker 2>I was perpetually high.</v>

1764
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:53.583
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive and very smart who also do </v>

1765
01:15:56.141 --> 01:15:58.600
<v Speaker 2>that now and they enjoy it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wife and I,</v>

01:15:58.601 --> 01:16:02.050
<v Speaker 2>at the end of a long day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go out in the backyard and because</v>

1767
01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:04.530
<v Speaker 2>we don't smoke anywhere near the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause of cystic fibrosis and other,</v>

1768
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.760
<v Speaker 2>but like we will just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>

1769
01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Fuck anyone who doesn't like it,</v>

1774
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 2>But if I wasn't getting as in smoking or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get even,</v>

1775
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I didn't get a buzz,</v>

1776
01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:29.650
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a happy thing.</v>

1777
01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying get even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying state elevators,</v>

1778
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:35.380
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're elevated the entire time.</v>

1779
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:36.403
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like you know you're breathing in </v>

1780
01:16:37.211 --> 01:16:38.044
<v Speaker 2>oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you pay attention to it on a </v>

1781
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:42.310
<v Speaker 2>regular basis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then just like knowing I liked it,</v>

1782
01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I liked the conscious actual like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1783
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a relieve state of pain right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1784
01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:48.363
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1785
01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a essentially army cookies man.</v>

1786
01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:53.674
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking for cookies or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's because I live in a </v>

1787
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:58.990
<v Speaker 2>slightly elevated level of stress than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the average person.</v>

1788
01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.640
<v Speaker 2>By appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know the difference.</v>

1789
01:17:00.641 --> 01:17:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel that cushion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the pillow on the bed for me.</v>

1790
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel the pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to just accept it's there.</v>

1791
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:07.624
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go Buddhists like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and washing the dishes just to wash </v>

1792
01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:09.630
<v Speaker 2>dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1793
01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I want to get</v>

1794
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.680
<v Speaker 8>high to get the fuck Outta here for </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking five minutes.</v>

1795
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:13.543
<v Speaker 8>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I find that it's one of the most </v>

1796
01:17:14.211 --> 01:17:15.860
<v Speaker 8>beneficial things about being high as </v>
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

1797
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:16.694
<v Speaker 8>I've only thinking about a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I'm thinking about them very </v>

1798
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:20.900
<v Speaker 8>intensely,</v>
<v Speaker 8>simply and very intently.</v>

1799
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:25.280
<v Speaker 8>Instead of thinking about a whole host </v>
<v Speaker 8>of things peripherally where it's almost</v>

1800
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 8>like there's too much data coming in </v>
<v Speaker 8>from all these other things that I don't</v>

1801
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 8>really care about or need.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

1802
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:31.423
<v Speaker 8>you care about all sorts of things in </v>
<v Speaker 8>your life that you're not going to deal </v>

1803
01:17:33.621 --> 01:17:34.454
<v Speaker 8>with right now and take to harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even a chunk of that in your </v>

1804
01:17:37.701 --> 01:17:38.534
<v Speaker 8>consciousness is it robs the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 8>your resources for thinking about other </v>

1805
01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:43.784
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that's one of the most apparent </v>

1806
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:47.870
<v Speaker 8>things about pot to me because like when</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

1807
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 8>here's a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when I smoked pot and then I play pool,</v>

1808
01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:55.820
<v Speaker 8>I am 20% better,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like a legitimate 20% better.</v>

1809
01:17:56.030 --> 01:18:00.290
<v Speaker 8>And I really think that it's because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 8>not thinking about,</v>

1810
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:04.010
<v Speaker 8>oh I gotta do this and then I got to </v>
<v Speaker 8>call that guy and then this guy,</v>

1811
01:18:04.011 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 8>I got to respond as to his text.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got to respond to that person's email.</v>

1812
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.830
<v Speaker 8>When I get high,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just see balls,</v>

1813
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.903
<v Speaker 8>I see balls and green cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And either one step further is you're </v>

1814
01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:15.104
<v Speaker 8>also not even thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got to beat this fucking guy you're </v>

1815
01:18:17.061 --> 01:18:19.010
<v Speaker 8>thinking about and I want to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 8>Shannon douchebag.</v>

1816
01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:19.341
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1817
01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 8>but you want to make the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's more about the shot though.</v>

1818
01:18:21.981 --> 01:18:22.814
<v Speaker 8>Like I want to make it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to fucking win this game cause I </v>

1819
01:18:24.321 --> 01:18:26.630
<v Speaker 8>want to make the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to do you see the angle?</v>

1820
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:27.643
<v Speaker 8>There's a zen to it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a thing that happens with pool </v>

1821
01:18:30.231 --> 01:18:34.250
<v Speaker 8>that happens the same way in archery and</v>
<v Speaker 8>then in archery,</v>

1822
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:37.820
<v Speaker 8>like when you hit a target there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's so foolish.</v>

1823
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:38.653
<v Speaker 8>Like of course it's just a a hay bale </v>
<v Speaker 8>with a target on it with a little paper </v>

1824
01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:46.010
<v Speaker 8>target that has a yellow center and you </v>
<v Speaker 8>hit the yellow center.</v>

1825
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:47.960
<v Speaker 8>Whoop de do nothing changed in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>world.</v>

1826
01:18:47.961 --> 01:18:51.520
<v Speaker 8>I understand that like rationally as my </v>
<v Speaker 8>Dick was say hard.</v>

1827
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:52.550
<v Speaker 8>If I do that though,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd be like,</v>

1828
01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:57.320
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the thing about doing that is that I</v>

1829
01:18:57.321 --> 01:19:00.860
<v Speaker 8>don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when you do something correctly,</v>

1830
01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:04.400
<v Speaker 8>when it all flows in harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just like with pool,</v>

1831
01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:07.430
<v Speaker 8>it's the same thing when you have a long</v>
<v Speaker 8>shot and it goes in.</v>

1832
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.490
<v Speaker 8>If you've ever been at a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you watch people play pool and some</v>

1833
01:19:10.491 --> 01:19:11.324
<v Speaker 8>dude makes or some woman makes the </v>
<v Speaker 8>craziest shot ever for the win and </v>

1834
01:19:14.361 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 8>everybody goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh Shit.</v>

1835
01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:17.563
<v Speaker 8>Because we know how hard it is to do and</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's something poetic and beautiful </v>

1836
01:19:21.351 --> 01:19:22.490
<v Speaker 8>about watching it happen.</v>

1837
01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 8>It's the that you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why Gulf makes any sense at all?</v>

1838
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:27.853
<v Speaker 8>I live on a golf course basically.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like to hit the balls and fucking I </v>

1839
01:19:31.341 --> 01:19:34.880
<v Speaker 8>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But what keeps you coming back is you'll</v>

1840
01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:39.881
<v Speaker 8>play that 18 whole day and one time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you feel you'll hit the shot that you</v>

1841
01:19:40.671 --> 01:19:45.200
<v Speaker 8>meant to hit the way you meant to hit it</v>
<v Speaker 8>and it went where you're meant to go and</v>

1842
01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:48.140
<v Speaker 8>you're like I can do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know I can too.</v>

1843
01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 8>I don't play Golf Jason.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like crack.</v>

1844
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:52.460
<v Speaker 8>You're chasing that first fucking high </v>
<v Speaker 8>forever.</v>

1845
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.353
<v Speaker 8>I'm not disrespecting anybody who plays </v>
<v Speaker 8>golf cause I know I would get addicted </v>

1846
01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 8>but I don't play golf because I know I'd</v>
<v Speaker 8>get it.</v>

1847
01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:01.670
<v Speaker 8>Because you would,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your whole personal it would cause you'd</v>

1848
01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:04.490
<v Speaker 8>hit that one shot the first day and </v>
<v Speaker 8>you'd be like,</v>

1851
01:20:09.901 --> 01:20:11.190

<v Speaker 8>The exact same reason.</v>

1852
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.260
<v Speaker 8>My friend in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jimmy Lawless,</v>

1853
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:15.960
<v Speaker 8>good buddy of mine to this day when we </v>
<v Speaker 8>were back in high school,</v>

1854
01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 8>we went to a party and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people were doing coke and he goes,</v>

1855
01:20:18.961 --> 01:20:19.950
<v Speaker 8>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>don't do it.</v>

1856

1860
01:20:32.521 --> 01:20:33.570

<v Speaker 8>I've said this before,</v>

1861
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:34.404
<v Speaker 8>but this is a real thing that happened </v>
<v Speaker 8>where it was on two lane road and we </v>

1862
01:20:37.111 --> 01:20:39.750
<v Speaker 8>were driving side this car that had the </v>
<v Speaker 8>dome light on.</v>

1863
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 8>And I looked over and there was this </v>
<v Speaker 8>chick and I'll never forget her arms.</v>

1864
01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 8>She had these big arms like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like almost like,</v>

1865
01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:47.243
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like she had a sleeveless shirt with </v>

1866
01:20:48.331 --> 01:20:49.164
<v Speaker 8>like thick arms.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like it was kind of girl that would </v>

1867
01:20:50.881 --> 01:20:52.560
<v Speaker 8>punch him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1868
01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:53.543
<v Speaker 8>And she was doing coke in the back seat </v>
<v Speaker 8>and she looked over at me with the Dome </v>

1869
01:20:56.011 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 8>light on and she just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck you.</v>

1870
01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:01.740
<v Speaker 8>She just says it to me like I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 8>looking at her.</v>

1871
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.050
<v Speaker 8>I'm just looking at her.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're doing coke,</v>

1872
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:05.970
<v Speaker 8>you're on the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're on a two lane road.</v>

1873
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:08.220
<v Speaker 8>There's the only two cars in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm watching you do coke.</v>

1874
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:11.820
<v Speaker 8>I'm seven feet away from you doing coke </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you're saying fuck you.</v>

1875
01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Like whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck coke.</v>

1876
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1877
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.153
<v Speaker 2>We used to call it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a few experiences with coke in my </v>

1878
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:19.740
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here,</v>

1879
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:22.680
<v Speaker 2>here's the breakdown of cocaine and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's evil.</v>

1880
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.083
<v Speaker 2>We used to call it amongst a few people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I actually trusted enough to </v>

1881
01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 2>partake of it in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We called it the sneaky pouch.</v>

1882
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:31.973
<v Speaker 2>Sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what would happen is like you </v>

1883
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:35.070
<v Speaker 2>get some coke and it'd be like in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fold,</v>

1884
01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:36.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a paper fold.</v>

1885
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would put in for some coke and</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

1886
01:21:38.521 --> 01:21:40.830
<v Speaker 2>you'd go somewhere and every once in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>

1887
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

1888
01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me get past some,</v>

1889
01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.840
<v Speaker 2>go to the bathroom real quick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1890
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:45.743
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1891
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.690
<v Speaker 2>When you went to that bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of coke,</v>

1892
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:50.933
<v Speaker 2>you would take a little piece of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of yourself and put it in your own </v>

1893
01:21:52.831 --> 01:21:54.380
<v Speaker 2>little dollar bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1894
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:55.810
<v Speaker 2>you're sneaky Boucher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sneaky,</v>

1895
01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.890
<v Speaker 2>sneaky pouch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what it says about,</v>

1896
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.010
<v Speaker 2>and everybody did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole crew,</v>

1897
01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.350
<v Speaker 2>like nobody made cop to it and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

1898
01:22:04.351 --> 01:22:05.184
<v Speaker 2>it got analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like we all know we took a </v>

1899
01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:08.400
<v Speaker 2>little piece for ourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1900
01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Off of the cook file and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever sneaky pouch.</v>

1901
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:11.561
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1902
01:22:11.561 --> 01:22:12.394
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1903
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:14.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you writing this?</v>

1904
01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:18.213
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1905
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:23.210
<v Speaker 2>so it's like kind of just describes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of what that what mind state that</v>

1906
01:22:23.211 --> 01:22:23.991
<v Speaker 2>puts you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1907
01:22:23.991 --> 01:22:25.820
<v Speaker 2>well fuck everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this goes,</v>

1908
01:22:25.821 --> 01:22:27.650
<v Speaker 2>if everybody's sniffs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's sniffing,</v>

1909
01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:28.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

1910
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.830
<v Speaker 2>that's what that drug creates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why,</v>

1911
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:31.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1912
01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I think three times in my life I've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

1913
01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:35.173
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Any drug that radically changes your </v>

1914
01:22:36.471 --> 01:22:37.304
<v Speaker 8>brain chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether it's whiskey or whether it's </v>

1915
01:22:39.771 --> 01:22:41.000
<v Speaker 8>coke or eat,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1916
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:43.580
<v Speaker 8>honestly even pot,</v>
<v Speaker 8>especially pertaining to edibles,</v>

1917
01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:46.520
<v Speaker 8>we should watch it very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What happens when people take it,</v>

1918
01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.653
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think that's one of the things </v>

1919
01:22:48.051 --> 01:22:48.884
<v Speaker 8>that I've been guilty of and I know a </v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of other people have been guilty of </v>

1920
01:22:50.661 --> 01:22:52.250
<v Speaker 8>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just to totally come clean.</v>

1921
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:53.383
<v Speaker 8>I defend pot so much that I never look </v>
<v Speaker 8>at the potential negative consequences </v>

1922
01:22:57.441 --> 01:23:00.380
<v Speaker 8>of people doing pot if they're too young</v>
<v Speaker 8>because I didn't do it when I was down.</v>

1923
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:05.350
<v Speaker 8>I mean did a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe like a handful of times before was</v>

1924
01:23:05.351 --> 01:23:08.650
<v Speaker 8>30 and then when I was 30 I met Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 8>Bravo.</v>

1925
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.950
<v Speaker 8>We started getting blazed all the time </v>
<v Speaker 8>and it just changed the entire west.</v>

1926
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.950
<v Speaker 8>Second Pot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I smoked pot was 14 I'd,</v>

1927
01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.860
<v Speaker 8>well I definitely smoked it younger than</v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

1928
01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.693
<v Speaker 8>I smoked when I was eight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My stepdad gave me someone I was eight </v>

1929
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:25.420
<v Speaker 8>just to a puff cause I was curious.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

1930
01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:26.770
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what and what happens when you do it?</v>

1931
01:23:26.771 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do you want to try it?</v>

1932
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.830
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how much should I breathe in?</v>

1933
01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.540
<v Speaker 8>He goes on breathing in a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just breathing a little bit.</v>

1934
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.553
<v Speaker 8>This is obviously like sketchy memory.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I did it once when I was eight and then </v>

1935
01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:39.780
<v Speaker 8>the next time I did it I was probably </v>
<v Speaker 8>like 14 and then I did it probably maybe</v>

1936
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:40.730
<v Speaker 8>again when I was sending him</v>

1937
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:44.840
<v Speaker 2>teen when we cut school and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

1938
01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:48.230
<v Speaker 2>a couple of kids that were the cool guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I kind of took a liking to me and I</v>

1939
01:23:48.231 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

1940
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:49.683
<v Speaker 2>like coke is like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go hang out with these </v>

1941
01:23:50.931 --> 01:23:51.764
<v Speaker 2>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They smoke weed and I remembered I hit </v>

1942
01:23:53.391 --> 01:23:55.410
<v Speaker 2>it and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were telling me like,</v>

1943
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.170
<v Speaker 2>have you ever smoked weed or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never spoke with her.</v>

1944
01:23:57.171 --> 01:23:58.004
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing might happen to you the first </v>

1945
01:23:58.371 --> 01:23:59.204
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember vividly hitting this </v>

1946
01:24:01.611 --> 01:24:05.840
<v Speaker 2>joint with these dudes and literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending probably an hour and 30 minutes</v>

1947
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:08.150
<v Speaker 2>laughing my balls off that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1948
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:10.480
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was the greatest thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1949
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:13.220
<v Speaker 2>And from then on I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit baseball.</v>

1950
01:24:14.130 --> 01:24:17.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it popcorn became an artist.</v>

1951
01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Well I started drawing and painting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>walls.</v>

1952
01:24:21.261 --> 01:24:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a different person.</v>

1953
01:24:22.941 --> 01:24:23.774
<v Speaker 2>That changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We eat is another thing that's probably </v>

1954
01:24:25.551 --> 01:24:26.384
<v Speaker 2>semi responses.</v>

1955
01:24:26.410 --> 01:24:27.243
<v Speaker 8>Well from my path I had a very important</v>
<v Speaker 8>moment when I was 16 like I only smoked </v>

1956
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:33.910
<v Speaker 8>weed a handful of times before I was 30 </v>
<v Speaker 8>years old,</v>

1957
01:24:33.911 --> 01:24:34.744
<v Speaker 8>like less than 12 like legitimately and </v>
<v Speaker 8>a one time when I was 16 it was me and </v>

1958
01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:43.930
<v Speaker 8>my girlfriend and my best friend who </v>
<v Speaker 8>went over her house and uh,</v>

1959
01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.793
<v Speaker 8>I had stole some weed for my Stepdad and</v>
<v Speaker 8>we'd rolled up a joint and we got so </v>

1960
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:52.144
<v Speaker 8>high we were teleporting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We would like find ourselves in the </v>

1961
01:24:55.151 --> 01:24:57.000
<v Speaker 8>kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>astro bleeding type show.</v>

1962
01:24:57.001 --> 01:24:57.834
<v Speaker 8>I'll be staring at each other on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>couch and then all of a sudden we'd be </v>

1963
01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:01.930
<v Speaker 8>in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We were barbecued.</v>

1964
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:02.913
<v Speaker 8>We were were fucking 16 I think my </v>
<v Speaker 8>girlfriend at the time was 15 had josh </v>

<v Speaker 8>he was,</v>

1966
01:25:08.351 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 8>he was 16 and we were just time </v>
<v Speaker 8>traveling all over the fucking building.</v>

1967
01:25:13.031 --> 01:25:14.830
<v Speaker 8>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we were way too high.</v>

1968
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:16.870
<v Speaker 8>That's how I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I</v>

1969
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:20.690
<v Speaker 2>described the for the first and only </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I ever smoked dust.</v>

1970
01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:21.913
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did that while I hung out with like </v>

1971
01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:27.240
<v Speaker 2>when I was one of the neighborhoods I </v>
<v Speaker 2>moved into this.</v>

1972
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Is there a fucking gateway drug to dust </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tell me what it is.</v>

1973
01:25:30.811 --> 01:25:34.350
<v Speaker 2>It's called Solos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cholos.</v>

1974
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Did they go right from Diet Pepsi to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dust?</v>

1975
01:25:36.621 --> 01:25:37.454
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my story is I moved onto this </v>

1976
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:43.070
<v Speaker 2>street called Independence Avenue in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the valley.</v>

1977
01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:46.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like West valley kind of Desoto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sherman Way Ish.</v>

1978
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:51.890
<v Speaker 2>And it was heavily Latino neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like we moved in and it was cool.</v>

1979
01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I lived here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came friends with a lot of people,</v>

1980
01:25:53.931 --> 01:25:55.490
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1981
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I went from like the end of elementary </v>
<v Speaker 2>school into junior high,</v>

1982
01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.970
<v Speaker 2>right in that era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like once we hit the junior high,</v>

1983
01:26:01.971 --> 01:26:05.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like a lot of the Mexican kids I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was hanging out with started hanging out</v>

1984
01:26:05.061 --> 01:26:05.894
<v Speaker 2>with you a little bit older Mason </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate kids and a lot of them were </v>

1985
01:26:07.341 --> 01:26:09.590
<v Speaker 2>dealing in like kind of gang life over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1986
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1987
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.020
<v Speaker 2>it's just part of the way they get down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1988
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of them like to fucking do </v>
<v Speaker 2>dips,</v>

1989
01:26:16.131 --> 01:26:21.050
<v Speaker 2>which is like a fucking sherm cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 2>dipped into my fucking angel angel dust.</v>

1990
01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like healthy choice dude's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how I wound up with this,</v>

1991
01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:27.650
<v Speaker 2>this little tattoo right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first Tattoo I ever had in my life.</v>

1992
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 2>This little three dots normally is </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be up here,</v>

1993
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:31.820
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't in a gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1994
01:26:31.821 --> 01:26:32.654
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like for some reason I was so </v>

1995
01:26:34.071 --> 01:26:35.390
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what wound up,</v>

1996
01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:37.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this represents what they call them a Mi</v>

1997
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Vida loca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like little three dots here.</v>

1998
01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.213
<v Speaker 2>But it's like that happened because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoked dust because these dudes pass me </v>

1999
01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:45.070
<v Speaker 2>the showroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know what I was,</v>

2000
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:46.363
<v Speaker 2>I was like this bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the literally the way you just </v>

2001
01:26:47.751 --> 01:26:49.370
<v Speaker 2>described that time traveling and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2002
01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I felt like if I thought of something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2003
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:55.490
<v Speaker 2>by the time I was finished with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought of thinking to do it,</v>

2004
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I had already done it.</v>

2005
01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call my mom because my mom </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like fucking nuts.</v>

2006
01:27:05.271 --> 01:27:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I fucking never experienced anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2007
01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was terrified,</v>

2008
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:11.690
<v Speaker 2>terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck is going on.</v>

2009
01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:14.190
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2010
01:27:14.191 --> 01:27:15.024
<v Speaker 2>It gave me a lot of feelings is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember the first Friday movie when </v>

2011
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>snuck him a little piece of dust,</v>

2012
01:27:21.531 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 2>any fucking line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2013
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't lose my mind naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>

2014
01:27:24.711 --> 01:27:27.380
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like I was the butt of a joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>that night.</v>

2015
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somebody gave me some dust.</v>

2016
01:27:28.941 --> 01:27:29.774
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's watch fucking the white boy </v>

2017
01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:31.244
<v Speaker 2>fucking trip on dust on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it made for a good story on Joe </v>

2018
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're either,</v>

2019
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.153
<v Speaker 8>I had an ex boxing coach who had his </v>
<v Speaker 8>finger bitten off when he was on dust </v>

2020
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.680
<v Speaker 8>and he had his toe removed and a his </v>
<v Speaker 8>second toe replaced his index finger and</v>

2021
01:27:52.831 --> 01:27:57.490
<v Speaker 8>he made it curled so that he could keep </v>
<v Speaker 8>throwing right hooks because he did.</v>

2022
01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.790
<v Speaker 8>So when you'd shake his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you'd shake his hand.</v>

2023
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.950
<v Speaker 8>He would get like,</v>

<v Speaker 8>he didn't get indicted.</v>

2044
01:29:10.381 --> 01:29:11.214
<v Speaker 8>He got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if they ever even tried </v>

2045
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:13.944
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>

2046
01:29:14.770 --> 01:29:15.603
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>

2047
01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:21.610
<v Speaker 2>long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say,</v>

2048
01:29:21.611 --> 01:29:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much I can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's life.</v>

2049
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a nice guy,</v>

2050
01:29:27.521 --> 01:29:29.350
<v Speaker 2>but I think you might have fucked a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>people up.</v>

2051
01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing weirder to me.</v>

2052
01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Would not even weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the right word,</v>

2053
01:29:38.110 --> 01:29:42.940
<v Speaker 2>but strange and uncomfortable as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

2054
01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.513
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking about like ex </v>
<v Speaker 2>marines are guys who have been in the </v>

2055
01:29:47.201 --> 01:29:48.490
<v Speaker 2>war or anything like that I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2056
01:29:48.491 --> 01:29:49.324
<v Speaker 2>but like a civilian person and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>around quite a few of these kinds of </v>

2057
01:29:52.151 --> 01:29:52.984
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be biker gang guys or </v>

2058
01:29:54.461 --> 01:29:55.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To that,</v>

2059
01:29:55.421 --> 01:29:56.770
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2060
01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know have fucking killed,</v>

2061
01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:00.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>

2062
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:01.233
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're not feeling threatened by </v>

2063
01:30:02.471 --> 01:30:03.304
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think they're going to kill </v>

2064
01:30:03.521 --> 01:30:05.230
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like you know it's,</v>

2065
01:30:05.231 --> 01:30:06.064
<v Speaker 2>there's a d</v>

2066
01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.970
<v Speaker 8>I used to train a guy who was in yt </v>
<v Speaker 8>bolgers gang.</v>

2067
01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:11.190
<v Speaker 8>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2068
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.320
<v Speaker 8>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if he was a Hitman,</v>

2069
01:30:13.321 --> 01:30:15.750
<v Speaker 8>but that was like the room or the room </v>
<v Speaker 8>one at least.</v>

2070
01:30:15.751 --> 01:30:16.584
<v Speaker 8>But he asked me why I was teaching him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He asked me if I was going to kill </v>

2071
01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:20.640
<v Speaker 8>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's,</v>

2072
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 8>what's the best place to hit him?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And we sat around talking about,</v>

2073
01:30:24.031 --> 01:30:24.864
<v Speaker 8>it were,</v>
<v Speaker 8>me and him were talking about this when </v>

2074
01:30:25.651 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 8>I was a black bow and he was a white </v>
<v Speaker 8>belt.</v>

2075
01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:29.250
<v Speaker 8>So it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was like a valid conversation for him</v>

2076
01:30:29.251 --> 01:30:33.450
<v Speaker 8>to be having with a 20 year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that was like the neck.</v>

2077
01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:34.560
<v Speaker 8>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would,</v>

2078
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.190
<v Speaker 8>I would hit someone in the neck like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your next very vulnerable and people get</v>

2079
01:30:38.191 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 8>knocked out very easily if they get hit </v>
<v Speaker 8>in the neck.</v>

2080
01:30:40.291 --> 01:30:42.660
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes even more so than the head.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he was like,</v>

2081
01:30:42.661 --> 01:30:44.580
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And we looked at each other.</v>

2082
01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:45.414
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2083
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.800
<v Speaker 8>this is what I want you to work on right</v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

2084
01:30:46.801 --> 01:30:47.634
<v Speaker 8>We're going to work.</v>

2085
01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's funny because I had a cousin when</v>

2086
01:30:50.341 --> 01:30:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like before,</v>

2087
01:30:51.991 --> 01:30:52.824
<v Speaker 2>like any of the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 1918 I was in California </v>

2088
01:30:56.221 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 2>visiting and he was a correctional </v>
<v Speaker 2>officer,</v>

2089
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:00.293
<v Speaker 2>oo in upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said the thing they were taught </v>

2090
01:31:03.361 --> 01:31:04.194
<v Speaker 2>first is cause all they walk around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only like maybe 30 guards at a </v>

2091
01:31:06.931 --> 01:31:11.430
<v Speaker 2>time on duty and what 600 to a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners.</v>

2092
01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.333
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And depending on what the circumstances </v>

2093
01:31:13.591 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 2>are and all they have is a big metal key</v>
<v Speaker 2>ring.</v>

2094
01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.033
<v Speaker 2>And they're taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you fucking do is punch </v>

2095
01:31:18.231 --> 01:31:19.850
<v Speaker 2>a dude right in his fucking throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 2>If you feel like you're any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2097
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:22.434
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told me that like that he was </v>

2098
01:31:23.521 --> 01:31:24.354
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was going to give you any advice </v>

2099
01:31:24.721 --> 01:31:27.200
<v Speaker 2>and you felt like you were fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the first thing you do.</v>

2100
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:28.243
<v Speaker 2>And I and he explained it well enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I knew and as even as a young man </v>

2101
01:31:31.231 --> 01:31:33.120
<v Speaker 2>like you're playing with a person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

2102
01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:35.520
<v Speaker 2>punching them in the fucking Adam's </v>
<v Speaker 2>apple or something,</v>

2103
01:31:35.521 --> 01:31:36.354
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With a kill them with like full like he </v>

2104
01:31:37.771 --> 01:31:39.720
<v Speaker 2>was like well what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can just put your fist.</v>

2105
01:31:39.721 --> 01:31:40.554
<v Speaker 2>If you hit him rake you would be amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be amazed at how much damage </v>

2106
01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:44.180
<v Speaker 2>people can take.</v>

2107
01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:45.013
<v Speaker 8>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd rather get punched in the Adam's </v>

2108
01:31:46.071 --> 01:31:46.904
<v Speaker 8>apple.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then I would get kicked in the side of </v>

2109
01:31:48.231 --> 01:31:51.800
<v Speaker 8>my head like around here cause this is </v>
<v Speaker 8>what shuts you off.</v>

2110
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:53.780
<v Speaker 8>It seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>

2111
01:31:53.781 --> 01:31:56.420
<v Speaker 8>many things can shut you off just with </v>
<v Speaker 8>the caveat.</v>

2112
01:31:56.490 --> 01:32:01.360
<v Speaker 8>Like you can get shut off with a kick,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even like to the top of your chest snaps</v>

2113
01:32:01.361 --> 01:32:02.194
<v Speaker 8>your head back so much and get shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But there's something about neck kicks </v>

2114
01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:07.840
<v Speaker 8>like Bang Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just go.</v>

2115
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:11.140
<v Speaker 8>They just crumpled and sometimes they </v>
<v Speaker 8>crumbled from Chin shots.</v>

2116
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.393
<v Speaker 8>But I think it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think with the Chin shot is doing is </v>

2117
01:32:15.371 --> 01:32:19.000
<v Speaker 8>somehow or another pinching the garden </v>
<v Speaker 8>hose that is the spine.</v>

2118
01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:21.400
<v Speaker 8>And shutting the system off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's also,</v>

2119
01:32:21.401 --> 01:32:22.690
<v Speaker 8>if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your,</v>

2120
01:32:22.691 --> 01:32:23.524
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your brain sits in that little bit of </v>

2121
01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:26.890
<v Speaker 8>fluid and if you have your scope moves </v>
<v Speaker 8>fast enough,</v>

2122
01:32:26.891 --> 01:32:29.530
<v Speaker 8>the brain doesn't move as fast and it </v>
<v Speaker 8>touches the,</v>

2123
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.393
<v Speaker 8>once a short rain touches the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's lights out that that absolutely </v>

2124
01:32:33.401 --> 01:32:33.940
<v Speaker 8>too.</v>

2125
01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:34.773
<v Speaker 8>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think the same principle like rear </v>

2126
01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:37.984
<v Speaker 8>naked chokes and um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>head kick knockouts are not the same in </v>

2127
01:32:41.561 --> 01:32:45.070
<v Speaker 8>that a rear naked choke is way safer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if you get choked unconscious,</v>

2128
01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 8>you're going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you get head kicked unconscious,</v>

2129
01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:50.110
<v Speaker 8>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you got to take some time off.</v>

2130
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:54.730
<v Speaker 8>Like you could just got fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But the mechanism behind them is kind of</v>

2131
01:32:54.731 --> 01:32:57.640
<v Speaker 8>similar in that it's cutting off the </v>
<v Speaker 8>circuitry,</v>

2132
01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:01.120
<v Speaker 8>not like specifically cause the choke is</v>
<v Speaker 8>like stopping the blood.</v>

2133
01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:02.163
<v Speaker 8>But the head kick is just jolting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like rebooting your computer head </v>

2134
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 8>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would imagine.</v>

2135
01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:09.580
<v Speaker 8>I've never experienced it nor can I </v>
<v Speaker 8>throw one that high.</v>

2136
01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.633
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I would imagine why it might be </v>

2137
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:14.440
<v Speaker 8>worse is because like right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can punch and it's the motion of the</v>

2138
01:33:14.441 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 8>head almost.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the brain not moving that is causing</v>

2139
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:18.760
<v Speaker 8>the knockout.</v>

2140
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.860
<v Speaker 8>If you get kicked like this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a shin.</v>

2141
01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:21.723
<v Speaker 8>It's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your head doesn't even get to move so </v>

2142
01:33:22.511 --> 01:33:23.344
<v Speaker 8>the brain is actually just cause getting</v>
<v Speaker 8>slammed against the other side of the </v>

2143
01:33:25.241 --> 01:33:28.300
<v Speaker 8>fucking skull.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've made this point really recently and</v>

2144
01:33:28.301 --> 01:33:31.390
<v Speaker 8>even yesterday I think people should </v>
<v Speaker 8>have no gloves on when they fight.</v>

2145
01:33:31.810 --> 01:33:34.780
<v Speaker 8>I think fighting with gloves is like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it makes it easier to punch people,</v>

2146
01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:35.614
<v Speaker 8>which is more an more unrealistic and </v>
<v Speaker 8>getting kicked in the head is way worse </v>

2147
01:33:39.161 --> 01:33:42.370
<v Speaker 8>than getting punched in the head wound.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That argument for Olympic head gear.</v>

2148
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.233
<v Speaker 8>That's why it's going away.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It causes more problems than it's </v>

2149
01:33:45.401 --> 01:33:46.234
<v Speaker 8>actually worth it at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I also think it's unrealistic in terms </v>

2150
01:33:48.311 --> 01:33:49.144
<v Speaker 8>of like the limitations of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like there's limitations of your body </v>

2151
01:33:51.611 --> 01:33:52.444
<v Speaker 8>with punching people and that's the your</v>
<v Speaker 8>risks bend like anybody's ever punched </v>

2152
01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:59.620
<v Speaker 8>someone or condone tape or just no bra,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no bra.</v>

2153
01:33:59.630 --> 01:34:00.550
<v Speaker 8>I that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2154
01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:01.973
<v Speaker 8>it was taped is really what the problem </v>
<v Speaker 8>is that when you take this risk like so </v>

2155
01:34:04.871 --> 01:34:07.210
<v Speaker 8>well that I can't really fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to,</v>

2156
01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:10.660
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to throw it with abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well also it's like no abandon you.</v>

2157
01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you can,</v>

2158
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.273
<v Speaker 8>if you can tape.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Here's what we're thinking with Noah </v>

2159
01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:15.003
<v Speaker 8>band.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

2160
01:34:15.761 --> 01:34:19.000
<v Speaker 8>with two people agreeing with a like a </v>
<v Speaker 8>rule set.</v>

2161
01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:19.834
<v Speaker 8>Like they agree,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay we're going to wear gloves and </v>

2162
01:34:20.801 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 8>we're going to wear khaki pants,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like things along those lines.</v>

2163
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:24.183
<v Speaker 8>But like if you could work gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>gloves for a striker or the equivalent </v>

2164
01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 8>of [inaudible] pants for a really good </v>
<v Speaker 8>Jujitsu guard player.</v>

2165
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:30.933
<v Speaker 8>Like if a guy like Eddie Bravo is </v>
<v Speaker 8>allowed to wear Gucci pants and he gets </v>

2166
01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:36.760
<v Speaker 8>you wrapped up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you'd like some regular dude,</v>

2167
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.340
<v Speaker 8>you're going to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're going to get fucked up.</v>

2168
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.870
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unless you're like some highly even like</v>

2169
01:34:40.871 --> 01:34:45.310
<v Speaker 8>coiler Gracie fucks up when he's wearing</v>
<v Speaker 8>the geek pants cause he knows that those</v>

2170
01:34:45.311 --> 01:34:48.190
<v Speaker 8>g pants provide insane amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 8>friction and traction.</v>

2171
01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.730
<v Speaker 8>Clamp a hold of you and he could do some</v>
<v Speaker 8>shit to you that you're just going to be</v>

2172
01:34:51.731 --> 01:34:54.190
<v Speaker 8>super uncomfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In a way,</v>

2173
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:56.920
<v Speaker 8>that's as much of an advantage for him </v>
<v Speaker 8>to be able to wear.</v>

2174
01:34:56.921 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 8>The g pants as it would be for a striker</v>
<v Speaker 8>to wear the gloves,</v>

2175
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 8>but only as tracker gets to wear the </v>
<v Speaker 8>gloves,</v>

2176
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:03.133
<v Speaker 8>like the grapplers have to wear shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like it's really kind of interesting </v>

2177
01:35:05.841 --> 01:35:06.674
<v Speaker 8>because having your knuckles taped up </v>
<v Speaker 8>and having your knuckles padded up is a </v>

2178
01:35:11.601 --> 01:35:15.320
<v Speaker 8>real advantage for someone who knows how</v>
<v Speaker 8>to hit things because you can,</v>

2179
01:35:15.321 --> 01:35:19.700
<v Speaker 8>you can be like much more a relaxed and </v>
<v Speaker 8>liberal with your use of punches.</v>

2180
01:35:19.701 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 8>You don't have to worry about hitting </v>
<v Speaker 8>bones,</v>

2181
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:24.470
<v Speaker 8>but you would never allow that the other</v>
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>

2182
01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:25.333
<v Speaker 8>like giving,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like giving the option of a striker to </v>

2183
01:35:26.901 --> 01:35:29.780
<v Speaker 8>wear hand pads and then a grappler to </v>
<v Speaker 8>where g pants,</v>

2184
01:35:29.781 --> 01:35:30.614
<v Speaker 8>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's like we have a very accepted idea </v>

2185
01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:34.130
<v Speaker 8>of what civilized.</v>

2186
01:35:34.130 --> 01:35:35.870
<v Speaker 8>One of the things is you cover your </v>
<v Speaker 8>knuckles.</v>

2187
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:38.690
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of stupid because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>have to cover your elbows,</v>

2188
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:42.170
<v Speaker 8>but people are smashing and slashing </v>
<v Speaker 8>people up with their elbows.</v>

2189
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 8>My case against it is that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 8>logical.</v>

2190
01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.630
<v Speaker 8>It's just historical.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're just,</v>

2191
01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 8>we're just going by a tradition and it's</v>
<v Speaker 8>not a logical tradition.</v>

2192
01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:52.890
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Still Queens,</v>

2193
01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:55.110
<v Speaker 8>mark's barry kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it is up,</v>

2194
01:35:55.150 --> 01:35:55.983
<v Speaker 8>but these are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these are limitations that we inherited </v>

2195
01:35:59.211 --> 01:36:03.380
<v Speaker 8>from a single discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it's also like think back back,</v>

2196
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.690
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not that long ago,</v>

2197
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:09.980
<v Speaker 8>a 75 round fight isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wasn't unheard of.</v>

2198
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:12.140
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They didn't have no cte.</v>

2199
01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:14.390
<v Speaker 8>There was no will smith movie.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was no,</v>

2200
01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:15.253
<v Speaker 8>no one knew what the fuck was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was no real sports with Bryant </v>

2201
01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.673
<v Speaker 8>Gumbel and nobody had any idea that </v>
<v Speaker 8>getting the hit in the head for that </v>

2202
01:36:21.711 --> 01:36:23.360
<v Speaker 8>long would be that bad for you.</v>

2203
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:25.370
<v Speaker 8>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:26.204
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's kind of fascinating when you think </v>

2205
01:36:26.931 --> 01:36:27.764
<v Speaker 8>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I really do think that the gloves </v>

2206
01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:30.440
<v Speaker 8>are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think we're doing a huge disservice to</v>

2207
01:36:30.441 --> 01:36:31.274
<v Speaker 8>the art of fighting because I think we </v>
<v Speaker 8>have unrealistic expectations based on </v>

2208
01:36:34.731 --> 01:36:37.940
<v Speaker 8>the idea that you could just punch </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone with padded knuckles.</v>

2209
01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:39.800
<v Speaker 8>I think if we didn't have padded </v>
<v Speaker 8>knuckles,</v>

2210
01:36:39.801 --> 01:36:42.290
<v Speaker 8>we'd be much more clever and how we use </v>
<v Speaker 8>our hands,</v>

2211
01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.213
<v Speaker 8>because you might break your hand in any</v>
<v Speaker 8>shot and it would be easy to choke </v>

2212
01:36:45.681 --> 01:36:46.514
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So jujitsu be more effective to have </v>

2213
01:36:48.291 --> 01:36:49.124
<v Speaker 8>those things are way better for the </v>
<v Speaker 8>athletes and way better for the the </v>

2214
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:55.520
<v Speaker 8>honest interpretation of what fighting </v>
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>

2215
01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:58.640
<v Speaker 8>The problem is no one's going to agree </v>
<v Speaker 8>to that because people got up from home,</v>

2216
01:36:58.641 --> 01:36:59.710
<v Speaker 8>they're going to look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

2217
01:36:59.711 --> 01:37:01.760
<v Speaker 8>this is barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is horrible.</v>

2218
01:37:01.761 --> 01:37:02.594
<v Speaker 8>They don't even have gloves on their </v>
<v Speaker 8>bare knock or the first time a guy </v>

2219
01:37:05.251 --> 01:37:08.160
<v Speaker 8>catches a tooth in his fast and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and it's just push open.</v>

2220
01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:09.013
<v Speaker 8>They're going to be in your elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which essentially it fixed in your chin </v>

2221
01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.030
<v Speaker 8>or,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2222
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:16.670
<v Speaker 8>me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but what's the difference between a,</v>

2223
01:37:16.671 --> 01:37:19.790
<v Speaker 8>you catching one and your knuckle or </v>
<v Speaker 8>catching one in the end of your foot?</v>

2224
01:37:19.791 --> 01:37:23.270
<v Speaker 8>When you kick someone's face sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can wheel kick them in the head with</v>

2225
01:37:23.271 --> 01:37:24.104
<v Speaker 8>your heel,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you can't punch them with bare </v>

2226
01:37:26.001 --> 01:37:27.530
<v Speaker 8>knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's stupid.</v>

2227
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:28.723
<v Speaker 8>It's a dumb rule.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's the whole six to 12 things and </v>

2228
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.120
<v Speaker 8>stupid too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't work,</v>

2229
01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:33.043
<v Speaker 8>but I'll leave that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll leave that and take no gloves any </v>

2230
01:37:35.271 --> 01:37:36.104
<v Speaker 8>day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I really think there should be no </v>

2231
01:37:36.501 --> 01:37:38.540
<v Speaker 8>gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think even for strikers,</v>

2232
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:39.561
<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah man,</v>

2233
01:37:39.561 --> 01:37:40.870
<v Speaker 8>you pad some dudes up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You,</v>

2234
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.490
<v Speaker 8>you fucking give a dude like tyrone's </v>
<v Speaker 8>loves.</v>

2235
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:45.520
<v Speaker 8>Just like protecting your lane.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Blood skin,</v>

2236
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:47.800
<v Speaker 8>but no taping.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What if that w would you,</v>

2237
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:49.640
<v Speaker 8>why urban text?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your knuckles and skin.</v>

2238
01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:51.500
<v Speaker 8>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What are we looking at?</v>

2239
01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:53.760
<v Speaker 8>We're looking at the why.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How can you look it up on my elbows,</v>

2240
01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 8>devil's advocate on that.</v>

2241
01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at exchange of bodily </v>
<v Speaker 2>fluids.</v>

2242
01:37:59.281 --> 01:38:01.350
<v Speaker 2>If I punch you in the teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2243
01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 8>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're getting that from everything.</v>

2244
01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:08.290
<v Speaker 8>You getting that from arms choke.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People really like people getting bitten</v>

2245
01:38:08.291 --> 01:38:10.450
<v Speaker 8>when they've been choke.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you choke like a rick,</v>

2246
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:13.870
<v Speaker 8>like you watched Damien Maia versus rick</v>
<v Speaker 8>story and he's going like right over his</v>

2247
01:38:13.871 --> 01:38:16.090
<v Speaker 8>face and you don't think he's getting a </v>
<v Speaker 8>little bit of bite.</v>

2248
01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 8>You get bites and your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't even,</v>

2249
01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:19.003
<v Speaker 8>they're not even trying to bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're trying to breathe and you're </v>

2250
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:22.240
<v Speaker 8>crushing your bar.</v>

2251
01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Rarely do you see his arm come away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bleeding or something.</v>

2252
01:38:24.771 --> 01:38:25.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying there's the rare occasion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like though but but a far less rare </v>

2253
01:38:29.031 --> 01:38:29.864
<v Speaker 2>would be if there was no gloves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're punching a guy and a </v>

2254
01:38:31.581 --> 01:38:33.740
<v Speaker 2>modification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to catch them teeth.</v>

2255
01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.840
<v Speaker 2>You going to be a lot more cutting of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands too.</v>

2256
01:38:35.841 --> 01:38:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm just playing devil's advocate.</v>

2257
01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:39.360
<v Speaker 8>Devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Here is a solution.</v>

2258
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 8>Double Mouth Guard in enforce the rule </v>
<v Speaker 8>of a devil mouth guard,</v>

2259
01:38:42.241 --> 01:38:43.074
<v Speaker 8>which means that there's a space and a </v>
<v Speaker 8>metal version too like an old school </v>

2260
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:46.770
<v Speaker 8>like no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2261
01:38:46.771 --> 01:38:47.131
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2262
01:38:47.131 --> 01:38:47.964
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It goes lower teeth and the upper teeth </v>

2263
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.213
<v Speaker 8>and then you have a space in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bernard Hopkins always used to fight </v>

2264
01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:52.884
<v Speaker 8>with one of those and it covers your </v>
<v Speaker 8>lower teeth and your upper teeth and </v>

2265
01:38:55.321 --> 01:38:56.154
<v Speaker 8>there's a space in the middle and you </v>
<v Speaker 8>breathe through that and you breathe </v>

2266
01:38:57.901 --> 01:39:01.710
<v Speaker 8>through your nose and you get used to </v>
<v Speaker 8>doing that and the lower mouth guard.</v>

2267
01:39:01.711 --> 01:39:05.100
<v Speaker 8>The problem with having only an upper </v>
<v Speaker 8>mouth guard is most people do that,</v>

2268
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:08.010
<v Speaker 8>but only in upper mouth guard will work </v>
<v Speaker 8>for the most part.</v>

2269
01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:09.870
<v Speaker 8>But there is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you're bare knuckle,</v>

2270
01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.843
<v Speaker 8>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a real argument for using an </v>

2271
01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:14.690
<v Speaker 8>upper and a lower because you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 8>with different situations.</v>

2272
01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.481
<v Speaker 8>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2273
01:39:15.481 --> 01:39:17.940
<v Speaker 8>even then you would just have it fitted </v>
<v Speaker 8>to your face.</v>

2274
01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:19.890
<v Speaker 8>Just devil advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I understand what you're saying.</v>

2275
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:20.820
<v Speaker 8>What I'm saying is</v>

2276
01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:22.280
<v Speaker 2>shut up either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but know our dough.</v>

2277
01:39:22.281 --> 01:39:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite fighter of all time.</v>

2278
01:39:24.561 --> 01:39:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

01:39:25.631 --> 01:39:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2281
01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:30.230
<v Speaker 2>He's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why is my fear,</v>

2282
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:32.450
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw his last fight.</v>

2283
01:39:32.451 --> 01:39:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I was there in the forum and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bummer to me.</v>

2284
01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.013
<v Speaker 2>You're better than that and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking career will be forever </v>

2285
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:42.350
<v Speaker 2>because here's what I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernard Hopkins was the fucking man.</v>

2286
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:43.730
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

2287
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:44.623
<v Speaker 2>I be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been surrounded by Latin </v>

<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

2295
01:39:58.551 --> 01:39:59.384

<v Speaker 2>So anytime a fight like that would come </v>

01:40:02.211 --> 01:40:03.230
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Trinidad,</v>

2299
01:40:08.690 --> 01:40:09.523
<v Speaker 2>we were all watching at [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>house when his mother fucker took the </v>

<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in Puerto Rico Talking Shit on </v>

2301
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:18.223
<v Speaker 2>Felix Trinidad at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking all mighty fucking son of </v>

2302
01:40:23.361 --> 01:40:26.540
<v Speaker 2>all Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Puerto Rican flag,</v>

2303
01:40:26.541 --> 01:40:27.374
<v Speaker 2>which if you know about Puerto Rican </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and I know plenty of Puerto Rican </v>

<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put that flag on anything.</v>

2305

<v Speaker 2>Is it a flag?</v>

2308
01:40:34.221 --> 01:40:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Is Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get crazy.</v>

2309
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:39.620
<v Speaker 2>He took this flag in Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude on the ground is stepped on it.</v>

2310
01:40:39.710 --> 01:40:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why go back you?</v>

2311
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.863
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's on youtube where he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps on the Puerto Rican for the end </v>

2312
01:40:44.811 --> 01:40:48.050
<v Speaker 2>point in a room and I literally told my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends if he gets off that island,</v>

2313
01:40:48.051 --> 01:40:50.150
<v Speaker 2>nobody on our speaking his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2314
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.333
<v Speaker 2>cause they should be trying to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill him right now if know anything </v>

2315
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

2316
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.813
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rican people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what me and when he got the fight came </v>

2317
01:40:57.461 --> 01:41:00.070
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet everybody and be,</v>

2318
01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.200
<v Speaker 1>be real used to throw like barbecues </v>
<v Speaker 1>every fight like it would be,</v>

2319
01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.300
<v Speaker 1>that's where we be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

2320
01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:05.490
<v Speaker 1>that was our routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>

2321
01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 1>And then it was always anytime it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a black guy versus like a Spanish,</v>

2322
01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Spanish guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be any kind of Spanish guy.</v>

2323
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I would always like bet against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and more times than not I won.</v>

2324
01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:15.813
<v Speaker 1>But like Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stomps on the God damn flag and got </v>

2325
01:41:18.671 --> 01:41:20.260
<v Speaker 1>out of that island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We threw it,</v>

2326
01:41:20.261 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 1>he took it away from fields to on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and then he beat his ass.</v>

2327
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he killed him and the ninth </v>
<v Speaker 1>round and my car.</v>

2328
01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:26.914
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he killed him right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he definitely landed a sack of </v>

2329
01:41:30.231 --> 01:41:31.900
<v Speaker 1>working with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owed him right there.</v>

2330
01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like if you didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>stabbed before you got off the island of</v>

2331
01:41:35.501 --> 01:41:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a win.</v>

2332
01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:38.830
<v Speaker 1>He put a lot of pressure on himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2333
01:41:38.831 --> 01:41:39.664
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I always knew I was like the </v>

2334
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:42.220
<v Speaker 1>is my man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

2335
01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but just for the ball factor of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big ball factor.</v>

2336
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you would have pulled that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

2337
01:41:47.951 --> 01:41:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I would said you were fucking crazy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico.</v>

2338
01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.473
<v Speaker 1>Jesus man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took huge nuts that we took the </v>

2339
01:41:55.181 --> 01:41:56.014
<v Speaker 1>dude who was in jail for most of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and was living off commissary </v>

2340
01:41:58.571 --> 01:41:59.404
<v Speaker 1>donations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a brilliant performance too in </v>

2341
01:42:00.941 --> 01:42:05.530
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kicked ass Yo Bernard until the last,</v>

2342
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:07.960
<v Speaker 1>he'd beat the shit out of fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

2343
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:10.120
<v Speaker 1>six fights of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd beat the shit out of everybody.</v>

2344
01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to realize he's like 51 which is</v>

2345
01:42:12.671 --> 01:42:17.470
<v Speaker 1>incredible when this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he was 34 35 well,</v>

2346
01:42:17.471 --> 01:42:20.920
<v Speaker 1>he was old when I did 36 spent so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in jail.</v>

2347
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a beautiful counter punch,</v>

2348
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 1>but you know what this show is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him.</v>

2349
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Is he live like a monk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It was always in training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never fucking partied.</v>

2351
01:42:28.661 --> 01:42:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Never any smoke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2352
01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Just us foods is the big thing he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

2353
01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:36.280
<v Speaker 1>He eats very healthy and clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the early advocates of the</v>

2354
01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:40.520
<v Speaker 1>raw diet kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he also was a brilliant boxer and</v>

2355
01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I just loved executional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came out with the mask duty.</v>

2356
01:42:43.770 --> 01:42:48.770
<v Speaker 1>You got to realize this guy got passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got past 12 rounds and Sergey Kovalev</v>

2357
01:42:48.941 --> 01:42:49.774
<v Speaker 1>without getting knocked out and he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocked and dinged several times in that </v>

2358
01:42:53.111 --> 01:42:55.900
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought cove 11 is prime cove left,</v>

2359
01:42:55.901 --> 01:42:59.740
<v Speaker 1>who my opinion is top three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound for pound in the world.</v>

2360
01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's arguable at least number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now or a fight.</v>

2361
01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted that first four could have,</v>

2362
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he'd get [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

2363
01:43:08.801 --> 01:43:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was my humble opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

2364
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I would have to like go over it with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real legitimate boxing judge and like,</v>

2365
01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.633
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know what I think about boxing </v>

2366
01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.473
<v Speaker 1>towns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crawford fight where he put it on that </v>

2367
01:43:20.621 --> 01:43:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Cuban or whatever he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the fucking crowd he's,</v>

2368
01:43:24.151 --> 01:43:27.480
<v Speaker 1>and he's in the argument for number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound for pound in the world is,</v>

2369
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tito got beat,</v>

2370
01:43:29.711 --> 01:43:31.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Controversial fight,</v>

2371
01:43:31.541 --> 01:43:33.180
<v Speaker 1>but closer yet to handle those </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>

2372
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:34.900
<v Speaker 1>see the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I heard it was controversial.</v>

2373
01:43:34.901 --> 01:43:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Some people disagreed with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my ma,</v>

2374
01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 1>what I feel is that like terrence </v>
<v Speaker 1>Crawford and Loma Chanko or the guys who</v>

2375
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:44.140
<v Speaker 1>put it on people to the point where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just run away from it.</v>

2376
01:43:44.141 --> 01:43:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Just set the fight and run away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they just set the big fight.</v>

2377
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:50.780
<v Speaker 1>The fucking triple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:51.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2379
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>lost all their money and everything,</v>

<v Speaker 2>When I heard about this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was texting him like,</v>

2495
01:48:24.241 --> 01:48:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you're going to win this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2496
01:48:25.351 --> 01:48:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I know you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Yo,</v>

01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love you.</v>

2499
01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Congrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2500
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.903
<v Speaker 2>And did everything he had to do like did</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real shit to get in shape that </v>

2501
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:38.723
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's inspired that that Kinda guy is </v>

2502
01:48:39.781 --> 01:48:40.760
<v Speaker 2>inspiring to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

2503
01:48:40.761 --> 01:48:42.990
<v Speaker 2>because what he does is he chooses </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and he says,</v>

2504
01:48:42.991 --> 01:48:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna commit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying,</v>

2505
01:48:46.021 --> 01:48:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I think earlier I'm here because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow road signs and I just,</v>

2506
01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:50.243
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I consider myself adept at reading the </v>

2507
01:48:53.251 --> 01:48:56.700
<v Speaker 2>signs of life and where I'm po when </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the forks in the road.</v>

2508
01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I happen to be good at making the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

2509
01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:00.653
<v Speaker 2>There's certain guys that don't give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck about the fork in the road and </v>

2510
01:49:02.761 --> 01:49:04.860
<v Speaker 2>determine their own fucking path and </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide.</v>

2511
01:49:04.861 --> 01:49:07.470
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of one of those dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I admire that.</v>

2512
01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admire what I do.</v>

2513
01:49:09.121 --> 01:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize there's a skill and a talent</v>

2514
01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:12.503
<v Speaker 2>and a blessing and what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about being of </v>

2515
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:15.594
<v Speaker 2>decide something and fucking make it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though maybe it's not supposed to </v>

2516
01:49:20.581 --> 01:49:25.581
<v Speaker 2>be so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is my next chasing life.</v>

2517
01:49:28.650 --> 01:49:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

2518
01:49:29.941 --> 01:49:31.830
<v Speaker 2>even if I don't achieve it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand it,</v>

2519
01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:33.960
<v Speaker 2>how it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could I be that guy?</v>

2520
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 2>How could it at 20 maybe I have under </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood a little bit differently,</v>

2521
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:41.970
<v Speaker 2>so maybe by the time I'm 70 God willing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an illusion.</v>

2522
01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.013
<v Speaker 2>This is the illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The illusion is that looking at the </v>

2523
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.460
<v Speaker 2>ultimate results</v>

2524
01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:52.270
<v Speaker 8>from your perspective and you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 8>how,</v>

2525
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:56.080
<v Speaker 8>how do I tune myself in?</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do I,</v>

2526
01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:56.973
<v Speaker 8>how do I get totally connected with what</v>
<v Speaker 8>I really want to do and not be </v>

2527
01:50:01.091 --> 01:50:04.420
<v Speaker 8>influenced by the opinions and the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 8>of others?</v>

2528
01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:08.050
<v Speaker 8>How do I find my true sweet spot,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2529
01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:13.180
<v Speaker 8>The problem is we all look at other </v>
<v Speaker 8>people's destination.</v>

2530
01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 8>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like that crazy quote,</v>

2531
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:20.200
<v Speaker 8>that comparison is the enemy of joy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's really kind of the same thing.</v>

2532
01:50:20.230 --> 01:50:21.420
<v Speaker 8>The thief of joy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2533
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:22.263
<v Speaker 8>the thief of joy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that the whole key I think to anything </v>

2534
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:27.550
<v Speaker 8>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether you're a guy who makes furniture</v>

2535
01:50:27.551 --> 01:50:32.551
<v Speaker 8>or a woman who paints or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck you do where you were a rapper or a</v>

2536
01:50:33.161 --> 01:50:33.994
<v Speaker 8>blues singer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a standup comedian or an author or </v>

2537
01:50:36.971 --> 01:50:39.400
<v Speaker 8>whatever the fuck you do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The thing,</v>

2538
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:42.430
<v Speaker 8>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and this is a cliche expression,</v>

2539
01:50:42.431 --> 01:50:43.264
<v Speaker 8>but it's re there's a reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 8>keep expressing and over and over again </v>

2540
01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.170
<v Speaker 8>get out of your own way.</v>

2541
01:50:47.710 --> 01:50:48.543
<v Speaker 8>Half of the reason why you're not tuning</v>
<v Speaker 8>in perfectly good to whatever fucking </v>

2542
01:50:52.691 --> 01:50:53.524
<v Speaker 8>vibration is available to you in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>universe as you get in your own fucking </v>

2543
01:50:56.681 --> 01:50:57.514
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you get in your own way with insecurity </v>

2544
01:50:59.711 --> 01:51:04.711
<v Speaker 8>and with ego and with expectation and </v>
<v Speaker 8>with pressure and with all the different</v>

2545
01:51:06.071 --> 01:51:10.650
<v Speaker 8>judgments you cast on different forms of</v>
<v Speaker 8>art that you may or may not like,</v>

2546
01:51:10.651 --> 01:51:14.770
<v Speaker 8>like you're wasting time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're wasting energy.</v>

2547
01:51:14.771 --> 01:51:17.500
<v Speaker 8>It's clogging up your gears.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You only have a certain amount.</v>

2548
01:51:17.650 --> 01:51:18.483
<v Speaker 8>You got to manage your attention the way</v>
<v Speaker 8>you would manage oxygen if you are in a </v>

2549
01:51:21.491 --> 01:51:23.410
<v Speaker 8>space ship.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You got to say,</v>

2550
01:51:23.411 --> 01:51:25.990
<v Speaker 8>I can't give away this stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 8>bullshit.</v>

2551
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.990
<v Speaker 8>I can't be sitting around wondering if </v>
<v Speaker 8>you know w,</v>

2552
01:51:28.991 --> 01:51:30.700
<v Speaker 8>W,</v>
<v Speaker 8>w whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2553
01:51:30.701 --> 01:51:31.534
<v Speaker 8>If it's not relevant to your life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you will be wasting way too much time </v>

2554
01:51:34.151 --> 01:51:34.760
<v Speaker 8>thinking about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want that.</v>

2664
01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:50.790

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2665
01:56:50.791 --> 01:56:51.624
<v Speaker 2>what he's given you is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>very specific situations given you </v>

01:56:55.891 --> 01:56:57.970
<v Speaker 2>opportunities that Rick Carson was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got down,</v>

01:56:57.990 --> 01:57:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when it's this other thing,</v>

2668
01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:02.513
<v Speaker 2>this other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a whole different level of like </v>

2669
01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:05.693

2670
01:57:07.081 --> 01:57:08.970
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but how do I find that in that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's tough.</v>

2672
01:57:12.710 --> 01:57:13.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sin.</v>

2673
01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:14.363
<v Speaker 2>What he's proposing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principles that he has the answer </v>

<v Speaker 2>he's saying that you can apply them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2676

<v Speaker 2>situation you're in and improve your </v>

01:59:19.241 --> 01:59:21.490
<v Speaker 4>personal level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the level of it with it.</v>

2723
01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:26.380
<v Speaker 4>The level of that that are that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>inspirational message is great,</v>

2724
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:30.180
<v Speaker 4>but I'm struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course you are with this part of it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2726
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:35.740

<v Speaker 4>guy who tapped me out or,</v>

2727
01:59:35.890 --> 01:59:40.060
<v Speaker 4>or life just kicked my ass and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get the job I or the opportunity,</v>

<v Speaker 4>as an excuse,</v>

2730
01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:53.820
<v Speaker 4>not using this but the truthful </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional fucking agony of like seeing a</v>

01:59:53.861 --> 01:59:58.690
<v Speaker 4>child tow you like and not just tell you</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's tweeted to me.</v>

2737
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:12.880
<v Speaker 4>If you're the dude who fucking is local </v>

<v Speaker 4>replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my workout.</v>

2740
02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you why working out gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird for me.</v>

2741
02:00:24.730 --> 02:00:26.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll do good.</v>

2742
02:00:26.711 --> 02:00:28.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll drop 15 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bang,</v>

2743
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.620
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

2744
02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:33.220
<v Speaker 4>And then I'll start to push myself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

2745
02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.760
<v Speaker 4>I'll get distrustful of my own heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a pain or a tinge that really might</v>

2746
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:43.270
<v Speaker 4>not be anything will come along and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking scare the shit out of me because</v>

2747
02:00:43.271 --> 02:00:44.104
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never was afraid of anything in my </v>

2748
02:00:45.881 --> 02:00:50.140
<v Speaker 4>life until I had children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the only thing I'm afraid of on this</v>

2749
02:00:50.141 --> 02:00:53.080
<v Speaker 4>planet is not being here for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

2750
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.210
<v Speaker 4>my life or death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not care.</v>

2751
02:00:55.211 --> 02:00:57.070
<v Speaker 4>I've died twice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally.</v>

2752
02:00:57.610 --> 02:01:00.220
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about that.</v>

2753
02:01:00.490 --> 02:01:03.460
<v Speaker 4>But now there's this fear of like these </v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

2754
02:01:03.461 --> 02:01:04.900
<v Speaker 4>these girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even boys.</v>

2755
02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I honestly even feel I would feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>differently if I had two boys.</v>

2756
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:09.783
<v Speaker 4>Like there'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can instill the manly shit into him </v>

2757
02:01:12.011 --> 02:01:12.844
<v Speaker 4>while I'm here.</v>

2758
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:15.630
<v Speaker 4>But my girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm of the,</v>

2759
02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:18.160
<v Speaker 4>my biggest fear in life is not being </v>
<v Speaker 4>here for them.</v>

2760
02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 4>And I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm healthy.</v>

2761
02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:22.090
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except for about 25 pounds of weight.</v>

2762
02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my blood works,</v>

2763
02:01:23.741 --> 02:01:26.070
<v Speaker 4>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My doctors are all very happy with me,</v>

2764
02:01:26.230 --> 02:01:27.063
<v Speaker 4>the only complaint they ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the only complaint I ever have is I </v>

2765
02:01:29.351 --> 02:01:30.980
<v Speaker 4>have some back pains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I'm asleep.</v>

2766
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me stop [inaudible] go ahead.</v>

2767
02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:33.933
<v Speaker 4>Let me stop you with all of his talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have a lot of reasons why </v>

2768
02:01:36.641 --> 02:01:39.850
<v Speaker 4>things aren't working physically the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would like them to.</v>

2769
02:01:40.290 --> 02:01:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely,</v>

2770
02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:43.553
<v Speaker 2>I would like help.</v>

2771
02:01:43.650 --> 02:01:44.483
<v Speaker 8>I understand you are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there's too much extra energy spent </v>

2772
02:01:48.271 --> 02:01:49.104
<v Speaker 8>on things that aren't helping you like </v>
<v Speaker 8>you and I know you have these time </v>

2773
02:01:52.951 --> 02:01:53.784
<v Speaker 8>constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but to focus on them is </v>

2774
02:01:55.051 --> 02:01:55.884
<v Speaker 8>counterproductive because you have the </v>
<v Speaker 8>time constraints that time constraints </v>

2775
02:01:58.441 --> 02:02:02.310
<v Speaker 8>rob you of your time and then the </v>
<v Speaker 8>focusing on the time constraints and the</v>

2776
02:02:02.311 --> 02:02:05.730
<v Speaker 8>agony of those time constraints and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking frustration of having those time</v>

2777
02:02:05.731 --> 02:02:08.670
<v Speaker 8>constraints robs you have more time and </v>
<v Speaker 8>more energy.</v>

2778
02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:11.100
<v Speaker 8>You just got to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You've got to be zen about it.</v>

2779
02:02:11.370 --> 02:02:14.430
<v Speaker 8>I had a friend and he's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's a comedian from Boston,</v>

2780
02:02:14.431 --> 02:02:16.410
<v Speaker 8>his name is Tony Vee,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and he said something to me once.</v>

2781
02:02:16.411 --> 02:02:17.244
<v Speaker 8>It's very important and it applied to </v>
<v Speaker 8>the rest of my life and it was a very </v>

2782
02:02:19.651 --> 02:02:20.484
<v Speaker 8>simple statement.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was driving from Boston to New York </v>

2783
02:02:22.921 --> 02:02:23.754
<v Speaker 8>several times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 8>several times for some job he got and </v>

2784
02:02:27.301 --> 02:02:28.470
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how do you do that?</v>

2785
02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.573
<v Speaker 8>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know what I found when I get in the </v>

2786
02:02:30.961 --> 02:02:32.820
<v Speaker 8>car I just go Zan.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I say,</v>

2787
02:02:32.821 --> 02:02:34.530
<v Speaker 8>this is what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

2788
02:02:34.531 --> 02:02:38.100
<v Speaker 8>I don't concern myself with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 8>that will wash the dishes.</v>

2789
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:42.060
<v Speaker 8>I don't concern myself with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 8>that I can't believe I have to do this.</v>

2790
02:02:42.090 --> 02:02:43.620
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>woe is me.</v>

2791
02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:44.730
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just do it.</v>

2792
02:02:44.970 --> 02:02:45.803
<v Speaker 8>And then I thought about that that day </v>
<v Speaker 8>and then I applied that to my life </v>

2793
02:02:50.130 --> 02:02:53.510
<v Speaker 8>because that's the best advice anybody </v>
<v Speaker 8>could ever get it from you.</v>

2794
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:55.440
<v Speaker 8>Anybody who's doing anything they don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>like to do.</v>

2795
02:02:55.530 --> 02:02:56.363
<v Speaker 8>Of course you don't like to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but to concentrate on the fact that you </v>

2796
02:02:59.671 --> 02:03:04.671
<v Speaker 8>don't like to do it compounds the not </v>
<v Speaker 8>like to do it aspect of it.</v>

2797
02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:06.450
<v Speaker 8>It makes it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2798
02:03:06.451 --> 02:03:06.880
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2799
02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Actually it was describing is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the stuff I'm reading right now,</v>

2800
02:03:09.881 --> 02:03:12.470
<v Speaker 2>which is like the art of mindfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is again,</v>

2801
02:03:12.471 --> 02:03:14.440
<v Speaker 2>when I keep saying wash the dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wash the dishes,</v>

2802
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:15.303
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like saying exactly what I </v>

2803
02:03:16.151 --> 02:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wash your dishes to wash your dishes,</v>

2804
02:03:18.521 --> 02:03:19.354
<v Speaker 2>don't wash your dishes to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next thing because then you're not </v>

2805
02:03:20.831 --> 02:03:22.450
<v Speaker 2>living life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not breathing in.</v>

2806
02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.293
<v Speaker 2>I live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your moment.</v>

2807
02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:24.213
<v Speaker 2>So I'm working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time I'm still saying </v>

2808
02:03:26.621 --> 02:03:27.454
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

2809
02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>of years,</v>

2811
02:03:31.391 --> 02:03:32.224
<v Speaker 2>especially through like the little </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media that I managed to be </v>

2812
02:03:34.571 --> 02:03:35.404
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2813
02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:38.470
<v Speaker 2>that people want to know the real deal.</v>

2814
02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Shit ain't fucking perfect over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things about me.</v>

2815
02:03:44.261 --> 02:03:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2816
02:03:46.330 --> 02:03:47.163

<v Speaker 2>Just because I make good money and I </v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2949
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.920

<v Speaker 2>Eddie doesn't live out that way so,</v>

2950
02:12:36.921 --> 02:12:38.000

<v Speaker 2>He's fucking awesome.</v>

2953
02:12:41.691 --> 02:12:42.524
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't followed up as much as he </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2955
02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:49.070

<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

2956

<v Speaker 2>on that and get that going to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what you said about the worry though?</v>

2974
02:13:37.321 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 4>I just get the worry part of the worry </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet is the hard part,</v>

2975
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

<v Speaker 4>of brought up earlier.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How do you get around worrying about </v>

2978
02:13:48.271 --> 02:13:49.104
<v Speaker 4>your own kid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to read some books </v>

2979
02:13:50.551 --> 02:13:52.290
<v Speaker 4>on strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to do that.</v>

2980
02:13:53.070 --> 02:13:55.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm also here.</v>

2981
02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:57.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling myself.</v>

2982
02:13:57.751 --> 02:13:58.830

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2983
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:02.910

<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2994
02:14:24.421 --> 02:14:25.920
<v Speaker 4>ping pong changed my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2995
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:27.631
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2996
02:14:27.631 --> 02:14:28.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2997
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:30.960
<v Speaker 4>you've been given a very difficult test </v>
<v Speaker 4>by whatever,</v>

2998
02:14:30.961 --> 02:14:34.070
<v Speaker 4>by life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the truth of the matter is,</v>

2999
02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:37.500
<v Speaker 4>up until that man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an easy ride he had.</v>

3000
02:14:37.501 --> 02:14:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so don't feel bad for me.</v>

3001
02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:41.070
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if he got a suggestion,</v>

3002
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:42.930
<v Speaker 4>please shoot it my way because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3003
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:46.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm at this point in life like I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>understood again,</v>

3004
02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:47.453
<v Speaker 4>the communal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think beyond the music lesson of it </v>

3005
02:14:50.611 --> 02:14:51.980
<v Speaker 4>being communal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3006
02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:55.050
<v Speaker 4>is as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are communal people.</v>

3007
02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:56.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even hails back to the beginning of </v>

3008
02:14:58.141 --> 02:14:59.730
<v Speaker 4>what we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blues and the reds,</v>

3009
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:00.833
<v Speaker 4>they are trying to separate us because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're communal and if we all actually </v>

3010
02:15:04.081 --> 02:15:07.800
<v Speaker 4>sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the most fucking worst opinion over</v>

3011
02:15:07.801 --> 02:15:09.000
<v Speaker 4>there in the worst pain over there.</v>

3012
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:09.833
<v Speaker 4>If we were only in the room together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could find somewhere over here where </v>

3013
02:15:13.261 --> 02:15:17.040
<v Speaker 4>we could both at least be the least bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry at each other.</v>

3014
02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:19.740
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think we should eliminate </v>
<v Speaker 4>political parties.</v>

3015
02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.753
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think what we should have is just a </v>

3016
02:15:21.511 --> 02:15:23.670
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people with money out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>

3017
02:15:24.410 --> 02:15:27.260
<v Speaker 4>money pull money here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's hear she.</v>

3018
02:15:27.261 --> 02:15:28.094
<v Speaker 4>Interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's an interesting idea about </v>

3019
02:15:29.641 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 4>England,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3020
02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:32.003
<v Speaker 4>England announces their elections.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are three months from the </v>

3021
02:15:35.551 --> 02:15:40.551
<v Speaker 4>announcement of the elections till the </v>
<v Speaker 4>election for you to legally campaign.</v>

3022
02:15:41.770 --> 02:15:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Why is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better because of what?</v>

3023
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hailing back to what we said earlier,</v>

3024
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:47.933
<v Speaker 4>the day after the presidents elected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like they're talking about </v>

3025
02:15:50.311 --> 02:15:52.800
<v Speaker 4>who's going to run in 2020 already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3026
02:15:52.850 --> 02:15:53.500
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3027
02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:54.241
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3028
02:15:54.241 --> 02:15:58.050
<v Speaker 4>we might be in a particularly weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstance now in America again,</v>

3029
02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't even delve into that.</v>

3030
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:05.340
<v Speaker 4>What I want to say is the day after our </v>
<v Speaker 4>president is elected,</v>

3031
02:16:05.341 --> 02:16:06.174
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't be talking about who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be the next fucking president </v>

3032
02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:12.540
<v Speaker 4>until that guy fucks up enough to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to be the next president.</v>

3033
02:16:12.750 --> 02:16:14.820
<v Speaker 4>There should be this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

3034
02:16:14.821 --> 02:16:19.350
<v Speaker 4>we are in some extremely absurd and </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird circumstances at the moment,</v>

3035
02:16:19.890 --> 02:16:21.890
<v Speaker 4>but under normal circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

3036
02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:26.920
<v Speaker 4>this is my argument would just be we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans.</v>

3037
02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:31.210
<v Speaker 4>This guy got elected through the process</v>
<v Speaker 4>we agreed to and even now I'll say that,</v>

3038
02:16:31.211 --> 02:16:32.044
<v Speaker 4>but dude's already fucking again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't want to visit that </v>

3039
02:16:33.881 --> 02:16:36.100
<v Speaker 4>because that's a whole fucking four </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours on his own.</v>

3040
02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:37.323
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3041
02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't and I just don't want to even go</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

3042
02:16:40.271 --> 02:16:45.271
<v Speaker 4>but give America a fucking chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3043
02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Am I making any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You make four whiskeys now brother,</v>

3044
02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:50.613
<v Speaker 4>I make Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what your idea is of America </v>

3045
02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:54.850
<v Speaker 4>versus what everybody else's idea.</v>

3046
02:16:54.850 --> 02:16:56.860
<v Speaker 4>We need to come some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>clarification.</v>

3047
02:16:56.861 --> 02:16:59.320
<v Speaker 4>My ideas this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't mean to interrupt you,</v>

3048
02:16:59.321 --> 02:17:00.154
<v Speaker 4>my idea is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you could be the furthest away </v>

3049
02:17:01.631 --> 02:17:02.464
<v Speaker 4>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could be and I could be way over </v>

3050
02:17:04.871 --> 02:17:05.704
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if we were in the same room </v>

3051
02:17:06.371 --> 02:17:07.204
<v Speaker 4>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we in here we'd find a place that we'd </v>

3052
02:17:09.641 --> 02:17:10.474
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3053
02:17:11.350 --> 02:17:13.830
<v Speaker 4>I can live with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>

3054
02:17:13.831 --> 02:17:14.664
<v Speaker 4>We need to figure out what these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>are that we're talking about living </v>

3055
02:17:16.331 --> 02:17:18.160
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I don't think there's very many of</v>

3056
02:17:18.161 --> 02:17:18.994
<v Speaker 4>them that were very agreeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disagreeing rather on between the left </v>

3057
02:17:21.881 --> 02:17:22.714
<v Speaker 4>and the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of bullshit and I </v>

3058
02:17:24.011 --> 02:17:25.600
<v Speaker 4>think it's a lot of what we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about earlier,</v>

3059
02:17:25.601 --> 02:17:28.690
<v Speaker 4>this tribal boohoo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those in the sand,</v>

3060
02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:31.510
<v Speaker 4>the people who elected this personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>president right now.</v>

3061
02:17:31.570 --> 02:17:32.450
<v Speaker 4>Personal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3062
02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 4>Personal president is a personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

3063
02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:37.000
<v Speaker 4>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very few amount of people.</v>

3064
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:39.460
<v Speaker 4>There's really truly very few people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are his base.</v>

3065
02:17:39.461 --> 02:17:43.000
<v Speaker 4>35% let's keep it real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's keep it real.</v>

3066
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:44.410
<v Speaker 4>Let's keep it fucking room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3067
02:17:44.411 --> 02:17:47.500
<v Speaker 4>cause a lot of bailed on him because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they realize what they voted for was not</v>

3068
02:17:47.501 --> 02:17:48.334
<v Speaker 4>what they fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They voted in protest almost a lot of </v>

3069
02:17:51.101 --> 02:17:52.420
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's his approval rate?</v>

3070
02:17:52.421 --> 02:17:53.241
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3071
02:17:53.241 --> 02:17:56.560
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking the lowest in history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it below and again,</v>

3072
02:17:56.561 --> 02:17:57.394
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is like a lot of people </v>

3073
02:17:59.141 --> 02:17:59.974
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck the whole system and for a second </v>

3074
02:18:01.301 --> 02:18:02.134
<v Speaker 4>they bought into the fact that this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually might think the same when this </v>

3075
02:18:04.781 --> 02:18:07.330
<v Speaker 4>guy has spent his entire life fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the working class.</v>

3076
02:18:07.331 --> 02:18:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

3077
02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:09.393
<v Speaker 4>as much as I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have voted the other direction </v>

3078
02:18:11.171 --> 02:18:13.000
<v Speaker 4>for whatever you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I again,</v>

3079
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:14.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck about Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton.</v>

3080
02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:15.393
<v Speaker 4>I'm not telling you the fucking world </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have been saved by Hillary </v>

3081
02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that shit.</v>

3082
02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:19.023
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was an entitled motherfucking </v>

3083
02:18:19.871 --> 02:18:20.704
<v Speaker 4>person who was only given that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>position because for some reason the </v>

3084
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:26.420
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3085
02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:27.253
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the elite of that party thought it was </v>

3086
02:18:28.931 --> 02:18:30.820
<v Speaker 4>her turn or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3087
02:18:30.970 --> 02:18:31.803
<v Speaker 4>That was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just as much their fault for </v>

3088
02:18:33.641 --> 02:18:36.190
<v Speaker 4>losing as fucking really shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about politics.</v>

3089
02:18:36.191 --> 02:18:38.020
<v Speaker 4>We're way too stupid already there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drunk.</v>

3090
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:39.663
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is this is that dude is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to give me a tax break if he's </v>

3091
02:18:44.201 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 4>successful and the guys that actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>voted for him,</v>

3092
02:18:47.651 --> 02:18:48.484
<v Speaker 4>the union guys and the fucking working </v>
<v Speaker 4>class guys are going to get fucked over </v>

3093
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:53.163
<v Speaker 4>and at the end of the day they'll be </v>
<v Speaker 4>regretting it as much as like some of </v>

3094
02:18:56.921 --> 02:19:00.220
<v Speaker 4>the things he spitting at you and saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you or appealing,</v>

3095
02:19:00.490 --> 02:19:02.560
<v Speaker 4>he's not that fucking die.</v>

3096
02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:05.170
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck Hillary Clinton.</v>

3097
02:19:05.171 --> 02:19:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Fuck Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can't be mad at me.</v>

3098
02:19:08.530 --> 02:19:09.363
<v Speaker 4>Fuck all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie Sanders was probably our most </v>

3099
02:19:12.341 --> 02:19:13.900
<v Speaker 4>logical choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I said,</v>

3100
02:19:13.901 --> 02:19:18.370
<v Speaker 4>fuck him because I read his tax pan plan</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he would have fucking raped me.</v>

3101
02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:21.490
<v Speaker 4>So it's like there's gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3102
02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:24.520
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be a whole new system </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the money is.</v>

3103
02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 4>There has to be a flat tax kind of thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>where every fucking person,</v>

3104
02:19:29.571 --> 02:19:32.480
<v Speaker 4>firm corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is too many corporations are</v>

3105
02:19:32.481 --> 02:19:35.090
<v Speaker 4>considered legally talking way too much </v>
<v Speaker 4>about politics.</v>

3106
02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:37.700
<v Speaker 4>You're freaking me the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this anymore.</v>

3107
02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:39.430
<v Speaker 4>Jma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3108
02:19:39.730 --> 02:19:41.090
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you're saying.</v>

3109
02:19:41.390 --> 02:19:45.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying this is as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody is good politics.</v>

3110
02:19:45.381 --> 02:19:48.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like explore the fact that they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>separating and dividing.</v>

3111
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:49.453
<v Speaker 4>You could be a white supremacy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be a black fucking </v>

3112
02:19:50.811 --> 02:19:52.760
<v Speaker 4>nationalists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to be there.</v>

3113
02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:56.210
<v Speaker 4>Fucking playing on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're playing on that.</v>

3114
02:19:56.211 --> 02:19:58.670
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is designed facebook,</v>

3115
02:19:58.671 --> 02:20:02.060
<v Speaker 4>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These algorithms are fucking designed to</v>

3116
02:20:02.061 --> 02:20:04.400
<v Speaker 4>design.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to see on your page?</v>

3117
02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:05.661
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3118
02:20:05.661 --> 02:20:06.494
<v Speaker 4>remember that Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to see this conversation right </v>

3119
02:20:09.111 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 4>now if everybody will just remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>there or no,</v>

3120
02:20:12.381 --> 02:20:15.590
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's been fact of the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>they set up programs.</v>

3121
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.903
<v Speaker 4>They set up a program to say what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be most like the guy who </v>

3122
02:20:19.131 --> 02:20:22.370
<v Speaker 4>invented facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark Zuckerberg get his team,</v>

3123
02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:24.350
<v Speaker 4>whoever's his team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once his,</v>

3124
02:20:24.410 --> 02:20:26.360
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who use his product to be the</v>

3125
02:20:26.361 --> 02:20:28.610
<v Speaker 4>happiest they can be with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

3126
02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:29.953
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the direction we're going with </v>

3127
02:20:31.041 --> 02:20:31.850
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3128
02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:34.580
<v Speaker 4>so if they look at the things you click </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

3129
02:20:34.850 --> 02:20:35.683
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and start developing a pattern in an </v>

3130
02:20:36.831 --> 02:20:37.664
<v Speaker 4>algorithm and you click on these </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely right things or you click on </v>

3131
02:20:40.371 --> 02:20:42.740
<v Speaker 4>these extremely left things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sooner or later,</v>

3132
02:20:42.741 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 4>that's all it's going to be on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>page.</v>

3133
02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Instagram even changed their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>algorithm too.</v>

3134
02:20:46.731 --> 02:20:48.880
<v Speaker 4>It's not like what was just last posted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3135
02:20:48.930 --> 02:20:53.120
<v Speaker 4>It's what was last posted that's most </v>
<v Speaker 4>popular and what's appealing to you that</v>

3136
02:20:53.121 --> 02:20:55.220
<v Speaker 4>you like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3137
02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:58.340
<v Speaker 4>That's where I'm going with this is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are,</v>

3138
02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:01.160
<v Speaker 4>they don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're being catered to your being fed.</v>

3139
02:21:01.310 --> 02:21:03.620
<v Speaker 4>You're being fed ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to be fed.</v>

3140
02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:06.730
<v Speaker 4>You're not being challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've always said this about pr,</v>

3141
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:08.240
<v Speaker 4>even personal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my art,</v>

3142
02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:09.163
<v Speaker 4>if there's not somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to being in a room by </v>

3143
02:21:10.821 --> 02:21:13.130
<v Speaker 4>yourself and why I got stagnated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're making a record.</v>

3144
02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:17.690
<v Speaker 4>If there's not somebody in that room </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow to challenge your idea,</v>

3145
02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:23.860
<v Speaker 4>your idea isn't the best it can be ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you're saying,</v>

3146
02:21:24.531 --> 02:21:25.364
<v Speaker 4>but I think that an alternative point of</v>
<v Speaker 4>view would not be that you're getting </v>

3147
02:21:28.461 --> 02:21:29.990
<v Speaker 4>fed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would that be?</v>

3148
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:34.990
<v Speaker 4>These algorithms recognize your </v>
<v Speaker 4>interests and whether it's golf or South</v>

3149
02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:38.750
<v Speaker 4>American fishing or fucking skydiving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck you're interested in,</v>

3150
02:21:38.751 --> 02:21:41.780
<v Speaker 4>and you start searching for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll give you things that you can start</v>

3151
02:21:41.781 --> 02:21:44.470
<v Speaker 4>just what you're searching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're liking and it's,</v>

3152
02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:45.290
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3153
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:46.123
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're saying the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations that you've best had in </v>

3154
02:21:48.201 --> 02:21:49.034
<v Speaker 4>your life or almost alternative opinions</v>
<v Speaker 4>and those start getting filtered out of </v>

3155
02:21:53.571 --> 02:21:58.571
<v Speaker 4>your feed and then you're seeing only </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own choices if you choose to go,</v>

3156
02:21:58.760 --> 02:21:59.593
<v Speaker 4>why don't you just search out things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are alternative to what you are </v>

3157
02:22:02.301 --> 02:22:04.550
<v Speaker 4>because you're Joe Rogan and you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3158
02:22:04.551 --> 02:22:05.384
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the guy who works </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking 40 hours a week who gets on </v>

3159
02:22:07.641 --> 02:22:11.000
<v Speaker 4>facebook and sees what comes down is </v>
<v Speaker 4>feed guy that he's no different than you</v>

3160
02:22:11.001 --> 02:22:12.470
<v Speaker 4>or me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's listening to you.</v>

3161
02:22:12.471 --> 02:22:13.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope he is.</v>

3162
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:15.890
<v Speaker 4>I hope he's listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you hear what I'm saying though,</v>

3163
02:22:15.891 --> 02:22:16.724
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not a fucking dismissed idea </v>

3164
02:22:18.621 --> 02:22:19.454
<v Speaker 4>that there's guys who got their heads </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking down just trying to get their </v>

3165
02:22:22.311 --> 02:22:23.144
<v Speaker 4>pay check for the next week to get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mortgage paid and they look up for a </v>

3166
02:22:26.281 --> 02:22:27.114
<v Speaker 4>long enough time and maybe facebook is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one thing they look at a week and </v>

3167
02:22:30.061 --> 02:22:32.100
<v Speaker 4>then that's where they get their </v>
<v Speaker 4>information from.</v>

3168
02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not facebook's fault.</v>

3169
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:35.093
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Facebook creates an algorithm that </v>

3170
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:40.530
<v Speaker 4>reinforce what your injuries be aware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you're saying,</v>

3171
02:22:40.770 --> 02:22:41.603
<v Speaker 4>but you're saying it also in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like almost like these people are </v>

3172
02:22:43.591 --> 02:22:44.424
<v Speaker 4>victims of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just a simple algorithm </v>

3242
02:25:51.161 --> 02:25:53.710
<v Speaker 4>it's money related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if we took money out of it,</v>

3243
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:54.723
<v Speaker 4>we could get more of an honest </v>
<v Speaker 4>politician who would actually give a </v>

<v Speaker 4>that are played that you're not even </v>

3307
02:28:54.861 --> 02:28:57.620
<v Speaker 4>tripping on because they sold you on the</v>

3313
02:29:07.101 --> 02:29:07.934
<v Speaker 4>but I could see both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see that someone would want to </v>

3314
02:29:09.801 --> 02:29:12.290
<v Speaker 4>lease something because it'd be a nice </v>
<v Speaker 4>tax write off,</v>

3315
02:29:12.291 --> 02:29:16.020
