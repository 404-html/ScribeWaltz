50
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.780

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:39.611
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>

57
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a bro Tell Mpr it's,</v>

58
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

60
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.073
<v Speaker 1>they did a study</v>

62
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.151
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

63
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>on just placebo effects per se,</v>

64
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 1>so that gave people what they told them was the placebo.</v>

65
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>They were in the control group,</v>

66
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.993
<v Speaker 1>for a,</v>

68
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>a low blood pressure or heart medication,</v>

69
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.443
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

70
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 1>but they told him we're only giving you a placebo and it's still affected.</v>

72
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Our blood pressure went down in the people noticeably like,</v>

73
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

74
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

75
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Like measurably,</v>

76
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>they think that it has something to do with just concentrating on whatever it is</v>

77
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>and or ritualistic thing.</v>

78
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm concentrating on it every day.</v>

79
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>One of the ladies in the study,</v>

80
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.860
<v Speaker 1>like after it ended,</v>

81
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.311
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

82
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

83
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.121
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

84
00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>but I need more of that.</v>

85
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Like my blood pressure is lower,</v>

86
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.503
<v Speaker 1>don't drop me.</v>

87
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I want lower blood pressure.</v>

88
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.071
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

89
00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>can I get as you wouldn't be out,</v>

90
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't get placebos at rite aid.</v>

91
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.510
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

92
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>How weird is the human brain and what the hell is going on?</v>

94
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Just some sort of regularity helps you,</v>

95
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

96
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about all the time you will,</v>

98
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a dude who was going to come on the podcast and talk about,</v>

99
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.950
<v Speaker 1>his name is Bruce Lipton and he wrote a book,</v>

100
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.671
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>on that very subject.</v>

102
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

103
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.001
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

106
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>he wrote,</v>

108
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 1>it's called the biology of belief and I ran into his,</v>

109
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:50.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's his cousin at one of the shows and the guy gave me that book and</v>

111
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>then he contacted me on Twitter and he's going to come on and explain to us,</v>

112
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>and he's a scientist so he'll,</v>

113
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.021
<v Speaker 1>the break,</v>

115
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's a scientist.</v>

116
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>He'll be able to break it down and explain exactly.</v>

117
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck they believe is going on.</v>

119
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And like with the human brain.</v>

120
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>In terms of,</v>

122
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>understandable that you and I will be able to grab the reasonably educated</v>

124
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>people to be able to grab,</v>

125
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is really strange,</v>

126
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.463
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

127
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>You can fool yourself into having a real hope.</v>

129
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre that we somehow or another have little triggers in our body that</v>

130
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how to push the road stuff.</v>

131
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

132
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

133
00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

134
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

135
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone gets caught under a car,</v>

136
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

137
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Why can all of a sudden you throw that fucking car off person,</v>

138
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.101
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>

139
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.611
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

140
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

141
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>people can do crazy shit.</v>

142
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>But I said that's cause the release of adrenaline.</v>

143
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Gas I guess.</v>

145
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.863
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

147
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>you know a lot of what you can't lift is cause you're not willing to tolerate</v>

148
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:51.484
<v Speaker 1>the pain.</v>

149
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're,</v>

150
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to pick up something really heavy,</v>

151
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>it's very painful.</v>

152
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Your body's sending you a lot of signals and most of those signals are uh,</v>

153
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.471
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

154
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>listen is not a good thing to do.</v>

155
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.411
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

156
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:03.191
<v Speaker 1>let's stop.</v>

157
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>This is heavy.</v>

158
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.051
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

159
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>This hurts.</v>

160
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.401
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

161
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.211
<v Speaker 1>we're going to drop this.</v>

162
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now we're going to drop this.</v>

163
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 1>But when your baby's trapped under your car,</v>

164
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>all those don't make it.</v>

165
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>They're like the only thing that saved the baby and your body just goes into</v>

166
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>full crazy gorilla mode.</v>

167
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>We tried to lift the car off train tracks at Bridgetown Portland Burstein and</v>

168
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>comedy festivals here.</v>

169
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Really to see if he could do it.</v>

170
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.533
<v Speaker 1>We took a wrong,</v>

171
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.883
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

172
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I only got stuck on the tracks and he went for it.</v>

173
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And you just started skidding cause it looks like you can drive over the,</v>

174
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

175
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>the stone part,</v>

176
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you know right outside the tracks.</v>

177
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>But that drops down so you would just start sliding.</v>

178
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

179
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.120
<v Speaker 1>The wheels make no connection.</v>

180
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So we had like 12 comics try to lift this car off the tracks.</v>

181
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>We get back it up.</v>

182
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't do it.</v>

183
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't even get close.</v>

184
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>We took like one tire up.</v>

185
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

186
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine some lady picking the car up off her kid.</v>

187
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.933
<v Speaker 1>I want to see it.</v>

188
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.193
<v Speaker 1>Why is there an opinion?</v>

189
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Well there's probably a video on youtube or something.</v>

190
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

191
00:04:58.661 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to watch it.</v>

192
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Would you be able to watch that amongst younger woman to try to pick a baby?</v>

193
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 1>That would be way too emotional for me.</v>

194
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

195
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>if there's that video though power,</v>

196
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 1>which is sponsored power,</v>

197
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>a I that would work,</v>

198
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.600
<v Speaker 1>that would help you rehydrate after lifting a baby or a car off a baby tired</v>

199
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>would give you a special strength.</v>

200
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>It is weird how some people would just have way more physical strength than</v>

201
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:24.911
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

202
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>It's so clear that we're in some weird phase,</v>

203
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>like very few animals I think vary in size and shape as much as people do.</v>

205
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's close,</v>

206
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I think his dogs and you know,</v>

207
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:37.451
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

208
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>they don't know where the fuck dogs come from.</v>

209
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Really don't have a goddamn clue.</v>

210
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

211
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things they found out when they mapped the genome of the dog.</v>

212
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>They thought that it was going to be wolves and a bunch of different wild canids</v>

213
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and coyotes and all this different chicken on.</v>

214
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

215
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:51.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

216
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:51.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

217
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:51.761
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

218
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>It's all walls.</v>

219
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.673
<v Speaker 1>It's all wove.</v>

220
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 1>All Wolf so that when they just bread it,</v>

221
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>just like they've read them now,</v>

222
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a fucking</v>

223
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.173
<v Speaker 3>clue.</v>

224
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>No one has ever been able to go from wolf to Chihuahua ever.</v>

225
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever documented,</v>

226
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.091
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

227
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take this wolf and turn it into Chihuahua.</v>

228
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things we accept that we don't understand it.</v>

229
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 3>It's been around for so long.</v>

230
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly genetic manipulation.</v>

231
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Egypt,</v>

232
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.093
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

233
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.031
<v Speaker 3>that cats,</v>

234
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 3>we know they had cats.</v>

235
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.741
<v Speaker 3>I think they had dogs,</v>

236
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 3>but there's no indication of whether or not they had the variation of dogs that</v>

237
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:23.301
<v Speaker 3>we have today.</v>

238
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.520
<v Speaker 3>We have a weird variation,</v>

239
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 3>a little tiny things that are useless.</v>

240
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.751
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

241
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 3>you know cute pets and shit,</v>

242
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 3>but big ones.</v>

243
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 3>They're guard dogs,</v>

244
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 3>work dogs,</v>

245
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>dogs for hunting.</v>

246
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 3>So many distinctions.</v>

247
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.451
<v Speaker 3>Arizona.</v>

248
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Just see the wild dogs,</v>

249
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 3>the really,</v>

250
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.223
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

251
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 3>that's scary shit.</v>

252
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 3>They don't really attack people that I've seen.</v>

253
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.370
<v Speaker 3>They're just sort of like bare.</v>

254
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 3>There was a story in Georgia a few years back about some wild dogs that killed a</v>

255
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

256
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

257
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

258
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

259
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't do that.</v>

260
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.071
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

261
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:49.904
<v Speaker 3>they get to,</v>

262
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean they get to packs and then they all grow up generation after generation</v>

263
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:55.401
<v Speaker 3>in the woods.</v>

264
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:55.641
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

265
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 3>all you need is a couple of generations and you're dealing with a fucking killer</v>

266
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 3>animal out there.</v>

267
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 3>That's a scary fucking thing.</v>

268
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:01.810
<v Speaker 3>And they'd take out a dear,</v>

269
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't they take out you if you're alone by yourself?</v>

270
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 3>And there's like 30 of them and that's how they're traveling.</v>

271
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.333
<v Speaker 3>Like grizzly man.</v>

272
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.931
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

273
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:09.764
<v Speaker 3>you finally start.</v>

274
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.130
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same feeling I got.</v>

275
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:11.391
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

276
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:11.661
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

277
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.770
<v Speaker 3>if they're eating their young,</v>

278
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.400
<v Speaker 3>what did you make the connection to food?</v>

279
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.593
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

280
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 3>That was the most ridiculous guy ever.</v>

281
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

282
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how he couldn't see that,</v>

283
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>

284
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.331
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

285
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 3>they're eating themselves well hungry.</v>

286
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 3>He was just so gay that he was just running away from it.</v>

287
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 3>He was running away from the gayness to the point where he decided to live alone</v>

288
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 3>in the woods with monsters.</v>

289
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Big,</v>

290
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.511
<v Speaker 3>giant,</v>

291
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

292
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 3>They're like rats,</v>

293
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:42.780
<v Speaker 3>like giant rats sort of bear as well.</v>

294
00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a peaceful right next to him and then they just too.</v>

295
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 3>How about the video where he had one bear who had his back up against a tree?</v>

296
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 3>He was like scratching his back.</v>

297
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 3>So he's standing full up and scratching his back and he's like fucking feet</v>

298
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:58.274
<v Speaker 3>tall.</v>

299
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 3>And could you imagine this asshole is just sleeping in the bushes with a piece</v>

300
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:06.550
<v Speaker 3>of fabric over his head for years and years.</v>

301
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:07.963
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

302
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

303
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>but will he fucked up as he stayed to la?</v>

304
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 3>He stayed to the point where they were super,</v>

305
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 3>super desperate.</v>

306
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 3>The those fall bears.</v>

307
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think he stayed longer than suicide by bear?</v>

308
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.440
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

309
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:19.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

310
00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 3>he's massively depressed.</v>

311
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 3>That guy was crazy.</v>

312
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 3>If you see how he gets in front of the camera and starts screaming and the</v>

313
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.010
<v Speaker 3>fucking government bears,</v>

314
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 3>that guy's manic and there's he's,</v>

315
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I think he was trying to commit suicide.</v>

316
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

317
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:33.831
<v Speaker 3>In a sense.</v>

318
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

319
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 3>He went back when he had nothing else.</v>

320
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 3>That's when he went back.</v>

321
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 3>He went back to the,</v>

322
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 3>to the Alaska to that,</v>

323
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:40.860
<v Speaker 3>that area every year.</v>

324
00:08:40.861 --> 00:08:41.691
<v Speaker 3>Where Al Yeah,</v>

325
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't go back this late.</v>

326
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 3>We went back in late October and in November that's when the bears are going to</v>

327
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>

328
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.240
<v Speaker 3>And so the only bears that are up are the bears that were unsuccessful.</v>

329
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know the old ones.</v>

330
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:54.410
<v Speaker 3>They're dying.</v>

331
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens man.</v>

332
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 3>They die</v>

333
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.031
<v Speaker 1>and we don't even know.</v>

334
00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

335
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.051
<v Speaker 1>we very,</v>

336
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>very rarely find bare bones.</v>

337
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It's really kinda interesting.</v>

338
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

339
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>bears are massive animals.</v>

340
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>One of the babies only just as bear skull,</v>

341
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>the white,</v>

342
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>and they'll probably eat that later and it wasn't coming back Kilbane within a</v>

343
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:13.700
<v Speaker 1>few days ago.</v>

344
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.533
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

345
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

346
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>they eat their bones.</v>

347
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>They eat,</v>

348
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>they eat their dead bodies.</v>

349
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Speaker 1>They the,</v>

350
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the bear that killed this guy,</v>

351
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>they shot it and killed it and they came back like two weeks later and it was</v>

352
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:25.430
<v Speaker 1>just everything gone.</v>

353
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Just a few bones scattered around.</v>

354
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It felt like rib bones or this is really [inaudible] most of the bones,</v>

355
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 1>they had most of everything.</v>

356
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>The chicken at Hardee's there,</v>

357
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 1>weather bears,</v>

358
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>man bears are big fucking animals.</v>

359
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:37.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

360
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can even wrap our heads around what that is.</v>

361
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a big building machine and people just sleep near him when those two bears</v>

362
00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 1>were fighting and the ones shit himself.</v>

363

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

364
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>How crazy was that?</v>

365
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Great footage?</v>

366
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing footage.</v>

367
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.391
<v Speaker 1>Amazing footage.</v>

368
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.770
<v Speaker 1>No one else would be that crazy right there.</v>

369
00:09:53.771 --> 00:09:55.360
<v Speaker 1>And they're really trying to kill each other.</v>

370
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

371
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing fight.</v>

372
00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Would always talking about between these two bears on this like beach,</v>

373
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:00.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:00.920
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

375
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

376
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.590
<v Speaker 1>the shore of a lake or something like that.</v>

377
00:10:02.591 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 1>We're in a field and lit or something like that.</v>

378
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.821
<v Speaker 1>Water right.</v>

380
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:06.654
<v Speaker 1>That scene.</v>

381
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Big scene,</v>

382
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.533
<v Speaker 1>going out,</v>

383
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.120
<v Speaker 1>partying,</v>

384
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.951
<v Speaker 1>trying to bite each other.</v>

385
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Like it looks like the death to death for sure on the eye and ear out.</v>

386
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:14.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

387
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.000
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to fuck each other up.</v>

388
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.401
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

389
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Who gets to fuck?</v>

390
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what it is,</v>

391
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

392
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>That's how they decide.</v>

393
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>That's how does it decide who gets to fuck.</v>

394
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't participate in that at bars,</v>

395
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>when I see another guy get involved with a check,</v>

00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>it used to be okay to say retard.</v>

654
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little upset that you can't say retarded anymore and you know,</v>

655
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 1>and without people thinking that you're brutally insensitive when,</v>

656
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 1>what do I mean?</v>

657
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Has Our society really truly evolved or they're just these hot button words now</v>

658
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that people choose to act on.</v>

659
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.101
<v Speaker 1>Because when you know,</v>

660
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:32.180
<v Speaker 1>when you're calling someone a retard,</v>

00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you have down syndrome.</v>

741
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.020

756
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.440

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>puke doesn't make me nauseous.</v>

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.840
<v Speaker 4>one of the like e entertainment people or something like that and he wanted to</v>

762
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.050
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

763
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:58.431
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

764
00:20:58.431 --> 00:20:58.711
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

765
00:20:58.711 --> 00:20:59.041
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

766
00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:00.210
<v Speaker 1>this is just protein.</v>

767
00:21:00.211 --> 00:21:01.350
<v Speaker 1>If we were living in,</v>

768
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:01.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

769
00:21:01.681 --> 00:21:02.790
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years ago,</v>

770
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.880
<v Speaker 1>this would be something you would be happy to eat this bar food.</v>

771
00:21:05.881 --> 00:21:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about that video on your phone.</v>

772
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Really just thinking about it and then we'll be on my phone.</v>

773
00:21:09.481 --> 00:21:10.320
<v Speaker 1>We can't talk about it though.</v>

774
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Some day we will someday we will,</v>

775
00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:13.831
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

776
00:21:13.831 --> 00:21:16.860
<v Speaker 1>but right now due to contractual obligations that I have with fear factor,</v>

777
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.800
<v Speaker 1>we have to keep some shit on the raps when that gets on the air.</v>

778
00:21:19.801 --> 00:21:20.011
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

779
00:21:20.011 --> 00:21:20.641
<v Speaker 1>when there's,</v>

780
00:21:20.641 --> 00:21:24.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of shit that we did the season that was sold way more over the</v>

781
00:21:24.661 --> 00:21:26.340
<v Speaker 1>top than anything we ever did before.</v>

782
00:21:26.341 --> 00:21:26.551
<v Speaker 1>Hot.</v>

783
00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:27.270
<v Speaker 1>It's going to vary.</v>

784
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.170
<v Speaker 1>We were just sitting there,</v>

785
00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:28.621
<v Speaker 1>standing there,</v>

786
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.820
<v Speaker 1>shaking each other's heads like,</v>

787
00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.170
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

788
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.220
<v Speaker 4>And you should've seen sales phase.</v>

789
00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:37.160
<v Speaker 4>I should sal Sal's comedy club.</v>

790
00:21:37.161 --> 00:21:39.230
<v Speaker 4>And he just sat there like he saw a calm goat.</v>

791
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

792
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Like a ghost man.</v>

793
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

794
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.070
<v Speaker 1>the bug was nothing.</v>

795
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.570
<v Speaker 1>It didn't taste bad at all.</v>

796
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.460
<v Speaker 1>What kind of bug was it?</v>

797
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:50.871
<v Speaker 1>Who was a,</v>

798
00:21:50.871 --> 00:21:51.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

799
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.920
<v Speaker 1>an African cave dwelling.</v>

800
00:21:52.921 --> 00:21:53.754
<v Speaker 1>Spider.</v>

801
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.803
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

802
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.750
<v Speaker 1>There's ones with the tons of crazy long lost.</v>

803
00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

804
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.480
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a giant alive,</v>

805
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.343
<v Speaker 1>crabbing,</v>

806
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:01.870
<v Speaker 1>shortness.</v>

807
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Your first,</v>

808
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:03.090
<v Speaker 1>how big?</v>

809
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

810
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.231
<v Speaker 1>it's spread out.</v>

811
00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It's about that big and what you do smell it up.</v>

812
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

813
00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed that bitch by the center and just stuff it in there right away.</v>

814
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Just by the legs.</v>

815
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.740
<v Speaker 1>All smash that motherfucker quick.</v>

816
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I smashed them up quick.</v>

817
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But it's a lot of chewing,</v>

818
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.311
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

819
00:22:17.311 --> 00:22:19.440
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't really taste that bad.</v>

820
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:19.981
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

821
00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:20.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

822
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.881
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

823
00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I knew that you new it's been okay.</v>

824
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.491
<v Speaker 1>It's been okay.</v>

825
00:22:23.491 --> 00:22:24.324
<v Speaker 1>This won't hurt me.</v>

826
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

827
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.550
<v Speaker 1>People have been eating those things forever.</v>

828
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Humans have been eating bugs forever to the tastes good.</v>

829
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:30.540
<v Speaker 1>And anyway,</v>

830
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

831
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

832
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

833
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.001
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad.</v>

834
00:22:33.001 --> 00:22:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I could look those giant Madagascar hissing cockroaches.</v>

835
00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I had one of those in the show too and uh,</v>

836
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot that's gross and eating those things but it's also a good form of</v>

837
00:22:43.081 --> 00:22:43.830
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>

838
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.270
<v Speaker 1>If you're really starving to death,</v>

839
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you would totally eat that.</v>

840
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 4>I think the grossest wants out of this big green with a garden</v>

841
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 1>tomato hornworms one of those too.</v>

842
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.690
<v Speaker 1>They just exploded,</v>

843
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.370
<v Speaker 1>just pouring out.</v>

844
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 1>It was gross.</v>

845
00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.600
<v Speaker 1>It was really hard to drink.</v>

846
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.601
<v Speaker 1>Really hard to do.</v>

847
00:23:00.601 --> 00:23:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

848
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.230
<v Speaker 1>what did that taste like?</v>

849
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Real bitter and it tasted like you shouldn't be eating it like,</v>

850
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.870
<v Speaker 1>like nature's trying to warn you,</v>

851
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.190
<v Speaker 1>which I was assuming they are.</v>

852
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not,</v>

853
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into acquiring any tastes if I don't like it.</v>

854
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Initially I don't like it.</v>

855
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:14.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

856
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:15.390
<v Speaker 1>like the idea,</v>

857
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 1>like caviar was always a weird one to me.</v>

858
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Like it's an acquired taste.</v>

859
00:23:18.651 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you like it?</v>

860
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

861
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.673
<v Speaker 1>it's a choir.</v>

862
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that mean?</v>

863
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>You're going to spend like 5,000 bucks for something that's acquired.</v>

864
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's more expensive,</v>

865
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting into this to enjoy some stupid eggs,</v>

866
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.600
<v Speaker 1>but some weird ritualistic thing almost.</v>

867
00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:35.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

868
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:35.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

869
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:35.661
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

870
00:23:35.661 --> 00:23:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you're getting eggs of this animal that's very rare.</v>

871
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.311
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

872
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:44.311
<v Speaker 1>you get to crush it's babies before they ever it on your cracker.</v>

873
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Fishing with David Taylor</v>

874
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.020
<v Speaker 5>in Alaska and we cut up one of the fishes and all these things in there and</v>

875
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:50.361
<v Speaker 5>David took,</v>

876
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:50.751
<v Speaker 5>what's this?</v>

877
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 5>And the guy's like eggs and he's like,</v>

878
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 5>is that caviar?</v>

879
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 5>Can I eat it?</v>

880
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 5>And this guy was like,</v>

881
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.070
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

882
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.241
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

883
00:23:54.241 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 5>if you want David,</v>

884
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 5>just start eating more and more of it.</v>

885
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Every time we call it pregnant salmon,</v>

886
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 5>he would just eat more and more of it until the veteran.</v>

887
00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:01.244
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

888
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:01.431
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

889
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:02.264
<v Speaker 5>I have to fill up now.</v>

890
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.190
<v Speaker 5>He was so nauseous from eating all that sand.</v>

891
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.000
<v Speaker 5>You're not supposed to eat fucking a pound of,</v>

892
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.490
<v Speaker 5>of warm salmon eggs.</v>

893
00:24:08.491 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

894
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.973
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

895
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.993
<v Speaker 5>It happens.</v>

896
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 5>You barred from actually on the open sea.</v>

897
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.103
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

898
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.800
<v Speaker 5>They'd be grilled on the beat on the,</v>

899
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.361
<v Speaker 5>on the boat.</v>

900
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:17.890
<v Speaker 5>It was so funny.</v>

901
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 5>It look good food.</v>

902
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.593
<v Speaker 5>What does he think?</v>

903
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 5>He was just eating it because it was caviar.</v>

904
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 5>Not that it was good or,</v>

905
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.050
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

906
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

907
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.471
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

908
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:24.861
<v Speaker 5>it's free.</v>

909
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:26.520
<v Speaker 5>I should get this as much as I can right now.</v>

910
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:27.531
<v Speaker 5>Fresh,</v>

911
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 5>fresh.</v>

912
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.671
<v Speaker 5>Is He German?</v>

913
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:31.290
<v Speaker 5>That guy is comes from German descent or English I think.</v>

914
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.940
<v Speaker 3>I think there's an issue with salmon.</v>

915
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.740
<v Speaker 3>You have to be careful with salmon.</v>

916
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.230
<v Speaker 3>You're not even really supposed to eat Sushi.</v>

917
00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:40.180
<v Speaker 3>If you talk to some quote unquote experts.</v>

918
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:40.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

919
00:24:40.631 --> 00:24:41.710
<v Speaker 3>that's fresh water.</v>

920
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Especially salmon because salmon is its potential.</v>

921
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:46.000
<v Speaker 3>It has a potential for parasites.</v>

922
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.871
<v Speaker 3>It's not likely,</v>

923
00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:48.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's got a potential.</v>

924
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.960
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

925
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.070
<v Speaker 3>You know most of the farm raised stuff,</v>

926
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:51.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

928
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.600
<v Speaker 3>I have it on the head with farm raised.</v>

929
00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:58.811
<v Speaker 3>Those are,</v>

930
00:24:58.811 --> 00:24:59.760
<v Speaker 3>they taste better man.</v>

931
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:00.730
<v Speaker 3>It's wild.</v>

932
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.280
<v Speaker 3>You know when you,</v>

933
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.470
<v Speaker 3>this is where it weirds me out.</v>

934
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Farm raised is like pink and you know when they put it in a store they die.</v>

935
00:25:07.361 --> 00:25:08.410
<v Speaker 3>That shit like diet,</v>

936
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.920
<v Speaker 3>pay,</v>

937
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.400
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>

938
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.920
<v Speaker 3>make it look like a healthy wild salmon.</v>

939
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.860
<v Speaker 3>But it literally becomes such a bit.</v>

940
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.920
<v Speaker 3>And the only way I know again gets like it loses its soul.</v>

941
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:18.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

942
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:19.810
<v Speaker 3>And that crazy,</v>

943
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.050
<v Speaker 3>the color drops out and it tastes worse.</v>

944
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

945
00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:24.160
<v Speaker 3>It tastes worse.</v>

946
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.480
<v Speaker 3>What's not worthy?</v>

947
00:25:25.481 --> 00:25:29.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not as worthy to catch that goes along with my theory that things that can</v>

948
00:25:29.351 --> 00:25:31.060
<v Speaker 3>get away real quick or better for you.</v>

949
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.590
<v Speaker 3>So I fishes so good for you.</v>

950
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.240
<v Speaker 3>So fucking hard to catch.</v>

951
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.250
<v Speaker 3>You know dear dear is great for you.</v>

952
00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:37.780
<v Speaker 3>So hard to catch the [inaudible] or the other,</v>

953
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.590
<v Speaker 3>they're so quick.</v>

954
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.960
<v Speaker 3>They have what they have is so good.</v>

955
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to catch you.</v>

956
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.020
<v Speaker 3>They run away real fast.</v>

957
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.310
<v Speaker 3>It's so good that they develop nature gave them a chance and that chance as you</v>

958
00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:50.830
<v Speaker 3>get to be faster than the people so that they can't,</v>

959
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

960
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.230
<v Speaker 3>just being able to be out and not being depressed cause cause cause I'm a farm</v>

961
00:25:57.911 --> 00:26:00.700
<v Speaker 3>raised cows tastes better than grain fed cows,</v>

962
00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:00.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

963
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes they do.</v>

964
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.650
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a different taste.</v>

965
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.523
<v Speaker 3>They can sort of be out.</v>

966
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

967
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I buy a grass fed beef whenever I can.</v>

968
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:07.570
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

969
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a different taste.</v>

970
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like a game animal almost.</v>

971
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:11.314
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

972
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of exaggerating,</v>

973
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:13.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

974
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.501
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

975
00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:14.951
<v Speaker 3>It's way,</v>

976
00:26:14.951 --> 00:26:15.191
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

977
00:26:15.191 --> 00:26:15.821
<v Speaker 3>way leaner.</v>

978
00:26:15.821 --> 00:26:17.350
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be real careful when you cook it.</v>

979
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.790
<v Speaker 3>You can't cook it for very long,</v>

980
00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

981
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.910
<v Speaker 3>really an overcook it big on,</v>

982
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.200
<v Speaker 3>really dry on the grass fed.</v>

983
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.191
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>

984
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:24.341
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

985
00:26:24.341 --> 00:26:26.200
<v Speaker 3>he's a crossfit fanatic Eddie,</v>

986
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:27.170
<v Speaker 3>if to our buddies,</v>

987
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:30.130
<v Speaker 3>like in crazy shape or I suppose he's always like,</v>

988
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.840
<v Speaker 3>try to get me to squeeze your shoulders and shit.</v>

989
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.480
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crossfit.</v>

990
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about his dead lifts and feel my fucking shoulders.</v>

991
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.760
<v Speaker 5>When those people do that at the same,</v>

992
00:26:39.761 --> 00:26:42.100
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty much you're telling me about your fantasy football team.</v>

993
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:42.521
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

994
00:26:42.521 --> 00:26:42.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

995
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:43.703
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

996
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 5>I totally</v>

997
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>see what is coming from me.</v>

998
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 1>People think that it's kind of,</v>

999
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:49.374
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1000
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:49.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1001
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

1002
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of a gross thing about worrying about what your body looks like and</v>

1003
00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.780
<v Speaker 1>being really into your body.</v>

1004
00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 1>There's something gross about it,</v>

1005
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1006
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

1007
00:26:58.711 --> 00:26:59.680
<v Speaker 1>it is a little vague,</v>

1008
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 1>but that said,</v>

1009
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>isn't it more fun to have like what's essentially a super body?</v>

1010
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it more fun to have a body that can do all kinds of crazy shit that</v>

1011
00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:10.790
<v Speaker 1>already regular body can't do.</v>

1012
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.761
<v Speaker 1>So when you know,</v>

1013
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's in there dead lifting and shit and I'm putting these big lifts in and</v>

1014
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.960
<v Speaker 1>doing these crazy kettlebell workouts and shit,</v>

1041
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.810
<v Speaker 6>And what's so weird is this one guy came in there and he looked like you looked</v>

1042
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:01.644
<v Speaker 6>at him and you're like,</v>

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>

1046
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.800
<v Speaker 6>his structure.</v>

1047
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:07.140
<v Speaker 6>He looks like a real GI Joe Guy.</v>

1048
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.970
<v Speaker 6>Like that looks like a Gi Joe Guy.</v>

1049
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 6>And then he got his food and he was like getting Sawso from the salsa bar and he</v>

1050
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 6>was putting in his bag and he folded like the bag down.</v>

1051
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 6>So like anger or not angry like it had be folded,</v>

1052
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:24.120
<v Speaker 6>like all the lines had to be like all the lines had to be straight and stuff</v>

1053
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:24.481
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

1054
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 6>And then this guy goes,</v>

<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

1057
00:28:27.121 --> 00:28:29.730
<v Speaker 6>And he just got this mad look like he was like unfolding it,</v>

1058
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 6>having to put it in there.</v>

1059
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:31.411
<v Speaker 6>And it was like,</v>

1060
00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 6>we are both looking at it going,</v>

1061
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.571
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 6>that guy's going to emerge.</v>

1063
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.370
<v Speaker 1>My friend was PSI in college.</v>

1065
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.660
<v Speaker 1>This Ethiopian guy used to work out and at the top of his lifts we go,</v>

1066
00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck somebody up.</v>

1067
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Like getting into bar fights.</v>

1068
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.963
<v Speaker 1>I love doing it.</v>

1069
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.583
<v Speaker 1>That's what kept them going.</v>

1070
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that light getting in the bus?</v>

1071
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.920
<v Speaker 1>So he would pick fights with people?</v>

1072
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It starts at not hard and be like,</v>

1073
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:03.771
<v Speaker 1>you would have to fight back.</v>

1074
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:04.604
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1075
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.830
<v Speaker 6>have you talked about the steroids documentary?</v>

1076
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.431
<v Speaker 6>Bigger,</v>

1077

<v Speaker 6>stronger,</v>

1078
00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:08.684
<v Speaker 6>faster.</v>

1079
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Smilier I haven't seen it,</v>

1080
00:29:10.401 --> 00:29:11.061
<v Speaker 1>so no.</v>

1081
00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:11.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1082
00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:11.811
<v Speaker 1>I never watched,</v>

1083
00:29:11.811 --> 00:29:13.130
<v Speaker 1>so I watched like little clips of it.</v>

1084
00:29:13.131 --> 00:29:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I actually own it on DVD,</v>

1085
00:29:14.301 --> 00:29:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but it never bothered watching it.</v>

1086
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.131
<v Speaker 6>It's not bad.</v>

1087
00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:16.351
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1088
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:17.330
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty interesting.</v>

1089
00:29:17.331 --> 00:29:17.511
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

1090
00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:18.021
<v Speaker 6>it would,</v>

1091
00:29:18.021 --> 00:29:19.490
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know though is like,</v>

1092
00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:20.321
<v Speaker 6>well also they should,</v>

1093
00:29:20.321 --> 00:29:21.290
<v Speaker 6>there's cows on there.</v>

1094
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.340
<v Speaker 6>This steroid cows.</v>

1095
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:23.723
<v Speaker 1>Well they are,</v>

1096
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1097
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a steroid.</v>

1098
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Now there's this thing that happens to certain cows where the,</v>

1099
00:29:29.881 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1100
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a myostatin inhibitor and it goes wrong and when it goes wrong,</v>

1101
00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:36.210
<v Speaker 1>they grow like three times.</v>

1102
00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:39.200
<v Speaker 1>The regular [inaudible] muscle dude,</v>

1103
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.670
<v Speaker 1>the dog's Huston.</v>

1104
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1105
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>it's just from,</v>

1106
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.090
<v Speaker 1>from breeding there's somehow or another their genetics,</v>

1107
00:29:45.091 --> 00:29:45.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1108
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:45.881
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those,</v>

1109
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 1>those gigantic house like three times the size of a person.</v>

1110
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 1>And we were seeing the dogs too.</v>

1111
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a whippet it happens too,</v>

1112
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 1>but specifically to whip.</v>

1113
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:56.680
<v Speaker 1>It's for some reason whippets are very slight dog,</v>

1114
00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>

1115
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly big,</v>

1116
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:01.330
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's not a tiny done but tall,</v>

1117
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:01.671
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1118
00:30:01.671 --> 00:30:01.991
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1119
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a thin dog.</v>

1120
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 1>But these whippets that have this myostatin inhibitor issue.</v>

1121
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Fucking swole.</v>

1122
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Like captain America,</v>

1123
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.050

<v Speaker 1>it's dummy proof the Internet these days.</v>

1165
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 1>It'll offer you suggestions,</v>

1166
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.530
<v Speaker 1>but weapons on steroids.</v>

1167
00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:09.041
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it,</v>

1168
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:09.611
<v Speaker 1>you'll find this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I read it explained,</v>

<v Speaker 1>amount of muscle.</v>

1318

<v Speaker 1>I worked at a fucking kid that was born with this motherfucker right here.</v>

1326
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.761
<v Speaker 1>Come on kid.</v>

1327

1328

<v Speaker 1>Really muscular kids.</v>

1333
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 1>It was just so surreal talking to Lou Ferrigno.</v>

1334
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.920
<v Speaker 1>You and I are talking about working out.</v>

1335
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.470
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to talk to him?</v>

1336
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of kettlebells like to did you just</v>

1337
00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.150

1339
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:00.290

1340
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.200
<v Speaker 4>Brian make it fun.</v>

1342
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.513
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1343
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.363
<v Speaker 4>one day</v>

1344
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 4>she had to take it to the lowest common denominator.</v>

1345
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1346
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 4>You went for the low hanging fruit.</v>

1347
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.010
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know what anywhere around these just trying to be on him side.</v>

1348
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.680
<v Speaker 4>These hopes don't talk man.</v>

1349
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:23.710
<v Speaker 4>That whole time actually just this was a hawk standing so like cause it was CGI.</v>

1350
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 4>I think it's what they used for people who are looking at cameras and stuff like</v>

1351
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1352
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.431
<v Speaker 4>Let me see what it looks.</v>

1353
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:29.130
<v Speaker 4>It does look good.</v>

1354
00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.260
<v Speaker 4>It looks pretty creepy.</v>

1355
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.370
<v Speaker 4>You're not buying that thing.</v>

1356
00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Don't buy that.</v>

1357
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.631
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

1358
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:32.781
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1359
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:36.590
<v Speaker 4>What do you my dad buy it now and it's on a stick to,</v>

1360
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:37.424
<v Speaker 4>it's on TMC</v>

1361
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.160
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

1362
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.351
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1363
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably not going to Marvel's having this pretty dope.</v>

1364
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:44.803
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty dope.</v>

1365
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what I would buy.</v>

1366
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:46.944
<v Speaker 3>I would buy the,</v>

1367
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.290
<v Speaker 3>the head of the American Werewolf in London.</v>

1368
00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.670
<v Speaker 3>The original best werewolf of all time.</v>

1369
00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.470
<v Speaker 3>There's been a few werewolf movies that have been kind of fun over the years,</v>

1371
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 3>but none can fuck with an American Werewolf in London.</v>

1372
00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.213
<v Speaker 3>That movie,</v>

1373
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 3>it looks so real.</v>

1374
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 3>It looks so real.</v>

1375
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.540
<v Speaker 3>That movie,</v>

1376
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 3>and it was a long ass time ago,</v>

1377
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:05.281
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1378
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 3>they did that shit in the 80s I movie rocks so much.</v>

1379
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 3>It looks so much better than that fixed star wars stuff.</v>

1380
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:14.520
<v Speaker 3>When that thing was in London,</v>

1381
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 3>when it was fucking people up in the streets when it came out of the,</v>

1382
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 3>the dirty movie theater.</v>

1383
00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 3>It kills everybody in the dirty movie theater on the London streets like they</v>

1384
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:27.080
<v Speaker 3>showed just enough of it to scare the fuck out.</v>

1385
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have to close up,</v>

1386
00:36:29.761 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 3>show the thing moving around because when you do that,</v>

1387
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:35.910
<v Speaker 3>then people get used to it and they knew how to do it back then.</v>

1388
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:36.721
<v Speaker 3>You know those,</v>

1389
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:37.490
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1390
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 3>the special effects were not nearly as if,</v>

1391
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 3>as Lou Joe's scared me so bad that I walked 45 minutes out of my way,</v>

1392
00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 3>wants to get back home after saying it instead of the seven minutes,</v>

1393
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:48.030
<v Speaker 3>it would have taken a fine.</v>

1394
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.320
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>

1395
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 3>They knew how to,</v>

1396
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean the American Werewolf in London,</v>

1397
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:55.321
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1398
00:36:55.321 --> 00:36:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's John Landis and whoever else was involved in John to that.</v>

1399
00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Whoever else was involved in creating the imagery behind it.</v>

1401
00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Just such an awesome job.</v>

1402
00:37:03.561 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 3>A special effects guy was supposed to be some legendary.</v>

1403
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.270
<v Speaker 3>How the vice guy,</v>

1404
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:06.451
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1405
00:37:06.451 --> 00:37:07.201
<v Speaker 3>it's Rick Baker.</v>

1406
00:37:07.201 --> 00:37:08.034
<v Speaker 3>He's the man,</v>

1407
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:13.250
<v Speaker 3>but he's also the guy who did the last wolf man with Benicio Del Toro and I</v>

1408
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:16.920
<v Speaker 3>didn't like that special effects at all.</v>

1409
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:18.720
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a silly choice.</v>

1410
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.003
<v Speaker 3>They went,</v>

1411
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 3>they went with this loan,</v>

1412
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:26.170
<v Speaker 3>Chaney junior look from like or whoever the fuck you original wolf man was as a</v>

1413
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.730
<v Speaker 3>long Chaney Jr uh,</v>

1414
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I was original wolf man.</v>

1415
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Don Not Vamos Paul.</v>

1416
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.833
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1417
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Claude rains.</v>

1418
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Well it says Claude rains and loan Chaney Jr.</v>

1419
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure which one was the uh,</v>

1420
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.961
<v Speaker 3>the monster.</v>

1421
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:46.621
<v Speaker 3>I think it's long.</v>

1422
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:47.454
<v Speaker 3>Chaney Junior.</v>

1423
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.331
<v Speaker 3>And they went to look like,</v>

1424
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1425
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:48.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1426
00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:51.170
<v Speaker 3>My point is that movie is from 1941,</v>

1427
00:37:51.171 --> 00:37:52.004
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1428
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.420
<v Speaker 3>And so what they did is like an updated version of it.</v>

1429
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:55.263
<v Speaker 3>It looked real.</v>

1430
00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It looked like a thing that's just a stylistic choice.</v>

1431
00:37:58.621 --> 00:38:00.840
<v Speaker 3>But as long as it looks real as that version of it,</v>

1432
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:05.870
<v Speaker 3>well their idea was they wanted to be a real person instead of a CGI thing</v>

1433
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:08.640
<v Speaker 3>because they had this great actor.</v>

1434
00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:12.720
<v Speaker 3>And when do you get an actor as good as Benito del Tora Way,</v>

1435
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.920
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1436
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 3>So use him to embody the beast and then you'll do some CGI,</v>

1437
00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:19.290
<v Speaker 3>like his legs were Cgi,</v>

1438
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.470
<v Speaker 3>so they bet backwards like a dog's legs and shit like that,</v>

1439
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Speaker 3>which is really weird that he's walking upright on those.</v>

1440
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 3>But it's a movie,</v>

1441
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.380
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1442
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 3>the real issue is the exact opposite of what you got from the American wealth in</v>

1443
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:34.140
<v Speaker 3>London for the American Werewolf in London,</v>

1444
00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:35.220
<v Speaker 3>there was mystery.</v>

1445
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:35.651
<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>

1446
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene where this guy gets killed in the London subway,</v>

1447
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.160
<v Speaker 3>there's shithead and he's kind of a shithead.</v>

1448
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.650
<v Speaker 3>So you kind of like a happy with you guys.</v>

1449
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1450
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 3>he's a dickhead and he's just stumbling.</v>

1451
00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:45.911
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1452
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 3>And he's trying to hold onto his briefcase.</v>

1453
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 3>And so this thing is,</v>

1454
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 3>he's running and this thing's chasing how many falls down on an escalator.</v>

1455
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 3>And as he's going on this escalator up,</v>

1456
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.900
<v Speaker 3>you see the thing at the bottom of the escalator and that ends the scene.</v>

1457
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 3>And it's terrifying.</v>

1458
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 3>You just know what's terrifying.</v>

1459
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:02.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to see a killer.</v>

1460
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1461
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.750
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying because they just played at just enough where you don't even get</v>

1462
00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 3>to see it.</v>

1463
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.620
<v Speaker 3>He sees it and you can see it in his eyes and he runs and then you hear the</v>

1464
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 3>thing in the background making this crazy noise and he's running and you can't</v>

1465
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 3>see it.</v>

1466
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 3>And then finally in the end of the scene,</v>

1467
00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 3>you see it at the bottom of the stairs and that's all you need,</v>

1468
00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:21.010
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1469
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:21.843
<v Speaker 3>That's all you need.</v>

1470
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:27.030
<v Speaker 3>They show that movie is the absolute perfect Horror Monster Werewolf movie to</v>

1471
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:28.420
<v Speaker 3>watch that again now,</v>

1472
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:30.550
<v Speaker 3>so the best and it's got some humor in it.</v>

1473
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 3>There's something I want to see in there.</v>

1474
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.020
<v Speaker 3>He gets laid Shizam it's everything.</v>

1475
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:39.070
<v Speaker 3>You want to have a movie that one hot English bitches.</v>

1476
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Holla at your boy.</v>

1477
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.883
<v Speaker 3>That's what</v>

1478
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.863
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what I was just,</v>

1479
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:44.650
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1480
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1481
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.630
<v Speaker 3>but if I had a head,</v>

1482
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.493
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would buy.</v>

1483
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.400
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't buy the whole kit,</v>

1484
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.010
<v Speaker 3>but I'll by the American Werewolf in London,</v>

1485
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.610
<v Speaker 5>I would buy robocop probably or something like that.</v>

1486
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:53.720
<v Speaker 5>From your childhood.</v>

1487
00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.310
<v Speaker 5>You remember it or star wars.</v>

1488
00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.470
<v Speaker 5>Star Wars did this,</v>

1489
00:39:57.471 --> 00:39:58.460
<v Speaker 5>this desk.</v>

1490
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 5>It's so fucking weird.</v>

1491
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.540
<v Speaker 5>That's sort of where it's so much.</v>

1492
00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.430
<v Speaker 5>You're such a like,</v>

1493
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.000
<v Speaker 5>it's just a mixture of the weirdest shit I've ever seen.</v>

1494
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.970
<v Speaker 5>Stevia and marijuana and knives.</v>

1495
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Dog Tag,</v>

1496
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:10.760
<v Speaker 5>weird reading glasses,</v>

1497
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.460
<v Speaker 5>tablets and the skulls.</v>

1498
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.270
<v Speaker 5>It's my mind.</v>

1499
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.560
<v Speaker 5>Skull fucking belt buckle.</v>

1500
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Stanley Kubrick's Odyssey.</v>

1501
00:40:19.581 --> 00:40:20.414
<v Speaker 5>The hidden.</v>

1502
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.280
<v Speaker 5>It looks like what's buried with a mummy.</v>

1503
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.173
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

1504
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.330
<v Speaker 5>This is just like a god.</v>

1505
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.540
<v Speaker 5>If they unbury the uncovered this 2000 years from now,</v>

1506
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.851
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

1507
00:40:28.851 --> 00:40:29.684
<v Speaker 5>what was this?</v>

1508
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:32.240
<v Speaker 5>This was like an error made and they came in here and we're like,</v>

1509
00:40:32.241 --> 00:40:32.541
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1510
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:33.350
<v Speaker 5>these treasures,</v>

1511
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.290
<v Speaker 5>these must be treasuries.</v>

1512
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.320
<v Speaker 5>This is all a mixture of my message.</v>

1513
00:40:36.321 --> 00:40:39.860
<v Speaker 5>Must have been a collector pile all this together and this is my message.</v>

1514
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.140
<v Speaker 5>Well you know if they like you look around my house,</v>

1515
00:40:42.141 --> 00:40:43.610
<v Speaker 5>I collect like a lot of weird shit.</v>

1516
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.740
<v Speaker 5>I can see you buying that giant hood,</v>

1517
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.971
<v Speaker 5>putting it somewhere.</v>

1518
00:40:46.971 --> 00:40:47.910
<v Speaker 5>I probably would if you,</v>

1519
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.730
<v Speaker 5>if you weren't here and if you didn't make fun of it,</v>

1520
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.433
<v Speaker 5>but it saved me,</v>

1521
00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.540
<v Speaker 5>saved me from a ridiculous purchase.</v>

1522
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.330
<v Speaker 5>Ebay does get me,</v>

1523
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 5>it's like five grand to somebody who's going to make a purchase on something.</v>

1524
00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:00.920
<v Speaker 5>Probably it said two grand.</v>

1525
00:41:00.921 --> 00:41:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Now if it's on Ebay grant already,</v>

1526
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.470
<v Speaker 5>it'll probably jack up the,</v>

1527
00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:09.050
<v Speaker 5>the last day they say on Ebay is where it really all goes going to go in five</v>

1528
00:41:09.051 --> 00:41:09.884
<v Speaker 5>seconds.</v>

1529
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.290
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

1530
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.950
<v Speaker 5>They have these things where like Ebay sniping,</v>

1531
00:41:12.951 --> 00:41:13.820
<v Speaker 5>I think it's what it's called,</v>

1532
00:41:13.821 --> 00:41:15.140
<v Speaker 5>where it's like people that,</v>

1533
00:41:15.141 --> 00:41:18.350
<v Speaker 5>I think there are programs that automatically sit there and at the last second</v>

1534
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.720
<v Speaker 5>just throw in like real fast math,</v>

1535
00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.790
<v Speaker 5>math to like try to beat it real quick.</v>

1536
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.690
<v Speaker 5>Wow Dude.</v>

1537
00:41:23.691 --> 00:41:25.940
<v Speaker 5>That kind of stuff kind of freaks me out.</v>

1538
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Like little little bots and little things and people are incorporated on the web</v>

1539
00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 5>so you can</v>

1540
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.490
<v Speaker 3>automatically bid at the last second we anything like that or people automate</v>

1541
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1542
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:43.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you open up the door for hoax stirs and Tunis and,</v>

1543
00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 3>and coders and people know how to tweak things and you know,</v>

1544
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:47.361
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1545
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:48.720
<v Speaker 3>remember when you used to play online?</v>

1546
00:41:48.721 --> 00:41:51.480
<v Speaker 3>If here just play quake online and people would get bought,</v>

1547
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.633
<v Speaker 3>drink,</v>

1548
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:53.933
<v Speaker 3>drank,</v>

1549
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.510
<v Speaker 3>you know what a bot is and it's bullshit.</v>

1550
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Or a Bot is like sort of your plot.</v>

1551
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.113
<v Speaker 3>Here's what it is.</v>

1552
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:05.420
<v Speaker 3>There's artificial intelligence involved in quake and they figured out a way to,</v>

1553
00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 3>when they make the game,</v>

1554
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.090
<v Speaker 3>it's a d first person shooters.</v>

1555
00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 3>So you're running through all these crazy corridors and you see other characters</v>

1556
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 3>in there and you shoot at each other,</v>

1557
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.151
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1558
00:42:14.151 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1559
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at it through your own perspective.</v>

1560
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.691
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

1561
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:18.051
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1562
00:42:18.051 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 3>when they make these,</v>

1563
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:19.341
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1564
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:19.671
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1565
00:42:19.671 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 3>these video games,</v>

1566
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 3>you can have one of these artificial intelligence people and just insert them</v>

1567
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 3>into the game and yeah.</v>

1568
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:28.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1569
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 3>you can also have,</v>

1570
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.390
<v Speaker 3>you could have it set up so you never miss.</v>

1571
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 3>You can have a Bot that just knows,</v>

1572
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.600
<v Speaker 3>see it read the code.</v>

1573
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.071
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1574
00:42:37.071 --> 00:42:37.904
<v Speaker 3>Nice cheating.</v>

1575
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 3>He reads the code and it knows absolutely exactly where your character is at all</v>

1576
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:43.190
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1577
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.110
<v Speaker 3>So every time you press the launch button,</v>

1578
00:42:45.111 --> 00:42:45.950
<v Speaker 3>you cannot miss,</v>

1579
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1580
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.890
<v Speaker 3>So you're just killing people in like three seconds.</v>

1581
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:49.724
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you see them,</v>

1582
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.890
<v Speaker 3>and I've played with people like this online and it's like,</v>

1583
00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:52.641
<v Speaker 3>it's really frustrating.</v>

1584

<v Speaker 1>One of the first</v>

1803
00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.070
<v Speaker 6>when the first threads I ever did on your message board ways.</v>

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:00.810
<v Speaker 6>my sister,</v>

1807
00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:01.560

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.060
<v Speaker 6>she went to this haunted house,</v>

<v Speaker 6>a famous haunted house in West Virginia and they stayed at,</v>

1810
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.330
<v Speaker 6>and she took a photo using our camera and one of the first things I ever posted</v>

1811
00:48:09.331 --> 00:48:14.130
<v Speaker 6>on your form was like these photos because it actually had like a person that</v>

1812
00:48:14.131 --> 00:48:17.760
<v Speaker 6>looked like a ghost standing on the porch and it was fucking creepy.</v>

1813
00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:18.960
<v Speaker 6>And I've been trying to find that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it shows these little circular things that look like it's probably dust in the</v>

1856
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:20.450
<v Speaker 1>air and cashes the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But people are convinced that it's like positive spirits.</v>

1866
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 1>that positive energy actually manifests itself in these fears but that you</v>

1867
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:46.181
<v Speaker 1>cannot see it.</v>

1868

<v Speaker 1>Cause they say if you talk to the people who really believe in it and Bravo they</v>

1872
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.110
<v Speaker 1>say that it when it shows up,</v>

1873
00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 1>when you have positive thoughts and positive energy and I've seen some pictures,</v>

1874
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I've received your really interesting pictures of like people happy smiling and</v>

1875
00:50:07.451 --> 00:50:10.330
<v Speaker 1>they're holding their hands up and there's orbs all around,</v>

1876
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 1>all of their photo but it also could be lent.</v>

1877
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Has it ever been a picture of somebody's happy it does</v>

1878
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:19.920
<v Speaker 6>and dust and stuff.</v>

1879
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:20.411
<v Speaker 6>But there,</v>

1880
00:50:20.411 --> 00:50:24.570
<v Speaker 6>there is definitely a lot of weird shit that happens in photos that aren't,</v>

1881
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.650
<v Speaker 6>that isn't dust.</v>

1882
00:50:25.651 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 6>But the problem is is that thinks</v>

1883
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.671
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

1884
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 4>it means it's a ghost.</v>

1885
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:30.644
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be out.</v>

1886
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:32.901
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of which,</v>

1887
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:37.010
<v Speaker 4>have you guys heard about this new Photoshop thing that removes the Biller?</v>

1888
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:38.790
<v Speaker 4>How's that takes up?</v>

1889
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.680
<v Speaker 4>If you take a photo saying it feels it's like a blurry photo,</v>

1890
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:48.010
<v Speaker 4>it can calculate where each image went wrong and how it all stretched out and</v>

1891
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:50.080
<v Speaker 4>they could turn it into an unbeliever.</v>

1892
00:50:50.081 --> 00:50:51.700
<v Speaker 4>He picture would,</v>

1893
00:50:51.701 --> 00:50:52.500
<v Speaker 4>it pretty much looks,</v>

1894
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.360
<v Speaker 4>it looks at the photo and does its math,</v>

1895
00:50:55.361 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 4>like how the blur is and it finds the path that like if you're holding the</v>

1896
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 4>camera and you first what it would have been.</v>

1897
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.271
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1898
00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 4>like if you're holding the camera,</v>

1899
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:05.780
<v Speaker 4>you're taking a photo and it goes a little right there.</v>

1900
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 4>It can see that in the camera by the blur.</v>

1901
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:13.400
<v Speaker 4>The blur is and so it tries to reverse that and straighten it back together and</v>

1902
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 4>it works really well.</v>

1903
00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 4>If one of my favorite things on the iPhone is when you open up a picture and it</v>

1904
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:18.951
<v Speaker 4>opens up,</v>

1905
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's this blurry for a second and you're like,</v>

1906
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:20.841
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1907
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:21.674
<v Speaker 4>I can already see it.</v>

1908
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.010
<v Speaker 4>Let's see it better and it gets all clear.</v>

1909
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.851
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1910
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:26.750
<v Speaker 4>I love that feeling.</v>

1911
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1912
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.453
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>

1913
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 4>You guys should definitely upgrade to the cloud thing.</v>

1914
00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:31.311
<v Speaker 4>It's nice.</v>

1915
00:51:31.311 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 4>I can now look at every photo like on my home computer right now.</v>

1916
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.700
<v Speaker 4>And you know those dreams,</v>

1917
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.910
<v Speaker 4>everything from your home computer constantly,</v>

1918
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:39.920
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>

1919
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean if you lose your phone,</v>

1920
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:42.770
<v Speaker 4>someone's going to see all your Dick Pictures?</v>

1921
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1922
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:44.420
<v Speaker 4>final?</v>

1923
00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1924
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.871
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1925
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 4>Cause you have brass farms,</v>

1926
00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 4>you have a password lock on it.</v>

1927
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.253
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

1928
00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:49.790
<v Speaker 4>I just found out about this program.</v>

1929
00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1930
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 4>I can't find it yet and I can't remember the name.</v>

1931
00:51:52.371 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 4>But there's this program that you could put on your iPhone that if somebody gets</v>

1932
00:51:55.701 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 4>the pass code wrong,</v>

1933
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 4>it will automatically take a photo of the,</v>

1934
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.520
<v Speaker 4>of the using the front camera.</v>

1935
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.310
<v Speaker 4>And so then if you lose it then you can track it.</v>

1936
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:05.780
<v Speaker 4>Also using Google maps,</v>

1937
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.320
<v Speaker 4>you can play alarms that you can have a recorded from your computer.</v>

1938
00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:11.180
<v Speaker 4>I know you've got my phone.</v>

1939
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:11.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1940
00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:12.680
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the name of it.</v>

1941
00:52:12.681 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 4>So from your computer at home,</v>

1942
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.130
<v Speaker 4>but you control it from a mobile money account or whatever it is.</v>

1943
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1944
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.170
<v Speaker 4>So it's in the iCloud.</v>

1945
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.153
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1946

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1947
00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the name though.</v>

1948
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cycle is how much a guy can get away with not using a condom.</v>

2013
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:11.663
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2014
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 1>So when she's closer to obviating,</v>

2015
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe like three condoms owners on the picture they've gun or something.</v>

2016
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.050
<v Speaker 1>And then when they,</v>

2017
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:19.590
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

2018
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.600
<v Speaker 1>whenever the time is when you just totally not fertile,</v>

2020
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Condoms are the grossest things of all time.</v>

2021
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I really even,</v>

2022
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2023
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:29.610
<v Speaker 1>they're necessary,</v>

2024
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.473
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

2025
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but it Christ stupid fucking rubber sword over your dick feel like ridiculous</v>

2026
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:38.880
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

2027
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:40.110
<v Speaker 1>We're so gross though.</v>

2028
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:40.771
<v Speaker 1>We so gross.</v>

2029
00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:43.170
<v Speaker 1>We give each other Kudos through our dicks pussies.</v>

2030
00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:45.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2031
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not just an issue of Islam is an issue of making people,</v>

2032
00:54:48.481 --> 00:54:51.540
<v Speaker 1>which is most certainly a fucking issue because there's a lot of people you</v>

2033
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 1>fucked that you don't want to make people with.</v>

2034
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a dirty God damn trick of nature that we need to fix pronto.</v>

2035
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:57.810
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2036
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Instead of trying to fucking get rid of the Fed,</v>

2037
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.080
<v Speaker 1>listen and let's try to fix that.</v>

2038
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to fix this fucking equals making people thing about that equals man,</v>

2039
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.231
<v Speaker 1>fuck for fun.</v>

2040
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And then if you want to make people,</v>

2041
00:55:08.641 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to be able to turn something off.</v>

2042
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:11.280
<v Speaker 1>It should be a better person.</v>

2043
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I was really considering it a sec to me the other day,</v>

2044
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.780
<v Speaker 1>which is like 10 minutes of serious thought into it.</v>

2045
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:17.230
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

2046
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.230
<v Speaker 1>You don't want kids if you don't want kids.</v>

2047
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:20.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2048
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.890
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst things that could happen to me right now cause I get someone</v>

2049
00:55:22.891 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>

2050
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2051
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.100
<v Speaker 1>so why would it be crazy?</v>

2052
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Like cheaper to own a gun.</v>

2053
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Have you been Joe?</v>

2054
00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:29.911
<v Speaker 1>Have you say that?</v>

2055
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:30.900
<v Speaker 1>But you know what man,</v>

2056
00:55:30.901 --> 00:55:31.740
<v Speaker 1>it sounds crazy,</v>

2057
00:55:31.741 --> 00:55:34.800
<v Speaker 1>but if you haven't checked that you were really into and you had a little ori</v>

2058
00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 1>hanging around you,</v>

2059
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.720
<v Speaker 1>you would love a fucking love it.</v>

2060
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 1>You would love it in a way that I couldn't even describe to you.</v>

2061
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a huge commitment and a huge time eater.</v>

2062
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just got to meet the right guy.</v>

2063
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.493
<v Speaker 1>And what if it was,</v>

2064
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.140
<v Speaker 1>what if it was to girl?</v>

2065
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 1>That's not the issue going and it's not cool enough to get rid of it.</v>

2066
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I have several friends that have children with people they don't like.</v>

2067
00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch of people in that situation and it's a sad situation.</v>

2068
00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.311
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

2069
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst thing that could happen to me right now.</v>

2070
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2071
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:02.500
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't mean that you're,</v>

2072
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I wish there was a reversible way cause that's the only negative is okay.</v>

2073
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.250
<v Speaker 1>At some point I want to do this,</v>

2074
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 1>but somebody who I believe there is,</v>

2075
00:56:09.691 --> 00:56:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's new technology that they uh,</v>

2076
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.830
<v Speaker 1>they attach a clip and it basically pinches off your,</v>

2077
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 1>where your dick sauce comes out like over a Doritos bag and I don't know how it</v>

2078
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:21.391
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

2079
00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:23.470
<v Speaker 1>but your body just sort of reabsorbs it.</v>

2080
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2081
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2082
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.001
<v Speaker 3>your loads are all,</v>

2083
00:56:25.001 --> 00:56:25.870

2084
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 3>a gigantic thing of sperm.</v>

2085
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:30.610
<v Speaker 3>The next time when you open up the flood gates,</v>

2086
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:31.840
<v Speaker 3>it must be one super,</v>

2087
00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.461
<v Speaker 3>super.</v>

2088
00:56:32.461 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2089
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.520

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 3>pushing forth fucking armies and John laying carpet,</v>

2092
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:40.320
<v Speaker 3>new carpet.</v>

2093
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.153

2094
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.570

2096
00:56:45.821 --> 00:56:49.030
<v Speaker 3>you first go into a apartment when they've just done it on you and laying the</v>

2097
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:49.864
<v Speaker 3>carpet down.</v>

2098
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.153
<v Speaker 3>I like smells,</v>

2099
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.260
<v Speaker 3>smells like it should.</v>

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:54.610
<v Speaker 3>It's the most clean.</v>

2153
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:56.730
<v Speaker 3>they moved from their location.</v>

2154
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:58.180
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't the original location.</v>

2155
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Now their religion location was downstairs.</v>

2179
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want to it.</v>

2216
00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.973

2232
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.460

2233
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2234
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2235
00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:53.871
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to.</v>

2236
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to tell him I couldn't do this.</v>

2237
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I have to do a podcast.</v>

2238
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I had to talk to him real quick resident.</v>

2239
00:59:58.790 --> 00:59:59.481
<v Speaker 1>Was it the president?</v>

2240
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Was that Obama?</v>

2241
01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Have you been following the latest news now on what a bond is killing us all at</v>

2242
01:00:04.411 --> 01:00:05.300
<v Speaker 1>the raping her children.</v>

2243
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Medical Marijuana.</v>

2244
01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>It's so pathetic there.</v>

2245
01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>They're going after medical marijuana like on an aggressive way and not,</v>

2246
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:14.691
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

2247
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:15.524
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

2248
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2249
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2250
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2251
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I just want to know if this is the attorney general or if it's Obama or the</v>

2252
01:00:20.971 --> 01:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>state's attorneys,</v>

2253
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>like a bodiless day.</v>

2254
01:00:22.781 --> 01:00:23.011
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2255
01:00:23.011 --> 01:00:28.011
<v Speaker 1>go for it changed its stance and the stance was originally that they would only</v>

2256
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>go after people who violated both state and federal law.</v>

2257
01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

2258
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.281
<v Speaker 1>Your phone is off.</v>

2259
01:00:36.281 --> 01:00:37.114
<v Speaker 1>The phone's off the hook.</v>

2260
01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:39.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with state and federal law is the state,</v>

2262
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:42.561
<v Speaker 1>the state law.</v>

2263
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2264
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I've seen parts of it.</v>

2265
01:00:43.821 --> 01:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It says you can't operate for profit,</v>

2266
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>which everyone sort of does and it's just sort of like what's for profit,</v>

2267
01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>what's not and that I don't think you're allowed to profit,</v>

2268
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but you're definitely allowed to make money too to actually pay for employees I</v>

2269
01:00:57.051 --> 01:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>think and things like that.</v>

2270
01:00:58.101 --> 01:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>So I think if you do do it by the book and not like some of these places,</v>

2271
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>that's also selling cocaine gets all their money to the employees.</v>

2272
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>They take some for themselves.</v>

2273
01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>

2274
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>that's why you run a business.</v>

2275
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I wish I believed them.</v>

2276
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.671
<v Speaker 1>I wish.</v>

2277
01:01:07.671 --> 01:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I believe that when they were really doing was eradicating the evil people who</v>

2278
01:01:10.711 --> 01:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>were a part of this peaceful medical and medical marijuana scene,</v>

2279
01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>peaceful and helpful medical marijuana scene and what we're going to do is just</v>

2280
01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>eradicate the the ones that are problems.</v>

2281
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2282
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>But if you really were caring about people,</v>

2283
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you would concentrate on first.</v>

2284
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:23.871
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2285
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't concentrate on people distributing marijuana even if they were</v>

2286
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>doing it illegally.</v>

2287
01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

2288
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>They're getting good stuff out to people illegally making me not have to go to a</v>

2289
01:01:32.251 --> 01:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>shitty part of town or deal with some sort of criminal behavior to get the same</v>

2290
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2291
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2292
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes a matter of priorities when it comes to law enforcement like you</v>

2293
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>incompetent fucks.</v>

2294
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Like why are you paying attention to this?</v>

2295
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>This is a non issue that hurts no one and you're paying attention to,</v>

2296
01:01:49.881 --> 01:01:50.714
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

2297
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>You know what think might happen?</v>

2298
01:01:51.861 --> 01:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I think this might get it legalized in California if they start</v>

2299
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>closing the box wrong.</v>

2300
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I think the potter did that point come and go like,</v>

2301
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.451
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2302
01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2303
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:00.923
<v Speaker 1>we don't have,</v>

2304
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>but the issue is still stands.</v>

2305
01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not a stuck,</v>

2306
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a federal issue.</v>

2307
01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It was what you don't understand the federal government,</v>

2308
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whatever the state chooses is still,</v>

2309
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 1>they're shutting down everywhere in America.</v>

2310
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Well they're first starting supposedly supposedly starting in San Diego cause I</v>

2311
01:02:16.311 --> 01:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>guess San Diego is like one of those areas where everyone around it,</v>

2312
01:02:19.711 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a</v>

2313
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 4>very high,</v>

2314
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2315
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 4>like people don't want it there as much as very conservative.</v>

2316
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.430
<v Speaker 4>You go to her to make them open cell.</v>

2317
01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 4>And so what now they're doing is they're attacking the,</v>

2318
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:28.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2319
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 4>publications and like,</v>

2320
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 4>like newspapers and,</v>

2321
01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:33.860
<v Speaker 4>and for advertising it,</v>

2322
01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.240
<v Speaker 4>because supposedly there's like this ridiculous law.</v>

2323
01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:41.241
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not allowed to advertise anything that's illegal or illegal drugs.</v>

2324
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 4>You can't advertise cigarettes.</v>

2325
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 4>And I'm in magazines anymore.</v>

2326
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2327
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.163
<v Speaker 4>You can't at all.</v>

2328
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

2329
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

2330
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.910
<v Speaker 4>I think it used to be no cartoons and a lot of people and then it was like,</v>

2331
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:51.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's just no bro whenever.</v>

2332
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.193
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2333
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Because they don't want the sort of real live with it,</v>

2334
01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:55.261
<v Speaker 4>but it's sort of harmful.</v>

2335
01:02:55.261 --> 01:02:59.340
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what the numbers are as far as p p p how much have people dropped off</v>

2336
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:00.480
<v Speaker 4>of smoking cigarettes?</v>

2337
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.773
<v Speaker 4>I've met a lot.</v>

2338
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.480
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

2339
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.313
<v Speaker 4>I bet a lot.</v>

2340
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't think kids are smoking as much.</v>

2341
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:06.443
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

2342
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 4>you can't smoke in public places.</v>

2343
01:03:08.131 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the biggest things for me,</v>

2344
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.561
<v Speaker 4>it's back in the day,</v>

2345
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:11.490
<v Speaker 4>you know you smoke cigarettes,</v>

2346
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:13.440
<v Speaker 4>you could smoke in restaurants,</v>

2347
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.610
<v Speaker 4>you could smoke anywhere.</v>

2348
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Now it's kind of a tenure brand.</v>

2349
01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.000
<v Speaker 4>It can be a lot more peer pressure moments.</v>

2350
01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:18.863
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2351
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.003
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2352
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.130
<v Speaker 4>People still smoke,</v>

2353
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.490
<v Speaker 4>but I have no idea if it's less or more people.</v>

2354
01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:25.863
<v Speaker 3>This question,</v>

2355
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 3>according to that article in La Times for 2007 American smoking rates declined</v>

2356
01:03:31.331 --> 01:03:36.331
<v Speaker 3>in the seven years leading up to 2004 but remained steady from 2004 to 2007</v>

2357
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.751
<v Speaker 3>moms.</v>

2358
01:03:37.751 --> 01:03:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Largely due to a cut in funding for smoke prevention programs and the things</v>

2359
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:42.550
<v Speaker 3>that works.</v>

2360
01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:42.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:03:42.971 --> 01:03:47.971
<v Speaker 3>Tobacco industry doubling its marketing spending just to keep it even.</v>

2362
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2363
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't Ling tumbling since 1997 tobacco consumption in developing countries has</v>

2364
01:03:54.881 --> 01:03:59.590
<v Speaker 3>increased at an annual rate of 1.7% according to the UN Food and Agricultural</v>

2365
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Organization.</v>

2366
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.521
<v Speaker 3>The key,</v>

2367
01:04:00.521 --> 01:04:01.510
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>

2368
01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.600
<v Speaker 3>is that heavy marketing from the tobacco industry has cow.</v>

2369
01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2370
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.083
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2371
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.083
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2372
01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.790
<v Speaker 3>It seems like steadied off when this study was made whenever I'm 2007 but</v>

2373
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:13.551
<v Speaker 4>when I was growing up,</v>

2374
01:04:13.551 --> 01:04:14.270
<v Speaker 4>my first high school,</v>

2375
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:16.400
<v Speaker 4>there was no question I would not be smoking.</v>

2376
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.151
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

2377
01:04:17.151 --> 01:04:17.984
<v Speaker 4>I've never tried that.</v>

2378
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.550
<v Speaker 4>Rarely do you meet other kids and you're like,</v>

2379
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.200
<v Speaker 4>oh well they're sort of normal and they do it.</v>

2380
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2381
01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.813
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I could.</v>

2382
01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2383
01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.021
<v Speaker 4>I mean taking classes,</v>

2384
01:04:24.021 --> 01:04:24.854
<v Speaker 4>I would smoke.</v>

2385
01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.300
<v Speaker 4>I would go outside and smoke.</v>

2386
01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.760
<v Speaker 4>Really in high school.</v>

2387
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:27.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2388
01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.960
<v Speaker 4>We had this bridge that we can just crawl underneath.</v>

2389
01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:31.930
<v Speaker 4>You kind of watch out for your health,</v>

2390
01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:32.764
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2391
01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.770
<v Speaker 4>That's why I freaked out and we w</v>

2392
01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.140
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2393
01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.680
<v Speaker 3>we have to talk about this in the podcast because so many people got attached to</v>

2394
01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:40.514
<v Speaker 3>it on Twitter.</v>

2395
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Our last a podcast we did,</v>

2396
01:04:42.711 --> 01:04:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Brian and I have little hissy fit because,</v>

2397
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.990
<v Speaker 3>well I was tired and I was,</v>

2398
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.790
<v Speaker 3>I was tired and uh,</v>

2399
01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I had been working a lot and um,</v>

2400
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.570
<v Speaker 3>I had a short fuse and Brian was hammered</v>

2401
01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.610
<v Speaker 4>and that was hammered because I've been doing this juice diet and on the way the</v>

2402
01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.453
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

2403
01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:03.260
<v Speaker 4>So I wake up and I go to bed and I have juice and so like I was in the car and</v>

2404
01:05:03.261 --> 01:05:04.400
<v Speaker 4>it awesome so far it's like,</v>

2405
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.234
<v Speaker 4>let's drink.</v>

2406
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.660
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

2407
01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:06.080
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2408
01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:06.680
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2409
01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.850
<v Speaker 4>So we got like all this beer.</v>

2410
01:05:07.851 --> 01:05:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I had like three or four beers and by the fourth beer I,</v>

2411
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I was so to the,</v>

2412
01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:12.890
<v Speaker 4>have you listened to my voice?</v>

2413
01:05:12.891 --> 01:05:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I could barely talk.</v>

2414
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.310
<v Speaker 4>I have no protein in me except everyone.</v>

2415
01:05:16.311 --> 01:05:16.790
<v Speaker 4>You'd honestly,</v>

2416
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:17.391
<v Speaker 4>you're not slurring.</v>

2417
01:05:17.391 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 4>There's the way you always talk</v>

2418
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.643
<v Speaker 3>that is used.</v>

2419
01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:23.030
<v Speaker 3>Brian gets pie.</v>

2420
01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd everyone always like,</v>

2421
01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:26.520
<v Speaker 3>what does he never wants you to draw?</v>

2422
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else I talked to.</v>

2423
01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:30.500
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2424
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.061
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>

2425
01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:31.894
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking,</v>

2426
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.720
<v Speaker 6>I just happen off a beer and like you get slurry fast.</v>

2427
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you really think it has something to do with that carbon monoxide poisoning</v>

2428
01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:42.390
<v Speaker 3>and you have no idea that really,</v>

2429
01:05:42.391 --> 01:05:44.550
<v Speaker 3>do you really think that you think about that every now and then?</v>

2430
01:05:44.551 --> 01:05:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Did that,</v>

2431
01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:46.163
<v Speaker 6>do you know,</v>

2432
01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.550
<v Speaker 6>looking back at it,</v>

2433
01:05:47.551 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 6>it seems what I,</v>

2434
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.590
<v Speaker 6>I guess you'd say the story again.</v>

2435
01:05:52.591 --> 01:05:54.510
<v Speaker 6>I rented out when I was in college.</v>

2436
01:05:54.511 --> 01:05:57.060
<v Speaker 6>I had this place and I had the top room,</v>

2437
01:05:57.061 --> 01:05:58.170
<v Speaker 6>which was like the attic,</v>

2438
01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.080
<v Speaker 6>but it was bad at it.</v>

2439
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.210
<v Speaker 6>So I was like brick walls.</v>

2440
01:06:00.211 --> 01:06:02.650
<v Speaker 6>It was really bad as it was a carbon monoxide was looking at them,</v>

2441
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:06.930
<v Speaker 6>a brick walls on one site and then would shitty windows on the other side.</v>

2442
01:06:06.931 --> 01:06:08.040
<v Speaker 6>And it was drafty.</v>

2443
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.050
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2444
01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:09.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2445
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:13.170
<v Speaker 6>there was only one heat vent that came out of this brick that,</v>

2446
01:06:13.171 --> 01:06:16.170
<v Speaker 6>that I had my bed right underneath cause I lived in Ohio,</v>

2447
01:06:16.171 --> 01:06:17.160
<v Speaker 6>so it's fucking cold.</v>

2448
01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.120
<v Speaker 6>And so like the heat would just come out of this event and warm up the whole</v>

2449
01:06:21.121 --> 01:06:21.691
<v Speaker 6>entire room.</v>

2450
01:06:21.691 --> 01:06:22.490
<v Speaker 6>So yeah.</v>

2451
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:23.323
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2452
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:24.510
<v Speaker 6>when I was moving out,</v>

2453
01:06:24.511 --> 01:06:25.530
<v Speaker 6>the landlord was like,</v>

2454
01:06:25.531 --> 01:06:25.711
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2455
01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:27.480
<v Speaker 6>going through to make sure I didn't destroy anything.</v>

2456
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.531
<v Speaker 6>And they go,</v>

2457
01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:28.801
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

2458
01:06:28.801 --> 01:06:29.031
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

2461
01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:30.991
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2462

<v Speaker 6>And they're like,</v>

2464
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.691
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2465
01:06:33.691 --> 01:06:35.040
<v Speaker 6>that's the carbon dioxide,</v>

2466
01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:35.470
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2467
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:36.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2468
01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.721
<v Speaker 6>furnace,</v>

2469
01:06:36.721 --> 01:06:37.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2470
01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:39.420
<v Speaker 6>output take that's supposed to be covered up.</v>

2471
01:06:39.421 --> 01:06:39.601
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2472
01:06:39.601 --> 01:06:42.280
<v Speaker 6>it's supposed to be like a chimney exhaust.</v>

2473
01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:43.883
<v Speaker 6>Those two,</v>

2474
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.600
<v Speaker 6>I cooked his brain.</v>

2475
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.490
<v Speaker 6>I found that's why you slur.</v>

2476
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.110
<v Speaker 6>He says he used to be able to talk better.</v>

2477
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.033
<v Speaker 6>I think I,</v>

2478
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.040
<v Speaker 6>I think it will.</v>

2479
01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:51.270
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

2480
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:52.980
<v Speaker 6>I think how I originally said it was like,</v>

2481
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:53.461
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2482
01:06:53.461 --> 01:06:53.881
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2483
01:06:53.881 --> 01:06:57.480
<v Speaker 6>I think it definitely made me have a slight little stutter or a little thing.</v>

2484
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:58.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it drastic,</v>

2485
01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:01.380
<v Speaker 6>dramatically changed anything over Manasseh.</v>

2486
01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.190
<v Speaker 6>Lauren,</v>

2487

2489
01:07:04.631 --> 01:07:08.020
<v Speaker 3>That is that you just said that you think that sleeping in this house,</v>

2490
01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.850
<v Speaker 3>it might've given you a certain stutter.</v>

2491

<v Speaker 3>an idea that somebody had on the message board and it was a very astute idea.</v>

2526
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:54.620
<v Speaker 3>And the guy said that when you write and you get used to writing things,</v>

01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:11.330
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what it is.</v>

2866
01:16:11.331 --> 01:16:12.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like beaten.</v>

2867
01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't just keep beating every,</v>

2868
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.871
<v Speaker 1>every host.</v>

2869
01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:17.201
<v Speaker 1>Just be like,</v>

2870
01:16:17.201 --> 01:16:17.381
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2871
01:16:17.381 --> 01:16:17.771
<v Speaker 1>that's nice guy.</v>

2872
01:16:17.771 --> 01:16:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Really funny and at some point when I,</v>

2873
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I never said that because I'm like,</v>

2874
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:23.480
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to believe me after you say five times in a row and say this</v>

2875
01:16:23.481 --> 01:16:24.880
<v Speaker 1>guy and the worst things ever,</v>

2876
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:26.170
<v Speaker 1>unless the guy's really funny.</v>

2877
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2878
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Never say he's really fun.</v>

2879
01:16:27.641 --> 01:16:28.281
<v Speaker 1>Then one time,</v>

2880
01:16:28.281 --> 01:16:28.410
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2881
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:28.811
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

2882
01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:29.051
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2883
01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I know there's been a shit show.</v>

2884
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It's been madness of homeless people right now,</v>

2885
01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but this guy is funny.</v>

2886
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:34.293
<v Speaker 1>You can say that.</v>

2887
01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2888
01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.093
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2889
01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:37.600
<v Speaker 1>They would get so hard.</v>

2890
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I used to have to host that like years.</v>

2891
01:16:39.731 --> 01:16:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I would host such very good for your act.</v>

2892
01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2893
01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.480
<v Speaker 1>It was for yours and how to apply.</v>

2894
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.090
<v Speaker 1>It helped you as a Freddy said the first time you went to let me do it.</v>

2895
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:46.391
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2896
01:16:46.391 --> 01:16:47.560
<v Speaker 1>if she lets you do it more than once,</v>

2897
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.400
<v Speaker 1>watch how much quicker it makes her onstage.</v>

2898
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:51.221
<v Speaker 1>Every three minutes.</v>

2899
01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I got to get back up there and start thinking of something to get the crowd</v>

2900
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 1>going away and you also learn how to manage the room,</v>

2901
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:58.690
<v Speaker 1>becomes sort of a social manager.</v>

2902
01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Keep all these people,</v>

2903
01:17:00.251 --> 01:17:01.084
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2904
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I have to keep doing like in between everybody to make him laugh at 30 seconds</v>

2905
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:07.770
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to make them laugh fast and then bring on the next awful</v>

2906
01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:08.481
<v Speaker 1>awful,</v>

2907
01:17:08.481 --> 01:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>awful types from actually used to love comics.</v>

2908
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:11.931
<v Speaker 1>Like boom,</v>

2909
01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Shaka Laka who would go on in drag with a bucket on his head and you know what?</v>

2910
01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:19.490
<v Speaker 1>At least he got the crowd going and you see how the crowd at least after him,</v>

2911
01:17:19.491 --> 01:17:19.941
<v Speaker 1>like he'd be like,</v>

2912
01:17:19.941 --> 01:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>keep that going for the next guy.</v>

2913
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.550
<v Speaker 1>But didn't you ever want to just sterilize that fucking microphone after you're</v>

2914
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.393
<v Speaker 1>done?</v>

2915
01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:26.883
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2916
01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:28.283
<v Speaker 1>I still worse.</v>

2917
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2918
01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.140
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the worst thing ever.</v>

2919
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I totally forget to when I'm like,</v>

2920
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.070
<v Speaker 1>oh I just touched my</v>

2921
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.271
<v Speaker 1>microphone.</v>

2922
01:17:37.271 --> 01:17:38.990
<v Speaker 1>That'll never gets clean.</v>

2923
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

2924
01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And they don't find new ones.</v>

2925
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

2926
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.380
<v Speaker 1>They've been there for a while.</v>

2927
01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:44.121
<v Speaker 1>One that's there.</v>

2928
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the one that I bought.</v>

2929
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.960
<v Speaker 1>It has to a blown up completely before they replaced that cheap content,</v>

2930
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.580
<v Speaker 1>just sucking that shit out of it.</v>

2931
01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I've always found my,</v>

2932
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.610
<v Speaker 1>and I think about it later,</v>

2933
01:17:55.611 --> 01:17:56.444
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2934
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.760
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible cause it smells.</v>

2935
01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes even through the night enough people have the little spittle laying on</v>

2936
01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:04.540
<v Speaker 1>it just thinks,</v>

2937
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.691
<v Speaker 1>damn.</v>

2938
01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I was going to talk about,</v>

2939
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.460
<v Speaker 1>oh this,</v>

2940
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I read some fucking studies as strangers study that I've ever read and it's a</v>

2941
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:17.350
<v Speaker 1>bunch of scientists that are convinced that there is no free will and that the</v>

2942
01:18:19.431 --> 01:18:24.431
<v Speaker 1>moment you decide and make up your mind to do something in reality,</v>

2943
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you had already decided several seconds before this,</v>

2944
01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:29.014
<v Speaker 1>she talks about those,</v>

2945
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:30.620
<v Speaker 1>did you talks about it?</v>

2946
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:30.981
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2947
01:18:30.981 --> 01:18:32.560
<v Speaker 1>the thing is you can't tell yourself up.</v>

2948
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Think of an elephant like what made you say to yourself,</v>

2949
01:18:35.391 --> 01:18:37.160
<v Speaker 1>think of an elephant you're making,</v>

2950
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you're making.</v>

2951
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:39.290
<v Speaker 1>There is no independent thought.</v>

2952
01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.830
<v Speaker 1>It's cool and I really don't fully understand it because a lot of what I</v>

2953
01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 1>understand about it could be completely opposite from the way my take on it</v>

2954
01:18:47.061 --> 01:18:48.020
<v Speaker 1>because I thought about it.</v>

2955
01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:48.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2956
01:18:48.261 --> 01:18:51.320
<v Speaker 1>this is a fascinating thing because you essentially have philosophers that are</v>

2957
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:56.321
<v Speaker 1>arguing with scientists and in a sense they're both right because maybe you,</v>

2958
01:18:57.410 --> 01:19:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you don't change what you're doing.</v>

2959
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe maybe you know,</v>

2960
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:04.730
<v Speaker 1>there is no real freewill,</v>

2961
01:19:04.731 --> 01:19:09.230
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's because the seven second thing that happens before you,</v>

2962
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:09.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2963
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:13.460
<v Speaker 1>you make up your mind to whatever the choice is going to be that you're gonna</v>

2964
01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:13.701
<v Speaker 1>pick.</v>

2965
01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's just a random thing,</v>

2966
01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.820
<v Speaker 1>but the results of that,</v>

2967
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what they can't measure the results or you change the way you think</v>

2968
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:26.470
<v Speaker 1>and that essentially is free will the freewill but already changed the way you</v>

2969
01:19:27.651 --> 01:19:28.020
<v Speaker 1>think they're,</v>

2970
01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:28.853
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're saying.</v>

2971
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:31.760
<v Speaker 1>They're not accounting for character.</v>

2972
01:19:31.761 --> 01:19:34.760
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it's an either or because I think that certain amount of</v>

2973
01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 1>character and certain amount of will can be developed.</v>

2974
01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And the essential question is why you develop again,</v>

2975
01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:45.620
<v Speaker 1>where you designed to develop it as just just your natural course of your life</v>

2976
01:19:46.011 --> 01:19:46.761
<v Speaker 1>that you're following,</v>

2977
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:48.350
<v Speaker 1>that you're supposed to follow anyway.</v>

2978
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:52.010
<v Speaker 1>And you are just tricking yourself into thinking these are your own decisions.</v>

2979
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:54.890
<v Speaker 1>But this is almost like laid out right where it's like you're going to make this</v>

2980
01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:55.161
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

2981
01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:56.720
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're going to struggle with it,</v>

2982
01:19:56.721 --> 01:19:57.770
<v Speaker 1>and then they come to this.</v>

2983
01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Imagine they have under further investigation,</v>

2984
01:20:01.281 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 1>they show that there really is a code that already set up picking out through</v>

2985
01:20:05.661 --> 01:20:10.661
<v Speaker 1>the air and that code is like a genetic code or like a computer code and that</v>

2986
01:20:10.951 --> 01:20:11.121
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2987
01:20:11.121 --> 01:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a wireless frequency that we're tuned into that is moving us in a very</v>

2988
01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 1>specific program to do a exactly what we do.</v>

2989
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>If this is what they're saying,</v>

2990
01:20:20.071 --> 01:20:21.540
<v Speaker 1>if they're saying that you know your,</v>

2991
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 1>your mind has made moves to to make this decision seven seconds before you</v>

2992
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 1>consciously decided that he says about God,</v>

2993
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:30.990
<v Speaker 1>where it's like if God knows what we're going to end up doing because there's no</v>

2994
01:20:30.991 --> 01:20:31.824
<v Speaker 1>time to God.</v>

2995
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2996
01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 1>In the normal concept of God,</v>

2997
01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:35.730
<v Speaker 1>then there's no free will.</v>

2998
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:36.451
<v Speaker 1>He knows what we're going to do.</v>

2999
01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:38.520
<v Speaker 1>He knows we're going to make a decision this way or that way and this is the</v>

3000
01:20:38.521 --> 01:20:38.821
<v Speaker 1>best way.</v>

3001
01:20:38.821 --> 01:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I was explained how that maybe it's not the best way of thinking about it.</v>

3002
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 1>If you go and see Jurassic Park with someone who's never seen it before and you</v>

3003
01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3004
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3005
01:20:46.231 --> 01:20:48.330
<v Speaker 1>this guy's about to get killed and then he gets killed,</v>

3006
01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:49.290
<v Speaker 1>your friend is going to be like,</v>

3007
01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:50.790
<v Speaker 1>why did you make that dinosaur to do that?</v>

3008
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't do it.</v>

3009
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 1>You just know what's going to happen.</v>

3010
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it doesn't mean you're commanding me.</v>

3011
01:20:59.130 --> 01:20:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3012
01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting concept.</v>

3013
01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:01.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3014
01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:01.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3015
01:21:01.581 --> 01:21:01.740
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3016
01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:05.610
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting concept because I want to believe that I'm in control of my</v>

3017
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.040
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3018
01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:06.990
<v Speaker 1>You want to assure,</v>

3019
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:07.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3020
01:21:07.861 --> 01:21:08.790
<v Speaker 1>and we all do,</v>

3021
01:21:08.791 --> 01:21:10.020
<v Speaker 1>but why do we,</v>

3022
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.640
<v Speaker 1>why do we want to absolutely believe that we're not just following some Howard</v>

3023
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.340
<v Speaker 1>determined pattern of behavior power.</v>

3024
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:18.091
<v Speaker 1>I want to be leaders,</v>

3025
01:21:18.091 --> 01:21:18.924
<v Speaker 1>not followers.</v>

3026
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:19.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3027
01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:19.381
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

3028
01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:20.760
<v Speaker 1>but like when you're at your best,</v>

3029
01:21:20.761 --> 01:21:21.840
<v Speaker 1>like say on stage,</v>

3030
01:21:21.841 --> 01:21:22.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3031
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:23.730
<v Speaker 1>we talk about like being in that groove,</v>

3032
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

3033
01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.680
<v Speaker 1>you're like a passenger.</v>

3034
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:27.450
<v Speaker 1>You're like riding that fucking thing,</v>

3035
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:28.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3036
01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 1>That's when you are at your best,</v>

3037
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:30.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3038
01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:30.961
<v Speaker 1>When it's not,</v>

3039
01:21:30.961 --> 01:21:32.280
<v Speaker 1>you're not really even thinking about,</v>

3040
01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:33.091
<v Speaker 1>not even in control.</v>

3041
01:21:33.091 --> 01:21:34.820
<v Speaker 1>He just sort of floating best.</v>

3042
01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Did it ever say shine?</v>

3043
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Shine?</v>

3044
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3045
01:21:37.071 --> 01:21:39.030
<v Speaker 1>The movie about the pianist that work,</v>

3046
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that goes crazy.</v>

3047
01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the guy who won the Oscar.</v>

3048
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:42.261
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3049
01:21:42.261 --> 01:21:44.190
<v Speaker 1>he did some Holocaust movie later.</v>

3050
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3051
01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3052
01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I know who you're talking about.</v>

3053
01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3054
01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.773
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3055
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.330
<v Speaker 1>The little kid one,</v>

3056
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:50.383
<v Speaker 1>he learned it,</v>

3057
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.240
<v Speaker 1>but they said when he was playing the thing and all you hear the sound drop off</v>

3058
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 1>and all you hear is the bumping of the keys,</v>

3059
01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:59.340
<v Speaker 1>the physical keys hitting his fingers,</v>

3060
01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:00.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3061
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:01.680
<v Speaker 1>cause everything goes quiet.</v>

3062
01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how it sort of feels like when you're in the zone on stage</v>

3063
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:05.040
<v Speaker 1>where it's ever,</v>

3064
01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:05.710
<v Speaker 1>you're just sort of like,</v>

3065
01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

3066
01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm saying this and those people are reacting this way.</v>

3067
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:09.451
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3068
01:22:09.451 --> 01:22:09.931
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

3069
01:22:09.931 --> 01:22:10.261
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3070
01:22:10.261 --> 01:22:11.640
<v Speaker 1>you're floating through it.</v>

3071
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.080
<v Speaker 1>You're not even conscious.</v>

3072
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:13.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3073
01:22:13.201 --> 01:22:13.531
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

3074
01:22:13.531 --> 01:22:13.791
<v Speaker 1>Look at what,</v>

3075
01:22:13.791 --> 01:22:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I just sit there and you can't even think about that too much because that'll</v>

3076
01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:18.661
<v Speaker 1>distract you.</v>

3077
01:22:18.661 --> 01:22:20.130
<v Speaker 1>But it's like you're just going on autopilot.</v>

3078
01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:20.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like boogie boarding.</v>

3079
01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You just catch away and just keep going.</v>

3080
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:22.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3081
01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:23.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3082
01:22:23.281 --> 01:22:25.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the concept of also the muse.</v>

3083
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:27.830
<v Speaker 1>The idea of creativity coming as something you tune into.</v>

3084
01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 1>It just hits you and it's all so maybe that is all really connected.</v>

3085
01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.581
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that.</v>

3086
01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:33.391
<v Speaker 1>When you get a great bit,</v>

3087
01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:33.900
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

3088
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of came to me.</v>

3089
01:22:34.801 --> 01:22:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it out of the air just comes out of the ether.</v>

3090
01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:40.800
<v Speaker 1>You have to sit yourself down to to receive it.</v>

3091
01:22:40.801 --> 01:22:41.634
<v Speaker 1>That's what you gotta do.</v>

3092
01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:42.661
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was saying.</v>

3093
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:43.494
<v Speaker 1>You should write.</v>

3094
01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:44.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3095
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 1>cause I think you have a lot of really funny ideas,</v>

3096
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:47.790
<v Speaker 1>but you keep them all in your head.</v>

3097
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3098
01:22:48.271 --> 01:22:51.360
<v Speaker 1>you bounce him out on stage and you write things down that you're going to do.</v>

3099
01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:53.370
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you wrote a blog,</v>

3100
01:22:53.371 --> 01:22:54.390
<v Speaker 1>like a funny blog,</v>

3101
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you would really get into it.</v>

3102
01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.720
<v Speaker 1>And I have some really funny shit and it would really help your stand up.</v>

3103
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.823
<v Speaker 1>It really helps your,</v>

3104
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:02.820
<v Speaker 1>your word,</v>

3105
01:23:02.821 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>you're forming sentences and it really helps your material because</v>

3106
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.341
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3107
01:23:06.341 --> 01:23:06.521
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3108
01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 3>when you sit down to write a blog,</v>

3109
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.820
<v Speaker 3>at least for me when I write,</v>

3110
01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3111
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:12.220
<v Speaker 3>I never restrict myself,</v>

3112
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3113
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:15.550
<v Speaker 3>unless I'm working on this particular bit that I'm trying to tighten up.</v>

3114
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:19.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't restrict myself to like what subject or how I'm going to do it.</v>

3115
01:23:19.241 --> 01:23:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I just start writing.</v>

3116
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Like if maybe it'll come out funny,</v>

3117
01:23:21.971 --> 01:23:23.050
<v Speaker 3>maybe it will come out creepy.</v>

3118
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.033
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it'll come out.</v>

3119
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3120
01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.900
<v Speaker 3>We just write just whatever the fuck I'm thinking and as you're writing then you</v>

3121
01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:29.141
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3122
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:29.471
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3123
01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:33.910
<v Speaker 3>it takes longer to write the word neuroscientists that it does to think of a</v>

3124
01:23:33.911 --> 01:23:34.451
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience,</v>

3125
01:23:34.451 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 3>but it makes you keep thinking about it.</v>

3126
01:23:35.861 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3127
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.110
<v Speaker 3>It makes me think about it.</v>

3128
01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:37.871
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3129
01:23:37.871 --> 01:23:42.070
<v Speaker 3>But it's almost in the ideas like it's richer in your mind as just sitting down</v>

3130
01:23:42.071 --> 01:23:42.881
<v Speaker 3>and just think,</v>

3131
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:44.530
<v Speaker 3>just thinking without actual pen.</v>

3132
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3133
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:46.570
<v Speaker 3>When you actually write things down,</v>

3134
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.660
<v Speaker 3>there's something to it I think where it enriches the,</v>

3135
01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to keep your compensation to like if you're thinking about whatever it</v>

3136
01:23:52.781 --> 01:23:52.991
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3137
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:53.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this call,</v>

3138
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.560
<v Speaker 3>we were trying to write a bit about skills without writing it down about putting</v>

3139
01:23:56.561 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 3>a pen to paper,</v>

3140
01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:00.700
<v Speaker 3>write your mind then wanders to something else and you're no longer doing the</v>

3141
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:01.510
<v Speaker 3>writing about the thing.</v>

3142
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.350
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've said it before.</v>

3143
01:24:02.351 --> 01:24:03.011
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it again.</v>

3144
01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:05.650
<v Speaker 3>That right room application is the shit.</v>

3145
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.640
<v Speaker 3>If you have a Mac,</v>

3146
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:10.440
<v Speaker 3>it's called right room and I know there's a PC a variation before,</v>

3147
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.970
<v Speaker 3>but I'm on team Mac so you can suck it.</v>

3148
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.730
<v Speaker 5>The best real world advice I got on writing came from uh,</v>

3149
01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.100
<v Speaker 5>Damon Wayans actually wants the,</v>

3150
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:17.681
<v Speaker 5>I'm starting.</v>

3151
01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:18.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3152
01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:19.230
<v Speaker 5>because people said like,</v>

3153
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.391
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3154
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:20.210
<v Speaker 5>it's so helpful.</v>

3155
01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:23.290
<v Speaker 5>So that's what the problem is in everybody's brains.</v>

3156
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.760
<v Speaker 5>There's a laziness where it's like,</v>

3157
01:24:24.761 --> 01:24:25.001
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3158
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:26.290
<v Speaker 5>but what am I going to write for an hour?</v>

3159
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.820
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm never going to fucking do that.</v>

3160
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 5>Whereas what he said in the morning,</v>

3161
01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:30.880
<v Speaker 5>before you go to work,</v>

3162
01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:33.280
<v Speaker 5>you take 10 minutes and set an alarm.</v>

3163
01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.990
<v Speaker 5>If it's 1102,</v>

3164
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:36.790
<v Speaker 5>when you're starting set of for 1113.</v>

3165
01:24:36.791 --> 01:24:38.800
<v Speaker 5>So as that next minute start to get 10 minutes,</v>

3166
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.060
<v Speaker 5>as soon as the alarm goes off,</v>

3167
01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.480
<v Speaker 5>stop writing and you always have 10 minutes,</v>

3168
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:44.590
<v Speaker 5>you can put in 10 minutes.</v>

3169
01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:45.161
<v Speaker 5>It goes,</v>

3170
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 5>one of two things happens.</v>

3171
01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.193
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

3172
01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3173
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.430
<v Speaker 5>if you do have more time,</v>

3174
01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 5>you'll keep writing if you want to.</v>

3175
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.080
<v Speaker 5>So we'll get it going already to the rest of the day.</v>

3176
01:24:53.081 --> 01:24:54.670
<v Speaker 5>You're thinking about what you're already put on paper.</v>

3177
01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.380
<v Speaker 5>So you're going to keep writing in your head.</v>

3178
01:24:56.381 --> 01:24:57.220
<v Speaker 5>You're going to keep that,</v>

3179
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:57.910
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3180
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:58.743
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3181
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.010
<v Speaker 5>the brain just pumping.</v>

3182
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:00.881
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3183
01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:03.280
<v Speaker 5>But you can always spare 10 minutes who always keep doing it.</v>

3184
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.430
<v Speaker 5>I haven't,</v>

3185
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:05.051
<v Speaker 5>let me get home.</v>

3186
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:05.980
<v Speaker 5>You can write more if you want,</v>

3187
01:25:05.981 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 5>but just every morning,</v>

3188
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:07.683
<v Speaker 5>10 minutes.</v>

3189
01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:09.370
<v Speaker 5>And it seems so foolish.</v>

3190
01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 5>If you can't put in 10 minutes.</v>

3191
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:11.343
<v Speaker 5>It does.</v>

3192
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:12.303
<v Speaker 5>And I don't</v>

3193
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:13.430
<v Speaker 3>very specific,</v>

3194
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:14.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3195
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:18.080
<v Speaker 3>set a mindset when it comes to anything that's going on in my life,</v>

3196
01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:20.030
<v Speaker 3>especially with stand up and,</v>

3197
01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.620
<v Speaker 3>and anything creative.</v>

3198
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:23.090
<v Speaker 3>If I'm not writing,</v>

3199
01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I never completely feel in the zone.</v>

3200
01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Like I will have to sit myself down.</v>

3201
01:25:28.251 --> 01:25:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Like if I have like a gig coming up,</v>

3202
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:34.490
<v Speaker 3>like let's say I'm doing a theater and the weekend I have to sit myself down and</v>

3203
01:25:34.491 --> 01:25:35.324
<v Speaker 3>write something.</v>

3204
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I have to sit myself down and get that part of my brain just crank it up.</v>

3205
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:41.061
<v Speaker 3>Here's an idea,</v>

3206
01:25:41.061 --> 01:25:42.200
<v Speaker 3>here's something I'm working on.</v>

3207
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Even if I don't talk about that on stage,</v>

3208
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.240
<v Speaker 3>but you're still,</v>

3209
01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 3>the fact that I'm working on new shit just puts you in a better mood.</v>

3210
01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Better brain move.</v>

3211
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Makes me feel productive.</v>

3212
01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.670
<v Speaker 3>It makes me feel like I'm,</v>

3213
01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3214
01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:55.241
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3215
01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting out what I'm neat when I'm supposed to put out.</v>

3216
01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:02.280
<v Speaker 3>I believe you also feel like confident or like a winner because you wrote and so</v>

3217
01:26:02.281 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>that helps your that's yeah.</v>

3218
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Well I think when you do what you know you're supposed to feel like a loser.</v>

3219
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I got made a non paid regular.</v>

3220
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Mitzi and maybe just like I was allowed to do belly room shows or something.</v>

3221
01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3222
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>But my sets around town over my expert just killer for like three weeks,</v>

3223
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 1>cause I felt like I'm a real comic.</v>

3224
01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3225
01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.720
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't make my writing any better.</v>

3226
01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I was still doing the same jokes.</v>

3227
01:26:21.681 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And they have told me that when he got his black belt from February see over</v>

3230
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.240
<v Speaker 1>And Ryan Parson said that too.</v>

3231
01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:30.620
<v Speaker 1>They were just thinking he deserved it.</v>

3232
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.131

<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3286
01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:45.270
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>

3287
01:27:45.271 --> 01:27:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3288
01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:46.201
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

3289
01:27:46.201 --> 01:27:49.330
<v Speaker 1>that just shows people it may have is really all about when those fights the</v>

3290
01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:52.060
<v Speaker 1>same time as they're doing the fight now as the coaches are fighting.</v>

3291
01:27:52.110 --> 01:27:52.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3292
01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:52.401
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3293
01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:54.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the next in the next integration.</v>

3294
01:27:54.121 --> 01:27:55.170
<v Speaker 1>When we do it on Fx,</v>

3295
01:27:55.171 --> 01:27:56.430
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to be in lifetime.</v>

3296
01:27:56.710 --> 01:27:58.590
<v Speaker 1>You mean December 3rd is that what you mean?</v>

3297
01:27:59.160 --> 01:27:59.993
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3298
01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.340
<v Speaker 1>but normally eventually it's going to be live.</v>

3299
01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:02.850
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have,</v>

3300
01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:04.330
<v Speaker 1>the fights are going to be live on telephone.</v>

3301
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Television used to do it on a different,</v>

3302
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.731
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3303
01:28:05.731 --> 01:28:05.941
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

3304
01:28:05.941 --> 01:28:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Every week.</v>

3305
01:28:06.630 --> 01:28:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3306
01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3307
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they're going to synchronize that.</v>

3308
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.440
<v Speaker 1>They're figuring it out with Fx,</v>

3309
01:28:10.441 --> 01:28:11.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's going to be amazing.</v>

3310
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3311
01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:12.250
<v Speaker 1>But Damn,</v>

3312
01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:13.830
<v Speaker 1>these 135 pounders,</v>

3313
01:28:13.831 --> 01:28:16.140
<v Speaker 1>145 pounds are fucking awesome.</v>

3314
01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Brian has the best idea for that.</v>

3315
01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:18.240
<v Speaker 1>It goes.</v>

3316
01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just so small.</v>

3317
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:20.011
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3318
01:28:20.011 --> 01:28:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I should come in and prance around the octagon on ponies and make it the reason</v>

3319
01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 1>I knew Brian Red Bell.</v>

3320
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>You said that all adorned.</v>

3321
01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll let you ride a favor,</v>

3322
01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:34.130
<v Speaker 1>send you all adorned and the one 35 was it have to move around with us.</v>

3323
01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:36.570
<v Speaker 1>That would be awesome.</v>

3324
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Horns and stuff.</v>

3325
01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:41.260
<v Speaker 4>I can't participate in that for that</v>

3326
01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:48.530
<v Speaker 4>and I feel like little lines and then they're lying.</v>

3327
01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.473
<v Speaker 4>Crossers</v>

3328
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:51.833
<v Speaker 4>flux are,</v>

3329
01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what to do.</v>

3330
01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:56.130
<v Speaker 4>That little prancing when it gets down on one knee,</v>

3331
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.013
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

3332
01:28:58.340 --> 01:28:59.710
<v Speaker 4>very regal.</v>

3333
01:28:59.711 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 4>Would it be a pony with the hair over the hubs</v>

3334
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:06.090
<v Speaker 1>to be an extra blessing and to have that extra hair that just blossoms run their</v>

3335
01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Budweiser ponies.</v>

3336
01:29:06.991 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck is that one of the fighter route is that man weird fucking dust</v>

3337
01:29:11.761 --> 01:29:13.850
<v Speaker 1>covers they have over their feet and shit.</v>

3338
01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 1>That man their feet.</v>

3339
01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody make that,</v>

3340
01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:18.920
<v Speaker 1>they invent that horse.</v>

3341
01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:19.741
<v Speaker 1>It's like dog breeding.</v>

3342
01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:20.060
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

3343
01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:21.050
<v Speaker 1>that's all they could do with horses.</v>

3344
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:21.901
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they did?</v>

3345
01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:22.261
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

3346
01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

3347
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3348
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>

3349
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:25.020
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different breeds.</v>

3350
01:29:25.021 --> 01:29:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Apparently we were wrong.</v>

3351
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:26.784
<v Speaker 1>And the Indians,</v>

3352
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:29.640
<v Speaker 1>a new agriculture before the,</v>

3353
01:29:29.641 --> 01:29:29.841
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3354
01:29:29.841 --> 01:29:33.500
<v Speaker 1>the white man and they taught the white man had to grow corn and uh,</v>

3355
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

3356
01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:38.880
<v Speaker 1>they apparently might have even had horses before European settlers,</v>

3357
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 1>but the ink is didn't,</v>

3358
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.960
<v Speaker 1>the Incas didn't know about the horse cause,</v>

3359
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 1>but there might've been some other horses that were left.</v>

3360
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:45.980
<v Speaker 1>They also think that the,</v>

3361
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the first settlers in America might've been the Chinese.</v>

3362
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3363
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3364
01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.470
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese might have found from the Bering strait.</v>

3365
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3366
01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.101
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3367
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:53.251
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3368
01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:53.760
<v Speaker 1>we do that.</v>

3369
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 1>We've got the one.</v>

3370
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:54.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3371
01:29:54.351 --> 01:29:54.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3372
01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:54.541
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3373
01:29:54.541 --> 01:29:55.374
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>

3374
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:57.330
<v Speaker 1>The Siberians I mean,</v>

3375
01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:58.164
<v Speaker 1>on boats.</v>

3376
01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3377
01:29:59.130 --> 01:29:59.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3378
01:29:59.431 --> 01:29:59.851
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3379
01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:00.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3380
01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's,</v>

3381
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:02.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of pump,</v>

3382
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:03.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3383
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:06.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of history that's obviously lost in North America because North</v>

3384
01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:09.630
<v Speaker 1>America used to be covered in a glacier and the gray shirt fucking crushed</v>

3385
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:12.450
<v Speaker 1>everything and melted and created the Great Lakes and all that shit.</v>

3386
01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:13.500
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>

3387
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I mostly Filipinos and they'll always look somewhat,</v>

3388
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:17.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3389
01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:18.151
<v Speaker 1>Mexican,</v>

3390
01:30:18.151 --> 01:30:19.950
<v Speaker 1>they look sort of Mexican for the Asians.</v>

3391
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to Edwin San Juan yesterday and it was like,</v>

3392
01:30:22.111 --> 01:30:22.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3393
01:30:22.231 --> 01:30:24.770
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish came and rape the fuck out of both the,</v>

3394
01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.540
<v Speaker 1>my name is Edwin San Juan San Juan,</v>

3395
01:30:27.541 --> 01:30:28.374
<v Speaker 1>and I'm an Asian.</v>

3396
01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3397
01:30:29.191 --> 01:30:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

3398
01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3399
01:30:30.670 --> 01:30:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a Filipinos.</v>

3400
01:30:31.801 --> 01:30:32.251
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>

3401
01:30:32.251 --> 01:30:34.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a Chinese and the Chinese and Spanish.</v>

3402
01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:34.861
<v Speaker 1>So they must have,</v>

3403
01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.591
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese must have like,</v>

3404
01:30:35.591 --> 01:30:38.310
<v Speaker 1>just when not the Asians must have just gone on both that way.</v>

3405
01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:39.144
<v Speaker 1>Going West,</v>

3406
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:40.240
<v Speaker 1>we were going use,</v>

3407
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.700
<v Speaker 1>they found cocaine,</v>

3408
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:45.270
<v Speaker 1>they found cocaine residue in some Faroes something or another.</v>

3409
01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:48.120
<v Speaker 1>They found evidence of cocaine use in ancient Egypt.</v>

3410
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And what's insane about that as cocaine can only be grown in South America,</v>

3411
01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.530
<v Speaker 1>can't be growing and in relationships.</v>

3412
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3413
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:56.360
<v Speaker 1>the climate doesn't suit it.</v>

3414
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3415
01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Part of the time they think that they might've been on a fucking ship.</v>

3416
01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.130
<v Speaker 1>The other possibility is that the climate was way,</v>

3417
01:31:02.131 --> 01:31:03.270
<v Speaker 1>way different back then.</v>

3418
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:03.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that,</v>

3419
01:31:03.961 --> 01:31:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they have a pretty detailed record of the can also be,</v>

3420
01:31:06.361 --> 01:31:06.630
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>

3421
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:09.580
<v Speaker 1>didn't some people used to bring stuff from other parts of the world we,</v>

3422
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3423
01:31:09.721 --> 01:31:11.130
<v Speaker 1>but they were saying by boats,</v>

3424
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:13.140
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know that people were traveling the globe.</v>

3425
01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:16.460
<v Speaker 1>That that mean that we are talking about 2,500 BC,</v>

3426
01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that they have boats back then.</v>

3427
01:31:18.421 --> 01:31:21.720
<v Speaker 1>There's some really detailed boats that they found in tombs,</v>

3428
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:22.980
<v Speaker 1>like incredible boats,</v>

3429
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:25.770
<v Speaker 1>like big giant put together boats inside tombs,</v>

3430
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3431
01:31:26.281 --> 01:31:28.080
<v Speaker 1>so that we know that they could get on,</v>

3432
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:28.943
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>

3433
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:29.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3434
01:31:29.221 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Speaker 1>across the ocean,</v>

3435
01:31:30.061 --> 01:31:30.840
<v Speaker 1>but they could,</v>

3436
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:31.111
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

3437
01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:33.420
<v Speaker 1>they definitely had the concept of boats down,</v>

3438
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3439
01:31:34.630 --> 01:31:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3440
01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:35.983
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3441
01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:37.733
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to say,</v>

3442
01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.050
<v Speaker 1>so the people that like that,</v>

3443
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 1>like live in North America,</v>

3444
01:31:42.271 --> 01:31:42.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3445
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:44.190
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing used to be covered in ice,</v>

3446
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.233
<v Speaker 1>so there's not,</v>

3447
01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.250
<v Speaker 1>there's not that many people that were here.</v>

3448
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sort of eventually went,</v>

3449
01:31:48.630 --> 01:31:48.781
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3450
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:49.920
<v Speaker 1>this is open now.</v>

3451
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:50.943
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3452
01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.220
<v Speaker 1>then people stormed in there,</v>

3453
01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:54.054
<v Speaker 1>just jumped,</v>

3454
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:54.871
<v Speaker 1>look at all the space.</v>

3455
01:31:54.871 --> 01:31:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>

3456
01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.490
<v Speaker 1>crazy how it happened.</v>

3457
01:31:56.730 --> 01:31:58.980
<v Speaker 1>If you look at like the evolution of the earth,</v>

3458
01:31:59.020 --> 01:31:59.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3459
01:31:59.321 --> 01:32:02.600
<v Speaker 1>and like the progress of people moving around it.</v>

3460
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:06.260
<v Speaker 1>A very strange thing that this one awesome spot that uh,</v>

3461
01:32:06.261 --> 01:32:10.090
<v Speaker 1>used to be connected to everything was completely empty except for it's,</v>

3466
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:16.121
<v Speaker 1>tiny number.</v>

3467
01:32:16.121 --> 01:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>So much extra real estate.</v>

01:32:28.261 --> 01:32:28.710
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

3477
01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>like in the best situation before the white men found out what the fuck was over</v>

3557
01:34:34.781 --> 01:34:38.140
<v Speaker 1>he could've died for sure if he didn't have a helmet on his head and up and</v>

3558
01:34:38.141 --> 01:34:39.550
<v Speaker 1>smushy they said this,</v>

3560
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I angle was coming in that way or whatever and he just saw him at the last</v>

3561
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.130
<v Speaker 1>second because he was speeding faster than normal I guess.</v>

3562
01:34:49.131 --> 01:34:49.964
<v Speaker 1>So it was just like,</v>

3563

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3564
01:34:50.371 --> 01:34:52.480
<v Speaker 1>he just timed it and they saw him and let's try to jump over.</v>

3565
01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:53.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a great video.</v>

3568
01:34:58.581 --> 01:34:59.450
<v Speaker 1>front of his motorcycle.</v>

3569
01:34:59.451 --> 01:35:00.800
<v Speaker 1>He's carving through canyons</v>

3570
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:07.970
<v Speaker 1>and he hits a deer and you see one frame where you see the deer's face.</v>

3571
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3572
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 1>fucking bad ass.</v>

3573
01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:12.291
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

3574
01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:13.890
<v Speaker 1>And he just goes fucking fine.</v>

3575
01:35:13.891 --> 01:35:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And you see the camera flying through the air and spins,</v>

3576
01:35:16.581 --> 01:35:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and then it goes black.</v>

3577
01:35:17.481 --> 01:35:19.490
<v Speaker 1>And then it shows the guy he actually survived.</v>

3578
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:20.780
<v Speaker 1>He got laid out,</v>

3579
01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:21.950
<v Speaker 1>his bike is destroyed,</v>

3580
01:35:21.951 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 1>and he just flipped and,</v>

3581
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:23.924
<v Speaker 1>but he was wearing,</v>

3582
01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:24.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3583
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.460
<v Speaker 1>it actually says,</v>

3584
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.350
<v Speaker 1>make sure you were always wear a helmet and we're,</v>

3585
01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:28.640
<v Speaker 1>we're leather men.</v>

3586
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:29.750
<v Speaker 1>He was like covered in like a,</v>

3587
01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:30.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3588
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:31.520
<v Speaker 1>like one of those racers,</v>

3589
01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Tom outfits that you can actually kind of take a little bit of an impact with it</v>

3590
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:35.420
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3591
01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not because you're sliding down.</v>

3592
01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:38.831
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

3593
01:35:38.831 --> 01:35:39.320
<v Speaker 1>A Harris,</v>

3594
01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.900
<v Speaker 1>it was sliding down the street and just ripping the skin off.</v>

3595
01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:42.763
<v Speaker 1>But when you hit it,</v>

3596
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you hit a deer and 60 miles an hour.</v>

3597
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:46.740
<v Speaker 1>It ain't that like,</v>

3598
01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.310
<v Speaker 1>it's sliding.</v>

3599
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 1>You're going flying,</v>

3600
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:49.691
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3601
01:35:49.691 --> 01:35:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fly through the air.</v>

3602
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:52.063
<v Speaker 1>Everything's flying.</v>

3603
01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck is going to happen.</v>

3604
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You just hit a deer and it's just,</v>

3605
01:35:55.431 --> 01:35:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you're going way too fast.</v>

3606
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.560
<v Speaker 1>You took on that speed,</v>

3607
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:59.630
<v Speaker 1>you're on something that's like 3000 pounds,</v>

3608
01:35:59.631 --> 01:35:59.901
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3609
01:35:59.901 --> 01:36:00.540
<v Speaker 1>not that heavy.</v>

3610
01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:00.891
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

3611
01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:01.730
<v Speaker 1>What does a motorcycle or whatever,</v>

3612
01:36:01.731 --> 01:36:02.564
<v Speaker 1>but he's a hundred pounds,</v>

3613
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:03.621
<v Speaker 1>500 pounds,</v>

3614
01:36:03.621 --> 01:36:04.454
<v Speaker 1>600 pounds,</v>

3615
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:06.470
<v Speaker 1>one of those like Ninjas or you're just,</v>

3616
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 1>your body goes that fast.</v>

3617
01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're going 60 miles an hour.</v>

3618
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 1>You keep going 60 it's ridiculously fast.</v>

3619
01:36:12.111 --> 01:36:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Those things are so crazy.</v>

3620
01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:14.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3621
01:36:14.151 --> 01:36:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I see them on the highway sometimes just fucking by</v>

3622
01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest thing ever that that's legal.</v>

3623
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is like what a massive risk taking of,</v>

3624
01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.890
<v Speaker 1>we have a high waist in California for people don't know.</v>

3625
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Most rational states all across this country.</v>

3626
01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay in your fucking lane.</v>

3627
01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:32.421
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

3628
01:36:32.421 --> 01:36:33.770
<v Speaker 1>You can't just drive in the middle.</v>

3629
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:34.551
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>

3630
01:36:34.551 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 1>they let motorcycles drive in between the fucking cars and I dunno who says</v>

3631
01:36:39.231 --> 01:36:42.770
<v Speaker 1>that's okay and they often hit your side mirrors and it happened twice.</v>

3632
01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:43.791
<v Speaker 1>I've had it happen.</v>

3633
01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:44.624
<v Speaker 1>I've had it happen.</v>

3634
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:46.400
<v Speaker 1>They just go right through it.</v>

3635
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Especially those dudes are those big crazy fat Harley bikes.</v>

3636
01:36:49.161 --> 01:36:50.840
<v Speaker 1>You know those things aren't that nimble man.</v>

3637
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:54.110
<v Speaker 1>What are those guys even trying like the ones with the big ass like that.</v>

3638
01:36:54.111 --> 01:36:56.990
<v Speaker 1>The storage containers on the side trying to go in between lanes.</v>

3639
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

3640
01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.380
<v Speaker 1>What's up with these handlebars?</v>

3641
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3642
01:37:00.810 --> 01:37:02.270
<v Speaker 1>These handlebars where they look like they're,</v>

3643
01:37:02.271 --> 01:37:03.860
<v Speaker 1>they're like lower,</v>

3644
01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:04.410
<v Speaker 1>lower,</v>

3645
01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:07.130
<v Speaker 1>no more rocky on the top of the stairs.</v>

3646
01:37:07.131 --> 01:37:10.130
<v Speaker 1>In Philadelphia they get more attention because it's like,</v>

3647
01:37:10.131 --> 01:37:10.551
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3648
01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:11.361
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

3650
01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.760
<v Speaker 1>rather listening at home.</v>

3651
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:21.720
<v Speaker 1>We're doing the arms up in the air thing where they call them hangars,</v>

3652
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:22.623
<v Speaker 1>ape hangers.</v>

3653
01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:24.493
<v Speaker 1>That's what they call them.</v>

3654
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:27.140
<v Speaker 1>The crazy handlebars that are like super tall,</v>

3655
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.891
<v Speaker 1>right to live,</v>

3656
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:28.471
<v Speaker 1>live the ride.</v>

3657
01:37:28.471 --> 01:37:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Your motorcycle motorcycles must be so much fucking fun.</v>

3658
01:37:32.061 --> 01:37:32.894
<v Speaker 1>Now think about it.</v>

3659
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:36.200
<v Speaker 1>People get together in groups and they all just ride around together.</v>

3660
01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to get that fat tire one,</v>

3661
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the one that has the really,</v>

3662
01:37:39.090 --> 01:37:40.460
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>

3663

3666
01:37:46.670 --> 01:37:48.680

3669
01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:54.020
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

3670
01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:54.501

01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.310
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3713
01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah that's a for I hear your,</v>

3714
01:39:02.591 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 1>your pain about one and a half of a sack to me I feel.</v>

3715
01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3716
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:08.490
<v Speaker 1>You know a lot of comments.</v>

3717
01:39:08.491 --> 01:39:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I got roped in over there.</v>

3718
01:39:09.850 --> 01:39:10.350
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3719
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3720
01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:15.210
<v Speaker 1>no though we all know them and we all know what happens but becomes their life</v>

3721
01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:18.720
<v Speaker 1>when it's just a weird thing that you get connected to someone like you.</v>

3722
01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:19.631
<v Speaker 1>They're inescapable.</v>

3723
01:39:19.631 --> 01:39:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And we were supposed to hook up three times and that was supposed to be it for</v>

3724
01:39:22.651 --> 01:39:23.484
<v Speaker 1>our story.</v>

3725
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.470
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to be spending 30 years together.</v>

3726
01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3727
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing man.</v>

3728
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:28.253
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

3729
01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:29.370
<v Speaker 1>They're getting that operation.</v>

3730
01:39:29.371 --> 01:39:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Just the print out some fake medical records saying that you have a past family</v>

3731
01:39:33.211 --> 01:39:33.680
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

3732
01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Here's the weird thing.</v>

3733
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So every time I hear something like that,</v>

3734
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:37.560
<v Speaker 1>like the only real excuse to not do it,</v>

3735
01:39:37.561 --> 01:39:38.700
<v Speaker 1>it's something ridiculous like that.</v>

3736
01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like joking.</v>

3737
01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:40.051
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3738
01:39:40.051 --> 01:39:40.210
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3739
01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Just how you do they have with case farms,</v>

3740
01:39:42.081 --> 01:39:42.914
<v Speaker 1>you just in it.</v>

3741
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:44.123
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it's got,</v>

3742
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.030
<v Speaker 1>we're going to think in terms of that.</v>

3743
01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:46.290
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely have a mastectomy.</v>

3744
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a pill for men that they're working on it forever.</v>

3745
01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Since I was,</v>

3746
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:53.850
<v Speaker 1>since I just started fucking,</v>

3747
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I would think that it's going to kill your deck though.</v>

3748
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:56.761
<v Speaker 1>I would think.</v>

3749
01:39:56.761 --> 01:39:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Did any pill that just the board said,</v>

3750
01:39:58.740 --> 01:39:59.191
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3751
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I think any pill that probably like it's going to affect your day.</v>

3752
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:06.960
<v Speaker 1>What if they cut it with like Viagara 90% so it's like,</v>

3753
01:40:06.961 --> 01:40:07.111
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3754
01:40:07.111 --> 01:40:07.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3755
01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Everything good.</v>

3756
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if that happened and uh,</v>

3757
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:11.970
<v Speaker 1>only sole as babies were born.</v>

3758
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not that starts the apocalypse.</v>

3759
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:19.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not only conceive soulless babies,</v>

3760
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.340
<v Speaker 1>they come out with fucking Parana teeth.</v>

3761
01:40:22.341 --> 01:40:23.500
<v Speaker 1>You just need the way out of the post.</v>

3762
01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:24.780
<v Speaker 1>No eyeballs.</v>

3763
01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:27.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3764
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:28.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what starts it.</v>

3765
01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.640
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different scenarios as to what's going to start it.</v>

3766
01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:34.670
<v Speaker 1>What's going to start the Zombie apart.</v>

3767
01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:35.970
<v Speaker 1>We all agree it's going to start.</v>

3768
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.590
<v Speaker 1>There will be a Zombie apocalypse at some point.</v>

3769
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Well we all know that there's too many fucking people for the amount of</v>

3770
01:40:40.111 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 1>resources that we have in this one area that we've all chosen to reside in and</v>

3771
01:40:44.011 --> 01:40:47.220
<v Speaker 1>eventually that Shit's going to fall apart if we don't figure out this whole</v>

3772
01:40:47.221 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 1>petro chemical dependency thing.</v>

3773
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:51.270
<v Speaker 1>We're eventually gonna run out of fucking oil.</v>

3774
01:40:51.271 --> 01:40:51.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3775
01:40:51.541 --> 01:40:54.430
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a 500 years from now or 10 years grand scheme of it,</v>

3776
01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:55.360
<v Speaker 1>we're running oil,</v>

3777
01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:59.500
<v Speaker 1>there'll be mass extinction and it start over with the amount of people we can</v>

3778
01:40:59.501 --> 01:41:01.330
<v Speaker 1>handle with no oil.</v>

3779
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with all that.</v>

3780
01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 1>He loved the walking home and smelling rotten.</v>

3781
01:41:05.561 --> 01:41:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

3782
01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:11.250
<v Speaker 1>20 to 40 hours joy that shit and worrying about who's going to eat your dog</v>

3783
01:41:11.951 --> 01:41:12.784
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

3784
01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3785
01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:17.020
<v Speaker 1>cause they need those times and then you smell it cooking and you look over the</v>

3786
01:41:17.021 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 1>window and you see your fucking neighbors chewing on your dog looking like</v>

3787
01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:21.350
<v Speaker 1>fucking monster.</v>

3788
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I hate my fucking dog hungry.</v>

3789
01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:26.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3790
01:41:26.531 --> 01:41:27.570
<v Speaker 1>People got gonna start eating dogs.</v>

3791
01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I think I was studying people.</v>

3792
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.910
<v Speaker 1>We're going to realize we're going to have to eat some of each other.</v>

3793
01:41:30.911 --> 01:41:32.260
<v Speaker 1>There's just too many to go around.</v>

3794
01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:33.970
<v Speaker 1>That's where mad cow comes from.</v>

3795
01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Cows eating each other in the grand cow disease comes from,</v>

3796
01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.910
<v Speaker 1>it's called Jacob's Crutchfield.</v>

3797
01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the name of the official name of the disease.</v>

3798
01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3799
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it comes from cows being forced,</v>

3800
01:41:46.121 --> 01:41:49.600
<v Speaker 1>fed brain tissue can on the grant.</v>

3801
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:54.280
<v Speaker 1>And this same exact disease manifests itself amongst cannibals.</v>

3802
01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:55.990
<v Speaker 1>When cannibals eat their,</v>

3803
01:41:55.991 --> 01:41:56.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3804
01:41:56.141 --> 01:41:57.670
<v Speaker 1>their rivals brains,</v>

3805
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 1>they get sick,</v>

3806
01:41:59.200 --> 01:41:59.911
<v Speaker 1>but then realized that,</v>

3807
01:41:59.911 --> 01:42:00.744
<v Speaker 1>that you get the shakes.</v>

3808
01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3809
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.600
<v Speaker 1>The book of Eli is,</v>

3810
01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.011
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

3811
01:42:05.011 --> 01:42:06.060
<v Speaker 1>So that wasn't a movie.</v>

3812
01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.060
<v Speaker 1>The book of your life in the mood.</v>

3813
01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3814
01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:09.123
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

3815
01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:09.993
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3816
01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:10.620
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3817
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I may or may not have been in the book.</v>

3818
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Probably wasn't in the original,</v>

3819
01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.770
<v Speaker 1>but it is true.</v>

3820
01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.450
<v Speaker 1>The same shitty ending of the book.</v>

3821
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Why did I watch this whole thing with this?</v>

3822
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:24.210
<v Speaker 1>That was a brutal ending in to find out that he's blind.</v>

3823
01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it doesn't pay off.</v>

3824
01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:27.550
<v Speaker 1>He's blind the whole time,</v>

3825
01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 1>but he's not really the whole things in Braille.</v>

3826
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And he's the only one that can read it.</v>

3827
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:32.380
<v Speaker 1>It's got the message of the Bible.</v>

3828
01:42:32.381 --> 01:42:33.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was living for us.</v>

3829
01:42:33.411 --> 01:42:34.244
<v Speaker 1>So we can move,</v>

3830
01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:35.620
<v Speaker 1>make the Bible live along.</v>

3831
01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:37.211
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

3832
01:42:37.211 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 1>what's the translation is an ancient Hebrew,</v>

3833
01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.393
<v Speaker 1>all English,</v>

3834
01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:41.000
<v Speaker 1>all English.</v>

3835
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:41.711
<v Speaker 1>She's given the gift.</v>

3836
01:42:41.711 --> 01:42:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Who knows it by heart.</v>

3837
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.170
<v Speaker 1>All English to fucking cunts.</v>

3838
01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:45.543
<v Speaker 1>How dare he,</v>

3839
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I can put it in a library,</v>

3840
01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.473
<v Speaker 1>but it is a thing.</v>

3841
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that is the disease when people get the shakes.</v>

3842
01:42:52.061 --> 01:42:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3843
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:53.280
<v Speaker 1>From that,</v>

3844
01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 1>there was something else we talked about last week that we shouldn't,</v>

3845
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you knew about that.</v>

3846
01:42:57.850 --> 01:43:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I funds not being built this time around in China really being built in Brazil.</v>

3847
01:43:03.090 --> 01:43:03.923
<v Speaker 1>Riley,</v>

3848
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:06.070
<v Speaker 1>this new iPhone is being built in Brazil.</v>

3849
01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.193
<v Speaker 1>Brazil.</v>

3850
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they don't have as many.</v>

3851
01:43:08.621 --> 01:43:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about sweatshops.</v>

3852
01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3853
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:12.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

3854
01:43:12.371 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I think they took a lot of heat from what happened in China.</v>

3855
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:15.540
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3856
01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.600
<v Speaker 1>they have these Foxconn studios,</v>

3857
01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:18.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3858
01:43:18.250 --> 01:43:23.250
<v Speaker 1>It's Foxconn studios at 420,000 people working 15 hours a day for $175 a month</v>

3859
01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.460
<v Speaker 1>and no air conditioning and hot fucking China.</v>

3860
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:28.960
<v Speaker 1>And does anyone have air conditioning in China</v>

3861
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.700
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

3862
01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:31.931
<v Speaker 1>Real?</v>

3863
01:43:31.931 --> 01:43:32.621
<v Speaker 1>They know it exists.</v>

3864
01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a ghost.</v>

3865
01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I read this thing that they were talking about Perry or Romney or one of those</v>

3866
01:43:36.551 --> 01:43:37.860
<v Speaker 1>guys wherever first Massachusetts.</v>

3867
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I literally don't care about politics at all,</v>

3868
01:43:39.851 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but some of it interests me.</v>

3869
01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:41.441
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

3870
01:43:41.441 --> 01:43:41.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3871
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:42.510
<v Speaker 1>there were saying how,</v>

3872
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3873
01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:47.120
<v Speaker 1>well the unemployment premiums went up there up to 14% in Massachusetts.</v>

3874
01:43:47.121 --> 01:43:48.250
<v Speaker 1>So that shows how bad they are.</v>

3875
01:43:48.251 --> 01:43:50.140
<v Speaker 1>That 43% higher than the national average.</v>

3876
01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:51.261
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody like,</v>

3877
01:43:51.261 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3878
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.300
<v Speaker 5>but when I institute this thing,</v>

3879
01:43:53.301 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 5>it was 20% over.</v>

3880
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 5>It's down to 14%.</v>

3881
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:57.170
<v Speaker 5>You can't just say,</v>

3882
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>

3883
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:59.360
<v Speaker 5>What were you saying that I just thought of this,</v>

3884
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:00.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3885
01:44:00.970 --> 01:44:02.100
<v Speaker 4>the people in Foxconn.</v>

3886
01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:02.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3887
01:44:02.421 --> 01:44:02.611
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3888
01:44:02.611 --> 01:44:02.921
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3889
01:44:02.921 --> 01:44:05.020
<v Speaker 4>what if no one in China has air conditioning and it's not,</v>

3890
01:44:05.021 --> 01:44:06.400
<v Speaker 4>that sounds way worse,</v>

3891
01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:07.420
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

3892
01:44:07.421 --> 01:44:08.290
<v Speaker 4>But either way,</v>

3893
01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.760
<v Speaker 4>that's extreme.</v>

3894
01:44:09.761 --> 01:44:10.650
<v Speaker 4>Hundred 70 bucks a month.</v>

3895
01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:15.670
<v Speaker 4>You're so cheap and a family of suicide and suicide nets all around the</v>

3896
01:44:17.831 --> 01:44:18.664
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

3897
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:23.890
<v Speaker 4>So this conversation you have to decide that's wow that,</v>

3898
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:26.050
<v Speaker 4>that there's like millions of people that work there.</v>

3899
01:44:26.051 --> 01:44:26.801
<v Speaker 4>It's all this conversation.</v>

3900
01:44:26.801 --> 01:44:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Yet there's millions of people there that that the rate is actually lower than</v>

3901
01:44:30.970 --> 01:44:31.691
<v Speaker 4>the national average.</v>

3902
01:44:31.691 --> 01:44:33.340
<v Speaker 4>The national average that's,</v>

3903
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:34.050
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

3904
01:44:34.050 --> 01:44:34.420
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

3905
01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:34.841
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

3906
01:44:34.841 --> 01:44:39.430
<v Speaker 4>Is that it's actually 420,000 people that are employed there and their rate is</v>

3907
01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:41.080
<v Speaker 4>slightly below the national rate.</v>

3908
01:44:41.110 --> 01:44:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3909
01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:43.570
<v Speaker 4>So really it's not about them being like,</v>

3910
01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:44.411
<v Speaker 4>oh look how bad the other,</v>

3911
01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:45.250
<v Speaker 4>you have to have suicide notes.</v>

3912
01:44:45.251 --> 01:44:45.461
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3913
01:44:45.461 --> 01:44:45.601
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3914
01:44:45.601 --> 01:44:45.671
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3915
01:44:45.671 --> 01:44:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Look how above and beyond they're going lead.</v>

3916
01:44:47.521 --> 01:44:51.700
<v Speaker 4>The real question is how many of those people kill themselves at work?</v>

3917
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:53.783
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

3918
01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:54.610
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3919
01:44:54.610 --> 01:44:55.240
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3920
01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.260
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's depressing.</v>

3921
01:44:56.261 --> 01:44:56.700
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>

3922
01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:59.200
<v Speaker 4>How many times have you heard like post office and his guys going in and</v>

3923
01:44:59.201 --> 01:45:01.780
<v Speaker 4>shooting up the place or just happen at Seal Beach?</v>

3924
01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Supposedly one of the employees just killed like eight people there at that an</v>

3925
01:45:05.471 --> 01:45:05.791
<v Speaker 4>employee.</v>

3926
01:45:05.791 --> 01:45:06.940
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was a boyfriend.</v>

3927
01:45:06.970 --> 01:45:07.181
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3928
01:45:07.181 --> 01:45:07.510
<v Speaker 4>was it?</v>

3929
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a guy that worked there.</v>

3930
01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:09.850
<v Speaker 4>I could see wanting to kill yourself.</v>

3931
01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:10.541
<v Speaker 4>If you work in an album,</v>

3932
01:45:10.541 --> 01:45:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that an apple plant for months and months and they come in one day.</v>

3933
01:45:13.421 --> 01:45:13.930
<v Speaker 4>It's like guys,</v>

3934
01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:15.410
<v Speaker 4>big announcement and if it stops working for a second,</v>

3935
01:45:15.411 --> 01:45:16.041
<v Speaker 4>it's like we're,</v>

3936
01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:16.610
<v Speaker 4>we're here.</v>

3937
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:17.620
<v Speaker 4>We just got a great review</v>

3938
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:19.490
<v Speaker 5>and the Gawker and be like,</v>

3939
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3940
01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:20.540
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3941
01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:21.080
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

3942
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.070
<v Speaker 5>and just go up to the roof</v>

3943
01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:23.660
<v Speaker 4>and just fucking ended.</v>

3944
01:45:24.010 --> 01:45:24.550
<v Speaker 4>It hasn't,</v>

3945
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3946
01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:26.460
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably one of these things that,</v>

3947
01:45:26.461 --> 01:45:26.791
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3948
01:45:26.791 --> 01:45:29.670
<v Speaker 4>whatever they're making like $200 a month or whatever it is.</v>

3949
01:45:29.671 --> 01:45:31.360
<v Speaker 4>Even once every fuck once if I,</v>

3950
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I think if anything it's,</v>

3951
01:45:33.581 --> 01:45:37.350
<v Speaker 4>it's probably in around them like how much does rice costs and things like that.</v>

3952
01:45:37.351 --> 01:45:38.770
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3953
01:45:38.771 --> 01:45:38.911
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3954
01:45:38.911 --> 01:45:41.310
<v Speaker 4>you can get a hold back for $5 first of all,</v>

3955
01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.410
<v Speaker 4>I know where you live sucks horribly,</v>

3956
01:45:43.411 --> 01:45:44.640
<v Speaker 4>but you don't need to escape.</v>

3957
01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3958
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:46.890
<v Speaker 4>what do you want to retirement?</v>

3959
01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.071
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3960
01:45:47.071 --> 01:45:50.400
<v Speaker 4>you can retire on a bag of rice and it's also giving them a place to live though</v>

3961
01:45:50.401 --> 01:45:50.731
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

3962
01:45:50.731 --> 01:45:51.990
<v Speaker 4>which is not most jobs.</v>

3963
01:45:51.991 --> 01:45:52.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3964
01:45:52.141 --> 01:45:53.310
<v Speaker 4>you might get paid shitty,</v>

3965
01:45:53.311 --> 01:45:54.150
<v Speaker 4>but you're awesome at getting,</v>

3966
01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:55.163
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3967
01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.033
<v Speaker 4>getting into live.</v>

3968
01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:59.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you're living in a dormitory stacked on top of each other that,</v>

3969
01:45:59.360 --> 01:45:59.680
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>

3970
01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.370
<v Speaker 4>they're not making enough money to like buy a house somewhere.</v>

3971
01:46:02.370 --> 01:46:02.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3972
01:46:02.581 --> 01:46:03.331
<v Speaker 4>what are they gonna do?</v>

3973
01:46:03.331 --> 01:46:08.331
<v Speaker 4>They're just going to get wrung out to dry drained of your humanity just so that</v>

3974
01:46:09.061 --> 01:46:09.894
<v Speaker 4>we can have phones,</v>

3975
01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:10.351
<v Speaker 4>but what are,</v>

3976
01:46:10.351 --> 01:46:10.950
<v Speaker 4>what are,</v>

3977
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:11.850
<v Speaker 4>what are the other Pete,</v>

3978
01:46:11.851 --> 01:46:14.170
<v Speaker 4>which is we're where that factory is or,</v>

3979
01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:18.000
<v Speaker 4>or their houses or people living in like on boats is a good question.</v>

3980
01:46:18.001 --> 01:46:18.181
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3981
01:46:18.181 --> 01:46:18.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3982
01:46:18.511 --> 01:46:22.530
<v Speaker 4>maybe that reality is so much better than the Zombie apocalypse that they were</v>

3983
01:46:22.531 --> 01:46:25.800
<v Speaker 4>living in before this fucking Chinese sweatshop factory opened up and they're</v>

3984
01:46:25.801 --> 01:46:27.150
<v Speaker 4>probably getting medical on that.</v>

3985
01:46:27.151 --> 01:46:27.984
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if they do.</v>

3986
01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:29.073
<v Speaker 4>They probably are.</v>

3987
01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:31.910
<v Speaker 4>Everybody sort of wants to say like,</v>

3988
01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.101
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3989
01:46:32.101 --> 01:46:32.551
<v Speaker 4>maybe if it's,</v>

3990
01:46:32.551 --> 01:46:33.540
<v Speaker 4>everything is okay,</v>

3991
01:46:33.541 --> 01:46:35.220
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is it's sweatshop itself.</v>

3992
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.193
<v Speaker 4>It is a sweat shop.</v>

3993
01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.190
<v Speaker 4>You don't hire children in America.</v>

3994
01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3995
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:42.390
<v Speaker 4>We had to make a law and it sucks what other people do pay them shittily and</v>

3996
01:46:42.391 --> 01:46:42.661
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3997
01:46:42.661 --> 01:46:42.781
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3998
01:46:42.781 --> 01:46:43.620
<v Speaker 4>of course we're going to have it there.</v>

3999
01:46:43.621 --> 01:46:44.100
<v Speaker 4>It's cheaper.</v>

4000
01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.020
<v Speaker 4>And then you realize Microsoft,</v>

4001

<v Speaker 4>Sony,</v>

<v Speaker 4>every single fucking company does the exact same thing.</v>

4003
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Even at Fox con.</v>

4004
01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

4007
01:46:53.801 --> 01:46:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4008
01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this on Twitter and I wrote us on,</v>

4009
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:57.121
<v Speaker 1>on the message board.</v>

4010
01:46:57.121 --> 01:46:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4011
01:46:57.510 --> 01:47:01.650
<v Speaker 1>what about a phone called the iPhone Karma and what it is is a phone that's made</v>

4012
01:47:01.651 --> 01:47:02.484
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>

4013

01:47:05.251 --> 01:47:08.160
<v Speaker 1>you pay them a good wage and I'll pay double for your phone and you're better to</v>

4016
01:47:08.161 --> 01:47:11.850
<v Speaker 1>have a sticker where everyone else can see that you're paying fucking sell</v>

4017
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:12.840
<v Speaker 1>hundreds</v>

4018
01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:19.820
<v Speaker 1>be such a great lesson that it might not,</v>

4019
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:22.250
<v Speaker 1>it might not be a moneymaker.</v>

4020
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.530
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4021
01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4022
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:23.603
<v Speaker 1>they would never do it.</v>

4023
01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:26.520
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys that have maybe also be admitting that they were doing something</v>

4024
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:27.300
<v Speaker 1>bad on the other end.</v>

4025
01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4026
01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the guests were message boards said that they should have an iPhone Karma</v>

4027
01:47:30.841 --> 01:47:31.680
<v Speaker 1>and then an iPhone.</v>

4030
01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:47.250
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of flesh of Afghany babies.</v>

4031
01:47:47.251 --> 01:47:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Even even like the shirts,</v>

4032
01:47:48.481 --> 01:47:50.280
<v Speaker 1>they even tee shirts and clothing,</v>

4033
01:47:50.281 --> 01:47:51.130
<v Speaker 1>like half of that shit.</v>

4034
01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.450
<v Speaker 1>It comes from even worse conditions than Foxconn,</v>

4035
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4036
01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4037
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:56.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really weird to wear.</v>

4038
01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Where do you prioritize?</v>

4039
01:47:57.781 --> 01:47:57.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4040
01:47:57.991 --> 01:48:01.380
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's horrible that there's war going on right now and civilians and</v>

4041
01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and Iraq are dying and they didn't.</v>

4042
01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not their fucking fault.</v>

4043
01:48:05.821 --> 01:48:07.080
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing is chaos.</v>

4044
01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:08.473
<v Speaker 1>You can only pick one.</v>

4045
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:13.910
<v Speaker 1>What can you do good things to think about that you have to go did a countries,</v>

4046
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:15.720
<v Speaker 1>they countries have to make it last and be like,</v>

4047
01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:15.931
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4048
01:48:15.931 --> 01:48:16.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4049
01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 1>this is illegal.</v>

4050
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:22.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to fucking have these conditions and got by our rules.</v>

4051
01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:23.581
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

4052
01:48:23.581 --> 01:48:24.414
<v Speaker 1>They won't do it.</v>

4053
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:25.850
<v Speaker 1>We're not worth anything anymore,</v>

4054
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.041
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4055
01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:26.641
<v Speaker 1>We're broke.</v>

4056
01:48:26.641 --> 01:48:27.600
<v Speaker 1>We're broke as fuck.</v>

4057
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand how that works.</v>

4058
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I understand how it works.</v>

4059
01:48:30.031 --> 01:48:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I finally figured it out.</v>

4060
01:48:30.931 --> 01:48:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Tell these fucking podcasts.</v>

4061
01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's working anymore.</v>

4062
01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.930
<v Speaker 1>90% of you listening right now just going to shut up.</v>

4063
01:48:36.931 --> 01:48:37.181
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

4064
01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:38.014
<v Speaker 1>You're going to ruin hitch.</v>

4065
01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:38.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4066
01:48:38.401 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 1>There was all listen to podcasts all day long at work.</v>

4067
01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:43.870
<v Speaker 1>It's motherfuckers ruin everything I think.</v>

4068
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I think we should just have a country bias out.</v>

4069
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:48.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what's the most expensive country,</v>

4070
01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:48.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4071
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:49.620
<v Speaker 1>We might be the most successful,</v>

4072
01:48:49.621 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 1>which is the scariest thing.</v>

4073
01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:53.880
<v Speaker 1>That means that the banks of the really key ones controlling everything.</v>

4074
01:48:53.881 --> 01:48:55.290
<v Speaker 1>If everybody's fucking broke,</v>

4075
01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.513
<v Speaker 1>everybody's proud.</v>

4076
01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 1>There's that one country where everybody's just fucking Bawling Jz style,</v>

4077
01:49:00.781 --> 01:49:03.120
<v Speaker 1>24 seven in their underwear,</v>

4078
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:05.490
<v Speaker 1>popping bottles with models and the top of a yacht.</v>

4079
01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:08.800
<v Speaker 1>No one's doing that.</v>

4080
01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.571
<v Speaker 1>Not One country.</v>

4081
01:49:09.571 --> 01:49:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Then how is anybody winning and if nobody's winning,</v>

4082
01:49:11.431 --> 01:49:12.540
<v Speaker 1>where does all the resources go?</v>

4083
01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.340
<v Speaker 1>You kind of who's got the money?</v>

4084
01:49:14.341 --> 01:49:15.174
<v Speaker 1>Who's got the papers?</v>

4085
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:15.700
<v Speaker 1>You've got to just,</v>

4086
01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it's my problem with the occupy,</v>

4087
01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:17.850
<v Speaker 1>occupy Wall Street stuff.</v>

4088
01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I just don't quite understand.</v>

4089
01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I like the rising up and stating your mind and stuff.</v>

4090
01:49:22.441 --> 01:49:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand who you're picketing forward,</v>

4091
01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:25.140
<v Speaker 1>what results you're hoping for.</v>

4092
01:49:25.610 --> 01:49:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4093
01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.140
<v Speaker 1>they want change and I don't know,</v>

4094
01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.380
<v Speaker 1>but the super rich,</v>

4095
01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.030
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones,</v>

4096
01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:30.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4097
01:49:30.391 --> 01:49:31.060
<v Speaker 1>are they going to be like,</v>

4098
01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:31.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4099
01:49:31.150 --> 01:49:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm to not affecting me in any way.</v>

4100
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:33.490
<v Speaker 1>The good thing is what they're,</v>

4101
01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.320
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is getting people to think that this is a very unstable situation</v>

4102
01:49:37.321 --> 01:49:40.950
<v Speaker 1>and because it is and that people are fed up because they are and they should</v>

4103
01:49:40.951 --> 01:49:41.251
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

4104
01:49:41.251 --> 01:49:44.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a fucking terrible financial system.</v>

4105
01:49:44.730 --> 01:49:45.870
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

4106
01:49:46.050 --> 01:49:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

4107
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I know that billions of dollars had been thrown around in the form of bailouts</v>

4108
01:49:51.821 --> 01:49:56.000
<v Speaker 1>and some say much more than that if you follow the accounting because yeah,</v>

4109
01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:59.890
<v Speaker 1>they forced the force an audit and Ron Paul had something to do with this and</v>

4110
01:49:59.891 --> 01:50:00.990
<v Speaker 1>they shout out,</v>

4111
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 1>there was just fucking,</v>

4112
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:06.190
<v Speaker 1>just insane amounts of money loaned to all these different creepy clients all</v>

4113
01:50:06.191 --> 01:50:10.540
<v Speaker 1>over the world and bailouts just put in left and right and it's all our tax</v>

4114
01:50:10.541 --> 01:50:10.781
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

4115
01:50:10.781 --> 01:50:10.991
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4116
01:50:10.991 --> 01:50:11.741
<v Speaker 1>It's all scary.</v>

4117
01:50:11.741 --> 01:50:15.400
<v Speaker 1>They spent all our fucking money and we're broke and we're in two wars at the</v>

4118
01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:16.234
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

4119
01:50:16.330 --> 01:50:21.330
<v Speaker 1>And no one has any solution that seems to want to deviate from the current path.</v>

4120
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's solution is stay on the current path and manage it better.</v>

4121
01:50:26.891 --> 01:50:27.670
<v Speaker 1>So then there,</v>

4122
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:28.510
<v Speaker 1>except Ron Paul,</v>

4123
01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:29.171
<v Speaker 1>what does he know?</v>

4124
01:50:29.171 --> 01:50:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He has a better solution.</v>

4125
01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:30.281
<v Speaker 1>What's his,</v>

4126
01:50:30.281 --> 01:50:31.720
<v Speaker 1>how he wants everybody back.</v>

4127
01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:32.141
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4128
01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:32.974
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

4129
01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:33.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4130
01:50:33.551 --> 01:50:34.271
<v Speaker 1>and because of that,</v>

4131
01:50:34.271 --> 01:50:35.470
<v Speaker 1>they don't even pay attention to him.</v>

4132
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 1>There's this new guy that they're following.</v>

4133
01:50:37.151 --> 01:50:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It was this black guy,</v>

4134
01:50:37.930 --> 01:50:38.500
<v Speaker 1>the black guy.</v>

4135
01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:39.191
<v Speaker 1>Herman pain.</v>

4136
01:50:39.191 --> 01:50:40.024
<v Speaker 1>Is that what his name is?</v>

4137
01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Haven't we had enough?</v>

4138
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:42.873
<v Speaker 1>I just kidding.</v>

4139
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.560
<v Speaker 1>He's a black Republican.</v>

4140
01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:44.851
<v Speaker 1>They sent,</v>

4141
01:50:44.851 --> 01:50:48.580
<v Speaker 1>said they've sent in Mothra to battle with Godzilla or he's not going to run.</v>

4142
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Jay's run.</v>

4143
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:51.550
<v Speaker 1>He's the black guys ahead.</v>

4144
01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4145
01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:52.750
<v Speaker 1>he's a head right now.</v>

4146
01:50:52.751 --> 01:50:52.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4147
01:50:52.981 --> 01:50:53.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4148
01:50:53.111 --> 01:50:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4149
01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.990
<v Speaker 1>We need to find out if you ever thought about robbing and shooting up.</v>

4150
01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:58.110
<v Speaker 1>This guy is different.</v>

4151
01:50:58.210 --> 01:50:59.570
<v Speaker 1>He's such a Republican treatment.</v>

4152
01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:00.700
<v Speaker 1>He says that if a,</v>

4153
01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:01.571
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a job,</v>

4154
01:51:01.571 --> 01:51:02.470
<v Speaker 1>that's your fault.</v>

4155
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:03.041
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4156
01:51:03.041 --> 01:51:03.431
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay.</v>

4157
01:51:03.431 --> 01:51:04.041
<v Speaker 1>If you're not rich,</v>

4158
01:51:04.041 --> 01:51:04.874
<v Speaker 1>it's your fault.</v>

4159
01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about doing that,</v>

4160
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

4161
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

4162
01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4163
01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.100
<v Speaker 1>when he was retiring in a different country,</v>

4164
01:51:09.101 --> 01:51:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4165
01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking Cat Stevens.</v>

4166
01:51:10.601 --> 01:51:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Sing out was in France.</v>

4167
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Mostly it's us cars or cars or traditionally our conditioning.</v>

4168
01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:19.753
<v Speaker 1>Herman Cain,</v>

4169
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that's his name.</v>

4170
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:21.401
<v Speaker 1>Herman Cain.</v>

4171
01:51:21.401 --> 01:51:22.990
<v Speaker 1>He's a very successful businessman,</v>

4172
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of those occupy wall should be,</v>

4173
01:51:24.931 --> 01:51:27.670
<v Speaker 1>we want to do away with capitalism as a,</v>

4174
01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4175
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4176
01:51:28.781 --> 01:51:30.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of Hippie bitches out there that need a punch.</v>

4177
01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I think that's their problem.</v>

4178
01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like why should 1% habit,</v>

4179
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:34.480
<v Speaker 1>we should all be equal in this long.</v>

4180
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You're proposing a giant change.</v>

4181
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:37.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of no.</v>

4182
01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:38.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4183
01:51:38.321 --> 01:51:39.220
<v Speaker 1>that's not cool.</v>

4184
01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:39.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4185
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

4186
01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't deserve to be equal.</v>

4187
01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:41.861
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4188
01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:45.730
<v Speaker 1>What you deserve as a fair system to compete in the tax breaks for the rich.</v>

4189
01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just look so shitty.</v>

4190
01:51:47.441 --> 01:51:49.630
<v Speaker 1>There should always be benefit for performance.</v>

4191
01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 1>That's why what makes human beings excel?</v>

4192
01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.710
<v Speaker 1>It should be a benefit for performance.</v>

4193
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:54.820
<v Speaker 1>So your ideas,</v>

4194
01:51:54.821 --> 01:51:56.140
<v Speaker 1>your socialistic nonsense,</v>

4195
01:51:56.141 --> 01:51:56.541
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

4196
01:51:56.541 --> 01:51:58.300
<v Speaker 1>It violates human behavior.</v>

4197
01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It violates everything that we know about how people operate and how people</v>

4198
01:52:02.231 --> 01:52:03.064
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

4199
01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.330
<v Speaker 1>We like to compete with each other.</v>

4200
01:52:04.331 --> 01:52:05.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

4201
01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:06.400
<v Speaker 1>We like to prove that we're worthy.</v>

4202
01:52:06.401 --> 01:52:08.150
<v Speaker 1>We liked to create things that people enjoy.</v>

4203
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.720
<v Speaker 1>We like to put out a bunch of things and would like to be rewarded for that.</v>

4204
01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4205
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.883
<v Speaker 1>Hippies.</v>

4206
01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:13.950
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

4207
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Just because you can't run doesn't mean other people can't run.</v>

4208
01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

4209
01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:17.860
<v Speaker 1>They want to run.</v>

4210
01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Let us run.</v>

4211
01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

4212
01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:22.090
<v Speaker 1>All it seems like they've succeeded in doing is getting cops in trouble for</v>

4213
01:52:22.091 --> 01:52:22.924
<v Speaker 1>beating on them.</v>

4214
01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.050
<v Speaker 1>We're all like one man.</v>

4215
01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:25.991
<v Speaker 1>They should be new.</v>

4216
01:52:25.991 --> 01:52:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Many man,</v>

4217
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:28.181
<v Speaker 1>there should be money.</v>

4218
01:52:28.181 --> 01:52:28.541
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

4219
01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:30.130
<v Speaker 1>you should be a fair system.</v>

4220
01:52:30.131 --> 01:52:33.070
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be one piece of gold equals one donkey.</v>

4221
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be,</v>

4222
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:34.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4223
01:52:34.661 --> 01:52:38.800
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be based on that problem or 1% will still own all the gold.</v>

4224
01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:39.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4225
01:52:39.311 --> 01:52:40.330
<v Speaker 1>but so fucking what?</v>

4226
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.611
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4227
01:52:40.611 --> 01:52:42.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a capitalist game,</v>

4228
01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:42.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4229
01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:45.560
<v Speaker 1>trying to get a cap on it.</v>

4230
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4231
01:52:46.011 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be bad to put a ridiculous cap.</v>

4232
01:52:47.781 --> 01:52:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Like say you can't have more than $10 billion ever and everything more than $10</v>

4233
01:52:51.970 --> 01:52:52.101
<v Speaker 1>billion go.</v>

4234
01:52:52.101 --> 01:52:52.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4235
01:52:52.371 --> 01:52:52.791
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

4236
01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking give it to charity and you'd just be laughing in Baldwin.</v>

4237
01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.110
<v Speaker 1>So wouldn't stop you from,</v>

4238
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4239
01:52:57.710 --> 01:52:57.921
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4240
01:52:57.921 --> 01:53:00.950
<v Speaker 1>you'd still be wanting to make a lot of money if you were that dude who was out</v>

4241
01:53:00.951 --> 01:53:01.784
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

4242
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4243
01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I can ask what am I 10 billion.</v>

4244
01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Most of them don't get like that.</v>

4245
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Whatever makes a guy like bill gates become a guy like bill gates.</v>

4246
01:53:09.561 --> 01:53:09.871
<v Speaker 1>Make some,</v>

4247
01:53:09.871 --> 01:53:12.590
<v Speaker 1>keep putting in more money and keep working until they're old men.</v>

4248
01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:13.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4249
01:53:13.251 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Speaker 1>they enjoy it.</v>

4250
01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates could have retired like with windows 95 he could have just sold that</v>

4251
01:53:18.111 --> 01:53:18.944
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

4252
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:20.593
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have,</v>

4253
01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:22.761
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

4254
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:23.594
<v Speaker 1>you need a,</v>

4255
01:53:23.650 --> 01:53:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you need a competitor now windows me cause but the Mac Osx back then sucked the,</v>

4256
01:53:29.361 --> 01:53:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean not OSX before,</v>

4257
01:53:30.861 --> 01:53:31.700
<v Speaker 1>pre Osx,</v>

4258
01:53:31.701 --> 01:53:32.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

4259
01:53:32.370 --> 01:53:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Steve jobs started back off.</v>

4260
01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:37.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a reason I didn't want to switch over to Mac cause because their ios nine</v>

4261
01:53:37.431 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 1>or before it was really hard to use.</v>

4262
01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't see what was open and it was just like way harder to use.</v>

4263
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember when John Carmax started coding for the Mac when they first started.</v>

4264
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Tried to port it software games or the Mac and he was like,</v>

4265
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:51.381
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

4266
01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:52.460
<v Speaker 1>like she's things are crap.</v>

4267
01:53:52.461 --> 01:53:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember they said there was no multitasking and the operating system,</v>

4268
01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:59.870
<v Speaker 1>no preemptive multitasking and no memory protection and the things are just shut</v>

4269
01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:00.930
<v Speaker 1>down crash.</v>

4270
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And it was like talking to me to make a blog about how many times he had to</v>

4271
01:54:03.491 --> 01:54:04.324
<v Speaker 1>reboot,</v>

4272
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:05.300
<v Speaker 1>just crash.</v>

4273
01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:08.330
<v Speaker 1>But then they get that Osx and it became much better at all.</v>

4274
01:54:08.331 --> 01:54:09.010
<v Speaker 1>It's dope.</v>

4275
01:54:09.010 --> 01:54:10.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the future.</v>

4276
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:10.701
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

4277
01:54:10.701 --> 01:54:11.380

4280
01:54:12.651 --> 01:54:15.020
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some new shit in like 10 years.</v>

4281
01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:18.290
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make this look like we're playing pong.</v>

4282
01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:19.500
<v Speaker 1>When they did away with the,</v>

4283
01:54:19.501 --> 01:54:19.910
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

4284
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:20.743
<v Speaker 1>with the um,</v>

4285
01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:21.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4286
01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:22.453
<v Speaker 1>just drive,</v>

4287
01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:22.881
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:23.530
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys</v>

4289

<v Speaker 6>The no one's you're idiots.</v>

4291
01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:28.510
<v Speaker 6>We got put a floppy in.</v>

4292
01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:29.650
<v Speaker 6>We had so many people.</v>

4293
01:54:29.651 --> 01:54:30.461
<v Speaker 6>When I worked at gateway,</v>

4294
01:54:30.461 --> 01:54:35.461
<v Speaker 6>that was right when we stopped putting disk drives and our computers and like</v>

4295
01:54:35.591 --> 01:54:36.131
<v Speaker 6>you could still,</v>

4296
01:54:36.131 --> 01:54:36.370
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

4297
01:54:36.370 --> 01:54:40.930
<v Speaker 6>we still have this external one that you could like hook up a using USP and</v>

4298
01:54:40.931 --> 01:54:42.370
<v Speaker 6>people got so angry.</v>

4299
01:54:42.371 --> 01:54:43.240
<v Speaker 6>People come in and goes,</v>

4300
01:54:43.241 --> 01:54:44.074
<v Speaker 6>you guys are,</v>

4301
01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.580
<v Speaker 1>we don't want change.</v>

4302
01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.020
<v Speaker 1>They want it floppy disks.</v>

4303
01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:50.250
<v Speaker 1>They wanted that.</v>

4304
01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's works fine.</v>

4305
01:54:51.451 --> 01:54:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Why are you messing with the system?</v>

4306
01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:56.340
<v Speaker 6>I saw one on the sidewalk the other day.</v>

4307
01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to pick it up and I'm like,</v>

4308
01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:00.800
<v Speaker 6>I wonder why I'm the fuck's on this floppy disk on the sidewalk,</v>

4309
01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:01.461
<v Speaker 6>but I was like,</v>

4310
01:55:01.461 --> 01:55:01.581
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>

4311
01:55:01.581 --> 01:55:02.720
<v Speaker 6>I don't even have a floppy disk.</v>

4312
01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:05.161
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

4313
01:55:05.161 --> 01:55:06.900
<v Speaker 1>someday those are going to be fascinating.</v>

4314
01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Someday they're going to be really fast.</v>

4315
01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I just got rid of my floppy disks when I the hoard it.</v>

4316
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:11.250
<v Speaker 1>You just do.</v>

4317
01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I had some old Macquarie,</v>

4318
01:55:12.230 --> 01:55:13.200
<v Speaker 1>like a script on it or something.</v>

4319
01:55:13.201 --> 01:55:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'd be all ended up essentially it was like,</v>

4320
01:55:14.671 --> 01:55:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Ari,</v>

4321
01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:16.710
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to put this in anywhere.</v>

4322
01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Just throw it away.</v>

4323
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:18.151
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4324
01:55:18.151 --> 01:55:18.984
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

4325
01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:20.093
<v Speaker 1>I would have kept it.</v>

4326
01:55:20.670 --> 01:55:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I did keep it for fucking 20 years for no reason.</v>

4327
01:55:23.730 --> 01:55:24.341
<v Speaker 1>I had one,</v>

4328
01:55:24.341 --> 01:55:24.991
<v Speaker 1>an old,</v>

4329
01:55:24.991 --> 01:55:25.351
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

4330
01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:28.860
<v Speaker 1>old Mac laptop computer that had like,</v>

4331
01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:30.361
<v Speaker 1>it was thick,</v>

4332
01:55:30.361 --> 01:55:33.960
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking brick and it was like a big ass computer.</v>

4333
01:55:33.961 --> 01:55:37.410
<v Speaker 1>But the screen inside it's pretty small and it had a track ball.</v>

4334
01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I like the train track,</v>

4335
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember of my favorite ones,</v>

4336
01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but the little none of that look like it.</v>

4337
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Like some little ads.</v>

4338
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Ibm thinkpad,</v>

4339
01:55:46.201 --> 01:55:47.910
<v Speaker 1>that red dot on there that you can mess with.</v>

4340
01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:50.370
<v Speaker 1>So when we were talking about this iPhone Karma,</v>

4341
01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:50.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4342
01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:53.940
<v Speaker 1>the idea of it being a at an American phone and you know,</v>

4343
01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 1>you could actually pay for it.</v>

4344
01:55:54.841 --> 01:55:56.670
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that they do them in Brazil now?</v>

4345
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:57.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4346
01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.033
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

4347
01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.930
<v Speaker 6>they do them in this factory in Brazil I think.</v>

4348
01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:04.090
<v Speaker 6>I think they just are mixing it up because uh,</v>

4349
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:05.123
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4350
01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 6>the company that is manufacturing the four s actually had this idea in their</v>

4351
01:56:09.931 --> 01:56:14.190
<v Speaker 6>head like how many they were going to have to make and they just found out.</v>

4352
01:56:14.191 --> 01:56:16.650
<v Speaker 6>But from all these preorders that so many people are ordering it,</v>

4353
01:56:16.651 --> 01:56:19.860
<v Speaker 6>it's about 50% more than they anticipated.</v>

4354
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:21.390
<v Speaker 6>50% more,</v>

4355
01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.081
<v Speaker 6>the percent more.</v>

4356
01:56:22.081 --> 01:56:24.480
<v Speaker 6>So I think what they have to do is just supply and demand.</v>

4357
01:56:24.481 --> 01:56:27.140
<v Speaker 6>Like Foxconn can't have an extra can't handle.</v>

4358
01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:27.931
<v Speaker 6>He can't handle that.</v>

4359
01:56:27.931 --> 01:56:29.460
<v Speaker 6>Especially if they're probably doing the IPAD too,</v>

4360
01:56:29.461 --> 01:56:31.860
<v Speaker 6>so they're just that splitting up the factories now.</v>

4361
01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:32.911
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

4362
01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:34.220
<v Speaker 6>it's just like anything you do.</v>

4363
01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:34.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4364
01:56:34.611 --> 01:56:35.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like that episode of what's happening.</v>

4365
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:39.740
<v Speaker 1>When Raj got that deal to print up the Christmas cards and birthday cards and</v>

4366
01:56:39.741 --> 01:56:41.900
<v Speaker 1>stuff and then they gave him such a large order that he,</v>

4367
01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:43.700
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't handle it and they had to go to business.</v>

4368
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Was that a quiz?</v>

4369
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.680
<v Speaker 1>It could have been anything.</v>

4370
01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you actually remember that plot.</v>

4371
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:54.711
<v Speaker 1>Different episodes.</v>

4372
01:56:54.711 --> 01:56:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4373
01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I never wanted her to sit.</v>

4374
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:56.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4375
01:56:56.001 --> 01:56:56.450
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

4376
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:57.140
<v Speaker 1>the order too much.</v>

4377
01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:58.130
<v Speaker 1>You had to go on a business.</v>

4378
01:56:58.131 --> 01:56:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that at all,</v>

4379
01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:01.273
<v Speaker 1>but it made sense to them.</v>

4380
01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:03.140
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

4381
01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:04.050
<v Speaker 1>it's only black people watching.</v>

4382
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.903
<v Speaker 1>Just say it.</v>

4383
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Probably Jimmy Walker got really upset after a while and didn't want to say</v>

4384
01:57:07.821 --> 01:57:08.720
<v Speaker 1>dynamite anymore.</v>

4385
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:09.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4386
01:57:09.111 --> 01:57:09.944
<v Speaker 1>he hated it.</v>

4387
01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:11.031
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

4388
01:57:11.031 --> 01:57:11.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4389
01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:12.350
<v Speaker 1>he was tortured by it.</v>

4390
01:57:12.351 --> 01:57:13.184
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

4391
01:57:13.190 --> 01:57:13.401
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4392
01:57:13.401 --> 01:57:13.521
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4393
01:57:13.521 --> 01:57:14.120
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of weird.</v>

4394
01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:15.440
<v Speaker 6>You probably just get sick of saying it,</v>

4395
01:57:15.441 --> 01:57:16.430
<v Speaker 6>but you remember the old saying,</v>

4396
01:57:16.431 --> 01:57:17.960
<v Speaker 6>where's the beef now?</v>

4397
01:57:17.961 --> 01:57:19.450
<v Speaker 6>Bringing that shit back now too.</v>

4398
01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:19.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4399
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:21.320
<v Speaker 6>it's is long dead,</v>

4400
01:57:21.321 --> 01:57:21.750
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>

4401
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:22.130
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

4402
01:57:22.130 --> 01:57:23.430
<v Speaker 6>Long before I met her one,</v>

4403
01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you met the where's the beef lady?</v>

4404
01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4405
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:29.640
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever said that.</v>

4406
01:57:29.641 --> 01:57:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

4407
01:57:30.330 --> 01:57:31.950
<v Speaker 1>In all the years that woman existed.</v>

4408
01:57:31.951 --> 01:57:36.930
<v Speaker 1>So now my mom was an executive secretary for the Whitney's corporation from in</v>

4409
01:57:36.931 --> 01:57:37.231
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

4410
01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:38.064
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>

4411
01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I had a Wendy's today feel very guilty.</v>

4412
01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4413
01:57:43.231 --> 01:57:43.561
<v Speaker 1>you don't want,</v>

4414
01:57:43.561 --> 01:57:47.010
<v Speaker 1>as far as like fast food cheeseburgers go pretty fucking sporty.</v>

4415
01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:48.120
<v Speaker 1>You feel better about that one,</v>

4416
01:57:48.121 --> 01:57:48.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4417
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Then other ones?</v>

4418
01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:49.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4419
01:57:49.331 --> 01:57:50.070
<v Speaker 1>It tastes better.</v>

4420
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.551
<v Speaker 1>It tastes better.</v>

4421
01:57:50.551 --> 01:57:51.384
<v Speaker 1>You can tell it's hot.</v>

4422
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:52.260
<v Speaker 1>They just made it,</v>

4423
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4424
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm pissed off at Carl's junior right now.</v>

4425
01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:56.370
<v Speaker 6>He's on the Midwest,</v>

4426
01:57:56.370 --> 01:58:00.810
<v Speaker 6>but that new steak burger they show where it's this humongous steak burger with</v>

4427
01:58:00.811 --> 01:58:04.860
<v Speaker 6>blue cheese and onion rings and it falls onto the TV and it's bouncing and</v>

4428
01:58:04.861 --> 01:58:05.940
<v Speaker 6>beautiful and huge.</v>

4429
01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:06.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4430
01:58:06.930 --> 01:58:07.200
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4431
01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:07.360
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4432
01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.161
<v Speaker 6>it looked like CGI.</v>

4433
01:58:08.161 --> 01:58:08.730
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

4434
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:10.950
<v Speaker 6>I just got it the other day and it looked like somebody sat on it.</v>

4435
01:58:12.930 --> 01:58:13.471
<v Speaker 6>What the heck?</v>

4436
01:58:13.471 --> 01:58:14.670
<v Speaker 6>This is all smooshed.</v>

4437
01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:15.780
<v Speaker 6>Where's all the fucking shit?</v>

4438
01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.580
<v Speaker 6>So they made me a new one and I just didn't even look.</v>

4439
01:58:17.581 --> 01:58:20.490
<v Speaker 6>I just took it home and I opened it up and in the same fucking thing,</v>

4440
01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:21.300
<v Speaker 6>it was just,</v>

4441
01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:26.100
<v Speaker 6>it was just like the most pitiful looking fucking nasty burger and maybe Matt.</v>

4442
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:26.480
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4443
01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I've always said that.</v>

4444
01:58:27.321 --> 01:58:28.490
<v Speaker 1>That's like actresses.</v>

4445
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:31.580
<v Speaker 1>You get them home and they'll never look like the pictures,</v>

4446
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.670
<v Speaker 1>like their head shots when they got the glamor shots,</v>

4447
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:35.360
<v Speaker 1>the some,</v>

4448
01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.830
<v Speaker 1>some actresses or cheeseburgers,</v>

4449
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4450
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:38.810
<v Speaker 1>he's talked to my agent about it.</v>

4451
01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:40.250
<v Speaker 1>He said he had girls sometimes where he's like,</v>

4452
01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.180
<v Speaker 1>you're a quirky.</v>

4453
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:43.750
<v Speaker 1>If you get this headshot that makes you look like a model,</v>

4454
01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:44.950
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be brought in for stuff.</v>

4455
01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:46.960
<v Speaker 1>You'll never book what's wrong with you?</v>

4456
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:49.040
<v Speaker 1>It goes off my glasses on and they want to be hot.</v>

4457
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Two pictures,</v>

<v Speaker 1>best friend.</v>

4459
01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:52.060
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be wacky.</v>

4460
01:58:52.061 --> 01:58:53.110
<v Speaker 1>The wacky best friend.</v>

4461
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:54.500
<v Speaker 1>How did the redhead from,</v>

4462
01:58:54.510 --> 01:58:56.710
<v Speaker 1>from your show and from suddenly Susan deal with that?</v>

4463
01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:57.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4464
01:58:57.941 --> 01:59:00.550
<v Speaker 1>the one from suddenly Susan started hanging around with a bunch of gay dudes,</v>

4465
01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.040
<v Speaker 1>so you got drunk you to draw that way.</v>

4466
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.211
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Griffin,</v>

4467
01:59:04.211 --> 01:59:05.044
<v Speaker 1>she's killing him.</v>

4468
01:59:05.050 --> 01:59:05.883
<v Speaker 1>She's killing it.</v>

4469
01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4470
01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:07.991
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves her.</v>

4471
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:08.320
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

4472
01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:08.920
<v Speaker 1>she's funny.</v>

4473
01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.753
<v Speaker 1>She's funny.</v>

4474
01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:10.571
<v Speaker 1>She's cool too.</v>

4475
01:59:10.571 --> 01:59:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I liked her and then Vicky,</v>

4476
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.950
<v Speaker 1>she's just,</v>

4477
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:14.783
<v Speaker 1>she does a lot of,</v>

4478
01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Broadway.</v>

4479
01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:17.711
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4480
01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It's actually really real acting.</v>

4481
01:59:19.001 --> 01:59:19.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4482
01:59:19.241 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 1>she's an amazing singer.</v>

4483
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 1>She's got an incredible voice,</v>

4484
01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:22.660
<v Speaker 1>like a really,</v>

4485
01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like probably her first love all the answers,</v>

4486
01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:26.651
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>

4487
01:59:26.651 --> 01:59:26.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4488
01:59:26.951 --> 01:59:27.610
<v Speaker 1>she always does.</v>

4489
01:59:27.610 --> 01:59:29.350
<v Speaker 1>She's always on sitcoms and stuff too.</v>

4490
01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:30.730
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

4491
01:59:30.730 --> 01:59:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how they deal with that though.</v>

4492
01:59:31.721 --> 01:59:32.030
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

4493
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4494
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be quirky.</v>

4495
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:34.000
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

4496
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I know it was the cute girl when I grew up,</v>

4497
01:59:35.321 --> 01:59:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but in la it looks a little different.</v>

4498
01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Vicky had a hot body though.</v>

4499
01:59:39.170 --> 01:59:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Really thank you Lewis.</v>

4500
01:59:40.071 --> 01:59:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4501
01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:41.043
<v Speaker 1>she's a dancer.</v>

4502
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:42.940
<v Speaker 1>She had a hot body and that's nice.</v>

4503
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:43.601
<v Speaker 1>She's quirky,</v>

4504
01:59:43.601 --> 01:59:44.434
<v Speaker 1>but she was</v>

4505
01:59:45.690 --> 01:59:46.990
<v Speaker 1>the robot scroll by robot.</v>

4506
01:59:47.250 --> 01:59:49.030
<v Speaker 1>This high school on the way over here.</v>

4507
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4508
01:59:49.570 --> 01:59:51.940
<v Speaker 1>and they were playing Lacrosse and all of these high school girls had their</v>

4509
01:59:51.941 --> 01:59:53.720
<v Speaker 1>shorts shorts on.</v>

4510
01:59:55.090 --> 01:59:55.871
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking,</v>

4511
01:59:55.871 --> 01:59:57.300
<v Speaker 1>they have the best legs.</v>

4512
01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that that's like that?</v>

4513
02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:00.851
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

4514
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't fuck them.</v>

4515
02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:01.931
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4516
02:00:01.931 --> 02:00:02.591
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

4517
02:00:02.591 --> 02:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>You're an old man and they're young and you know,</v>

4518
02:00:05.710 --> 02:00:06.520
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't know,</v>

4519
02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.090
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4520
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:07.780
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4521
02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:08.171
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4522
02:00:08.171 --> 02:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4523
02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4524
02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>but why is,</v>

4525
02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:11.463
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

4526
02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here and explain what's happening to my peanuts.</v>

4527
02:00:14.010 --> 02:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

4528
02:00:14.650 --> 02:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>When do we blend that we make,</v>

4529
02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>we make a cutoff at 18 and that arbitrary cutoff means that this girl can handle</v>

4530
02:00:20.801 --> 02:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4531
02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:21.491
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

4532
02:00:21.491 --> 02:00:21.671
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4533
02:00:21.671 --> 02:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I know you're just gonna fuck her.</v>

4534
02:00:22.591 --> 02:00:23.001
<v Speaker 1>I forget her,</v>

4535
02:00:23.001 --> 02:00:23.834
<v Speaker 1>but now it's legal.</v>

4536
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>At 18 the bell rings,</v>

4537
02:00:26.981 --> 02:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>we've decided that enough time has gone by,</v>

4538
02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:30.730
<v Speaker 1>the chicken has hatched,</v>

4539
02:00:30.930 --> 02:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

4540
02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It's ready for delivery.</v>

4541
02:00:32.951 --> 02:00:33.611
<v Speaker 1>Go run.</v>

4542
02:00:33.611 --> 02:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>And he gets run.</v>

4543
02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:38.230
<v Speaker 1>And the moment the clocks takes 12 you can shove your cognitive,</v>

4544
02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but if you put it in five minutes before the clock ticks 12,</v>

4545
02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:41.913
<v Speaker 1>they could lock you.</v>

4546
02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

4547
02:00:42.450 --> 02:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>rub it on the outside until 12th can't even do the hell.</v>

4548
02:00:45.341 --> 02:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't even talk about it on a podcast.</v>

4549
02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>You can't even have a talking about it on the,</v>

4550
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4551
02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>so for the record,</v>

4552
02:00:52.181 --> 02:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>this girl that we're talking about is 23.</v>

4553
02:00:53.471 --> 02:00:54.304
<v Speaker 1>It just looks really young.</v>

4554
02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4555
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about is when a person turns 18 that's what we're talking about.</v>

4556
02:00:58.781 --> 02:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

4557
02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird that we have like a little fucking,</v>

4558
02:01:01.730 --> 02:01:02.291
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>

4559
02:01:02.291 --> 02:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>especially when you see those girls that are 17 and you look,</v>

4560
02:01:04.061 --> 02:01:04.451

<v Speaker 1>It's rude that girls don't get that though.</v>

4573
02:01:26.891 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Girls don't look at 15 year old boys and go women.</v>

02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:40.850

4582
02:01:40.851 --> 02:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>they're at their best when they're 17,</v>

4583
02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>if anyone has passed that you're gone downhill.</v>

4590
02:01:55.671 --> 02:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Like little girls do not like older men in the 30s.</v>

4639
02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:18.960

4650
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:34.160
<v Speaker 1>They have weird ones like New Mexico.</v>

4651
02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I think a man to boy is like 13 man to a boy.</v>

4652
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:39.330

02:03:40.130 --> 02:03:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Talk to the young boys.</v>

02:03:41.010 --> 02:03:41.120
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4657
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.860
<v Speaker 1>they'll protect them in New Mexico as a smarter,</v>

4658
02:03:42.861 --> 02:03:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I might've made that up.</v>

4659
02:03:44.970 --> 02:03:45.803
<v Speaker 1>It's fast</v>

4660
02:03:48.670 --> 02:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>and I really don't know.</v>

4661
02:03:49.941 --> 02:03:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like 70% sure.</v>

4662
02:03:51.141 --> 02:03:54.050
<v Speaker 1>I know it was a fact at one point in time that one state had that I thought it</v>

4663
02:03:54.051 --> 02:03:57.020
<v Speaker 1>was New Mexico and I was using it in this piece that I was writing about,</v>

4664
02:03:57.021 --> 02:03:57.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4665
02:03:57.230 --> 02:03:57.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4666
02:03:57.660 --> 02:04:01.520
<v Speaker 1>about fucking Catholics and how weird it is that they take Catholics when they</v>

4667
02:04:01.521 --> 02:04:04.160
<v Speaker 1>get accused of child molesting and they just ship them out of state and they do</v>

4668
02:04:04.161 --> 02:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>it on a regular basis.</v>

4669
02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:06.241
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering,</v>

4670
02:04:06.241 --> 02:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4671
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:09.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe they shift them to places where the laws were different and I'm like,</v>

4672
02:04:09.051 --> 02:04:10.130
<v Speaker 1>what law would be different?</v>

4673
02:04:10.131 --> 02:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>And then it finds out that New Mexico was one that had a weird law.</v>

4674
02:04:13.451 --> 02:04:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I was like men to women was like 16 but men to boy was like 13 and I'm like,</v>

4675
02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:18.321
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4676
02:04:18.321 --> 02:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>who to hear how your organization is acting.</v>

4677
02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Totally making my own connection.</v>

4678
02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:25.461
<v Speaker 1>So that's why.</v>

4679
02:04:25.461 --> 02:04:28.610
<v Speaker 1>But I remember reading all these different various state laws.</v>

4680
02:04:28.611 --> 02:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be careful.</v>

4681
02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.920
<v Speaker 1>You have to drag a girl across a certain spot that don't yet.</v>

4682
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:33.470
<v Speaker 1>We fucking also take someone under age,</v>

4683
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:34.850
<v Speaker 1>across state border.</v>

4684
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Even if you live close to the border,</v>

4685
02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

4686
02:04:37.210 --> 02:04:40.130
<v Speaker 1>it's just going over there like Kentucky and Cincinnati when they just sort of</v>

4687
02:04:40.131 --> 02:04:40.741
<v Speaker 1>at twine,</v>

4688
02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>they're right next to each other.</v>

4689
02:04:41.611 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 1>The Kentucky Airport is,</v>

4690
02:04:42.781 --> 02:04:44.580
<v Speaker 1>or this incident in airports in Kentucky.</v>

4691
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It's real bizarre.</v>

4692
02:04:47.130 --> 02:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>So like there you who if what's the agent candidates lower there too,</v>

4699
02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:04.200
<v Speaker 1>not going to have a great memory of this,</v>

4700
02:05:04.201 --> 02:05:05.130
<v Speaker 1>but it will help her grow.</v>

4701
02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:05.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4702
02:05:05.791 --> 02:05:06.121
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4703
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:07.920
<v Speaker 1>everybody's had awkward sexual moments,</v>

4704
02:05:07.921 --> 02:05:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4705
02:05:08.250 --> 02:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully she's around nice people and nothing bad happens to her.</v>

4706
02:05:10.801 --> 02:05:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course everybody wants that,</v>

4707
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:15.200
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point in time get a lot of person to be a person and what year,</v>

4708
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:16.700
<v Speaker 1>what year is that?</v>

4709
02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Is Not bad to have sex with somebody you want to have sex with.</v>

4710
02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Relate to.</v>

4711
02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4712
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Like someone said this to me like,</v>

4713
02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>well you know how you got to treat your daughters and they start dating.</v>

4714
02:05:24.781 --> 02:05:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I go there.</v>

4715
02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:26.940
<v Speaker 1>They're girls.</v>

4716
02:05:27.090 --> 02:05:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Girls like boys and girls like boys have boys like girls.</v>

4717
02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's my job to make sure that they see what a nice guy is like.</v>

4718
02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:35.100
<v Speaker 1>You know where that question comes from.</v>

4719
02:05:35.130 --> 02:05:36.770
<v Speaker 1>That question comes from the ideal that you're like,</v>

4720
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4721
02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I think sort of sex as victimization of women.</v>

4722
02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also the idea of someone shoving their cock and your baby.</v>

4723
02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4724
02:05:44.230 --> 02:05:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that you raise this child.</v>

4725
02:05:46.021 --> 02:05:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Since there was this little bit that it's something bad,</v>

4726
02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:49.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to happen to them.</v>

4727
02:05:49.681 --> 02:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>But it's also you just,</v>

4728
02:05:51.391 --> 02:05:54.780
<v Speaker 1>you're losing the innocence of their youth even if they want it.</v>

4729
02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 1>What about a guy shopping is talking to a girl that looks the same sort of</v>

4730
02:05:58.140 --> 02:05:58.973
<v Speaker 1>innocence of youth?</v>

4731
02:05:59.120 --> 02:05:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

4732
02:05:59.530 --> 02:06:00.780
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if the guy loses,</v>

4733
02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:01.741
<v Speaker 1>the guy loses it.</v>

4734
02:06:01.741 --> 02:06:03.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like a celebration when the girl loses</v>

4735
02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:06.330
<v Speaker 1>cog in the back of,</v>

4736
02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you're a parent that is happening through her.</v>

4737
02:06:08.730 --> 02:06:08.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4738
02:06:08.941 --> 02:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're a parent and you come outside and you,</v>

4739
02:06:11.001 --> 02:06:16.001
<v Speaker 1>you see a foggy car and you peer in and your daughters suck in some guy's cock,</v>

4740
02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:18.270
<v Speaker 1>it's going to bum you out.</v>

4741
02:06:18.271 --> 02:06:19.104
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

4742
02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:20.113
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

4743
02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:21.600
<v Speaker 1>It's going to bum you out,</v>

4744
02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4745
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:22.651
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like saying it.</v>

4746
02:06:22.651 --> 02:06:23.880
<v Speaker 1>If it's like someone that like,</v>

4747
02:06:24.090 --> 02:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I know and sort of not like have a crush on,</v>

4748
02:06:26.271 --> 02:06:27.660
<v Speaker 1>but sort of just like as a human,</v>

4749
02:06:28.050 --> 02:06:30.660
<v Speaker 1>like if I saw Eleanor fucking below on some guy in a car and be like,</v>

4750
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:31.703

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Somebody Jewish bags and they want to get into arguments too.</v>

5125
02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:15.130
<v Speaker 1>There's some guys that are just professional trolls.</v>

5126
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Like that's all they do is they just say things hoping to upset your feelings</v>

5127
02:17:18.970 --> 02:17:20.050
<v Speaker 1>and hoping to drag,</v>

5128
02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:22.620
<v Speaker 1>drag you into some sort of an arguments and then you're there.</v>

5129
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:27.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like I got in a fight with a fucking Francesca Hilton and I was so mad at</v>

5130
02:17:27.761 --> 02:17:28.810
<v Speaker 1>me letting my slow sad.</v>

5131
02:17:29.130 --> 02:17:29.920
<v Speaker 1>You remember that crate?</v>

5132
02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:31.780
<v Speaker 1>She's like John's his granddaughter or something.</v>

5133
02:17:31.781 --> 02:17:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Her daughter.</v>

5134
02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:32.981
<v Speaker 1>I remember her.</v>

5135
02:17:32.981 --> 02:17:33.910
<v Speaker 1>She was hanging out at the store.</v>

5136
02:17:34.210 --> 02:17:35.043
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5137
02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:36.610
<v Speaker 1>why is she crazy?</v>

5138
02:17:36.611 --> 02:17:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And then Mitzi eventually made her a paid regular for who knows why.</v>

5139
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:40.840
<v Speaker 1>That's why she hangs around.</v>

5140
02:17:41.530 --> 02:17:42.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

5141
02:17:42.131 --> 02:17:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Now I do remember it.</v>

5142
02:17:43.181 --> 02:17:44.080
<v Speaker 1>She's kind of a big girl,</v>

02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.960
<v Speaker 1>So she was in the showroom the other day and she was making noise.</v>

5146
02:17:50.050 --> 02:17:52.750

5149
02:17:55.570 --> 02:17:55.901

5150
02:17:55.901 --> 02:17:56.531
<v Speaker 1>I have one question.</v>

5151
02:17:56.531 --> 02:17:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Why is she in here making noise during a show?</v>

5199
02:18:52.601 --> 02:18:53.290
<v Speaker 1>a certain direction?</v>

<v Speaker 1>no more.</v>

5410
02:23:04.861 --> 02:23:05.700
<v Speaker 1>God's elect out,</v>

5411
02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming as something like for for like a five minute long thing where it's</v>

5412
02:23:08.341 --> 02:23:09.120
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5413
02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:09.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5414
02:23:09.271 --> 02:23:10.710
<v Speaker 1>this makes no sense and CD form.</v>

5415
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:12.023
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

5416
02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5417
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

5418
02:23:13.410 --> 02:23:13.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5419
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:17.850
<v Speaker 1>he said it would always justify what he was doing with his words somehow like</v>

5420
02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:18.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5421
02:23:18.091 --> 02:23:18.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

5422
02:23:18.350 --> 02:23:19.183
<v Speaker 1>to help illustrate it.</v>

5423
02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:19.790
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>

5424
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah that's smart.</v>

5425
02:23:20.701 --> 02:23:22.470
<v Speaker 1>But some people just love like that.</v>

5426
02:23:22.471 --> 02:23:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Just a plain physical comedy.</v>

5427
02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And even though you don't understand what the fuck is going on when you're</v>

5428
02:23:27.421 --> 02:23:28.530
<v Speaker 1>listening to the CD,</v>

5429
02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:30.060
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's okay,</v>

5430
02:23:30.390 --> 02:23:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but here's my thoughts on it.</v>

5431
02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:32.131
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some words,</v>

5432
02:23:32.131 --> 02:23:32.970
<v Speaker 1>cause [inaudible] had this,</v>

5433
02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:33.151
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

5434
02:23:33.151 --> 02:23:33.271
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

5435
02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was listening to cds,</v>

5436
02:23:34.471 --> 02:23:35.640
<v Speaker 1>there was some things I couldn't see.</v>

5437
02:23:35.641 --> 02:23:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I know he made a funny face there,</v>

5438
02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:37.801
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be like,</v>

5439
02:23:37.801 --> 02:23:38.401
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>

5440
02:23:38.401 --> 02:23:40.950
<v Speaker 1>And I was so wish I could also see it live so I can be there.</v>

5441
02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:42.540
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't lose anything out of it.</v>

5442
02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:43.403
<v Speaker 1>Like damn it.</v>

5443
02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:43.711
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

5444
02:23:43.711 --> 02:23:44.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool funny face.</v>

5445
02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:46.840
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing quite so like,</v>

5446
02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:47.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5447
02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:48.960
<v Speaker 1>being live at standup show,</v>

5448
02:23:48.961 --> 02:23:50.340
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a 40 people in the room,</v>

5449
02:23:50.430 --> 02:23:53.670
<v Speaker 1>it's still better than any CD or a special and I think that,</v>

5450
02:23:53.671 --> 02:23:54.001
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5451
02:23:54.001 --> 02:23:56.520
<v Speaker 1>and I think that really if you're going to record a CD,</v>

5452
02:23:56.521 --> 02:23:57.480
<v Speaker 1>if you want to record a special,</v>

5453
02:23:57.481 --> 02:24:00.120
<v Speaker 1>the real way to do it is 200 people.</v>

5454
02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:02.910
<v Speaker 1>That's not what anybody ever wants to hear.</v>

5455
02:24:02.911 --> 02:24:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to do these big giant,</v>

5456
02:24:04.641 --> 02:24:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what this place is around that 200 people.</v>

5457
02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:08.633
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

5458
02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:11.300
<v Speaker 1>First CD I ever did was the last stop in Houston.</v>

5459
02:24:11.370 --> 02:24:13.380
<v Speaker 1>There was the old last up to 50,</v>

5460
02:24:13.381 --> 02:24:14.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

5461
02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I think we got 300 people in there one day and it goes stuffed folding chairs</v>

5462
02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:21.300
<v Speaker 1>off at different level than like a than like an auditorium.</v>

5463
02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5464
02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just did the uh,</v>

5465
02:24:23.790 --> 02:24:26.070
<v Speaker 1>the Verizon wireless theater and Houston,</v>

5466
02:24:26.071 --> 02:24:27.840
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking awesome and it's huge.</v>

5467
02:24:27.841 --> 02:24:29.190
<v Speaker 1>That place is gigantic,</v>

5468
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

5469
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:31.950
<v Speaker 1>but I hadn't been Houston forever,</v>

5470
02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:33.500
<v Speaker 1>so it was a lot of energy there is,</v>

5471
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:35.070
<v Speaker 1>for me it was like a big,</v>

5472
02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:35.880
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

5473
02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:37.200
<v Speaker 1>that's an important city for me.</v>

5474
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:39.631
<v Speaker 1>It's stuck in your head.</v>

5475
02:24:39.631 --> 02:24:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I gotta make a show for these people.</v>

5476
02:24:41.371 --> 02:24:41.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5477
02:24:41.611 --> 02:24:41.881
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

5478
02:24:41.881 --> 02:24:42.451
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know.</v>

5479
02:24:42.451 --> 02:24:42.841
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5480
02:24:42.841 --> 02:24:43.531
<v Speaker 1>there's something men making.</v>

5481
02:24:43.531 --> 02:24:45.330
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go back to a comedy club there soon.</v>

5482
02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5483
02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:46.171
<v Speaker 1>I might.</v>

5484
02:24:46.171 --> 02:24:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I might go back to that comedy club too.</v>

5485
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.801
<v Speaker 1>When I'm,</v>

5486
02:24:47.801 --> 02:24:51.750
<v Speaker 1>when I put my special out after I'm done with the special,</v>

5487
02:24:51.751 --> 02:24:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to write some new shit and I'll spend a lot more time doing</v>

5488
02:24:54.391 --> 02:24:58.050
<v Speaker 1>clubs and a lot less time doing theaters because of the clubs.</v>

5489
02:24:58.051 --> 02:24:59.700
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier to come up with new shit.</v>

5490
02:24:59.701 --> 02:25:03.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a more experimental environment when there's like 200 to 300 people,</v>

5491
02:25:03.390 --> 02:25:06.000
<v Speaker 1>the acoustics at a place like that must be creepy.</v>

5492
02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Like a giant place I think.</v>

5493
02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno sort of mean.</v>

5494
02:25:10.831 --> 02:25:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all about the sound system.</v>

5495
02:25:12.010 --> 02:25:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Sound system.</v>

5496
02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:14.760
<v Speaker 1>So if the crowd is up against the wall,</v>

5497
02:25:14.761 --> 02:25:16.860
<v Speaker 1>like if it goes all the way to the outside walls,</v>

5498
02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:18.030
<v Speaker 1>laughter bounces.</v>

5499
02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm making this part up but it seems like a bounces harder and everyone laughs</v>

5500
02:25:20.911 --> 02:25:21.570
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

5501
02:25:21.570 --> 02:25:23.950
<v Speaker 1>But when there's space in between the wall or the ceiling,</v>

5502
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:24.351
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

5503
02:25:24.351 --> 02:25:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Ceilings and it doesn't go off as much because you're not surrounded by this</v>

5504
02:25:27.071 --> 02:25:27.550
<v Speaker 3>laughter.</v>

5505
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5506
02:25:27.821 --> 02:25:28.654
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>

5507
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:31.630
<v Speaker 3>the perfect example is the right and a wrong way to do it.</v>

5508
02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:36.660
<v Speaker 3>It's COBB's cobb's in San Francisco calms the old comms was 150 fucking like,</v>

5509
02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that into that room.</v>

5510
02:25:38.561 --> 02:25:39.251
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was okay.</v>

5511
02:25:39.251 --> 02:25:41.680
<v Speaker 3>But it's like the old room build room.</v>

5512
02:25:41.681 --> 02:25:41.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5513
02:25:41.951 --> 02:25:42.784
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

5514
02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:43.810
<v Speaker 3>It's on a Wednesday.</v>

5515
02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Did you really just don't like best up San Francisco?</v>

5516
02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Great Room.</v>

5517
02:25:47.090 --> 02:25:48.190
<v Speaker 3>It was a great room.</v>

5518
02:25:48.191 --> 02:25:51.670
<v Speaker 3>It was real small and it was one of the few rooms that I would do for cheap</v>

5519
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.060
<v Speaker 3>because I knew that I would go up there and have a real good time and I knew</v>

5520
02:25:55.061 --> 02:25:57.080
<v Speaker 3>that would be a good place to fuck around.</v>

5521
02:25:57.090 --> 02:25:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5522
02:25:57.460 --> 02:25:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Work on my material.</v>

5523
02:25:58.900 --> 02:25:59.471
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

5524
02:25:59.471 --> 02:26:00.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5525
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:02.140
<v Speaker 3>it gave us shitty wage but make it a good show.</v>

5526
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:02.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5527
02:26:02.350 --> 02:26:04.750
<v Speaker 3>But they want to do that too at giant place.</v>

5528
02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Now there are places like four 50 with a big high ceiling and a bounce bounce</v>

5529
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:10.660
<v Speaker 3>back far back.</v>

5530
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:11.860
<v Speaker 3>So you're really far away.</v>

5531
02:26:12.010 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 3>But it's so cool that it doesn't even matter.</v>

5532
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:15.140
<v Speaker 3>It's still really great.</v>

5533
02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:15.881
<v Speaker 3>Crowds are great,</v>

5534
02:26:15.881 --> 02:26:17.020
<v Speaker 3>but the crowds are fantastic,</v>

5535
02:26:17.310 --> 02:26:18.143
<v Speaker 3>but it's not perfect.</v>

5536
02:26:18.370 --> 02:26:20.350
<v Speaker 3>So there's two places to me that they're like super important.</v>

5537
02:26:20.351 --> 02:26:21.184
<v Speaker 3>Three places.</v>

5538
02:26:21.370 --> 02:26:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Boston's cause I started there,</v>

5539
02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:24.520
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco and Houston.</v>

5540
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Those are,</v>

5541
02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:26.110
<v Speaker 3>those are the two places.</v>

5542
02:26:26.250 --> 02:26:26.951
<v Speaker 3>So I used to just,</v>

5543
02:26:26.951 --> 02:26:27.910
<v Speaker 3>because this is what I did,</v>

5544
02:26:27.911 --> 02:26:28.691
<v Speaker 3>my first CD,</v>

5545
02:26:28.691 --> 02:26:29.170
<v Speaker 3>that one,</v>

5546
02:26:29.170 --> 02:26:30.460
<v Speaker 3>that pink thing on the wall back there,</v>

5547
02:26:30.461 --> 02:26:31.330
<v Speaker 3>the Warner brothers one,</v>

5548
02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I got a deal with Warner brothers.</v>

5549
02:26:33.430 --> 02:26:35.270
<v Speaker 3>They were going to like really push this.</v>

5579
02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:13.210

5580
02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:15.460
<v Speaker 3>You can't have it anywhere else else with that.</v>

5581
02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:16.480
<v Speaker 3>It has to be,</v>

5582

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5583
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can still buy it.</v>

5586
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard and it's always the CD that's not on like,</v>

5587
02:27:24.341 --> 02:27:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you know the iTunes or it's not on anything like that.</v>

5589
02:27:27.641 --> 02:27:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

5590
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:28.833
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>

5591
02:27:30.050 --> 02:27:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Like I think I've tried to find it a couple of times and bought a Phi and all</v>

5594
02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:38.680
<v Speaker 1>but were a better comic now.</v>

5595
02:27:38.681 --> 02:27:40.870
<v Speaker 1>But they were still a really good comic though.</v>

5596
02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5597

5600
02:27:48.461 --> 02:27:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Houston because Houston was my,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll find it on this.</v>

5645
02:28:43.890 --> 02:28:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5646
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:45.210
<v Speaker 4>and it's not in anything.</v>

02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:45.651
<v Speaker 3>Well I'll,</v>

5648
02:28:45.651 --> 02:28:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I'll have them put it on.</v>

5649
02:28:46.671 --> 02:28:47.690
<v Speaker 3>I'll figure out a way to put it on.</v>

5650
02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5651
02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:49.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure Warner brothers probably owns it.</v>

5652
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:50.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

5653
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:51.020
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

5654
02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:51.860
<v Speaker 3>it's not as good as,</v>

5655
02:28:51.861 --> 02:28:52.340
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

5656
02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:54.500
<v Speaker 3>my delivery is not nearly as good as it is now.</v>

5657
02:28:54.860 --> 02:28:55.311
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>

5658
02:28:55.311 --> 02:28:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Comedies feels like they've got everything.</v>

5659
02:28:56.780 --> 02:28:57.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5660
02:28:57.141 --> 02:28:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is weird like that though.</v>

5661
02:28:58.131 --> 02:28:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I like having something when I was,</v>

5662
02:28:59.931 --> 02:29:00.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5663
02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:01.470
<v Speaker 3>well the same thing as musicians,</v>

5664
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:04.340
<v Speaker 3>like albums of a,</v>

5665
02:29:04.341 --> 02:29:06.350
<v Speaker 3>of a band that plays not with the major album.</v>

5666
02:29:06.351 --> 02:29:06.710
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

5667
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.950
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

5668
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I see where you're going,</v>

5669
02:29:08.091 --> 02:29:08.924
<v Speaker 3>but you're not there yet.</v>

5670
02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:10.510
<v Speaker 3>But it's still like I'd want to have it.</v>

5671
02:29:10.610 --> 02:29:11.720
<v Speaker 3>And that to me,</v>

5672
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:16.520
<v Speaker 3>that CD represents a sort of an awakening that I had,</v>

5673
02:29:16.610 --> 02:29:17.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5674
02:29:17.010 --> 02:29:17.571
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

5675
02:29:17.571 --> 02:29:18.590
<v Speaker 3>with standup comedy too,</v>

5676
02:29:18.591 --> 02:29:21.350
<v Speaker 3>because I was doing news radio and when I was doing news radio,</v>

5677
02:29:21.351 --> 02:29:24.050
<v Speaker 3>there was a long time where I got fucking really lazy man.</v>

5678
02:29:24.050 --> 02:29:25.640
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't writing any new material.</v>

5679
02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:26.191
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5680
02:29:26.191 --> 02:29:27.024
<v Speaker 3>They talked about that once.</v>

5681
02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:28.191
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

5682
02:29:28.191 --> 02:29:29.720
<v Speaker 3>it was just being lazy.</v>

5683
02:29:29.721 --> 02:29:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I was just doing the TV show and when I was doing the TV show,</v>

5684
02:29:32.631 --> 02:29:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I'd get tired from doing it.</v>

5685
02:29:34.131 --> 02:29:34.791
<v Speaker 3>And then I would,</v>

5686
02:29:34.791 --> 02:29:35.624
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5687
02:29:36.210 --> 02:29:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5688
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:37.220
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

5689
02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I would fuck off and I wouldn't write any new shit.</v>

5690
02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:40.730
<v Speaker 3>So he's just do the same stuff.</v>

5691
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5692
