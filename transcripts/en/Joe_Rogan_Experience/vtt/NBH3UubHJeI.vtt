<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>We were talking a little bit earlier,</v>

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>how much of your life revolves around on it?</v>

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:09.744
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

6
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>How much year of life revolves around the pleasure that food,</v>

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>booze,</v>

8
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>before the podcast started about making the choice between booze and food.</v>

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could eat whatever the fuck you want it to be healthy and live til</v>

11
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking 90 and all that shit or,</v>

12
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't drink or you could drink,</v>

13
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.291
<v Speaker 1>but he can't eat shit,</v>

14
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>you gotta eat cardboard and the fucking grape leaves.</v>

15
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

16
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:37.891
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

17
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to work great.</v>

19
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Please give cardboard and fucking grass.</v>

20
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe that living without good food and living without,</v>

21
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to survive,</v>

24
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

25
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:51.311
<v Speaker 1>if you live in,</v>

27
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>in the walking dead and you got to shoot deer and shit,</v>

28
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good,</v>

29
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about in this day and age,</v>

30
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.731
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you.</v>

31
00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>You have a choice.</v>

32
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>If you have to make a choice between I can eat my favorite shit or I can drink</v>

33
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>booze and,</v>

34
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

35
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and have the added sort of crank that that give.</v>

36
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

37
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to say was that the,</v>

38
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 2>the idea of,</v>

39
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

40
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 2>subsistence living is all although frightening that food is delicious.</v>

41
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Eating deer over a campfire.</v>

42
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a really yummy tasting food,</v>

43
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

44
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 2>If you're saying like shitty food,</v>

45
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 2>like cardboard tasting bland food,</v>

46
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 2>that's a sergeant.</v>

47
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 2>The enjoyment of the day in my opinion,</v>

48
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 2>my meal with my family I think is uh,</v>

49
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I one of my favorite things in life and that sounds like it sounds uttered like</v>

50
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.973
<v Speaker 2>utter horse shit,</v>

51
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.913
<v Speaker 2>the people.</v>

52
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

53
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

54
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 2>the real idea is like sitting down with your kids and having a laugh and having</v>

55
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:44.544
<v Speaker 2>a meal.</v>

56
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that that whole process is,</v>

57
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 2>it's very important and nutrition is very important,</v>

58
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 2>but for me the taste is very important as well.</v>

59
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important to eat things that are delicious.</v>

60
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 2>It fee,</v>

61
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

62
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a part of like a pleasurable aspect of life.</v>

63
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 2>And so if I had to choose honestly between drinking booze and eating delicious</v>

64
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:10.461
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

65
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I would go with delicious food.</v>

66
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I think delicious food is more important because I've experienced the booze and</v>

67
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I understand the lessons,</v>

68
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.140
<v Speaker 2>the lessons of the dropping of the inhibition and the good aspects of alcohol,</v>

69
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 2>which are often overlooked by people who just can't handle alcohol.</v>

70
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

71
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.421
<v Speaker 1>like we were,</v>

73
00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>we were talking before the podcast started about not,</v>

74
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 1>this is a fee.</v>

75
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.883
<v Speaker 1>There's certain</v>

76
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 2>level of trust that you have or someone is willing to get drunk with you.</v>

77
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you know that guy's demons,</v>

78
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.711
<v Speaker 2>they're all,</v>

79
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 2>they're all right there.</v>

80
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Five or six Jack and cokes,</v>

81
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 2>telling a story about Tiawana and you're like,</v>

83
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

84
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.193
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>

85
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.043
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

86
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 2>what did you tell your mom?</v>

87
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

88
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 2>climbed into my,</v>

89
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.231
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

90
00:02:55.231 --> 00:03:00.231
<v Speaker 2>It's like you get to know a person and you realize that there's no benefit in</v>

91
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 2>hiding all that shit from PBL love anyway.</v>

92
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a benefit and telling them,</v>

93
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 2>right and the sort of camaraderie that ensues from those drunk and conversations</v>

94
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:10.411
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

95
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:15.411
<v Speaker 2>of complete and total honesty where the alcohol does a purpose instead of</v>

96
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>inhibiting you and making you make shitty decisions.</v>

97
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>The alcohol releases you from this,</v>

98
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>this idea that a anything makes any sense whatsoever.</v>

99
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And you start telling the truth or you start expressing yourself or you start</v>

100
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 2>looking at things from more rural relax perspective,</v>

101
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>even temporarily or that thought gets planted in your mind.</v>

102
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And then you just have more of a sense of friendliness the next day.</v>

103
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

104
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.820
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes it's,</v>

106
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>it's little encounters.</v>

107
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.980
<v Speaker 2>It's steer us and uh,</v>

108
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 2>like I remember this and the Anthony Robbins quote who,</v>

109
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not have,</v>

111
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to a lot of his books on tape and read his books and he's got a</v>

112
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>lot of interesting ways of looking at things that I really think are enabling.</v>

113
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that he said is that sometimes if two people are going</v>

114
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 2>along very same path,</v>

115
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 2>like think of yourself as like two boats.</v>

116
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 2>If one boat just turns one degree to the right,</v>

117
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 2>like over the course of the boats,</v>

118
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>motion through life,</v>

119
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:20.581
<v Speaker 2>just that one decision can lead it so far away from the original path that it</v>

120
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:21.604
<v Speaker 2>was on.</v>

121
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And that the,</v>

122
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.360
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes it's a good time that leads you,</v>

123
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 2>and it might cost you a day or two of being hung over.</v>

125
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 2>It might,</v>

126
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 2>but there might be that phone call,</v>

127
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 2>we would call each other on a Wednesday.</v>

128
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a fucking gray type dude.</v>

129
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 2>That was funny.</v>

130
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 2>I even</v>

131
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.311
<v Speaker 1>have to be,</v>

132
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:43.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even talking about like a crazy fucking boozy fucking crazy because the</v>

133
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:46.770
<v Speaker 1>reason why I asked the question is because whenever I meet people I like and I</v>

134
00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:47.604
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>

135
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.421
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

137
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to ask them questions because I believe that's how you learn.</v>

138
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I have this problem because I'll tell you what,</v>

139
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I grew up poor.</v>

140
00:04:57.871 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>

141
00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.131
<v Speaker 1>they're poor.</v>

143
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I left home at a very young age and a lot of what I learned,</v>

144
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I learned initially through books,</v>

145
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:04.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:06.120

147
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 1>that's why I have this sort of a intense curiosity about the world because I'm</v>

148
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:10.651

190
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.440

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like the best is,</v>

201
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

202
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I bought like $10,000 with the caviar for 100 bucks or some shit.</v>

203
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>So I get it and I go upstairs but didn't have no booze.</v>

204
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:35.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

205
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's the rent.</v>

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>So I have like Orange Fanta and some chips in this caviar and I'm like this is</v>

214
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>have your linguine with clams with a nice fucking Chris fucking white wine,</v>

215
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.590
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is white wine?</v>

216
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm very whatever.</v>

219
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>the thing around,</v>

220
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

221
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>do you have a meal with your family?</v>

223
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And then so when I was sitting up there in,</v>

224
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.371
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

235
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>it was a very fucking transformative evening.</v>

236
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>And then when I just had the straight up caviar and like,</v>

237
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:43.101
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

240
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was asking you the question,</v>

242
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 1>cause we were talking about food and you were saying like,</v>

243
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:51.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 1>if you have a bad back,</v>

245
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:52.921
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't need to pass that.</v>

246
00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

247
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.910

249
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.510
<v Speaker 1>fuck</v>

250
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.751
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

251
00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:57.750
<v Speaker 2>What I was saying is that this a chiropractor that I was talking to,</v>

252
00:07:57.751 --> 00:07:58.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

253
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.921
<v Speaker 2>over the weekend,</v>

254
00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:02.670
<v Speaker 2>she was explained to me the influence of a certain,</v>

255
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:02.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

256
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.560
<v Speaker 2>wheats and glutens and how it inflamed tissue.</v>

257
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:11.610
<v Speaker 2>And that you can get a substantial anti inflammatory response by just cutting</v>

258
00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 2>wheat out of your diet.</v>

259
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

260
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you that there's a pleasure to eating that I think is like super</v>

261
00:08:16.861 --> 00:08:17.340
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

262
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.020
<v Speaker 2>It pleasure to eating and a pleasure to drink.</v>

263
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean I like can I smoke weed and not drink because I would talk to that</v>

264
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:23.701
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

265
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:24.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

266
00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:25.014
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing that.</v>

267
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:25.860
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

268
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.060
<v Speaker 2>weed is like,</v>

269
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that really made a big difference.</v>

270
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:34.221
<v Speaker 2>Like I think alcohol has played a good part in a lot of positive aspects of my</v>

271
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 2>life as far as like joyful evening,</v>

272
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.950
<v Speaker 2>having fun with friends and telling them that you love them and hugging them</v>

273
00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:41.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

274
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.031
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

275
00:08:42.031 --> 00:08:43.200
<v Speaker 2>even whatever,</v>

276
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 2>a romantic altercations,</v>

277
00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:46.230
<v Speaker 2>you know the boys,</v>

278
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.850

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.590
<v Speaker 2>the Shit Brian.</v>

280
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.050
<v Speaker 2>But as far as like what,</v>

281
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.480
<v Speaker 2>what transformed me as a human being now,</v>

282
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 2>marijuana more important.</v>

283
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

284
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Merritt marijuana was to me like there was like a,</v>

286
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.760
<v Speaker 1>almost like a missing piece to my sort of conceptual puzzle of like how I</v>

287
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>interfaced with the,</v>

288
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:07.770

334
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and he has to walk up this hill every day.</v>

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>not even six weeks to live.</v>

345
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

346
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.660

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.000

353
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>and there's no stress.</v>

356
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And he's walking up the hill every day and he's,</v>

357
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 1>he's drinking wine with his buddies and he's eating the food from the,</v>

358
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>You think you're fucking live your life.</v>

435
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.271
<v Speaker 1>You haven't lived shit.</v>

436
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:43.901
<v Speaker 1>You haven't done shit.</v>

437
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:44.734
<v Speaker 1>You haven't seen shit.</v>

438
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

439
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why I say I'm going to go out and I'm going to see shit</v>

440
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to do all this shit,</v>

441
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever is because I didn't fucking die.</v>

442
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 1>But at a certain point you sit there and you say,</v>

444
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:53.940
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

445
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.773
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

446
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 1>and I know how hard life is.</v>

448
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 1>We know fucking what good things are or can be.</v>

449
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

450
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:02.521
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

451
00:13:02.521 --> 00:13:03.191
<v Speaker 1>and can be.</v>

452
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And also we realized there's a lot of people who didn't make it.</v>

453
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:07.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

454
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:09.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people who just for one hour,</v>

455
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.400
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another,</v>

456
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.470
<v Speaker 1>they don't get to where you are.</v>

457
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.430
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm trying to say is you,</v>

458
00:13:13.431 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>you want to get to more of a,</v>

460
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:16.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

461
00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:17.770
<v Speaker 1>of an understanding,</v>

462
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:18.920
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I go back to it.</v>

463
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't give a fuck what people think about me.</v>

464
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about,</v>

465
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>about shit because when you see it,</v>

466
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you sit there and say,</v>

467
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 1>on this hand,</v>

468
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker got shot or this right.</v>

469
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I got it right down and this guy and got into this.</v>

470
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Now to go back to this,</v>

471
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 1>it's quite long winded,</v>

472
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 1>but if you go back to it,</v>

473
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>what do I want to do?</v>

474
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to sit in the cove with my family,</v>

475
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.540
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

476
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.703
<v Speaker 1>hanging out,</v>

477
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.693
<v Speaker 1>have a drink,</v>

478
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 1>enjoying myself.</v>

479
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much food.</v>

480
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And although I'm a fat bastard,</v>

481
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much food is going to play into that,</v>

482
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely want to be sitting there when that glass of wine looking out at</v>

483
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 1>that cove and just go on a fucking made it.</v>

484
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I don't get,</v>

485
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 1>that's why I don't judge anybody,</v>

486
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.960
<v Speaker 1>because I'll tell you what everyone's trying to get through the day to get to</v>

487
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:03.250
<v Speaker 1>their Goddamn cove.</v>

488
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:08.550
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

489
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.810
