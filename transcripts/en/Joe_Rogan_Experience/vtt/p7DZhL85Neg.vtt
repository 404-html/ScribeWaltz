00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I remember I took some mushrooms one</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to a,</v>

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>a party in high school because I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an area where you could just get</v>

3
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms grew on</v>

4
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grow in your fucking cousins back</v>

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and we took a long enough nap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you grow up in Louisiana.</v>

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>They grew everywhere out there or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab work because everybody had</v>

7
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>something shitting in their yard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would rain every single day for</v>

8
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>about a half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you see people picking them and eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and families out there and join</v>

11
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>them in the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was.</v>

12
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

13
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>it was psychedelic heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we would ride out and go get them.</v>

14
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time getting a trash bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>of probably about 35 pounds of</v>

15
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>And one time a golden retriever came</v>
<v Speaker 1>running at us across this field and we</v>

17
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>thought he was pissed because we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>tripping.</v>

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>And then he got to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ran for like a half mile,</v>

19
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>he got to us finally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're crawling away from thinking he's</v>

20
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>evil and he just fucking love this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And licked mean golden retriever.</v>

21
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was mean for us because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hair,</v>

22
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Speaker 1>his hair was kind of slick back like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil golden retriever.</v>

23
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took that back and busters to that</v>

24
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>party and a bunch of people ate a mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never had them before.</v>

25
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And then we played a game of hide and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>seek.</v>

26
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

27
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>hide in another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll count you guys go hide.</v>

29
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never went to fucking look for</v>

30
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Tim at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that dude again.</v>
