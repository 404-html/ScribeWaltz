<v Speaker 1>He advised Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel Edison.</v>

11
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>And yet that's a wicked fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good fight.</v>

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you're looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt embry and other Canadian kid </v>

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.500
<v Speaker 1>against that Dutch beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin van small and.</v>

14
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

15
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a on UFC fight pass.</v>

16
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm so psyched that the UFC and UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight pass is embracing glory.</v>

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>It's super exciting for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

19
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>And it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:49.931
<v Speaker 1>that huge collision card in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had rico versus butter and UFC ran </v>

21
00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 1>that pay per view for us.</v>

22
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time the UFC has run </v>

24
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.711
<v Speaker 1>anything other than UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for us as a big accomplishment </v>

25
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>for kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 1>we know we've talked about in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

27
00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.220
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about it a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes ago.</v>

28
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I think kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially high level kickboxing like </v>

29
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>glory is one of the most exciting sports</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and it perplexes me and </v>

30
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>many other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why it's not more exciting.</v>

31
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Crazy because it's not hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what's going on.</v>

32
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things about mma that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important to me.</v>

33
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like when the fight to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

34
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I have to explain step by step what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on because otherwise people that </v>

35
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.501
<v Speaker 1>don't know ground fighting the all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden like why is he tapping what's </v>

36
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't see exactly what's going,</v>

37
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.440
<v Speaker 1>but when someone explains it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it with kickboxing,</v>

38
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious.</v>

39
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Pretty obvious kicks and punches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees.</v>

40
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so people are getting smashed.</v>

41
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

42
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I seriously don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana white has a really good theory.</v>

43
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that PKA karate from like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the 19 eighties when they used </v>

44
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.991
<v Speaker 1>to have those pka karate matches on espn</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the karate pants and the big booties</v>

45
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>on their feet don't sit around and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really just sloppy boxing with </v>

46
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>like some shitty kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's even American kickboxing.</v>

47
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have a kick rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would happen and they would </v>

48
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.351
<v Speaker 1>throw eight kicks in the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the round and then all of a sudden they </v>

49
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:10.351
<v Speaker 1>boxed for the rest of the round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

50
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

51
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And for whatever reason above the waist </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

52
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>which I think one of the things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing as opposed to the traditional</v>

53
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.110
<v Speaker 1>martial arts or like taekwondo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>karate,</v>

54
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like as soon as you start adding </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg kicks,</v>

55
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 1>like it changes the whole game.</v>

56
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes everything.</v>

57
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:31.411
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking before this fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your fight for this podcast were </v>

58
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>either about your fight with Raymond </v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniels,</v>

59
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>which is one of my favorite fights ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

60
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Because he is this traditional karate </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who was a point fighting champion </v>

61
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.431
<v Speaker 1>and he has wicked kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just one of the most spectacular </v>

62
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:46.021
<v Speaker 1>and dynamic guys and kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your leg kicks and your constant </v>

63
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.480
<v Speaker 1>pressure and just rock solid Moitai </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals.</v>

64
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 1>You just chopped them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopped them down,</v>

65
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and then eventually had kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:57.811
<v Speaker 1>it's that movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighters are very tricky and I think </v>

67
00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>what made that fight super exciting was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that old school ufc mentality.</v>

68
00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>You two different arts,</v>

69
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>battling to see which one was better.</v>

70
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:07.471
<v Speaker 2>And Raymond Daniels was undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just knocking people out with </v>

71
00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 2>spinning hoecakes every time he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

72
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a smart,</v>

74
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 2>intelligent fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to put pressure.</v>

75
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 2>And I remember we had a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

76
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys like a wonder Boy Thompson,</v>

77
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>why isn't his opponents calling someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like me to do it?</v>

78
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.431
<v Speaker 2>But you had a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a special fighter to really </v>

79
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:30.120
<v Speaker 2>close distance and pressure like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to be able to execute a game plan </v>

80
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.111
<v Speaker 2>with heavy low kicks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to really have a high level </v>

81
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:37.681
<v Speaker 2>more tie game to deal with a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder boy the same way because we'll </v>

82
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 2>wonder boys also real unusual in his use</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the front leg,</v>

83
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 2>like he is that sideways stance kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>upends a little at the waist and throws </v>

84
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:50.551
<v Speaker 2>all those wicked front leg side kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>round kicks and on top of that he's a </v>

85
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:50.551
<v Speaker 2>really good punch her.</v>

86
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>And He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's impressive.</v>

87
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the rematch is happening,</v>

88
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With woodleigh?</v>

89
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

90
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be in March in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be crazy.</v>

91
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good rematch.</v>

92
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160
<v Speaker 2>It is a good rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially because Woodley was </v>

93
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.041
<v Speaker 2>dominating that first round with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and really never took them </v>

94
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:08.041
<v Speaker 2>down again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

95
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

96
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Like I wonder why he didn't take them </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and I asked him after the fight,</v>

97
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:15.571
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea why I didn't take them </v>

98
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:15.571
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

99
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:15.571
<v Speaker 2>So it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just in the moment.</v>

100
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>It's loving event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's loving the moment.</v>

101
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Loving the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you now have taken some time off from</v>

103
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>fighting because of concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

104
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 2>And tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

105
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 2>it was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you were at my last fight.</v>

106
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought mark the bond,</v>

107
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest in peace.</v>

108
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I remember we talked about the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

109
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they find out what happened to him?</v>

110
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know a lot of the stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out is in Dutch and Dutch </v>

111
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Speaker 2>newspapers and I'm asking all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutch community kind of what's happening</v>

112
00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 2>and they don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear different things and rumors,</v>

113
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to listen to rumors </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't want to hear it from like a</v>

114
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:53.251
<v Speaker 2>concrete source and went missing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they found his body and they </v>

115
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 2>basically found his body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

116
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 2>So why or who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was great.</v>

117
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 2>He was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent,</v>

118
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 2>excellent fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

119
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was another guy,</v>

120
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>but boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>you look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looked like a computer programmer.</v>

122
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

123
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

124
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.370
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting how it looks can be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>deceiving.</v>

125
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 2>It's super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super high level guy.</v>

126
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was my last fight and I'm from </v>

127
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.901
<v Speaker 2>there was actually a really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really opened up about it to be </v>

128
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 2>honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very tough experience.</v>

129
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 2>you got to think I just win the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>title.</v>

131
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going home to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which my concussion was pretty bad where</v>

132
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have even gone on a plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>home and next thing you know,</v>

133
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm at home and just the concussions got</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>

134
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I had to be hospitalized for a few days </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

135
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I was in a dark room for three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I could knock it out of a dark room</v>

136
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 2>for three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't walk.</v>

137
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess something with the concussion </v>

138
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.281
<v Speaker 2>started causing some neuron now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nervous nerve damage that could be </v>

139
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:55.230
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of us concussion,</v>

140
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 2>nerve damage and effects.</v>

141
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like in a bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't even look out at a little red </v>

142
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 2>light on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charger was too much.</v>

143
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was bad.</v>

144
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 2>It light on the phone charger would hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head.</v>

145
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even look at a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was at that point,</v>

146
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

147
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:13.391
<v Speaker 2>it's like I just win this world title </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a really tough time and this </v>

148
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 2>is actually the first time I've really </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened up about it,</v>

149
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>but it was a tough experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being in that,</v>

150
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>downstate where you're basically in a </v>

151
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.900
<v Speaker 2>dark room for three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

152
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.820
<v Speaker 2>doctors were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

153
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.020
<v Speaker 2>handy me over shit ton of percosets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxies to kind of deal with the pain.</v>

154
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a tough time man.</v>

155
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:36.221
<v Speaker 2>And it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what was the hardest was what </v>

156
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:36.221
<v Speaker 2>was happening mentally.</v>

157
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:36.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting there and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

158
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I just want a world that I want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in there.</v>

159
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:42.641
<v Speaker 2>I want to know do so much in this sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my goal was to be a legend in the </v>

160
00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:43.200
<v Speaker 2>sport and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

161
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it got to the point I saw my </v>

162
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 2>family and how much it was affecting my </v>
<v Speaker 2>family and that's when I decided that,</v>

163
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put this unrest for a little bit.</v>

164
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>So you win the fight and after the fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>is over,</v>

165
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 2>was it immediately that you knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>something was wrong?</v>

166
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 2>It honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some adrenaline rush and I did the</v>

167
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>post fight press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was fine.</v>

168
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I was just when I got back to the hotel </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and I was throwing up and couldn't </v>

169
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>leave my room and I was surprised that </v>
<v Speaker 2>even got on an airplane home,</v>

170
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 2>the doctors in Canada or like how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heck did you get on an airplane home?</v>

171
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.660
<v Speaker 2>So it was scary times man and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it took a lot of good mental </v>

172
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 2>strength to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm actually in a,</v>

173
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 2>in a position where I'm super happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm loving it.</v>

174
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I got that whole color commentary role </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Gloria,</v>

175
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 2>which has been incredible because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

176
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>It's great that you found a way out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

177
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:36.311
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that when you were in </v>

178
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:36.311
<v Speaker 2>that dark room and you couldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the light on a charger,</v>

179
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 2>that must've been really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

180
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:44.231
<v Speaker 2>really uncomfortable to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was tough and I know another like </v>

181
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 2>it's just the way of how can I explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>it if it gets emotional sometimes,</v>

182
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:51.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a time where it was like I </v>

183
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.261
<v Speaker 2>finally achieved what I wanted and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one has really gotten to that level and </v>

184
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 2>the time that I did before I turned pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only had 11 amateur fights.</v>

185
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I only had 11 amateur fights and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away into the pro ranks,</v>

186
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:05.891
<v Speaker 2>they only had 14 professional fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta think in 25 fights I was </v>

187
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:10.601
<v Speaker 2>able to get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a professional win the world </v>

188
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 2>title in the biggest kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

189
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 2>all within 25 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amateur professional combined.</v>

190
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 2>And how old were you when you won the </v>
<v Speaker 2>title?</v>

191
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Twenty eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're still young.</v>

192
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm 31 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about that.</v>

193
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 2>You know the amount of fights you had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that many in comparison.</v>

194
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these Dutch guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have 100 plus fights.</v>

195
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 2>All the Thai guys that have more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to think.</v>

196
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just bad luck sometimes and</v>

197
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:37.241
<v Speaker 2>my style was a style that was really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It meant you could watch any one of my </v>

198
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 2>fights and you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertained.</v>

199
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understood the value of,</v>

200
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more than just a sport.</v>

201
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>You GotTa win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a dominant,</v>

202
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

203
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I really did in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career and that's what I,</v>

204
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I got such a huge following behind me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

205
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was sucked because I had more,</v>

206
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I want it to show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it that way.</v>

207
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Now when you see a guy like mayweather </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's gone through a career and he's </v>

208
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 2>like 49 and o and is probably one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

209
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 2>if not the best defensive fighters of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

210
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 2>And then you see what you went through </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your situation.</v>

211
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you look at a guy like mayweather and</v>

212
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men may be,</v>

213
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.730
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should take a different approach</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe I should have taken a more </v>

214
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.571
<v Speaker 2>safety first approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm torn between that because at one </v>

215
00:09:20.571 --> 00:09:20.780
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

216
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 2>if that's floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

217
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 2>And you're looking at a guy who makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>multimillions of fight and um,</v>

218
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has that,</v>

219
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.850
<v Speaker 2>a support around them and whether it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>boring fight and most people who watch </v>

220
00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 2>the casual fans who watch floyd </v>
<v Speaker 2>mayweather think he's boring.</v>

221
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

222
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:43.281
<v Speaker 2>But really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a skilled fighter and you </v>

223
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:45.291
<v Speaker 2>understand what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand how incredible of an </v>

224
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:45.291
<v Speaker 2>athlete he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

225
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 2>but I was just thrown in there with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves men.</v>

226
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

227
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting a cream Gaji in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>third glory fight.</v>

228
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only as hundreds of professional </v>

229
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.590
<v Speaker 2>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's my,</v>

230
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 2>that's my eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do I do?</v>

231
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Do I play the point games with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's been in that ring?</v>

232
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Probably had 100 amateur fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 professional fights.</v>

233
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 2>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

234
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I have to go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to build a name for myself.</v>

235
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 2>You gotta think Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no professional fighting in </v>

236
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

237
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.040
<v Speaker 2>where I'm from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no professional fighting.</v>

238
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I had no experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my approach was I got to bring the </v>

239
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.100
<v Speaker 2>heat to these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

240
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I got to bring the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to be exciting and I got to </v>

241
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 2>finish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just turned into a brawl.</v>

242
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Just turn it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

243
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't use this as people always </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

244
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in Brawley or aggressive,</v>

245
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

246
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm a technician and actually when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming forward and I'm stocking you,</v>

247
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting to counter kick him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went in to use my low kicks and </v>

248
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.290
<v Speaker 2>waiting a county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's very calculated.</v>

249
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.740
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you turn them into very violent </v>

251
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 2>encounters always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

252
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you watch high level kickboxing</v>

253
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 2>like glory and then you see what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on in mma,</v>

254
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 2>where I think the level of striking is </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly advancing.</v>

255
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 2>You're getting better and better </v>
<v Speaker 2>strikers,</v>

256
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:02.331
<v Speaker 2>but it's really not at the same level </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're seeing in like world </v>

257
00:11:02.331 --> 00:11:02.710
<v Speaker 2>champion kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

258
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 2>It's totally different and people can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

259
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way you would fight in kickboxing,</v>

260
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.560
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to fight the same way </v>
<v Speaker 2>in mma begging me.</v>

261
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.840
<v Speaker 2>There's take downs and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>very successful kickboxers who don't do </v>

262
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.261
<v Speaker 2>well in mma a lot don't because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep that traditional Thai stance where </v>

263
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:25.311
<v Speaker 2>they stand very tall and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting very tall and of course the </v>

264
00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:28.731
<v Speaker 2>rest is going to take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an example of a good Canadian </v>

265
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 2>strikers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane Campbell,</v>

266
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Shane Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the fights in the UFC and he's </v>

267
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.211
<v Speaker 2>got an incredible background in Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he stays true to sometimes a little </v>

268
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 2>too much to his Moitai roots on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking.</v>

269
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep your hips back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to move.</v>

270
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a four ounce glove,</v>

271
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>not an eight ounce gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so shit changes.</v>

272
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also affects your offense to when </v>

273
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 2>you're worried about take downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're worried about all these different</v>

274
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.350
<v Speaker 2>aspects of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

275
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>The clinch,</v>

276
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 3>the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

277
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever fought in a cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>

278
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been debating a lot lately.</v>

279
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:03.541
<v Speaker 3>I talk way too much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People getting annoyed because I think </v>

280
00:12:03.541 --> 00:12:03.541
<v Speaker 3>that they should do it on like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball court.</v>

281
00:12:03.541 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 3>I really think fight should take place </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a large surface with no obstacles,</v>

282
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 3>no nothing other than the fighters </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

283
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 3>Did you like the pride ring over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>octagon or.</v>

284
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 3>No?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think rings are dangerous.</v>

285
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you started the Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Smith Jr.</v>

286
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a good example.</v>

287
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:25.921
<v Speaker 3>WhY think rings are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not often that that happens where </v>

288
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:29.341
<v Speaker 3>guys get knocked through the ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but It does happen and in pride I think,</v>

289
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

290
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 3>they did a good job of standing outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ring.</v>

291
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Like the pride organization was good </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they had a bunch of guys waiting </v>

292
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.430
<v Speaker 3>to catch people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still weird.</v>

293
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't have to come down to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

294
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I get it for mma,</v>

295
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:46.561
<v Speaker 3>but for like a kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't really see it being done in the </v>

296
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:46.561
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

297
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:47.630
<v Speaker 3>I think you had them on john wayne par.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

298
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does.</v>

299
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Caged moitai yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

300
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your thoughts on that?</v>

301
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loves it,</v>

302
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he does it with mma gloves too.</v>

303
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 3>That's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you're putting good strikers on</v>

304
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 3>without a takedown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's dangerous.</v>

305
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally different thing,</v>

306
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a totally different thing </v>

307
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:06.810
<v Speaker 3>with those little gloves too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

308
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you done any fighting with little </v>

309
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 3>gloves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

310
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.701
<v Speaker 3>I was actually planning to fight a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>times because before glory there was </v>

311
00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:11.701
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

312
00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 3>you got to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was originally,</v>

313
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Speaker 3>it was k one and k one only had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightweight division and the heavyweight</v>

314
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 3>division.</v>

315
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 3>So everyone in between kind of have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of pick away.</v>

316
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.470
<v Speaker 3>I actually fought in la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was against a ufc fighter many </v>

317
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 3>baghdad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

318
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 3>So I fought many baghdad in la and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just,</v>

319
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:35.011
<v Speaker 3>I tried making for the first time one 60</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was a guy to walk around.</v>

320
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well my non fighting walk round about </v>

321
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.030
<v Speaker 3>200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

322
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 3>when I was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one 91 95.</v>

323
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.710
<v Speaker 3>So you're trying to lose 30 plus pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

324
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucked.</v>

325
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the other thing.</v>

326
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:54.331
<v Speaker 3>Mma guys knoW how to cut weight a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than kickboxers do its thing </v>

327
00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 3>that's at wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Growing up with that wrestling helps,</v>

328
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.240
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's more dangerous with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I know it's more dangerous with </v>

329
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.901
<v Speaker 3>striking than it is with wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the problems with that </v>

330
00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 3>wrestling mentor brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain's dehydrated.</v>

331
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see the,</v>

332
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.300
<v Speaker 3>the advantage in mma of being bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same as the advantage of </v>

333
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.090
<v Speaker 3>being bigger and striking because being </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger and striking is,</v>

334
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 3>is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely a factor,</v>

335
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:24.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's so much more of a factor when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're clenching so much more of a </v>

336
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 3>factor when you take guys down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose a little bit of speed sometimes</v>

337
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:27.050
<v Speaker 3>and that mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

338
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

339
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 3>so when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you thinking about sparring with </v>

340
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 3>little gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

341
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.890
<v Speaker 3>what differences did you notice or think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about fighting with little gloves?</v>

342
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.580
<v Speaker 3>It was more about moving more and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach a lot of mma guys and um,</v>

343
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I actually got to work in the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to the corner twice in the ufc,</v>

344
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:49.471
<v Speaker 3>which was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had mitch gagnon and I got to corner </v>

345
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:49.740
<v Speaker 3>antonio carvallo who was mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

346
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he fought,</v>

347
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>he fought.</v>

348
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

349
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I have to dig deep here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a young kid,</v>

350
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he was hawaiian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe knocked him out.</v>

351
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I helped trained him for he fought </v>
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>

352
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:05.800
<v Speaker 3>well watson non demo with a left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

353
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.230
<v Speaker 3>who was that other kid that he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my last antonio fight was against </v>

354
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.080
<v Speaker 3>derek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darren elkins was,</v>

355
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 3>that was one of those fights where </v>
<v Speaker 3>antonio got caught,</v>

356
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:20.891
<v Speaker 3>drop pop back up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even being called that off and we're </v>

357
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:20.891
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

358
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 3>like it was an early stoppage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

359
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:27.341
<v Speaker 3>he's protecting antonio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting that a guy like you </v>

360
00:15:27.341 --> 00:15:31.330
<v Speaker 3>who is very high level world champion </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxer learning how to fight and move</v>

361
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:37.241
<v Speaker 3>with the small mma gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kind of shows you that striking in </v>

362
00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:40.721
<v Speaker 3>particular with a mma striking is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning growing food for sure because </v>

363
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:45.860
<v Speaker 3>guys like you come in and you are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys like duke roufus,</v>

364
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:50.861
<v Speaker 3>a former world champion himself was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at training guys and </v>

365
00:15:50.861 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 3>teaching guys duane ludwig's doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good job.</v>

366
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 3>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

367
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different methods and so</v>

368
00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 3>many different styles that people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to incorporate.</v>

369
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's fighting is I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>people focus fighting the way I look at </v>

370
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.591
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not actually what you throw and I </v>

371
00:16:08.591 --> 00:16:10.961
<v Speaker 3>always get questioned what's a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach versus a bad coach and a good </v>

372
00:16:10.961 --> 00:16:15.701
<v Speaker 3>coach is going to teach you positioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Distance is going to tell you more of </v>

373
00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:21.221
<v Speaker 3>the philosophies and strategies around </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding where there's so many coaches </v>

374
00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:23.530
<v Speaker 3>and with mma being so popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's every,</v>

375
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every other corner has an mma gym and </v>

376
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.031
<v Speaker 3>these guys are basically putting these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters on pads and they're just </v>

377
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:31.160
<v Speaker 3>getting them tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jab,</v>

378
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 3>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hook,</v>

379
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:31.880
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jab,</v>

380
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 3>cross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hook,</v>

381
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:37.271
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more combination combination and they </v>

382
00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:37.271
<v Speaker 3>get tired and they think tired equals </v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

383
00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 3>where there's so much more to fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's your distance control?</v>

384
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.970
<v Speaker 3>How are you moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

385
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 3>like what are your counters?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you countering?</v>

386
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:45.030
<v Speaker 3>What are your defense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think there's a,</v>

387
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 3>there's defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's different types of demons.</v>

388
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:48.890
<v Speaker 3>You got head movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got shield defense,</v>

389
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:50.960
<v Speaker 3>you got footwork for your defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 3>you got perry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's so many different ways,</v>

391
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.910
<v Speaker 3>but it does take good coaching in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion,</v>

392
00:16:55.911 --> 00:17:00.911
<v Speaker 3>to take these guys to that high </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional level and there's not </v>

393
00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:00.911
<v Speaker 3>enough of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

394
00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:05.651
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so hard for a young fighter to </v>

395
00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:05.780
<v Speaker 3>find really solid coaching and when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>start out,</v>

396
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 3>you're really kind of lucky if you walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a great gym your first time because</v>

397
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.520
<v Speaker 3>so few people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the beginning really know </v>

398
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 3>how to differentiate between a great gym</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just a regular gym.</v>

399
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to tell.</v>

400
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

401
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 3>But back to your original question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about mobility in my opinion.</v>

402
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 3>A guys that have been made need to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to move a little bit better.</v>

403
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think footwork is one of the most </v>

404
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 3>important things in fighting him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you got to be able to adapt.</v>

405
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're fighting a pressure fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be able to move and fight on </v>

406
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.870
<v Speaker 3>angles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

407
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 3>if you're fighting a guy who now likes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to move a lot,</v>

408
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.460
<v Speaker 3>you got to be able to pressure fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to have the coaching and the</v>

409
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 3>knowledge to be able to adapt </v>
<v Speaker 3>accordingly.</v>

410
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that a lot of people don't</v>

411
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 1>see when you're watching kickboxing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you watching moitai,</v>

412
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing these guys are standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to each other and they're throwing</v>

413
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:01.671
<v Speaker 1>kicks and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell exactly why they're </v>

414
00:18:01.671 --> 00:18:04.530
<v Speaker 1>doing what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell exactly why one guy is</v>

415
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:09.531
<v Speaker 1>more effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you see it and once you </v>

416
00:18:09.531 --> 00:18:12.951
<v Speaker 1>practice it and once you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it all starts opening up like a </v>

417
00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:17.361
<v Speaker 1>flower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when a guy like you is doing </v>

418
00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really helps because a guy who's been</v>

419
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:23.241
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys been a world champion and you get </v>

420
00:18:23.241 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 1>to explain what this guy's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

421
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 1>what's going wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sort of.</v>

422
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I really liked your commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

423
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I been trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

424
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.680
<v Speaker 1>It's done great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turning.</v>

425
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming from you,</v>

426
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.830
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your explaining things in a way that's </v>

427
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>opening up the game to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opens up the sport where you go,</v>

428
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:37.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

429
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.390
<v Speaker 1>now I know what to look for.</v>

430
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Now I know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what trends are happening.</v>

431
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find the balance still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good.</v>

432
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of my challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I come in there and I started </v>

433
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:48.740
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

434
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

435
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 1>his left heel is about two inches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is causing this to happen and he's</v>

436
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:53.830
<v Speaker 1>distance control is off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You needs to slip off.</v>

437
00:18:53.831 --> 00:18:55.470
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much sometimes.</v>

438
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.830
<v Speaker 1>So my challenge has been trying to kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bring it down a little bit and try </v>

439
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 1>not to overly try to overeducate yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been my challenge.</v>

440
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.620
<v Speaker 1>The other challenge is try not to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same word all the time.</v>

441
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what a good left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big left hook.</v>

442
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm trying to change words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

443

<v Speaker 1>exact same because talk too much.</v>

446
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.610

<v Speaker 1>Say the same words too many times.</v>

447
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 1>You call people to explosive and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some people got mad for column </v>

448

449
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:31.650
<v Speaker 1>you call them explosive and athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

450
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:36.651

<v Speaker 1>Anybody who says that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there and you're going to get </v>

461
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they keep you on your toes,</v>

462
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

463
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think for the most part,</v>

464
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 1>the majority of respectful fans and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might see something that maybe you don't</v>

465
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:08.181
<v Speaker 1>know that you're doing that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying and if it's annoying to them </v>

466
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:08.181
<v Speaker 1>it's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might just.</v>

467
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 1>It might be only annoying to two percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people,</v>

468
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but it might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be a way where you could </v>

469
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.150
<v Speaker 1>eliminate that aspect of your commentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know I've worked hard at that.</v>

470
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all the online criticism,</v>

471
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:21.150
<v Speaker 1>as much as it's uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of it fucks.</v>

472
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heads up,</v>

473
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.700
<v Speaker 1>man kills people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

474
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coaches that were like,</v>

475
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:27.150
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those trolls,</v>

476
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:28.160
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucked with his head.</v>

477
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

478
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

479
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>he was always reading the comments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on forums and can be dangerous.</v>

480
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 1>That can be freaking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because you don't know who's </v>

481
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.670
<v Speaker 1>making those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that can be a 12 year old kid who</v>

482
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.570
<v Speaker 1>on adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's kicking his cat and you're reading</v>

483
00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 1>this guy's words like as if it's gospel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to argue with them and guys</v>

484
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>get you don't know shit</v>

485
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 2>and like fuck your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my mother,</v>

486
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder than it.</v>

487
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I thought commentary was going to be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier job than I thought,</v>

488
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:03.691
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's harder than fighting right </v>

489
00:21:03.691 --> 00:21:04.570
<v Speaker 2>now because it's still new to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only done 10 glory shows and um,</v>

490
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's official yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I'll make it official here,</v>

491
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 2>but a glory signed me full time next </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

492
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

493
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.810

<v Speaker 2>Had huge shows and do 18 shows next </v>

494
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:15.810
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

495
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if I don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much you know about my life,</v>

496
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also a full time high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>

497
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>

498
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 2>So literally my morning I teach phys ed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I teach at a special education school,</v>

499
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 2>so I work with kids with special needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors,</v>

500
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 2>autism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I teach phys ed to them.</v>

501
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 2>So that's nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash eight.</v>

502
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 2>What time do we start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight 50.</v>

503
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Five to 3:30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then from three,</v>

504
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:40.711
<v Speaker 2>I have an hour to eat my lunch or my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner at that point and then I have my </v>

505
00:21:40.711 --> 00:21:40.711
<v Speaker 2>own gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bazooka,</v>

506
00:21:40.711 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing and mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you teach classes after that?</v>

507
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I train and I teach classes a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times we put,</v>

508
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.730
<v Speaker 2>we have a big broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentored her.</v>

509
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Jim's huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's big,</v>

510
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 2>it's popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's nonstop.</v>

511
00:21:50.771 --> 00:21:53.050
<v Speaker 2>And then at night I go home and I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do commentary.</v>

512
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.350
<v Speaker 2>what a bunch of lucky kids to have a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you as a coach,</v>

513
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing,</v>

514
00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:01.240
<v Speaker 2>but I never really got to reach my full </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential and all the things I wanted to</v>

515
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 2>do with kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is where it's happening.</v>

516
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Glory having me full time allowed me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a year leave from teaching.</v>

517
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at my instagram,</v>

518
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you could already see the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

519
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to educate people.</v>

520
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to get people hooked to glory </v>
<v Speaker 2>hooked to this sport.</v>

521
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.950
<v Speaker 2>So I'm posting training videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training tips.</v>

522
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I got chris kamozi just a commented on </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my videos being like,</v>

523
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep up the drilling.</v>

524
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I loved the drills I had john mccain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just private messaged me saying like,</v>

525
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.160

<v Speaker 2>So it's just getting that word out man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>is where it's at.</v>

528
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's just a matter of staying </v>

529
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 2>the course and continuing to put out </v>
<v Speaker 2>content and we've played a bunch of your</v>

530
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 2>stuff on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on has been huge.</v>

531
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.400
<v Speaker 2>You just posted something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got like a,</v>

532
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 2>almost a thousand new instagram likes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and follows.</v>

533
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

534
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:54.050
<v Speaker 2>you're welcome brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now that you are in this position as </v>

535
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.990
<v Speaker 2>glory commentator and you've recovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>from your concussion,</v>

536
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.210
<v Speaker 2>do you have any thoughts in your head of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting?</v>

537
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

538
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 2>there's more money doing commentary than</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is in the ring.</v>

539
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's where kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still that there's still not enough</v>

540
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:11.371
<v Speaker 2>finances to make it worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also comes down to is any money </v>

541
00:23:11.371 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 2>worth health at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can make $10,000,000</v>

542
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:19.351
<v Speaker 2>a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't remember that fight </v>

543
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:19.351
<v Speaker 2>after and you don't recover from brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries again,</v>

544
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.060
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having this conversation with some</v>

545
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:23.380
<v Speaker 2>guys this week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

546
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.440
<v Speaker 2>that are not fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were asking me about a certain </v>

547
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 2>fights where people got knocked out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

548
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.680
<v Speaker 2>how come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

549
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.940
<v Speaker 2>when they came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.160
<v Speaker 2>they weren't as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my take on It was you never know how</v>

551
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:41.161
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to recover from a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know physically and your case </v>

552
00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:42.730
<v Speaker 2>is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a fight you want,</v>

553
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>where you won the world title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We dIdn't get knocked and he got</v>

554
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.040
<v Speaker 1>knocked down but not knocked out and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>still had this concussion issue and when</v>

555
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 1>someone would look at you like right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk,</v>

556
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:55.280
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look fine.</v>

557
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't look like there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

558
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 1>People would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

559
00:23:57.381 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 1>he's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you fight?</v>

560
00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.710
<v Speaker 1>But you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

561
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.750
<v Speaker 1>it takes a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to be honest with this </v>

562
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.750
<v Speaker 1>whole recovery period and it takes a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of you.</v>

563
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:10.751
<v Speaker 1>It takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have to find something deep </v>

564
00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to find that mental strength to</v>

565
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

566
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of what people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand with concussions comes </v>

567
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.191
<v Speaker 1>depression and there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is a big side effect of </v>

568
00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:22.080
<v Speaker 1>depression is a big side effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>concussions.</v>

569
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these guys that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

570
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just get knocked out and then </v>

571
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:29.290
<v Speaker 1>they're forgotten about.</v>

572
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Those guys go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're depressed.</v>

573
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brain chemistry is all mixed up.</v>

574
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Their brains not recovering the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

575
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these fighters are at home,</v>

576
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:37.640
<v Speaker 1>probably crying themselves to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

577
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 1>have headaches every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just don't.</v>

578
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.110
<v Speaker 1>ThEre's not enough education on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are going through and </v>

579
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Speaker 1>suffering with and I know you're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>big on it,</v>

580
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 1>but one of the big things that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped me and we can go,</v>

581
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 1>we can branch off on this is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of cbds for brain injuries.</v>

582
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.350
<v Speaker 1>That's been incredible for my recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

583
00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.360
<v Speaker 1>cbd is non psychoactive compound in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis and it's a crazy thing that's </v>

584
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:11.081
<v Speaker 1>going on here in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you guys treated up in </v>

585
00:25:11.081 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially being turned into a</v>

586
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:14.900
<v Speaker 1>schedule one drug now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not psychoactive.</v>

587
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 100 percent shenanigans by </v>

588
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.830
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

589
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.620
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent influenced by these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that stand to lose money because </v>

590
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.300
<v Speaker 1>cbd oil helps a lot of people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

591
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:31.301
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people with chronic arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lung cancer as a potential to cure </v>

592
00:25:31.301 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

593
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey.</v>

594
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly helps treat it.</v>

595
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.500
<v Speaker 1>It treats inflammation and inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently if you talk to doctors,</v>

596
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:44.501
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you it's a huge issue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest issues when it comes </v>

597
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.621
<v Speaker 1>to diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and things like arthritis </v>

598
00:25:47.621 --> 00:25:47.621
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and headaches,</v>

599
00:25:47.621 --> 00:25:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you know like when you're taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for a </v>

600
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.941
<v Speaker 1>headache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're taking an advil or </v>

601
00:25:54.941 --> 00:25:56.920
<v Speaker 1>ibuprofen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're taking is something that </v>

602
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:56.920
<v Speaker 1>reduces inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what it's for.</v>

603
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And cbd oil does the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's natural.</v>

604
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:04.691
<v Speaker 1>It's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad for you and it doesn't get </v>

605
00:26:04.691 --> 00:26:04.691
<v Speaker 1>you high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like something's gonna fuck you</v>

606
00:26:04.691 --> 00:26:09.011
<v Speaker 1>up at work has been crazy because when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going in that dark room there for </v>

607
00:26:09.011 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 1>three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

608
00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:15.221
<v Speaker 1>doctors were giving me like six to eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>percocets a day and they were giving me </v>

609
00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:17.330
<v Speaker 1>two muscle relaxants for my back pain.</v>

610
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.940
<v Speaker 1>So what was going on with your back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

611
00:26:19.941 --> 00:26:21.380
<v Speaker 1>something with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

612
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:26.381
<v Speaker 1>the nerves from my brain because it must</v>
<v Speaker 1>have damaged some of the inflammation </v>

613
00:26:26.381 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 1>and it was causing this back pain and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even get out of bed with.</v>

614
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.130
<v Speaker 1>So they were giving me all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to cope with it.</v>

615
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.370
<v Speaker 1>WhEn and then all of a sudden I got my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters and my family to do some </v>

616
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:36.370
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

617
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.931
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've taken anything you could've </v>

618
00:26:40.931 --> 00:26:40.931
<v Speaker 1>given me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coke,</v>

619
00:26:40.931 --> 00:26:40.931
<v Speaker 1>heroine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acid,</v>

620
00:26:40.931 --> 00:26:41.870
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have taken it to recover because</v>

621
00:26:41.871 --> 00:26:43.140
<v Speaker 1>those pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were messing me up.</v>

622
00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I was going through like I was living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cartoon world in that dark room.</v>

623
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:51.351
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was tripping out and then it got to </v>

624
00:26:51.351 --> 00:26:51.351
<v Speaker 1>the point where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

625
00:26:51.351 --> 00:26:51.351
<v Speaker 1>I've been.</v>

626
00:26:51.351 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I got people to research and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

627
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:57.891
<v Speaker 1>these cbds help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My family did all the research and they </v>

628
00:26:57.891 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 1>ended up getting me some cbd stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so how did it for them?</v>

629
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Did you take it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it as a,</v>

630
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>as an oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you just take it on?</v>

631
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:08.121
<v Speaker 1>Drops on your tongue and you put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath my tongue basically kinda </v>

632
00:27:08.121 --> 00:27:10.890
<v Speaker 1>thing and I was able to cut out all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those percosets and everything just with</v>

633
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>cbd oil in how long of a time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right away.</v>

634
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right away.</v>

635
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I stopped because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those concussions and brain </v>

636
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:20.180
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you develop insomnia.</v>

637
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't eating much.</v>

638
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.960
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does cbd and cannabis good for </v>

639
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 1>munchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>munchies and sleeping so.</v>

640
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And it was good for my recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

641
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helped manage to get off all of those</v>

642
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 1>painkillers and now I'm able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

643
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.630
<v Speaker 1>be healthy and control my brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>headaches and stuff without having to </v>

644
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.840
<v Speaker 1>take ibuprofen and advil.</v>

645
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Are you still getting headaches?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come,</v>

646
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:46.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still there and we gotta </v>

647
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 1>remember I'm working three full time </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs and if you're not,</v>

648
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.360
<v Speaker 1>even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 1>your brain is healthy and you're working</v>
<v Speaker 1>three full time jobs,</v>

650
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to get a headache </v>
<v Speaker 1>or to throughout your day,</v>

651
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.250
<v Speaker 1>but when you get a headache it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different experience.</v>

652
00:27:55.251 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 1>It's different because you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so aware of where it can go.</v>

653
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scary.</v>

654
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's been helping men and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

655
00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:04.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on my list to watch.</v>

656
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

657
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 1>because I was explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

658
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:11.421
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to tell brogan about your </v>

659
00:28:11.421 --> 00:28:11.421
<v Speaker 1>experience with cbd and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got to watch it.</v>

660
00:28:11.421 --> 00:28:15.681
<v Speaker 1>I think you wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a 2007 you came up with the </v>

661
00:28:15.681 --> 00:28:15.681
<v Speaker 1>union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

662
00:28:15.681 --> 00:28:15.681
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

663
00:28:15.681 --> 00:28:20.130
<v Speaker 1>that was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a documentary by my buddy adam who had,</v>

664
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives up in bc and that whole area is</v>

665
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:29.211
<v Speaker 1>essentially run by the marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry even though marijuana is </v>

666
00:28:29.211 --> 00:28:29.211
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

667
00:28:29.211 --> 00:28:33.800
<v Speaker 1>So they made this documentary explaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>how without marijuana your entire </v>

668
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:39.051
<v Speaker 1>economies fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's this underground economy and </v>

669
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 1>they call it the union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a really,</v>

670
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on my list.</v>

671
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And then he went onto make the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

672
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 1>which is also an excellent documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he made after lunch.</v>

673
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I watch both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

674
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

675
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

676
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.680
<v Speaker 1>we've been hoodwinked in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately in all countries now </v>

677
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.231
<v Speaker 1>because of the influence of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been hoodwinked by the propaganda </v>

678
00:28:57.231 --> 00:28:58.560
<v Speaker 1>that they came up with in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties,</v>

679
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't even about pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs back then.</v>

680
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.350
<v Speaker 1>it was really about the paper industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

681
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's William Randolph hearst who was a,</v>

682
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:12.590
<v Speaker 1>a real creepy guy and he was the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>why a orson welles made that movie </v>

683
00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:14.310
<v Speaker 1>citizen kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the,</v>

684
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.970
<v Speaker 1>he was the inspiration for that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

685
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 1>About one guy.</v>

686
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of dominating the world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his influence.</v>

687
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And William Randolph hearst didn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>own newspaper companies.</v>

688
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 1>He also owned paper mills and he owned </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>

689
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 1>these enormous forest where they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>chop down trees to make paper with them.</v>

690
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And in the 19 thirties they came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a product called the decorticator.</v>

691
00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:38.671
<v Speaker 1>And the decorticator is a machine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed them to effectively process hemp</v>

692
00:29:38.701 --> 00:29:43.000
<v Speaker 1>fiber very easily because hemp is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual plant.</v>

693
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this table that we have here,</v>

694
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:47.170
<v Speaker 1>this is oak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An oak is a very hard wood,</v>

695
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 1>will hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hemp is as hard as a joke,</v>

696
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's way lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a freaking alien plant.</v>

697
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Like if you pick up a hemp stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is a decorticator that there,</v>

698
00:29:56.351 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

699
00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:57.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

700
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a modern one I guess.</v>

701
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>So you throw the hemp fibers in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it grinds them up,</v>

702
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.360
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemp is still federally illegal even </v>

703
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.650
<v Speaker 1>though it's not psychoactive and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much stupidity that's all attached to</v>

704
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:12.780
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

705
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It was just so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tsa has to be under one percent thc or</v>

706
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:19.550
<v Speaker 1>is that a myth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

707
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't make it legal to sell or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

708
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can grow it in some states,</v>

709
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.370
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is like federally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>federally it's still illegal,</v>

710
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just slow and painful.</v>

711
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all the propaganda from the 19 </v>

712
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.761
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So William Randolph hearst who own </v>

713
00:30:41.761 --> 00:30:41.860
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came out with this decorticator and</v>

714
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 1>then popular science magazine had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover cv good.</v>

715
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>And jamie hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new billion dollar crop because </v>

716
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.770
<v Speaker 1>because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see they used to use hemp way back in </v>

717
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.591
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the drafts of the declaration of </v>

718
00:30:55.591 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 1>independence were written on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sales that they used for,</v>

719
00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.490
<v Speaker 1>for boats were all made out of hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff was out of hemp.</v>

720
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.750
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>canvas,</v>

721
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:03.850
<v Speaker 1>the word canvas comes from the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>

722
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
<v Speaker 1>so the mona lisa was painted on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they came up with that and then when </v>

723
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>eli whitney came up with a cotton gin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cotton was more effective to use.</v>

724
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were going to use it for clothes</v>

725
00:31:15.571 --> 00:31:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and you see it on the cover of popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>science magazine.</v>

726
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 1>It was on the cover though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

727
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Speaker 1>See if you isn't popular mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>

728
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they used to use it for parachutes.</v>

729
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>They use it for all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

730
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.420
<v Speaker 1>But then when eli whitney came up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cotton gin,</v>

731
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:36.540
<v Speaker 1>it was easier for them to make clothes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of cotton because hemp requires a </v>

732
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.840
<v Speaker 1>lot to break down the fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such an abandoned cloth.</v>

733
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a crazy plant and it makes </v>

734
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.461
<v Speaker 1>this unbelievable paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hemp paper is so superior to this </v>

735
00:31:47.461 --> 00:31:47.680
<v Speaker 1>paper that we all use.</v>

736
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Like this paper that we use is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rips so easy.</v>

737
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Hemp papers really hard to epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It weighs the same.</v>

738
00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:56.380
<v Speaker 1>It looks the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels the same,</v>

739
00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a better fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of William Randolph hearst </v>

740
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.681
<v Speaker 1>embracing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have lost millions of dollars </v>

741
00:32:04.681 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 1>because he would've had to replant these</v>
<v Speaker 1>forests and tournament at him.</v>

742
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:10.590
<v Speaker 1>He decided to go the other route and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just start making propaganda against </v>

743
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he started calling it marijuana.</v>

744
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana was never a name for cannabis.</v>

745
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana was a wild mexican tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took this name from this wild </v>

746
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 1>mexican tobacco just called it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started talking about this new drug</v>

747
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 1>that's making white women get raped by </v>
<v Speaker 1>mexicans and black people.</v>

748
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Nice plant wizards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fIght war time,</v>

749
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:33.760
<v Speaker 1>drug paralegal that we need hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of it for mortgage.</v>

750
00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:38.761
<v Speaker 1>But hemp means marijuana to content is </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the drug menace out of this useful </v>

751
00:32:38.761 --> 00:32:39.280
<v Speaker 1>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

752
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 1>So all this</v>

753
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:45.130
<v Speaker 3>shit came from this one asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one asshole in harry anslinger who was </v>

754
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.810
<v Speaker 3>the guy in charge of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

755
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they originally got a lot of people that</v>

756
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:53.990
<v Speaker 3>were involved in the alcohol prohibition</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once alcohol prohibition was done,</v>

757
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 3>they needed something else to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>

758
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got something right here.</v>

759
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Which call probably does more damage to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body then?</v>

760
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

761
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was drunk as fuck monday night,</v>

762
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 3>monday night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've,</v>

763
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.890
<v Speaker 3>I might've been blackout drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People tell me for like three days </v>

764
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:08.890
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

765
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 3>I feel like shit today a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so this,</v>

766
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.670
<v Speaker 3>this propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're still fighting this.</v>

767
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 3>They're literally still fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of like.</v>

768
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:20.951
<v Speaker 3>It's little different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why I'm kickboxing and mmas it was </v>

769
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:23.870
<v Speaker 3>so hard to get into ontario stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

770
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 3>legislature and stuff from years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the language ruined.</v>

771
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.400
<v Speaker 3>It just ruins things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the language and it's something</v>

772
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 3>that was something about the belts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we can't get kickboxing or,</v>

773
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 3>or more tie in ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada because of belt.</v>

774
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because of some language inside </v>

775
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.250
<v Speaker 3>like a legal documents and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>within that language.</v>

776
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 3>It says something about you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>perform kicks sir.</v>

777
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:53.470
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ufc had so much dIfficult time to get </v>

778
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.801
<v Speaker 3>into toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's in there now so it's not yet </v>

779
00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.190
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not in toronto.</v>

780
00:33:58.191 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Above the waist on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do local,</v>

781
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.910
<v Speaker 3>can't do low kicking fights or </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional moy.</v>

782
00:34:03.911 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Tai in ontario is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All old shit from years ago that,</v>

783
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the commissioner was following from long</v>

784
00:34:12.171 --> 00:34:17.171
<v Speaker 3>time ago and even if you ask fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had a conversation with matt </v>

785
00:34:17.171 --> 00:34:18.170
<v Speaker 3>embry who was fighting robin van route </v>
<v Speaker 3>smiling and we were like,</v>

786
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we don't even know it's Just,</v>

787
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 3>it's been in the legal document the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's written and the terminology screWed</v>

788
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:26.330
<v Speaker 3>us up.</v>

789
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.420
<v Speaker 3>But how is that the case when you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>still have ufc fights and they're </v>

790
00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.911
<v Speaker 3>allowed to low kick and I think it comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to money probably comes down to money </v>

791
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 3>like everything else that's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

792
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But You gotta think too off topic,</v>

793
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:45.761
<v Speaker 3>but look at the canadian kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>champions that have come out of Canada </v>

794
00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:46.460
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know one of your favorite fights of </v>

<v Speaker 3>because there hasn't been one us glory </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

807
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point in time before mma or </v>

808
00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 3>before the ufC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really got a foothold in Brazil.</v>

809
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:27.730
<v Speaker 3>The Canada Market was the biggest market</v>
<v Speaker 3>for mma is outside of the United States.</v>

810
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.840
<v Speaker 3>The ones that we had at the roger </v>
<v Speaker 3>center,</v>

811
00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:31.940
<v Speaker 3>they're 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

812
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.790
<v Speaker 3>it was gigantic or 60,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it was.</v>

00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:35.960
<v Speaker 3>It was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>

814
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a also</v>

815
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it was because of george st </v>
<v Speaker 1>pierre and george being such a great </v>

816
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.881
<v Speaker 1>representative of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great representative of the ufc and a </v>

<v Speaker 1>great champion like people flock to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

818
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:52.191
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things about Canada is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how loYal canadian citizens are towards </v>

819
00:35:52.191 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 1>their fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you ask toronto blue jays,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the toronto may police,</v>

00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.760
<v Speaker 1>We're going to build it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

823
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:02.160
<v Speaker 1>There's talks about it so it can glory </v>
<v Speaker 1>make something happen.</v>

824
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:07.161
<v Speaker 1>Here is talk about the rules here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fouls administering a kick to the </v>

825
00:36:07.161 --> 00:36:08.610
<v Speaker 1>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning back fists or illegal,</v>

826
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 1>striking the face with any part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

827
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Elbows are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chopping to the back of the neck.</v>

828
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they watched too much.</v>

829
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Flintstones fucking karate chop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Striking a blow to the groin area.</v>

830
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Butting with the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the top one?</v>

831
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

832
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 1>striking a blow with an elbow or a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't strike a need of the box.</v>

833
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't get how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

834
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.240
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how did the ufc I think is so it's </v>

835
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:32.640
<v Speaker 1>got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you need a big chunk of money to</v>

836
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 1>kind of even get the commissioner to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>

837
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:40.401
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this professional boxing where </v>

838
00:36:40.401 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 1>blows may be struck with both the fists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the feet.</v>

839
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.360
<v Speaker 1>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the same laws that apply to </v>

840
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.560
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use for kickboxing book.</v>

841
00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:53.220
<v Speaker 1>You can only kick with the fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what if you kick someone with a head</v>

842
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:55.170
<v Speaker 1>kick and you hit with the shin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it illegal?</v>

843
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't even knoW that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

844
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 1>No one thinks you're kicking with feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

845
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Sweeping above the ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't even have a fucking.</v>

846
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't even sweep someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

847
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

848
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Above the ankle so you can't sweep </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

849
00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 1>You just sweep shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>

850
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 1>But it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

851
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:19.320
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intentionally using block.</v>

852
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't block within the chat below </v>
<v Speaker 1>the waist,</v>

853
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:27.741
<v Speaker 1>so I guess there's no need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The block a body kick you block with a </v>

854
00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:30.270
<v Speaker 1>body kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

855
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:35.271
<v Speaker 1>Intentionally evading contact or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a lot of fucking wacky rules.</v>

856
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Striking a blow with an open glove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed the commissioner who was </v>

857
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 1>kind of really strict too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is now out.</v>

858
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Speaker 1>So this one would changes using abusive </v>
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>

859
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nick diaz fights in Canada.</v>

860
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Folks disobeying the referee going down </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally.</v>

861
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Intentionally using the nea as a block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

862
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Extending the legs for the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing an opponent from kicking.</v>

863
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.170
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

864
00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:01.620
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's messed up.</v>

865
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.070
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extending the leg for the pope?</v>

866
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Purpose of preventing an opponent from </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking.</v>

867
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing this was written in 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't even make any sense.</v>

868
00:38:11.761 --> 00:38:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even use it team then,</v>

869
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:17.540
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanted to extend your leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tape is to extend the leg,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You could say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>guys that was like really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would knock guys dead.</v>

885
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.340
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get to watch a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

886
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I've done my research and watched a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his fights after and that's crazy for</v>

887
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 2>god about him for a long time until </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice conversation.</v>

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Rick rufus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

891
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Rick rufus was one of the most popular I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say.</v>

892
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

893
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was so flashy too.</v>

894
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.800
<v Speaker 2>He could do so many wild techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the octagon.</v>

895
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see the fight where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought a tie fighter?</v>

896
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

897
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those low kicks,</v>

898
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't exciting.</v>

899
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Fight to down to that and his stuff's </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

900
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 2>He posted one with the mine and mark to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bond and he put a nice little.</v>

901
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 2>The way I set up that high kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's good.</v>

902
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very good.</v>

903
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:43.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting because the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight essentially changed a lot of </v>

904
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:48.871
<v Speaker 2>people's ideas about low kicks because </v>
<v Speaker 2>even duke roufus like they interviewed </v>

905
00:39:48.871 --> 00:39:50.530
<v Speaker 2>roof is after the funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 19 and he's like,</v>

906
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:55.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take any talent to just kick </v>

907
00:39:55.531 --> 00:39:55.531
<v Speaker 2>the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

908
00:39:55.531 --> 00:39:55.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

909
00:39:55.531 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I rememBer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy weird idea.</v>

910
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.590
<v Speaker 2>You gotta ask him about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked to him about it.</v>

911
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a huge proponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He became a world champion,</v>

912
00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loves his low kicks.</v>

913
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.620
<v Speaker 2>He was seeing his brother at such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>young age,</v>

914
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 2>but that opened up everyone's eyes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>low kick.</v>

915
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the low kicks he people think like,</v>

916
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:18.070
<v Speaker 2>my style of the low kicks style is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a new thing is actually a really</v>

917
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 2>old concept that was kind of forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

918
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.940
<v Speaker 2>And then there's only a few people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>came in and stuck true to that low kick </v>

919
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.940
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's underrated,</v>

920
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:33.150
<v Speaker 2>especially in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I'm going to bring it up </v>

921
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.150
<v Speaker 2>about mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was like,</v>

922
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.751
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the takedowns of good low kick is </v>

923
00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:36.751
<v Speaker 2>based off timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

924
00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to sit there and get a lead</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a low kick against the rest of </v>

925
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

926
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.880
<v Speaker 2>He's going to take me down every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's the timing of the low </v>

927
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.090
<v Speaker 2>kick that people need to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone's exiting backwards,</v>

928
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 2>that's your time for the low kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you put,</v>

929
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.970
<v Speaker 2>especially in mma where people can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really stand in the pocket,</v>

930
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.810
<v Speaker 2>they move and they exit as soon as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get outside of punch range,</v>

931
00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 2>that's perfect.</v>

932
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Low kick time and you'll get so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>free low kicks on mma.</v>

933
00:40:59.501 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Guys and Their legs aren't strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mma guys aren't used to that.</v>

934
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>body damage that kickboxers are,</v>

935
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.890
<v Speaker 2>and I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

936
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 2>my coach coach gary goodridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

937
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 2>and gary once told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

938
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 2>when he got fought both kickboxing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mma,</v>

939
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.650
<v Speaker 2>he came back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

940
00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I knew I could go to the after party </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I fought mma,</v>

941
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.690
<v Speaker 2>but he goes in after a kickboxing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's lIke,</v>

942
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting out of my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to think how much shinta shin </v>

943
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>kickboxers go through compared to an mma</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

944
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.230
<v Speaker 2>How often do you see a late kick checked</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the or there?</v>

945
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 1>It's getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting better,</v>

946
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.230
<v Speaker 1>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

947
00:41:37.231 --> 00:41:42.231
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you and that's another </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that people always complain about </v>

948
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:42.231
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm always calling for low kicks and</v>

949
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 1>saying I'd like to see more low kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like to see him kick his legs more.</v>

950
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:49.481
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're right too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it takes someone who understands </v>

951
00:41:49.481 --> 00:41:53.051
<v Speaker 1>moitai at a very high level to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull that off and do it in </v>

952
00:41:53.051 --> 00:41:55.991
<v Speaker 1>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're seeing sometimes in mma is </v>

953
00:41:55.991 --> 00:41:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you would see a lot during the george st</v>
<v Speaker 1>pierre era where guys were afraid to </v>

954
00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 1>kick because george was so good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>timing explosive,</v>

955
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:03.440
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was he fighting against?</v>

956
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:06.920
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't fighting against a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually knew how to use the proper.</v>

957
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

958
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 1>and we don't really see that many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>lIke,</v>

959
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have a few in the sales </v>
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>

960
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Would you say jose though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph has spectacular leg kicks,</v>

961
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was killing guys.</v>

962
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

963
00:42:18.981 --> 00:42:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you look at the notoriety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

964
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Favorite fight was horrendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called that fight and afterwards,</v>

965
00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:28.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uriah posted all these instagram </v>

966
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.881
<v Speaker 1>pictures and social horrible leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swollen leg twice the size and yeah,</v>

967
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a meme on my phone.</v>

968
00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:38.951
<v Speaker 1>I keep sending because a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring and some will smash my guy's </v>

969
00:42:38.951 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 1>legs and then I'll send them the picture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being like,</v>

970
00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 1>tag someone who doesn't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>block a low kick and I just keep sending</v>

971
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:44.750
<v Speaker 1>that picture out of mess around with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

972
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:45.710
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal.</v>

973
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens to your ears?</v>

974
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes leg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

975
00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:56.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to go in a hyperbaric chamber to </v>

976
00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:56.140
<v Speaker 1>try to lessen the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

977
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 1>the injury.</v>

978
00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Try to heal the injury quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people don't understand the damage </v>

979
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:02.010
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

980
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.560
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if every time you punch,</v>

981
00:43:03.561 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I smash your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to want to punch me.</v>

982
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's the timing I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as someone jabs,</v>

983
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you take the leg because when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches,</v>

984
00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:16.601
<v Speaker 1>they have to put their weight on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>front leg and once you put your weight </v>

985
00:43:16.601 --> 00:43:19.990
<v Speaker 1>on the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can no longer block at that </v>

986
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.031
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you watch any of my fights are </v>

987
00:43:22.031 --> 00:43:24.131
<v Speaker 1>guys with good low kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually timed the low kick off the </v>

988
00:43:24.131 --> 00:43:26.441
<v Speaker 1>hands because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the step because every time you step </v>

989
00:43:26.441 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you got to be heavy on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your front foot.</v>

990
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's the opportunity to hit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>low kick.</v>

991
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 1>So you want to look for what I call free</v>
<v Speaker 1>low kicks ones where they can't block.</v>

992
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.900
<v Speaker 1>So as they're exiting up or as they step</v>
<v Speaker 1>in or you've tried to find those free </v>

993
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:43.031
<v Speaker 1>ones when they're planted on their legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can't lift up there like the </v>

994
00:43:43.031 --> 00:43:46.101
<v Speaker 1>black jamie put up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see If you can find joe's fight with </v>

995
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Daniels because like I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

996
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 1>this was one of my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a big Raymond Daniels fan by the</v>

997
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a knock on him at all.</v>

998
00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:57.821
<v Speaker 1>I think he's awesome and I think his </v>
<v Speaker 1>style is very important because it's </v>

999
00:43:57.821 --> 00:44:01.541
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important to know that there </v>

1000
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:01.541
<v Speaker 1>is a guy who can do the kind of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can do.</v>

1001
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:03.350
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does that jump side kick,</v>

1002
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:08.351
<v Speaker 1>spinning back kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he does a lot of wild shit inside</v>

1003
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:14.951
<v Speaker 1>the octagon and so this fight to me was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really important fight for just </v>

1004
00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:20.501
<v Speaker 1>martial arts strategy and technique to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how a guy like you,</v>

1005
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:26.080
<v Speaker 1>who's super high level guy deals with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who's completely unorthodox in terms</v>

1006
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:29.690
<v Speaker 1>of traditional kickboxing techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:32.640
<v Speaker 1>he's got a style that is impossible</v>

1008
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.480
<v Speaker 2>to emulate inside inside the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1009
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I fought kareem gaji over a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

1010
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.080
<v Speaker 2>nikki hold skin over 100 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've fought guys mark to bond over 100 </v>

1011
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:47.001
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was probably the fighter I was most </v>

1012
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:47.001
<v Speaker 2>scared to fight because all this wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1013
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:47.001
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1014
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:51.651
<v Speaker 2>do I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last thing I want to be as part of </v>

1015
00:44:51.651 --> 00:44:53.871
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a knockout real of Raymond Daniels </v>

1016
00:44:53.871 --> 00:44:53.871
<v Speaker 2>spinning hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick knocking me the frig out.</v>

1017
00:44:53.871 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I was scared then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at this point,</v>

1018
00:44:56.731 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 2>like even in round one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

1019
00:44:58.321 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 2>what the heck is this guy going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what the heck this guy was</v>

1020
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:07.071
<v Speaker 2>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I really love about </v>

1021
00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:07.071
<v Speaker 2>watching fight too is always a very high</v>
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>

<v Speaker 2>very good fundamentals.</v>

1023

<v Speaker 2>training sequences that you put on </v>

<v Speaker 2>He's the one who really developed my low</v>

1031
00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:35.331
<v Speaker 2>kick style and I just was able to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it together and showcase his </v>

1032
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:41.571
<v Speaker 2>strategy of low kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he used to explain it is that </v>

1033
00:45:41.571 --> 00:45:42.160
<v Speaker 2>people think a low kick is a low kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1034
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not you gotta think we're on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shin.</v>

1035
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Are you landing the cake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1036
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.100
<v Speaker 2>If you land more of the lower part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your shin,</v>

1037
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:55.130
<v Speaker 2>that's more of a setup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might want to use your low kick to </v>

1038
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.321
<v Speaker 2>set up your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might want to have it as a feeler </v>

1039
00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:57.560
<v Speaker 2>just as a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1040
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.840
<v Speaker 2>if you start landing higher up on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shin,</v>

1041
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 2>those are more finished low kicks.</v>

1042
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.650
<v Speaker 2>the angle you throw it at the timing you</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it at.</v>

1043
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.320
<v Speaker 2>So when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when paul was training me,</v>

1044
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:12.500
<v Speaker 2>he would kind of classify like nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>different locations based on where on </v>

1045
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the leg gets hitting and where on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shin your landing.</v>

1046
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.200
<v Speaker 2>So there's so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a jab.</v>

1047
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:18.480
<v Speaker 2>There's not just theirs up jabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1048
00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jab with your head off to off on angles.</v>

1049
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:23.280
<v Speaker 2>There's low jabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hijabs.</v>

1050
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Each job has a different purpose in same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with the low kick or you just lit </v>

1051
00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.530
<v Speaker 2>him up with that low kick and you saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>that little limp that guys start doing.</v>

1052
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:36.531
<v Speaker 2>When you see right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once you start landing these big </v>

1053
00:46:36.531 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 2>shots to the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you slow them down considerably.</v>

1054
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Now what did you do to prepare for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and this front leg style?</v>

1055
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Because he was throwiNg a lot of front </v>
<v Speaker 2>like psychics to your front leg.</v>

1056
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:51.050
<v Speaker 2>It was just this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What lot of people don't see when you </v>

1057
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.170
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of it is risk control.</v>

1058
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 2>You can't just chase raymond as you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get him against the ropes.</v>

1059
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.690
<v Speaker 2>You got a corner room and if you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he blitzes,</v>

1060
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't move back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you move back,</v>

1061
00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:07.870
<v Speaker 2>you give him an exit and an opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to escape where if you stay.</v>

1062
00:47:07.871 --> 00:47:12.871
<v Speaker 2>See when he blitzes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stay right in his pocket and it opens </v>

1063
00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:13.870
<v Speaker 2>up the low kick and you're forcing them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to move backwards as well,</v>

1064
00:47:13.871 --> 00:47:15.540
<v Speaker 2>which it's very tiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1066
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Most people get way more tired moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1067
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Then they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moving forward.</v>

1068
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you're both fighting at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same pace,</v>

1069
00:47:22.441 --> 00:47:23.670
<v Speaker 2>but who's doing more work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1070
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:28.671
<v Speaker 2>this round was more of a feel around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to remember after this fight </v>

1071
00:47:28.671 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I fought nikki holtz a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's</v>

1072
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>

1073
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Twenty minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a fan of that.</v>

1074
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.140
<v Speaker 3>I really admire that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1075
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.380
<v Speaker 3>I personally don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to think your brain is still </v>

1076
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 3>shook up from that first fight if not </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully recovered.</v>

1077
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:46.020
<v Speaker 3>and in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best fighter doesn't necessarily </v>

1078
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 3>come out on top and internal too many </v>
<v Speaker 3>variables.</v>

1079
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's crazy.</v>

1080
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:49.820
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1081
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:54.930
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting when you're watching it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it builds up to one eventual </v>

1082
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:56.260
<v Speaker 3>champion and you get to watch all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights take place during the night,</v>

1083
00:47:56.261 --> 00:48:01.261
<v Speaker 3>but I think especially you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt and then you recovering a little </v>

1084
00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:05.401
<v Speaker 3>bit and then going back in again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still busted up from the first </v>

1085
00:48:05.401 --> 00:48:08.401
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably lost a good 10 years of my </v>

1086
00:48:08.401 --> 00:48:08.401
<v Speaker 3>life after that night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what are you going to do?</v>

1087
00:48:08.401 --> 00:48:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there used to be eight minute </v>

1088
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:13.050
<v Speaker 3>tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Aight man tournament.</v>

1090
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 3>So that's three fights in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you just want nikki holds can twice a</v>

1091
00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:16.030
<v Speaker 3>just once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just once,</v>

1092
00:48:16.031 --> 00:48:18.220
<v Speaker 3>just once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in one night you got to think.</v>

1093
00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I got one of the knockouts of the year </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this fight and I got the fight of the</v>

1094
00:48:21.851 --> 00:48:26.851
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nikki and I one fight of the year that </v>

1095
00:48:26.851 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 3>year where we jUst sat and exchange </v>
<v Speaker 3>combinations for three rounds.</v>

1096
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an awesome fight.</v>

1097
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Now they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see like he started to limp.</v>

1098
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.310
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you bring anybody in that,</v>

1099
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:38.340
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kicks like this that throws those </v>

1100
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:38.340
<v Speaker 3>front leg side sidekicks and the hopping</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks.</v>

1101
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very tough.</v>

1102
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:44.490
<v Speaker 3>I experimenTed with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a taekwondo guy and it just wasn't the </v>

1103
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.300
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is a lot of these karate</v>

1104
00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:51.301
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't handle that constant </v>

1105
00:48:51.301 --> 00:48:51.301
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There used to guys standing,</v>

1106
00:48:51.301 --> 00:48:52.930
<v Speaker 3>keeping distance with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting them kick.</v>

1107
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.680
<v Speaker 3>But I was too much of a bully for those </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

1108
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I was able to just stay in the pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to throw spinning kicks.</v>

1109
00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I would just push them on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like they couldn't handle like </v>

1110
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.660
<v Speaker 3>the constant strong pressure style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1111
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:08.890
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely interesting to watch how</v>

1112
00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:10.630
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's so much more.</v>

1113
00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:15.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is over and over again and </v>

1114
00:49:15.631 --> 00:49:15.631
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing them limping now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're noticing them as you're fighting,</v>

1115
00:49:15.631 --> 00:49:19.591
<v Speaker 3>you're noticing that and you keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting that same spot and now he's </v>

1116
00:49:19.591 --> 00:49:19.591
<v Speaker 3>moving and he's standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soundcloud,</v>

1117
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 3>you can tell he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He mixes it up a little bit.</v>

1118
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does switch the stances,</v>

1119
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:29.641
<v Speaker 3>but you could see he's really trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect that left leg now he's keeping </v>

1120
00:49:29.641 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 3>it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1121
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:34.951
<v Speaker 3>When you did bringing those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was there anything that they could show </v>

1122
00:49:34.951 --> 00:49:39.280
<v Speaker 3>you about how to avoid those kicks are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more just kinda like,</v>

1123
00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:44.281
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of the distance and the </v>

1124
00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:44.281
<v Speaker 3>setup.</v>

1125
00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:44.281
<v Speaker 3>These are the kind of few things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to look at.</v>

1126
00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.420
<v Speaker 3>But I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1127
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my fiker,</v>

1128
00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:49.240
<v Speaker 3>which I kind of have a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy now.</v>

1129
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Now that I'm a coach a lot more and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at fighting a little bit </v>

1130
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.510
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1131
00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.640
<v Speaker 3>but here I knew I was going to fight my </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1132
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.200
<v Speaker 3>He had to fight my way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1133
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to be in trouble.</v>

1134
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.580
<v Speaker 3>It was three in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

1135
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:04.360
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

1136
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:06.940
<v Speaker 3>You just chop and chop and at that leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1137
00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:10.750
<v Speaker 3>this is like the fight that I show </v>
<v Speaker 3>people when I show people the difference</v>

1138
00:50:10.751 --> 00:50:15.751
<v Speaker 3>between a really good thai fighter who </v>
<v Speaker 3>is fighting a guy who throws a lot of </v>

1139
00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 3>flashy stuff but doesn't really know the</v>
<v Speaker 3>low kick game.</v>

1140
00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And he throws those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not a lot of threat outside </v>

1141
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:26.200
<v Speaker 3>those spinning attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does have that explosive lefthand but</v>

1142
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can shut that</v>

1143
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 2>down really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1144
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a great karate point fighter,</v>

1145
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 2>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1146
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 2>His boxing has come along way since this</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1147
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I think he learned a lot about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in this fight,</v>

1148
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 2>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1149
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.080
<v Speaker 2>his hands weren't the big threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1150
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.020
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiates him from wonderboy.</v>

1151
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Also wonder boys obviously fighting with</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller gloves,</v>

1152
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:52.810
<v Speaker 2>but wonderboy has nasty hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if wonderboy in raymond dan is where </v>

1153
00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:54.140
<v Speaker 2>to fight and kick boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who went?</v>

1154
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:57.170
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder boys,</v>

1155
00:50:57.171 --> 00:51:00.670
<v Speaker 2>undefeated kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't checked box things.</v>

1156
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1157
00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:03.950
<v Speaker 2>you hear about this guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1158
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:04.580
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1159
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 2>he's undefeated as a kick boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1160
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.980
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the same weight if you're </v>

1161
00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.931
<v Speaker 2>undefeated in years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how can we never heard of each other </v>

1162
00:51:13.931 --> 00:51:13.931
<v Speaker 2>or saw each other?</v>

1163
00:51:13.931 --> 00:51:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Like what happens with a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and,</v>

1164
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with kickboxing,</v>

1165
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:21.671
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll see guys that'll come around </v>

1166
00:51:21.671 --> 00:51:21.671
<v Speaker 2>and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1167
00:51:21.671 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm a 10 time world champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they okay.</v>

1168
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Like where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there should be,</v>

1169
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 2>like there's one world champion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters right now and its glory.</v>

1170
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So any other belt than that?</v>

1171
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:31.850
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're a world champion.</v>

1172
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about lion fight?</v>

1173
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.090
<v Speaker 2>What about more time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1174
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's a little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A different class.</v>

1175
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:38.480
<v Speaker 2>I would say more thai and kickboxing are</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

1176
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you like better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a straight kickbox.</v>

1177
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.720
<v Speaker 2>And why do you like kickboxing better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than more time?</v>

1178
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Because I like to rely on pace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1179
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.450
<v Speaker 2>more aggression and more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1180
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm a combination style fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I liked him,</v>

1181
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.000
<v Speaker 2>always mix up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks and punches,</v>

1182
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 2>punches and kicks.</v>

1183
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought to full rules,</v>

1184
00:51:55.540 --> 00:52:00.110
<v Speaker 2>more time fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was I'm a french fighter who</v>

1185
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.070
<v Speaker 2>was again sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sixth professional fight.</v>

1186
00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:06.440
<v Speaker 2>It was his 70th and he came in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just,</v>

1187
00:52:06.441 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I beat them up on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as he came close,</v>

1188
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:11.240
<v Speaker 2>he clinched up with my elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elbows,</v>

1189
00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Speaker 2>elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he split my head open.</v>

1190
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Six weeks later I fought that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1191
00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought a medi baghdad.</v>

1192
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.300
<v Speaker 2>That would be a cool one for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

1193
00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.630
<v Speaker 2>'em and I put a little clip on if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to find it after this one,</v>

1194
00:52:23.631 --> 00:52:28.631
<v Speaker 2>it's literally like I've made it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a two minute clip and it's just </v>

1195
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:33.790
<v Speaker 2>beating the crap out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he landed two elbows and I got like </v>

1196
00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 2>30 stitches at the end of that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Covered In blood.</v>

1197
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I got like a three inch gash in my head.</v>

1198
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I had five stitches off my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He landed two elbows,</v>

1199
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 2>two strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the whole flight.</v>

1200
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.320
<v Speaker 2>And those two strikes were the damaging </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

1201
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I mean,</v>

1202
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:47.690
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>

1203
00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wanted to be a kickboxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I never focused on my elbows.</v>

1204
00:52:50.811 --> 00:52:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Could I be a more thai champion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1205
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:57.340
<v Speaker 2>But my focus was on kickboxing and at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point to get into the k,</v>

1206
00:52:57.341 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 2>one max.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1207
00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to fight this mbds.</v>

1208
00:53:00.681 --> 00:53:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I want it to fight aLl of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1209
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 2>the book cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to fight those guys.</v>

1210
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 2>So my focus was always on kIckboxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the day I started.</v>

1211
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:11.510
<v Speaker 2>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1212
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:15.730
<v Speaker 2>that was the big organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>K one was the big organization that kind</v>

1213
00:53:15.731 --> 00:53:17.880
<v Speaker 2>of opened Up kickboxing to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:19.730
<v Speaker 2>in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did an amazing job oF that.</v>

1215
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:21.020
<v Speaker 2>And then they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Course,</v>

1216
00:53:21.021 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>it's showtime and it's show time ran for</v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile and that they became glory,</v>

1217
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1218
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's part of it.</v>

1219
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:31.281
<v Speaker 2>And they shut down because there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there was a lot of </v>

1220
00:53:31.281 --> 00:53:31.281
<v Speaker 2>problems happening in holland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1221
00:53:31.281 --> 00:53:32.480
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1222
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.970
<v Speaker 2>illegal stuff happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal to finish right here.</v>

1223
00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:39.840
<v Speaker 2>This is your Battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now just the amount of shots.</v>

1224
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.880
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had care console over the amount of </v>

1225
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.421
<v Speaker 2>shots that he took to the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you were saying that mma </v>

1226
00:53:47.421 --> 00:53:50.811
<v Speaker 2>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the toughness of the </v>

1227
00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:53.961
<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not used to taking the </v>

1228
00:53:53.961 --> 00:53:53.961
<v Speaker 2>punishment and the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference?</v>

1229
00:53:53.961 --> 00:53:57.201
<v Speaker 2>Like hOw does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does your legs get tougher from </v>

1230
00:53:57.201 --> 00:53:57.201
<v Speaker 2>getting kicked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1231
00:53:57.201 --> 00:53:57.201
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1232
00:53:57.201 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Speaker 2>if you look at martial arts in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

1233
00:53:58.171 --> 00:54:00.060
<v Speaker 2>your body has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your armor.</v>

1234
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta look at your body as armor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't strengthen that armor,</v>

1235
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 2>you're only as strong as your armor can </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold,</v>

1236
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:05.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1237
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not training your Body to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get hit,</v>

1238
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:09.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1239
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:12.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really take as much damage.</v>

1240
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 2>So if you're constantly taking low kicks</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day in training,</v>

1241
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:21.140
<v Speaker 2>you build up that endurance and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance and that strength to be able </v>

1242
00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:21.140
<v Speaker 2>to take hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low kicks.</v>

1243
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:26.270
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not used to that taking heart </v>

1244
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.270
<v Speaker 2>arm kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I my first professionaL fight,</v>

1245
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I left with like welts on my forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My knees would be swollen,</v>

1246
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:35.271
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even get my shoe on after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight because everything was just so </v>

1247
00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:38.331
<v Speaker 2>swollen and you just take so much damage</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the body that eventually it hardens </v>

1248
00:54:38.331 --> 00:54:43.011
<v Speaker 2>and gets stronger and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got to look at our shins or </v>

1249
00:54:43.011 --> 00:54:44.730
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing and muay thai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shins were going through bats,</v>

1250
00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:49.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just constantly kicking things </v>

1251
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.981
<v Speaker 2>where an mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not as much focus on </v>

1252
00:54:51.981 --> 00:54:53.430
<v Speaker 2>condItioning and hardening the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't need it as much,</v>

1253
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:58.730
<v Speaker 2>but what does condition the legs take </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of punishment and constant </v>

1254
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:02.661
<v Speaker 2>hitting loosen years of training or </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting someone to constantly lightly </v>

1255
00:55:02.661 --> 00:55:04.410
<v Speaker 2>touch your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build up the tolerance.</v>

1256
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You got to build a strong armor to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to withstand whatever damage.</v>

1257
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000
<v Speaker 2>What I'm confused about those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is the physical response that </v>

1258
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 2>your body has to getting physiologic </v>
<v Speaker 2>clots?</v>

1259
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the shin for example,</v>

1260
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:21.000
<v Speaker 2>every time you spend there's like those </v>
<v Speaker 2>microfractures that then calcify,</v>

1261
00:55:21.001 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 2>which then caused the shin to harden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1262
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.360
<v Speaker 2>even if the difference between my right </v>
<v Speaker 2>and left shin,</v>

1263
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:31.370
<v Speaker 2>my right shin is probably double the </v>
<v Speaker 2>size of my left one because I'm used my </v>

1264
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:35.091
<v Speaker 2>right shin a lot more really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's just constant years of </v>

1265
00:55:35.091 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 2>training your body to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what about this,</v>

1266
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.760
<v Speaker 2>what about your quads?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And although the lake,</v>

1267
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it nerves?</v>

1268
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Your nerves are able to withstand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain or is the big difference?</v>

1269
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:52.341
<v Speaker 2>And it's weird because I've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it so long where I can usually stand in </v>

1270
00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:56.211
<v Speaker 2>front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you like little lake tapps and I </v>

1271
00:55:56.211 --> 00:55:58.401
<v Speaker 2>can kind of see how hard your body is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can withstand a low kick or now </v>

1272
00:55:58.401 --> 00:56:00.120
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a feeling mechanism so you feel how</v>

1273
00:56:00.121 --> 00:56:03.840
<v Speaker 2>they're responding to it is how they put</v>
<v Speaker 2>their weight,</v>

1274
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:05.490
<v Speaker 2>their pressure on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell.</v>

1275
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 2>You can really tell and when you fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and that's where those guys that</v>

1276
00:56:09.421 --> 00:56:12.030
<v Speaker 2>have a 100 professional fights have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1277
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:17.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of wear and tear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those guys have a body armor that </v>

1278
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:21.590
<v Speaker 2>really takes a lot to try to damage an </v>
<v Speaker 2>older those forearms or those lake cakes</v>

1279
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 2>or it was just years of accumulated</v>

1280
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:29.460
<v Speaker 3>damage in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heart ends up is weird because like you </v>

1281
00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.611
<v Speaker 3>see some of the ties that just blast </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and you'll watch them low </v>

1282
00:56:32.611 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 3>kick each other and you never see him </v>
<v Speaker 3>limping.</v>

1283
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:34.600
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1284
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:39.601
<v Speaker 3>And you see this fight that you had with</v>
<v Speaker 3>raymond and you see like after you know </v>

1285
00:56:39.601 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 3>a minute or in the fight when you kept </v>
<v Speaker 3>chopping,</v>

1286
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 3>there was one moment in the fight in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first round.</v>

1287
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:47.971
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching it live and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught them with one low kick in the </v>

1288
00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:47.971
<v Speaker 3>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

1289
00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:47.971
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it goes.</v>

1290
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:53.070
<v Speaker 3>You see that little dip you know am and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the little dip that their body </v>

1291
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:53.070
<v Speaker 3>goes and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1292
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 3>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you got to think.</v>

1293
00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:58.711
<v Speaker 3>I've probably sparred with thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of different mma fighters and </v>

1294
00:56:58.711 --> 00:57:00.310
<v Speaker 3>soon as we start sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tap the leg once,</v>

1295
00:57:00.311 --> 00:57:02.120
<v Speaker 3>tap the leg twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times,</v>

1296
00:57:02.121 --> 00:57:02.660
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1297
00:57:02.661 --> 00:57:02.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1298
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Can you lay off the leg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

1299
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:05.920
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1300
00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1301
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just hit the other leg.</v>

1302
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.500
<v Speaker 3>The other leg will hit your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

1303
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1304
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a different type of body </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning.</v>

1305
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Is there any way to do it other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>just getting kicked there?</v>

1306
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:19.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does anybody.</v>

1307
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Not that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just years of accumulation </v>

1308
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 3>bottles on their shannon's that I tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find research on that.</v>

1309
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1310
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I did when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1311
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:32.290
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at me.</v>

1312
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:37.291
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting a rolling pin over my shin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess it kind of takes out that </v>

1313
00:57:37.291 --> 00:57:41.570
<v Speaker 3>the nerve damage a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know all the nerve endings and </v>

1314
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Speaker 3>preventing shot to numb them out a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1315
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1316
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:45.130
<v Speaker 3>it is interesting.</v>

1317
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't necessarily make sense.</v>

1318
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Like when it comes to the muscle of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the thighs,</v>

1319
00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:56.611
<v Speaker 3>like it's got to come down to nerve or </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not really bone that's </v>

1320
00:57:56.611 --> 00:57:59.911
<v Speaker 3>getting stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to talk to a doctor who </v>

1321
00:57:59.911 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 3>understands moitai you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know anybody that's like a doctor</v>

1322
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:04.110
<v Speaker 3>that train started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll find out.</v>

1323
00:58:04.111 --> 00:58:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll tweet you out the answer and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll find it.</v>

1324
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it definitely seems like.</v>

1325
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:13.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean especially like we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ties and these guys that have 100 </v>

1326
00:58:13.201 --> 00:58:16.141
<v Speaker 3>plus fights and you see them getting low</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked and it doesn't seem to affect </v>

1327
00:58:16.141 --> 00:58:16.141
<v Speaker 3>them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's landing.</v>

1328
00:58:16.141 --> 00:58:21.001
<v Speaker 3>It's an effective strike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the difference between the way it </v>

1329
00:58:21.001 --> 00:58:23.611
<v Speaker 3>would affect them versus the way it </v>
<v Speaker 3>affect a person's never been low kick </v>

1330
00:58:23.611 --> 00:58:23.611
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1331
00:58:23.611 --> 00:58:26.260
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most underrated a technique and</v>

1332
00:58:26.261 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 3>all martial arts.</v>

1333
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.470
<v Speaker 3>I agree because until you've been low </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked,</v>

1334
00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 3>like once you get low kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you go,</v>

1335
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.700
<v Speaker 3>oh jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1336
00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.410
<v Speaker 3>it's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1337
00:58:33.411 --> 00:58:38.411
<v Speaker 3>it's those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's usually when you get those parties </v>

1338
00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:40.441
<v Speaker 3>and you're drunk go those leg kicks her </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt and then all of a sudden they're </v>

1339
00:58:40.861 --> 00:58:41.800
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just give him one.</v>

1340
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1341
00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.140
<v Speaker 3>I was actually messing with someone once</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1342
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Bruce Lee had the one inch punch and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1343
00:58:49.631 --> 00:58:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a one inch low kick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't walk for a month.</v>

1344
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.300
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you,</v>

1345
00:58:55.301 --> 00:58:58.570
<v Speaker 3>I'll give anyone if anyone listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to have a one inch located.</v>

1346
00:58:58.571 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 3>How do you set it up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

1347
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:04.390
<v Speaker 3>All they gotta do is put my literally my</v>
<v Speaker 3>shin one inch away and just bang done.</v>

1348
00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.450
<v Speaker 3>So like it's hitting the right part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to know where to hit.</v>

1349
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:09.540
<v Speaker 3>So you would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like,</v>

1350
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 3>almost like you're throwing a kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a controlled kicking.</v>

1351
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Stopping at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just go right on that part.</v>

1352
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Tell any man new one inch low kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start it.</v>

1353
00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:25.860
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should make a video about one inch </v>

1354
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:26.690
<v Speaker 3>lower kicked challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you I'm going to do it now.</v>

1355
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 3>You were saying early on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go back to this,</v>

1356
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:33.730
<v Speaker 3>that your thoughts on fighting have </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed from being a fighter to being a </v>

1357
00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:36.920
<v Speaker 3>coach because I think right now I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was fighting,</v>

1358
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 3>I had to have a one dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>

1359
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 3>What worked for me and now as a coach I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone asked me the question,</v>

1360
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.760
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like a new student who's very </v>

1361
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:48.760
<v Speaker 3>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to your gym.</v>

1362
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.060
<v Speaker 3>He has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not strong,</v>

1363
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.480
<v Speaker 3>he's not really as athletic as you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have the training background </v>

1364
00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:55.490
<v Speaker 3>as you.</v>

1365
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:57.260
<v Speaker 3>How do you make that guy a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion?</v>

1366
00:59:58.850 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huh,</v>

1367
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.680
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1368
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:02.330
<v Speaker 3>he's not big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not strong.</v>

1369
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.480
<v Speaker 3>So he's not going to be a great pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter that's going to be able to </v>

1370
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:07.480
<v Speaker 3>withstand a lot of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened?</v>

1371
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.910
<v Speaker 3>So I want it to create a system of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting that is kind of universal.</v>

1372
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want to have.</v>

1373
01:00:12.741 --> 01:00:17.741
<v Speaker 3>I want to have a system in my fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>at bazooka kickboxing that you can go </v>

1374
01:00:17.741 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 3>onto a street fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go and do an mma fight,</v>

1375
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:24.250
<v Speaker 3>you can kick box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to have that knowledge and the </v>

1376
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.891
<v Speaker 3>skillset to be able to fight everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's my goal as a coach right now </v>

1377
01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 3>is to make a universal system that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>handle anything.</v>

1378
01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:32.600
<v Speaker 3>So if you've got a pressure fight versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>

1379
01:00:32.601 --> 01:00:35.180
<v Speaker 3>if you've got to keep distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you need to jab or box,</v>

1380
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 3>you got to be able to have it all.</v>

1381
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree anymore too much with a </v>

1382
01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.751
<v Speaker 3>one dimensional approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the one dimensional approach was </v>

1383
01:00:43.751 --> 01:00:46.571
<v Speaker 3>good for you as a fighter because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>found out where your skills in directed </v>

1384
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:47.990
<v Speaker 3>you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1385
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I look at it as I wasn't an </v>

1386
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.031
<v Speaker 3>exceptional case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an exceptional athlete that was </v>

1387
01:00:55.031 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 3>gifted with a strong body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong mind,</v>

1388
01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:58.490
<v Speaker 3>good dedication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very motivated,</v>

1389
01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:03.491
<v Speaker 3>so it all worked in my favor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I have a guy who was fighting </v>

1390
01:01:03.491 --> 01:01:06.880
<v Speaker 3>amateur kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I train that guy to be </v>

1391
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.941
<v Speaker 3>successful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that helps you as a </v>

1392
01:01:09.941 --> 01:01:12.791
<v Speaker 3>fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he didn't know a lot of jujitsu </v>

1393
01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:15.191
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start coaching and once they start </v>

1394
01:01:15.191 --> 01:01:15.400
<v Speaker 3>coaching and teaching lessons there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>

1395
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.620
<v Speaker 3>their game jUst jumps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was being a color commentator.</v>

1396
01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 3>That helps a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1397
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I got to show you like after or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1398
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you my notes on what I do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be interested to see your thoughts </v>

1399
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:27.560
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you write your own notes for,</v>

1400
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:32.610
<v Speaker 3>for the events?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wrote notes as far as like your </v>

1401
01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:34.930
<v Speaker 3>fighter notes or do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you now just experienced enough to </v>

1402
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:37.691
<v Speaker 3>know about the fighters?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends entirely on who the fighters </v>

1403
01:01:37.691 --> 01:01:41.261
<v Speaker 3>either because many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times I'm watching the guy fight </v>

1404
01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:41.420
<v Speaker 3>for the first time and if I've never </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen someone before,</v>

1405
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:44.330
<v Speaker 3>what I like to do is I like to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>some youtube videos of them,</v>

1406
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 3>like to watch him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read what their background is.</v>

1407
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.010
<v Speaker 3>So you do do a lot of research still you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1408
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:55.780
<v Speaker 3>See I say I do research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say I don't do any research because I </v>

1409
01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.600
<v Speaker 3>would've done it anyway because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1410
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.850
<v Speaker 3>like I'll do research for gloria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't work for gloria.</v>

1411
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you still want.</v>

1412
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:02.210
<v Speaker 3>So like your fence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1414
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.490
<v Speaker 3>So it's like say if there's a big fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up,</v>

1415
01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:06.710
<v Speaker 3>like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example,</v>

1416
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:07.320
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1417
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holly holm,</v>

1418
01:02:09.891 --> 01:02:14.891
<v Speaker 3>germane to random me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to fight for the ufc for </v>

1419
01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:14.891
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1420
01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:19.390
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting to me is germane </v>
<v Speaker 3>to random randomize a multiple time </v>

1421
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>world champion and who's had a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with the</v>

1422
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>clench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with people,</v>

1423
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>taking her down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the other aspects of them.</v>

1424
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And she's trying to find our groove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a dutch girl,</v>

1425
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>nasty strike or real tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw her was at ufc 200.</v>

1426
01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Was she In the Brazil card with cyborg </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something?</v>

1427
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>She'd like to vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's vicious.</v>

1428
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>She's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good striker.</v>

1429
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>

1430
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting because you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>holly,</v>

1431
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>who looked like a fucking dynamo when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she fought ronda because ronda fought </v>

1432
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>the absolute worst kind of fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fight with holly,</v>

1433
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>run right at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go straight go at her because she </v>

1434
01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>didn't want her to bully her and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't,</v>

1435
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holly,</v>

1436
01:02:57.271 --> 01:03:02.271
<v Speaker 1>so good at evasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good at using angles and so good at </v>

1437
01:03:02.271 --> 01:03:02.930
<v Speaker 1>stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then countering,</v>

1438
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>punching straight punching and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird oblique kick that they,</v>

1439
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.480
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the winkle john guys like to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the thigh.</v>

1440
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you use that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kick it off.</v>

1441
01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1442
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys use that kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1443
01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1444
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1445
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:21.990
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys that really know how </v>

1446
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:21.990
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1447
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:23.700
<v Speaker 1>to land that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm starting to see it.</v>

1448
01:03:23.701 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1449
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1450
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting kick.</v>

1451
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>But the john guys in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gals too.</v>

1452
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Holly is really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the front kick.</v>

1453
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.940
<v Speaker 1>It's when anderson silva knocked dell </v>
<v Speaker 1>bell for and everyone was like,</v>

1454
01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front kick,</v>

1455
01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:45.051
<v Speaker 1>look at this amazing new weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it'S probably the first kick ever </v>

1456
01:03:45.051 --> 01:03:48.420
<v Speaker 1>taught in traditional martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just he made it so popular and then</v>

1457
01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:53.421
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you see it as a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>trend where everyone started throwing </v>

1458
01:03:53.421 --> 01:03:56.301
<v Speaker 1>front kicks to the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became like a new popular little </v>

1459
01:03:56.301 --> 01:03:56.940
<v Speaker 1>trend there for a little bit that hey </v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1460
01:03:56.941 --> 01:03:58.050
<v Speaker 1>front kicks work again.</v>

1461
01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:03.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just they were forgotten about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I'm hoping with the low </v>

1462
01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:03.330
<v Speaker 1>kick they were forgotten about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they come back.</v>

1463
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's room for a lot of </v>

1464
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.730
<v Speaker 1>different kicks in mma that aren't there</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

1465
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And one of them that we're seeing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some organizations is acs kicks.</v>

1466
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>And I saw some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there was that guy that was </v>

1467
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>fighting and mma for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gfc adlon.</v>

1468
01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm a gov.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's a wild fighter man.</v>

1469
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:28.050
<v Speaker 1>And he now he retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stopped fighting and mma.</v>

1470
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:33.350
<v Speaker 1>But he was really talented man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out it was tj walberger I </v>

1471
01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:36.600
<v Speaker 1>believe in the ufc with an ax cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1472
01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:41.601
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what he kicked him with and </v>

1473
01:04:41.601 --> 01:04:41.601
<v Speaker 1>punched him with too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

1474
01:04:41.601 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>he had wicked kicks and incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility.</v>

1475
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.280
<v Speaker 1>So he had this ability to utilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques that you don't necessarily </v>

1476
01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:55.011
<v Speaker 1>think of as knockout techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he would smash guys with acs kicks </v>

1477
01:04:55.011 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>in front kicks and round kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just for those,</v>

1478
01:04:57.841 --> 01:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kickboxing fans listening.</v>

1479
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Andy hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1480
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hook kicks to the lay.</v>

1481
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1500
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1501
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Lorenzo larkin's recent fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil magni.</v>

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up a lorenz larkin.</v>

1503
01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Neil magnet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want.</v>

1504
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I want to show them that oblique kick to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body and what am I.</v>

1505
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.110
<v Speaker 2>My guys out there that's In the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenroom.</v>

1506
01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Matt special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually sent me the fight and have </v>

1507
01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.121
<v Speaker 2>it was too busy with glory notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he sent me that exact fight to </v>

1508
01:06:15.121 --> 01:06:15.121
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

1509
01:06:15.121 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Lauren's larkin's a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good and his.</v>

1510
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 2>He does a lot of spinning wheel kicks to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thigh to.</v>

1511
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 2>He does a lot of wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1512
01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I think any kid should Be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown at different levels for sure.</v>

1513
01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes that kIck more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

1514
01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:32.320
<v Speaker 2>If you're constantly going at one level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes easy to defend.</v>

1515
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.300
<v Speaker 2>So you got to change the levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

1516
01:06:34.301 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Same thing as southpaws guys don't kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough for myself,</v>

1517
01:06:38.021 --> 01:06:39.010
<v Speaker 2>paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1518
01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.140
<v Speaker 2>or If they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's constantly one.</v>

1519
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:44.110
<v Speaker 2>It's either the inside leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not attacking the back legs,</v>

1520
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:45.130
<v Speaker 2>the bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head.</v>

1521
01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:50.131
<v Speaker 2>You got to change levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not enough self paws are changing </v>

1522
01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:50.131
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With that left kick,</v>

1523
01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:53.170
<v Speaker 2>do you experiment or use any traditional</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts techniques?</v>

1524
01:06:53.171 --> 01:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Like do you ever throw sidekicks or </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning kicks?</v>

1525
01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1526
01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I've really taken like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really been taught to keep really </v>

1527
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:05.830
<v Speaker 2>tight on a shield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now my whole style has actually been</v>

1528
01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>trying to like add dimensions to it.</v>

1529
01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.120
<v Speaker 2>So I've been boxing a lot more and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1530
01:07:10.121 --> 01:07:11.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had the concussion,</v>

1531
01:07:11.211 --> 01:07:13.300
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean I stopped being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial artist.</v>

1532
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.390
<v Speaker 2>This is when my real martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>training has evolved.</v>

1533
01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.070
<v Speaker 2>UM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was fighting,</v>

1534
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was fighting,</v>

1535
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have tiMe to sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for exAmple,</v>

1536
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:25.870
<v Speaker 2>the last three months I fought southpaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been training self paul just to.</v>

1537
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a new dimension to my game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now's the time.</v>

1538
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I get to be a full time martial artists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and learn.</v>

1539
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Watch how he throws this oblique kick to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body,</v>

1540
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>back up a little bit because this is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the fight.</v>

1541
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:38.320
<v Speaker 2>He's setting it up with the low kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1542
01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:43.321
<v Speaker 2>he sets it up with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's what's interesting is the </v>

1543
01:07:43.321 --> 01:07:43.840
<v Speaker 2>distance where he throws this oblique </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick,</v>

1544
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.430
<v Speaker 2>he throws it like right there.</v>

1545
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see how he throws it.</v>

1546
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:49.520
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1547
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Heel and toe out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1548
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.330
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so fast.</v>

1549
01:07:53.331 --> 01:07:53.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1550
01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:58.651
<v Speaker 2>I liked that because if the elbows in </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets the foot probably just outside of </v>

1551
01:07:58.651 --> 01:08:03.151
<v Speaker 2>the elbow or inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of follows the inside forearm </v>

1552
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:03.151
<v Speaker 2>nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Lorenzo is the best I've ever seen a </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing that kick and throwing it right</v>

1554
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.380
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried right there.</v>

1555
01:08:08.381 --> 01:08:10.900
<v Speaker 2>I miss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he throws it from tight quarters and</v>

1556
01:08:10.901 --> 01:08:13.030
<v Speaker 2>guys think he's gonna throw low kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he missed it,</v>

1557
01:08:13.031 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>mixes it up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's using the kick and</v>

1558
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.270
<v Speaker 1>then he sets it up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1559
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:21.470
<v Speaker 1>with either the oblique kick or the low </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick and he constantly varies.</v>

1560
01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that kicked traditionally is</v>

1561
01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>meant to hit with the heel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1562
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's hitting him with the heel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's um,</v>

1564
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird to look at because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1565
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:36.430
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that to this setup is unreal </v>

1566
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.430
<v Speaker 1>with the low kick there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1567
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's set up is great.</v>

1568
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And this was a great fight for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1569
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew lawrence was super talented </v>

1570
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:47.410
<v Speaker 1>before this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but neil magnum was a highly rated guy </v>

1571
01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>and lauren just ran through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is the difference in the striking</v>

1572
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.740
<v Speaker 1>magnet is a really good all around </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

1573
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 1>He's really well rounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got incredible endurance,</v>

1574
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>but what lorenzo was able to do is avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>

1575
01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>avoid the ground game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the fight in his wheelhouse,</v>

1576
01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.730
<v Speaker 1>which is in the standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just show how much more technical he</v>

1577
01:09:04.731 --> 01:09:07.760
<v Speaker 1>is on his feet and how much quicker he </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a closing the gap.</v>

1578
01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any staying long too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1579
01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's fighting a tall guy too.</v>

1580
01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

1581
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:18.970
<v Speaker 1>if larkin's got the shorter arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is he going to sit there and want a </v>

1582
01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:22.361
<v Speaker 1>box with a guy with longer arms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to change your distance and </v>

1583
01:09:22.361 --> 01:09:23.480
<v Speaker 1>the low kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect work setup perfectly.</v>

1584
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Now back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1585
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:28.760
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to moitai and elbows.</v>

1586
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that elbows are the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously they're really effective,</v>

1587
01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and elbows and elbows from the clinch </v>

1588
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.441
<v Speaker 1>and needs from the clench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you're really effective </v>

1589
01:09:41.441 --> 01:09:43.601
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like rules that don't have </v>

1590
01:09:43.601 --> 01:09:43.930
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember listening to your podcast and</v>

1591
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:48.931
<v Speaker 1>someone asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you were talking about how you </v>

1592
01:09:48.931 --> 01:09:49.340
<v Speaker 1>feel more tie is like the purest art of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up fighting.</v>

1593
01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1594
01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like all fighting.</v>

1595
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:55.040
<v Speaker 1>I like mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1596
01:09:55.041 --> 01:10:00.041
<v Speaker 1>obviously love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mma is probably my favorite </v>

1597
01:10:00.041 --> 01:10:02.591
<v Speaker 1>thing to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I like about moitai is when </v>

1598
01:10:02.591 --> 01:10:06.671
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing the clench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your using all the potential weapons </v>

1599
01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 1>from inside that position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in kickboxinG they will separate</v>

1600
01:10:08.691 --> 01:10:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just for me personally,</v>

1601
01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:13.400
<v Speaker 1>why I don't like to clinch it slows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight down.</v>

1602
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's because you can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crappy outside fighter but be so strong </v>

1603
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:22.580
<v Speaker 1>and dominant and the clinton winning all</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fights in the clench.</v>

1604
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1605
01:10:23.421 --> 01:10:28.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's just a rule set and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean each guy's going to be different </v>

1606
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:30.800
<v Speaker 1>from what they're good at or not good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1607
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's how you train,</v>

1608
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:35.000
<v Speaker 1>but you have to change your style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to change.</v>

1609
01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Like even if I were to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about kickboxing and mma.</v>

1610
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to change your style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if you fight between kickboxing</v>

1611
01:10:42.891 --> 01:10:44.810
<v Speaker 1>and muay thai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to change quite a bit.</v>

1612
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fighter like myself,</v>

1613
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:50.210
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't want to get into the clinch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to fight differently.</v>

1614
01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:52.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to use triangle stepping in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your foot work.</v>

1615
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 1>You got to use more distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to stay away.</v>

1616
01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I could maybe only throw a a two or </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hit combination before I have to </v>

1617
01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:04.031
<v Speaker 1>exit and move again because I know he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try to grab me and cleanse me </v>

1618
01:11:04.031 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slice me up with his elbows.</v>

1619
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Is there a more difficult transItion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you think that the transition </v>

1620
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.960
<v Speaker 1>between kickboxing and muay thai is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult or the transition between more</v>

1621
01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 1>thai and kickboxing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're seeing a lot of</v>

1622
01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.590
<v Speaker 3>moitai champions that are now entering </v>
<v Speaker 3>into kickbox.</v>

1623
01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:19.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to more tie more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>

1624
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:24.951
<v Speaker 3>It's more difficult because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>adding all these new weapons so you're </v>

1625
01:11:25.511 --> 01:11:30.511
<v Speaker 3>in all of a sudden now have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons that you're not used to wear </v>

1626
01:11:30.511 --> 01:11:31.920
<v Speaker 3>with more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tie your kind of take away some,</v>

1627
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:36.921
<v Speaker 3>but you still have your other weapons </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are effective and it had this </v>

1628
01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:36.921
<v Speaker 3>conversation with a lot of the more tie </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>

1629
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:42.020
<v Speaker 3>They were saying how you got to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the success of more tIe fighters and </v>

1630
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:42.770
<v Speaker 3>kick with boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have sit.</v>

1631
01:11:42.771 --> 01:11:44.580
<v Speaker 3>A chai sits on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been on.</v>

1632
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:49.610
<v Speaker 3>who's a savage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the current lightweight champion </v>

1633
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:53.890
<v Speaker 3>fighters like sand chai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moitai legend came in and his first </v>

1634
01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:57.240
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing fight dominated this young </v>
<v Speaker 3>thai kid that just came in and France.</v>

1635
01:11:57.241 --> 01:12:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pet panda maroon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't move cow.</v>

1636
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.580
<v Speaker 3>He came in and just left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked one weapon,</v>

1637
01:12:03.581 --> 01:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>shut down a an aggressive punch to low </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>

1638
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.670
<v Speaker 3>just one kick left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick left,</v>

1639
01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:09.210
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

1640
01:12:09.211 --> 01:12:09.450
<v Speaker 3>kick.</v>

1641
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 3>And these guys have been fighting for so</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

1642
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:17.121
<v Speaker 3>It's fighting to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fighting at the end of the day is still </v>

1643
01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:17.121
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1644
01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:21.141
<v Speaker 3>so these thai guys and who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>following traditional moitai are still </v>

1645
01:12:21.141 --> 01:12:24.861
<v Speaker 3>being very successful and kickboxing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the basic workout you can </v>

1646
01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:28.350
<v Speaker 3>dominated dog house is a great example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1647
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:32.000
<v Speaker 3>And still around to sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting because he's a,</v>

1648
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.840
<v Speaker 3>she wants his glory for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes I did.</v>

1649
01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fun to watch,</v>

1650
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:35.820
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1651
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Tricky slipping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll fly.</v>

1652
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Big guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small guys.</v>

1653
01:12:38.671 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put a hole,</v>

1654
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 3>a social media campaign to fight conor </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcgregor in mma.</v>

1655
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1656
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Does he know how to wrestle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1657
01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:53.380
<v Speaker 3>No luck with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your thoughts on conor and floyd?</v>

1658
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could that even happen?</v>

1659
01:12:57.610 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Could it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.290
<v Speaker 3>Floyd is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like again,</v>

1661
01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.750
<v Speaker 3>the best defensive fighter ever and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1662
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:08.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean in a straight boxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to give the advantage of him </v>

1663
01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:08.770
<v Speaker 3>and just have to.</v>

1664
01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:12.950
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The traditional wisdom would say that </v>

1665
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:14.700
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna box connor's face off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1666
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.740
<v Speaker 3>You would look at it and you would look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at what he's been able to do,</v>

1667
01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:21.330
<v Speaker 3>but conner's a fucking freak man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a weird guy.</v>

1668
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:25.680
<v Speaker 3>He's got his mind is so fucking strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he eats pressure.</v>

1669
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.620
<v Speaker 3>He just eats it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when he stepped into that ring with</v>

1670
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:33.621
<v Speaker 3>josie aldo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked like he didn't have a care in </v>

1671
01:13:33.621 --> 01:13:34.050
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need that confidence and that belief</v>

1672
01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:39.051
<v Speaker 3>men is just staggering and he had talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much shit for so long and aldo was </v>

1673
01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:44.931
<v Speaker 3>just fuming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was steaming at the bank when he got </v>

1674
01:13:44.931 --> 01:13:47.721
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was so emotionally invested in that </v>

1675
01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:50.181
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like he had never been </v>

1676
01:13:50.181 --> 01:13:51.450
<v Speaker 3>disrespected like that and to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespected for months.</v>

1677
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean they had done this huge world </v>
<v Speaker 3>tour where connor stole his belt at a </v>

1678
01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 3>press conference and was yelling at him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean it was madness.</v>

1679
01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:04.490
<v Speaker 3>And then to have the fight and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>connor starches him with one punch 13 </v>

1680
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:05.250
<v Speaker 3>seconds into the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wow.</v>

1681
01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1682
01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.440
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stirred up a lot of attention.</v>

1683
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Obviously floyd is not jose aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Floyd is,</v>

1684
01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:14.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1685
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.350
<v Speaker 3>it would be a boxing match in an mma </v>
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>

1686
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Connor would fucking kill him for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1687
01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:20.180
<v Speaker 3>to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kicked it.</v>

1688
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 3>shit wouldn't even flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would never get close to,</v>

1689
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:24.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct,</v>

1690
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:26.680
<v Speaker 3>kicked his fucking legs out from under </v>
<v Speaker 3>them every time.</v>

1691
01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be,</v>

1692
01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:30.100
<v Speaker 3>it would be brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in a boxing match,</v>

1693
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.040
<v Speaker 3>one thing that connor's has got going </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

1694
01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:33.220
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way bigger guy.</v>

1695
01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:34.390
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1696
01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I know he fought at 1:45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but jesus christ,</v>

1697
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:38.650
<v Speaker 3>he looked like a dead man when he made </v>
<v Speaker 3>45.</v>

1698
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.020
<v Speaker 3>His shoulders are broad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's.</v>

1699
01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's walking around and one 70 ish </v>

1700
01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:46.050
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around then.</v>

1701
01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:46.270
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think floyd is floyd is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller guy.</v>

1702
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:51.960
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you were saying about with </v>

1703
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:51.960
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the same holds true with boxing,</v>

1704
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.131
<v Speaker 3>that those fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not cutting the kind of weight </v>

1705
01:14:56.131 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 3>that mma fighters are cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what they would weigh in</v>

1706
01:14:56.381 --> 01:15:01.381
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume it'd probably be like </v>

1707
01:15:01.381 --> 01:15:01.381
<v Speaker 3>1:55</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around there.</v>

1708
01:15:01.381 --> 01:15:03.220
<v Speaker 3>And then once they got into the octagon </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the ring rather,</v>

1709
01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.060
<v Speaker 3>it would be a boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Floyd would probably have a disadvantage</v>

1710
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.890
<v Speaker 3>weight-wise of somewhere around 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

1711
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1712
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't see it happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they did,</v>

1713
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:17.170
<v Speaker 3>floyd look canelo had a big weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage over him in that fight too.</v>

1714
01:15:17.171 --> 01:15:19.660
<v Speaker 3>And floyd shut that shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1715
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so good at boxing,</v>

1716
01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:22.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just so good.</v>

1717
01:15:22.661 --> 01:15:27.661
<v Speaker 3>He's so grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more I follow and train and learn </v>

1718
01:15:27.661 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 3>boxing I something I wish I started a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot earlier on in my career.</v>

1719
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.550
<v Speaker 3>It's men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you only have two weapons,</v>

1720
01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you all of a sudden have to make </v>

1721
01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:39.410
<v Speaker 3>this complex strategy through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1722
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 3>creating openings and with kicks you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a whole other dimension.</v>

1723
01:15:43.361 --> 01:15:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinic.</v>

1724
01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:47.710
<v Speaker 3>But with boxing man he got two fists </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to make land.</v>

1725
01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.590
<v Speaker 3>It's tough and I get why it's called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet science.</v>

1726
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Now when you are training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sparring a right?</v>

1727
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

1728
01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.560
<v Speaker 3>but I make sure I spar with the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys and that kind of thing,</v>

1729
01:15:56.561 --> 01:15:59.530
<v Speaker 3>but I still do spar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And are you worried at all about getting</v>

1730
01:15:59.531 --> 01:16:02.260
<v Speaker 3>hit when you're doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes and no.</v>

1731
01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just love it too much.</v>

1732
01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I just love it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1733
01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the last thing you could ever</v>

1734
01:16:08.261 --> 01:16:10.420
<v Speaker 3>call me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do everything very calculated,</v>

1735
01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:12.760
<v Speaker 3>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I know there's an issue,</v>

1736
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:18.060
<v Speaker 3>I slow it down or if there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive guy but I still spar and I </v>

1737
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.120
<v Speaker 3>still start very controlled and I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick it up if I want.</v>

1738
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.140
<v Speaker 3>It's just why was the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I don't need to get in there </v>

1739
01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.460
<v Speaker 3>and have those sparring matches where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to take the guy's head off.</v>

1740
01:16:27.461 --> 01:16:32.461
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the obviously the consequences for </v>

1741
01:16:32.461 --> 01:16:32.920
<v Speaker 3>you are so much more obvious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intense,</v>

1742
01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:34.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing what you've been through.</v>

1743
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean is that in the back of your head </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all while you're doing it sometimes.</v>

1744
01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:44.370
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your take on these fighters </v>

1745
01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:45.370
<v Speaker 3>taking a new approach on a not sparring </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore?</v>

1746
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>donald cerrone is taken that approach </v>

1747
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:53.700
<v Speaker 3>and it seems really effective for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think part of what's doing well </v>

1748
01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:58.171
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously he has excellent </v>

1749
01:16:58.171 --> 01:17:00.061
<v Speaker 3>timing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he's very experienced as a </v>

1750
01:17:00.061 --> 01:17:00.061
<v Speaker 3>fighter already and he likes to stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>active,</v>

1751
01:17:00.061 --> 01:17:03.040
<v Speaker 3>but his take on it was that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>beating himself up too much in the gym.</v>

1752
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Then he was firing too many hard rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would go into these fights </v>

1753
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:08.040
<v Speaker 3>already damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just couldn't take shots.</v>

1754
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the philosophy and moitai.</v>

1755
01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:14.441
<v Speaker 3>They don't really spar hard in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand because they fight very often </v>

1756
01:17:14.441 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're not fighting very often,</v>

1757
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.590
<v Speaker 3>would you need that sparring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>

1758
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I think their spa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's stupid sparring and then there's</v>

1759
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:27.941
<v Speaker 3>quality sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's so many different ways </v>

1760
01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:30.851
<v Speaker 3>to spar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're constantly going in there and </v>

1761
01:17:30.851 --> 01:17:30.851
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to slug it out and getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>sloppy,</v>

1762
01:17:30.851 --> 01:17:30.851
<v Speaker 3>that's not good sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1763
01:17:30.851 --> 01:17:35.770
<v Speaker 3>so you can get a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of really sets his shots up </v>

1764
01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:36.830
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goes hard to the body and low kicks.</v>

1765
01:17:36.831 --> 01:17:41.831
<v Speaker 3>When I spar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my guys were trying to take each other </v>

1766
01:17:41.831 --> 01:17:44.141
<v Speaker 3>out with body shots and low kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I finished my training partner </v>

1767
01:17:44.141 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 3>to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the king.</v>

1768
01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.330
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk around and just like walking,</v>

1769
01:17:47.331 --> 01:17:50.300
<v Speaker 3>like I owned the place mat to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the body,</v>

1770
01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 3>low kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are okay,</v>

1771
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 3>but you don't need to finish guys to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>head inspiring.</v>

1772
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the dutch way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1773
01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.470
<v Speaker 3>They go 100 percent of the legs into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom.</v>

1774
01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Speaking to some of the dutch guys like </v>
<v Speaker 3>jason wellness,</v>

1775
01:18:00.171 --> 01:18:05.171
<v Speaker 3>who's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His coach was telling me they do </v>

1776
01:18:05.171 --> 01:18:05.810
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the lines of 50 rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of sparring a week.</v>

1777
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:09.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1779
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how intense are the types </v>
<v Speaker 3>of shots,</v>

1780
01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:14.120
<v Speaker 3>but they rely a lot on sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1781
01:18:14.121 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 3>wildernesses fight with simon marcus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a fight.</v>

1782
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 3>That was jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was an amazing fight.</v>

1783
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:23.820
<v Speaker 3>And simon marcus looks so fucking good </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning of first.</v>

1784
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just exploding,</v>

1785
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.960
<v Speaker 3>but it seemed like he drained his gas </v>
<v Speaker 3>tank and got too cocky with that head </v>

1786
01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.060
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

1787
01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that about?</v>

1788
01:18:33.081 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he at one point in the fight,</v>

1789
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.720
<v Speaker 3>like almost like invited him to punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>him and just kind of moved his head a </v>

1790
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.180
<v Speaker 3>little bit and then they gave him a </v>
<v Speaker 3>count for that too.</v>

1791
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I don't,</v>

1792
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have called that one account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the referee did a good stop on that.</v>

1793
01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Wellness was just unloading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1794
01:18:48.621 --> 01:18:53.621
<v Speaker 3>it definitely under stoppage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seemed like when they gave my </v>

1795
01:18:53.621 --> 01:18:56.351
<v Speaker 3>account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the referee was seeing some shit </v>

1796
01:18:56.351 --> 01:18:56.660
<v Speaker 3>we weren't seeing because it seemed like</v>
<v Speaker 3>simon,</v>

1797
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:59.010
<v Speaker 3>like from that point on started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wither.</v>

1798
01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was crazy.</v>

1799
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Because you look how good he looked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of that fight.</v>

1800
01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:08.360
<v Speaker 3>He was blasting those kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like jesus and he was fucking going</v>

1801
01:19:08.361 --> 01:19:08.990
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1802
01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:13.991
<v Speaker 3>Which is when you look at simon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so shredded a specimen and his </v>

1803
01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:17.890
<v Speaker 3>style is so predicated on that.</v>

1804
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.610
<v Speaker 3>We're reliant on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just yells In the ring,</v>

1805
01:19:22.611 --> 01:19:23.150
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1806
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense.</v>

1807
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.830
<v Speaker 3>But he just couldn't keep it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1808
01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:31.850
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't keep that pace up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is why I liked this fight with </v>

1809
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.850
<v Speaker 3>tanya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see Israel stuff?</v>

1810
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.830
<v Speaker 3>They call the style of vendor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1811
01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.360
<v Speaker 3>is all low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wicked.</v>

1812
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:39.620
<v Speaker 3>He's throwing the low line technical </v>
<v Speaker 3>good distance control southpaw,</v>

1813
01:19:39.621 --> 01:19:42.710
<v Speaker 3>orthodox spin kick boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's good.</v>

1814
01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:47.860
<v Speaker 3>He's a paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the style to beat that dutch </v>

1815
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:48.950
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Straightforward fighting.</v>

1816
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want to fight on angles.</v>

1817
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Use distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use movement.</v>

1818
01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.130
<v Speaker 3>Where how do you beat someone like style</v>
<v Speaker 3>bender?</v>

1819
01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Constant pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1820
01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 3>head to head fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low kicks,</v>

1821
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:04.660
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to see wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to use that head to head pressure </v>

1822
01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:07.541
<v Speaker 3>fighting like we saw with me and Raymond</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniels versus I decided to try to use </v>

1823
01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:09.480
<v Speaker 3>movement on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick his shots,</v>

1824
01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:10.290
<v Speaker 3>fight on angles.</v>

1825
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:15.290
<v Speaker 3>So on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of these guys have the style to </v>

1826
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:18.501
<v Speaker 3>beat one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why that fights super </v>

1827
01:20:18.501 --> 01:20:20.460
<v Speaker 3>exciting for me to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well a style bender has been toying with</v>

1828
01:20:20.461 --> 01:20:25.461
<v Speaker 3>the idea of fighting and mma to and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interested to know and I'm toying</v>

1829
01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:27.500
<v Speaker 3>with the idea of fighting the ufc I </v>
<v Speaker 3>should say,</v>

1830
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:32.890
<v Speaker 3>and I'm really wanted to see like how he</v>
<v Speaker 3>manages training and competing in both </v>

1831
01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:35.910
<v Speaker 3>sports because that was a giant issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>with joe schilling.</v>

1832
01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:41.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe schilling was trying to do both </v>

1833
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:41.170
<v Speaker 3>little time when he just decided that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1834
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:45.590
<v Speaker 3>it's just not really smart and wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't able to fight to his best </v>

1835
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 3>ability in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1836
01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Too many limits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1837
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.660
<v Speaker 3>and you don't have much time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in his thirties,</v>

1838
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much time is there in a day?</v>

1839
01:20:54.211 --> 01:20:55.410
<v Speaker 3>How much time is there in your life?</v>

1840
01:20:55.430 --> 01:21:00.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be excellent at one </v>

1841
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.430
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot.</v>

1842
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.870
<v Speaker 3>That's why if you're a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectionist and it.</v>

1843
01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:01.840
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:06.420
<v Speaker 3>And you have to be okay with not being </v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent at everything.</v>

1845
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a hard concept for martial </v>

1846
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Speaker 3>artist and an athlete to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

1847
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:16.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're striking is just going to be </v>

1848
01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:16.581
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we gotta work on your ground,</v>

1849
01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:19.881
<v Speaker 3>so don't worry about your striking now </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only so much time in a day you </v>

1850
01:21:19.881 --> 01:21:23.241
<v Speaker 3>can do training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really interesting thing that </v>

1851
01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:25.371
<v Speaker 3>you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be really okay at that </v>

1852
01:21:25.371 --> 01:21:28.701
<v Speaker 3>because like if you do jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna get strangled by black </v>

1853
01:21:28.701 --> 01:21:28.701
<v Speaker 3>belts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you go,</v>

1854
01:21:28.701 --> 01:21:32.631
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were kickbox I'd fuck that dude </v>

1855
01:21:32.631 --> 01:21:32.631
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1856
01:21:32.631 --> 01:21:32.631
<v Speaker 3>And you have to have that in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>

1857
01:21:32.631 --> 01:21:37.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing kickbox and with a guy </v>

1858
01:21:37.181 --> 01:21:37.181
<v Speaker 3>like bull cow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1859
01:21:37.181 --> 01:21:37.181
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1860
01:21:37.181 --> 01:21:37.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not as good as him.</v>

1861
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:42.230
<v Speaker 3>I kicked butt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking take his ass down and can't </v>

1862
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:42.230
<v Speaker 3>keep gotta be okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1863
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.320
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the things that george </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so amazing at.</v>

1864
01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:47.880
<v Speaker 3>St pierre was so amazing at being able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do whatever he wanted to.</v>

1865
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Dependent upon what you thought he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do.</v>

1866
01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was definitely above average and </v>

1867
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:56.361
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you put george st pierre and a </v>

1868
01:21:56.361 --> 01:21:56.361
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1869
01:21:56.361 --> 01:21:58.030
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would it be the best?</v>

1870
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.780
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's great.</v>

1871
01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.610
<v Speaker 3>He's phenomenal at everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1872
01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what made him so </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant.</v>

1873
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:07.640
<v Speaker 3>He's above average on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1874
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1875
01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:11.490
<v Speaker 3>And also incredibly unpredictable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative.</v>

1876
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.520
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the best things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most athletic guys I've seen </v>

1877
01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:16.520
<v Speaker 3>in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1878
01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.631
<v Speaker 3>He's a really interesting case too </v>
<v Speaker 3>because george didn't really wrestle </v>

1879
01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:20.631
<v Speaker 3>competitively in college or in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

1880
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.820
<v Speaker 3>He learned wrestling from a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>russian nationals in montreal,</v>

1881
01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:28.850
<v Speaker 3>which could be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose a lot of those things that </v>

1882
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.850
<v Speaker 3>aren't needed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1883
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Well george is also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so humble,</v>

1884
01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:35.760
<v Speaker 3>like as confident as he was as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion and as a dominant champion.</v>

1885
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:41.150
<v Speaker 3>He's so humble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could teach george things and </v>

1886
01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:41.150
<v Speaker 3>he would just completely absorbed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would never,</v>

1887
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:46.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't the type of guy that would </v>

1888
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:49.640
<v Speaker 3>have a hard time learning new things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very open to stuff because I </v>

1889
01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:53.121
<v Speaker 3>always follow him on social media and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I hope that I'm actually </v>

1890
01:22:53.121 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 3>trying to get out to tristar was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to for us a little bit.</v>

1891
01:22:55.290 --> 01:23:00.290
<v Speaker 3>I would love to go out there and train </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their team and to see if you know </v>

1892
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.290
<v Speaker 3>how we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1893
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:02.280
<v Speaker 3>connect together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that'd be an awesome connection.</v>

1894
01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:04.530
<v Speaker 3>It would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's still gonna fight.</v>

1895
01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:06.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean he still still talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1896
01:23:06.171 --> 01:23:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I heard that that's what I hit up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1897
01:23:07.661 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>let me help you guys to take me in.</v>

1900
01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I got to do some work with gsp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he did that kickboxer vengeance </v>

1901
01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:23.041
<v Speaker 3>movie and it was cool because he came in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and is like a never met george in my </v>

1902
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:26.320
<v Speaker 3>life at this point is like both illini.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fan of yours.</v>

1903
01:23:26.321 --> 01:23:29.260
<v Speaker 3>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched you fight Raymond Daniels.</v>

1904
01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1905
01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.660
<v Speaker 3>And so for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's like,</v>

1906
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:35.620
<v Speaker 3>he comes from a karate background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for him to say that he liked my style</v>

1907
01:23:35.621 --> 01:23:37.470
<v Speaker 3>and he was a fan of mine from my Raymond</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniels fire,</v>

1908
01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1909
01:23:38.051 --> 01:23:43.051
<v Speaker 3>this is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they brought Raymond Daniels in to </v>

1910
01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:43.051
<v Speaker 3>prepare Roy Mcdonald.</v>

1911
01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:46.650
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I think even gsp went to daniel's </v>

1912
01:23:47.141 --> 01:23:48.590
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>belvoir kickboxing.</v>

1913
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

1914
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

1915
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's another good thing too that </v>

1916
01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.171
<v Speaker 3>bella is holding those really high level</v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing bouts to Kevin Ross was over </v>

1917
01:23:58.171 --> 01:24:00.490
<v Speaker 3>there and he's been doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess who's now gonna fight.</v>

1918
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.640
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna fight him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I saw that I was actuallY talking to</v>

1919
01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:04.870
<v Speaker 3>their coach that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1920
01:24:04.871 --> 01:24:06.580
<v Speaker 3>we got to get gasoline and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1921
01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.710
<v Speaker 3>he'd be good in the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we get them on gloria,</v>

1922
01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:13.780
<v Speaker 3>I think he needs a good platform to </v>
<v Speaker 3>really grow and be consistent with it.</v>

1923
01:24:13.781 --> 01:24:18.781
<v Speaker 3>I think he'd be a perfect fit for glorY.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as far as like a coverage and is </v>

1924
01:24:18.781 --> 01:24:20.710
<v Speaker 3>falling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets that full time attention and who</v>

1925
01:24:20.711 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 3>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see how good he is in mma.</v>

1926
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Is he jUst a phenomenal striker trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to test himself in mma?</v>

1927
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:28.330
<v Speaker 3>How was this ground skills?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1928
01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 3>I know he can wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's a good wrestler,</v>

1929
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:34.060
<v Speaker 3>but like at a professional wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

1930
01:24:34.061 --> 01:24:39.061
<v Speaker 3>like ready to go kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to say because what I'm </v>

1931
01:24:39.061 --> 01:24:42.631
<v Speaker 3>hearing is from just guys who trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them and guys who trained mma with </v>

1932
01:24:42.631 --> 01:24:45.571
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're surprised at how good his </v>

1933
01:24:45.571 --> 01:24:47.491
<v Speaker 3>wrestling is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just a really strong athletic </v>

1934

1936
01:24:50.641 --> 01:24:53.230

<v Speaker 3>I see the spinning elbow telling guys in</v>

1937
01:24:53.231 --> 01:24:55.720
<v Speaker 3>line flight with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he'd be perfect for glory.</v>

1950
01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:29.710
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to be split between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1951
01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.700
<v Speaker 3>we got some good uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uhm,</v>

1952
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:37.710
<v Speaker 3>investors in glory from China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to actually try to get a </v>

1953
01:25:37.710 --> 01:25:38.140
<v Speaker 3>few shows out in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1954
01:25:38.141 --> 01:25:40.510
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at south America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1955
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.630
<v Speaker 3>and then the rest mixed between the us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and europe.</v>

1956
01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.010
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

1957
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Team shows and this is the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that glory is coming out and saying,</v>

1958
01:25:47.951 --> 01:25:52.951
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 18 shows in our december </v>

1959
01:25:52.951 --> 01:25:54.580
<v Speaker 3>collision show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to announce glory la.</v>

1960
01:25:54.581 --> 01:25:56.920
<v Speaker 3>We've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go to chicago next.</v>

1961
01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:00.160
<v Speaker 3>so we're having that time to show </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone that,</v>

1962
01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:02.380
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two or three shows coming up.</v>

1963
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Here's to prepare and plan</v>

1964
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.260
<v Speaker 2>because when you don't have that funding</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>

1965
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:11.261
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of hard to have those multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>events and have that time to build up </v>

1966
01:26:11.511 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 2>the shows properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now that we have.</v>

1967
01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:15.530
<v Speaker 2>And I think the sports just going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1968
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I hope so man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

1969
01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:22.931
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have more than one a </v>

1970
01:26:22.931 --> 01:26:22.931
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1971
01:26:22.931 --> 01:26:22.931
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:26:22.931 --> 01:26:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll need consistency one a month plus </v>

1973
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:26.760
<v Speaker 2>six more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1974
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.320
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1975
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:32.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every other month they're going to have </v>

1976
01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:32.530
<v Speaker 2>two events then that's what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

1977
01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:35.420
<v Speaker 2>That's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like as far as coverage,</v>

1978
01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I know you guys are on ufc fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also sometimes on espn,</v>

1979
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:44.210
<v Speaker 2>espn three and sometimes we get espn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live so it's all depending,</v>

1980
01:26:44.211 --> 01:26:49.211
<v Speaker 2>but I'm hoping we can get on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge step because we started </v>

1981
01:26:49.211 --> 01:26:49.211
<v Speaker 2>off on spike tv.</v>

1982
01:26:49.211 --> 01:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when,</v>

1983
01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.490
<v Speaker 2>which was great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was okay.</v>

1984
01:26:51.491 --> 01:26:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it was great for me.</v>

1985
01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I could watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then what was happening was when we </v>

1986
01:26:59.140 --> 01:26:59.680
<v Speaker 2>went to espn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a whole different market now.</v>

1987
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 2>If we want to hit those casual fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>espn is going to be the place to do it.</v>

1988
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1989
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the espn three,</v>

1990
01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:11.930
<v Speaker 2>those weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to get it when we're on live </v>

1991
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:12.770
<v Speaker 2>onto it seems to do well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just kinda keep it,</v>

1992
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.800
<v Speaker 2>keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what are they going to do with rico </v>

1993
01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 2>and butter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the rico verhoeven,</v>

1994
01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:21.420
<v Speaker 2>badr hari five was probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most most hyped up heavyweight fights of</v>

1995
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.090
<v Speaker 2>13,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1996
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Nuts wasn't really like when badr hari </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in the building,</v>

1997
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:30.240
<v Speaker 2>like people know he's a superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1998
01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't even have to fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a superstar and it was in a uber </v>

1999
01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:35.810
<v Speaker 2>house in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where borders,</v>

2000
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.260
<v Speaker 2>holland.</v>

2001
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:41.530
<v Speaker 2>So all the hall fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the dutch moroccans came and </v>

2002
01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:44.801
<v Speaker 2>when he came out crazy people were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going nuts trying to rush and get him.</v>

2003
01:27:45.441 --> 01:27:49.880
<v Speaker 2>He's a superstar sell to it needs fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and it's kinda like that conor</v>

2004
01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:54.881
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he builds that energy around him that </v>

2005
01:27:54.881 --> 01:27:55.970
<v Speaker 2>people just need to tune into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what bothered does.</v>

2006
01:27:55.971 --> 01:28:00.230
<v Speaker 2>So that rematch is going to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think rico was going to go fight.</v>

2007
01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:02.240
<v Speaker 2>He has some other fights that he has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2008
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 2>There's contender tournaments that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>

2009
01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:10.361
<v Speaker 2>He gets the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he has a fight with ishmael launch </v>

2010
01:28:10.361 --> 01:28:10.361
<v Speaker 2>planned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you watch collision,</v>

2011
01:28:10.361 --> 01:28:13.900
<v Speaker 2>there's ben jamal sadeek who was at big </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster heavyweight.</v>

2012
01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:19.150
<v Speaker 2>He's looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have guys like jafar wellness who </v>

2013
01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:19.700
<v Speaker 2>are doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin addict boy,</v>

2014
01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 2>so there's so many fights for ricoh and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think bob is going to be once he heals</v>

2015
01:28:24.021 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 2>up and then maybe they'll do another one</v>
<v Speaker 2>next year,</v>

2016
01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:27.320
<v Speaker 2>but nothing planned right now.</v>

2017
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.800
<v Speaker 2>You just got to be another fight has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2018
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:33.920
<v Speaker 2>But I mean how long does it take before </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be back in action?</v>

2019
01:28:33.921 --> 01:28:35.470
<v Speaker 2>He had a broken forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what happened?</v>

2020
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.260
<v Speaker 2>He tore a ligament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it was.</v>

2021
01:28:37.261 --> 01:28:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a torn ligament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

2022
01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.060
<v Speaker 2>And it's trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've re watched it a few times trying to</v>

2023
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:42.710
<v Speaker 2>see where in the fight had happened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2024
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 2>it's very tough to actually see where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2025
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:50.240
<v Speaker 2>but apparently he tore a ligament in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>form and it just wasn't working.</v>

2026
01:28:50.241 --> 01:28:55.241
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell he looked down on because </v>

2027
01:28:55.241 --> 01:28:56.860
<v Speaker 2>it didn't look like trying to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no real time where the damage </v>

2028
01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:57.470
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you seen him do it?</v>

2029
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>

2030
01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think it is somewhere must've torn</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he</v>

2031
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 3>just couldn't take the pain anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

2032
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:08.390
<v Speaker 3>I was so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was interesting because bought or</v>

2033
01:29:08.391 --> 01:29:12.300
<v Speaker 3>who's just a notorious psycho came out </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first round,</v>

2034
01:29:12.301 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 3>pretty controlled and measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:19.550
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and approach the fIght intelligently to </v>

2036
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560
<v Speaker 3>said no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do three rounds.</v>

2037
01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been fighting a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want a five round fight.</v>

2038
01:29:22.501 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I want a three round fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't care about the title.</v>

2039
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't for the world title.</v>

2040
01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I think what he wanted to do was have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this three rounder than let them meet </v>

2041
01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:36.831
<v Speaker 3>again for the five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it's a torn tendon or ligament </v>

2042
01:29:36.831 --> 01:29:39.450
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a much more invasive issue.</v>

2043
01:29:39.451 --> 01:29:44.451
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a long and I haven't really </v>

2044
01:29:44.451 --> 01:29:44.451
<v Speaker 3>gotten an update.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to find out for us.</v>

2045
01:29:44.451 --> 01:29:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Usually ligaments take a long time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>heal,</v>

2046
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 3>like the maybe even need surgery or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like already that the next fights </v>
<v Speaker 3>already hyped up even after the loss of </v>

2061
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:24.880
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2062
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.670
<v Speaker 3>this is what this sport needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get attention.</v>

2063
01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:29.970
<v Speaker 3>And I keep trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I came out publicly a little bit,</v>

2064
01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little while ago.</v>

2065
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Fighters need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the kickboxing world need to do more </v>

2066
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:40.611
<v Speaker 3>to promote themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't constantly rely on glory or </v>

2067
01:30:40.611 --> 01:30:44.121
<v Speaker 3>other people to kind of promote them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to go oUt there and really try </v>

2068
01:30:44.121 --> 01:30:44.670
<v Speaker 3>to build themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the more they build themselves,</v>

2069
01:30:44.671 --> 01:30:46.860
<v Speaker 3>the more the sport's going to build.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2070
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree.</v>

2071
01:30:48.691 --> 01:30:51.630
<v Speaker 3>It's just so hard For fighters to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to promote themselves.</v>

2072
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:56.631
<v Speaker 3>It's hard enough to be a great fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard enough to train hard and get </v>

2073
01:30:56.631 --> 01:30:57.640
<v Speaker 3>in shape and fight smart and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2074

<v Speaker 3>Concentrate on social media too and you </v>

<v Speaker 3>like fake trash talking and it just </v>

2077
01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:07.640
<v Speaker 3>comes out and clunky and terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's,</v>

2078
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:12.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always these guys lIke connor </v>

<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now you are a hundred percent </v>

2111
01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:19.250
<v Speaker 2>uM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I,</v>

2112
01:32:19.251 --> 01:32:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I want to try doing different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my body needs to be stretched out a</v>

2113
01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:24.760
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The years of damaGe on my joints.</v>

2114
01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to start doing more yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try some yoga out.</v>

2115
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2116
01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to create a kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional kickboxing program for </v>

2117
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:38.740
<v Speaker 2>other pros to come in and have daytIme </v>
<v Speaker 2>training and stuff like that.</v>

2118
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:44.430
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this whole fight was all about </v>

2119
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:47.520
<v Speaker 2>different and he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing pretty well in the ufc I </v>

2120
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:47.520
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't he?</v>

2121
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:47.740
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a tough guy.</v>

2122
01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:53.100
<v Speaker 2>That's such a gorgeous combination man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That left hook to the body and the low </v>

2123
01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:56.401
<v Speaker 2>kick that arnesto who's combinAtion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's another one of my all time </v>

2124
01:32:57.701 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's my.</v>

2125
01:32:58.481 --> 01:33:00.760
<v Speaker 2>He's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is so good.</v>

2126
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 2>There was one highlight that he has on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2127
01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I literally watChed probably a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

2128
01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Why is he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does he cheer and end?</v>

2129
01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Because he couldn't take the low kicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2130
01:33:11.781 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 2>So it was his way of hyping it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2131
01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:16.190
<v Speaker 2>You'll see the elbow soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one right here.</v>

2132
01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:18.170
<v Speaker 2>See that elbow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch what happened.</v>

2133
01:33:18.171 --> 01:33:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gash right away.</v>

2134
01:33:20.151 --> 01:33:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so slice it.</v>

2135
01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.520
<v Speaker 2>That's all you really through was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>down downward elbow.</v>

2136
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a fucking gas.</v>

2137
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only hit me with that shot.</v>

2138
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.710
<v Speaker 2>And that was in the fourth round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2139
01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:39.410
<v Speaker 2>And we worried about the fight getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped here and I probably should have </v>

2140
01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.480
<v Speaker 2>stopped it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really a that.</v>

2141
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.000
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2142
01:33:41.001 --> 01:33:46.001
<v Speaker 2>And as a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to say stop the </v>

2143
01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:46.001
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2144
01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:47.030
<v Speaker 2>But probably looking back and then right</v>
<v Speaker 2>away I just come back and say,</v>

2145
01:33:47.031 --> 01:33:48.350
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you that leg.</v>

2146
01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:51.080
<v Speaker 2>was the blood going into your eyes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point?</v>

2147
01:33:51.081 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it.</v>

2148
01:33:52.121 --> 01:33:56.540
<v Speaker 2>And this was in three d apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they filmed it and literally.</v>

2149
01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

2150
01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:00.020
<v Speaker 2>So I would have loved to have seen it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gash.</v>

2151
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 2>That's not even the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big ones in my head that you can't even </v>

2152
01:34:05.290 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 2>see on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2153
01:34:05.290 --> 01:34:05.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just right through the hairline</v>

2154
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.440
<v Speaker 2>that it's such a nasty combination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2155
01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he basically hit me with two elbows,</v>

2156
01:34:12.741 --> 01:34:14.180
<v Speaker 2>the whole fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2157
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Two gases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time he did well you can't even </v>

2158
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.510
<v Speaker 2>see the scar man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a good plastic surgeon.</v>

2159
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:23.030
<v Speaker 2>The back stage doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his face.</v>

2160
01:34:23.031 --> 01:34:24.820
<v Speaker 2>When he started cUtting my starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stitch,</v>

2161
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:26.750
<v Speaker 2>it was like I was making all these faces</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2162
01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:31.780
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know that a doctor was </v>

2163
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:31.780
<v Speaker 2>making a face like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of fucking dog?</v>

2164
01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:35.030
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy man.</v>

2165
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So do you have any desire to compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

2166
01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

2167
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:43.070
<v Speaker 2>have you figured your path out from here</v>
<v Speaker 2>on out?</v>

2168
01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Gloria has been too good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2169
01:34:44.391 --> 01:34:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I've been loving this commentary gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new challenge.</v>

2170
01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.330
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's new.</v>

2171
01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a for this the first time,</v>

2172
01:34:51.711 --> 01:34:55.520
<v Speaker 2>even when I won my world title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work during the day as a teacher,</v>

2173
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:59.120
<v Speaker 2>eat my lunch as I drove the gym and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would train at night.</v>

2174
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I won a world title working a fUlltime </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

2175
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it just,</v>

2176
01:35:02.841 --> 01:35:05.400
<v Speaker 2>at that point there wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2177
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2178
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to a certain type of living and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to fight to </v>

2179
01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:15.641
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my whole thing was I'm going to use </v>

2180
01:35:15.641 --> 01:35:15.710
<v Speaker 2>fighting to build it as a platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you know,</v>

2181
01:35:15.711 --> 01:35:20.000
<v Speaker 2>because I have a university education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to have a commentary job,</v>

2182
01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to run my own gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to have other things going on.</v>

2183
01:35:23.901 --> 01:35:28.901
<v Speaker 2>So I was very lucky to build a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform that I didn't have to rely on </v>

2184
01:35:28.901 --> 01:35:32.000
<v Speaker 2>fighting for my income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now things are too good,</v>

2185
01:35:32.001 --> 01:35:35.390
<v Speaker 2>there's more money on the sitting in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>suit and you know,</v>

2186
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:39.290
<v Speaker 2>trying to be joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's more money,</v>

2187
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:43.540
<v Speaker 2>it's better on my health and so enjoying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and loving it,</v>

2188
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:44.990
<v Speaker 2>genuinely loving it.</v>

2189
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.200
<v Speaker 2>What was your education in health and </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical education?</v>

2190
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:53.590
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at a training methods </v>

2191
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:55.280
<v Speaker 2>like some of the methods that are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>employed today,</v>

2192
01:35:55.281 --> 01:35:57.350
<v Speaker 2>some of the varIous strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning methods,</v>

2193
01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.840
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2194
01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 2>is there anything that you think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really stands out?</v>

2195
01:36:02.210 --> 01:36:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main thing for me is guys in combat </v>

2196
01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:09.470
<v Speaker 2>sports are using crossfit as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight training for fighting.</v>

2197
01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily agree with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on many tHings because they're </v>

2198
01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.600
<v Speaker 2>doing an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unsafe exercise like a dead lift or a</v>

2199
01:36:17.601 --> 01:36:22.601
<v Speaker 2>clean and you're doing it over time </v>
<v Speaker 2>where those movements are made to </v>

2200
01:36:22.601 --> 01:36:23.600
<v Speaker 2>develop power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip strength,</v>

2201
01:36:23.601 --> 01:36:26.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not meant for endurance.</v>

2202
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of guys are hurting themselves.</v>

2203
01:36:29.721 --> 01:36:34.721
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw some crossfit guys and they're </v>

2204
01:36:34.721 --> 01:36:37.370
<v Speaker 2>doing this terrible rounded back dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifts and they're just trying to get the</v>

2205
01:36:37.371 --> 01:36:39.290
<v Speaker 2>bar up and wait and they're hurting </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2206
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:41.060
<v Speaker 2>They're doing too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2207
01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:42.920
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports specific,</v>

2208
01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:46.220
<v Speaker 2>properly tailored strength program is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important,</v>

2209
01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but crossfitting is just killing guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>their body.</v>

2210
01:36:49.251 --> 01:36:53.630
<v Speaker 2>The damage on the joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't made to be help you enhance.</v>

2211
01:36:53.631 --> 01:36:56.960
<v Speaker 2>There's different ways to do it in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>safer way that helps protect your body.</v>

2212
01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Too many people are canceling flights </v>
<v Speaker 2>with injuries.</v>

2213
01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they overtrain they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that,</v>

2214
01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like crossfit where they're </v>

2215
01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.511
<v Speaker 2>constantly killing their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because some people </v>

2216
01:37:10.511 --> 01:37:10.511
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2217
01:37:10.511 --> 01:37:12.670
<v Speaker 2>fighters or overtraining and some people</v>
<v Speaker 2>think no,</v>

2218
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:17.680
<v Speaker 2>the problem is they just haven't built </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves up to the point where they </v>

2219
01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.130
<v Speaker 2>can do this the way they move or </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

2220
01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Then you thInk it's overture </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtraining now.</v>

2221
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:24.260
<v Speaker 2>When you were fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you do?</v>

2222
01:37:24.261 --> 01:37:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Any kind of strength and conditioning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was huge on.</v>

2223
01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:27.800
<v Speaker 2>It was very big on it.</v>

2224
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I was very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

2225
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:30.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very complex.</v>

2226
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:33.160
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in in,</v>

2227
01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.180
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a short term,</v>

2228
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:38.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a periodization,</v>

2229
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:43.780
<v Speaker 2>so right after my fight I would go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hypertrophy phase where I tried to </v>

2230
01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:46.100
<v Speaker 2>build myself because during your camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're losing weight,</v>

2231
01:37:46.101 --> 01:37:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to break down muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're constantly training,</v>

2232
01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:53.681
<v Speaker 2>you're not eating as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would go through a hypertrophy </v>

2233
01:37:53.681 --> 01:37:56.621
<v Speaker 2>phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is building get biggest strong as </v>

2234
01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:56.621
<v Speaker 2>I possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>closer to fight time.</v>

2235
01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I build that muscle into more explosive </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

2236
01:38:00.601 --> 01:38:04.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's when I start doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of high volume reps,</v>

2237
01:38:04.081 --> 01:38:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to kind of lower my rep </v>
<v Speaker 2>count.</v>

2238
01:38:05.981 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll do five sets of five on squat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2239
01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll do dead lifts to five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's now translating that muscle and</v>

2240
01:38:12.871 --> 01:38:15.090
<v Speaker 2>that size into power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From there,</v>

2241
01:38:15.091 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 2>you got to get the power phase turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>into more of an explosive phase.</v>

2242
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.480
<v Speaker 2>So I start turning that power into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive.</v>

2243
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>So I'll start doing med ball throws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive jumping,</v>

2244
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2245
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll box squat instead of a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>squat.</v>

2246
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.320
<v Speaker 2>And even when your in that hypertrophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>phase and when you're building muscle,</v>

2247
01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.900
<v Speaker 2>the whole point is to break your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>down so you're sore.</v>

2248
01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows how sore and how shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel.</v>

2249
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four to 48 hours after a workout </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's good because your body's </v>

2250
01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.830
<v Speaker 2>breaking down and has to get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you have,</v>

2251
01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.980
<v Speaker 2>when your goal is to fight and be good </v>
<v Speaker 2>at your sport,</v>

2252
01:38:50.370 --> 01:38:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you can have that soreness because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take away from your training.</v>

2253
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:58.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's why we really have to period </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes our training to make sure we can </v>

2254
01:38:58.790 --> 01:39:02.511
<v Speaker 2>peek on fight night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of talk in an amazing </v>

2255
01:39:02.511 --> 01:39:06.861
<v Speaker 2>circles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That strength and conditioning is the </v>

2256
01:39:06.861 --> 01:39:06.861
<v Speaker 2>most important thing that once you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

2257
01:39:06.861 --> 01:39:07.680
<v Speaker 2>that's what you should concentrate on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is your cardio,</v>

2258
01:39:07.681 --> 01:39:10.770
<v Speaker 2>your endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that your fight skills actually come</v>

2259
01:39:10.771 --> 01:39:12.900
<v Speaker 2>in secondary because you already know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to fight.</v>

2260
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:18.230
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you need to do is work on your </v>

2261
01:39:18.230 --> 01:39:20.760
<v Speaker 2>fight skills and all the other time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that you abandoned them,</v>

2262
01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:25.970
<v Speaker 2>but that they take second place and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing is having a </v>

2263
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.970
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal gas tank.</v>

2264
01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know aboUt that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fighting,</v>

2265
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.700
<v Speaker 2>you have to constantly are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to fight.</v>

2266
01:39:32.701 --> 01:39:34.860
<v Speaker 2>You have to practice what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they'll.</v>

2267
01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I think the most important is your mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mind.</v>

2268
01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.820
<v Speaker 2>The mind is number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you.</v>

2269
01:39:39.150 --> 01:39:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Did you involve yourself in any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental training?</v>

2270
01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

2271
01:39:42.591 --> 01:39:47.591
<v Speaker 2>I was naturally gifted with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was naturally had the ability to be </v>

2272
01:39:47.591 --> 01:39:51.891
<v Speaker 2>able to block things out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have been my years of sports </v>

2273
01:39:51.891 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but men come fight time.</v>

2274
01:39:52.411 --> 01:39:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I barely even thought of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

2275
01:39:54.661 --> 01:39:54.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2276
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.620
<v Speaker 2>you're going to Japan next week to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>two fights in one night.</v>

2277
01:39:57.621 --> 01:39:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2278
01:39:58.051 --> 01:40:03.051
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll deal with it when I have to get </v>

2279
01:40:03.051 --> 01:40:03.051
<v Speaker 2>there kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put my work in.</v>

2280
01:40:03.051 --> 01:40:05.670
<v Speaker 2>The more you stress about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you released the cortisone,</v>

2281
01:40:05.671 --> 01:40:08.670
<v Speaker 2>more that your body breaks itself down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more stressed you get,</v>

2282
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:10.500
<v Speaker 2>the less sleep you are going to have.</v>

2283
01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:13.320
<v Speaker 2>All terrible shit when you're fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a few days.</v>

2284
01:40:13.321 --> 01:40:18.321
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my whole strategy was just to say I </v>

2285
01:40:18.321 --> 01:40:22.011
<v Speaker 2>do my work and the problem with you said</v>
<v Speaker 2>about overtraining and guys fight.</v>

2286
01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Then they party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat like shit.</v>

2287
01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:28.800
<v Speaker 2>They constantly don't focus on fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the k you're fighting in eight weeks.</v>

2288
01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

2289
01:40:29.971 --> 01:40:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I got to do a crash course and get up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

2290
01:40:31.981 --> 01:40:35.760
<v Speaker 2>And then they overtake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A true martial artist is it doesn't look</v>

2291
01:40:35.761 --> 01:40:39.030
<v Speaker 2>at the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a flight basis.</v>

2292
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.940
<v Speaker 2>It looks as a longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at,</v>

2293
01:40:41.941 --> 01:40:43.380
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this fight,</v>

2294
01:40:43.381 --> 01:40:45.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boxing might improve a little bit,</v>

2295
01:40:45.211 --> 01:40:50.211
<v Speaker 2>but I have to improve something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's constantly improvements in </v>

2296
01:40:50.211 --> 01:40:50.970
<v Speaker 2>all areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yukon,</v>

2297
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:52.500
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you're done your fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>YeAh,</v>

2298
01:40:52.501 --> 01:40:57.501
<v Speaker 2>it's healthy to take a week or two off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys three weeks depending on the </v>

2299
01:40:57.501 --> 01:40:58.600
<v Speaker 2>damage you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to get working again.</v>

2300
01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:00.850
<v Speaker 2>You got to get back to sharpening your </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

2301
01:41:00.851 --> 01:41:02.530
<v Speaker 2>your weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

2302
01:41:02.531 --> 01:41:04.990
<v Speaker 2>You got to get back into it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly trying to.</v>

2303
01:41:04.991 --> 01:41:09.991
<v Speaker 2>You got to learn 24 slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with guys who think they </v>

2304
01:41:09.991 --> 01:41:12.980
<v Speaker 2>can just train for camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Camps on a real fighter,</v>

2305
01:41:12.981 --> 01:41:17.981
<v Speaker 2>a real athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real martial artist is going to train </v>

2306
01:41:17.981 --> 01:41:20.700
<v Speaker 2>all year round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to look at it also in terms of </v>

2307
01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:25.050
<v Speaker 2>you're involved in one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous pursuits athletically than </v>

2308
01:41:25.050 --> 01:41:29.101
<v Speaker 2>someone can engage in and anytime that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting better is going to take </v>

2309
01:41:29.101 --> 01:41:32.500
<v Speaker 2>away some damage that you could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain.</v>

2310
01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make you better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>aDministering damage.</v>

2311
01:41:35.141 --> 01:41:37.630
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make you better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of staying the course</v>

2312
01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:42.610
<v Speaker 2>anD being disciplined to work it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean intensity changes.</v>

2313
01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be right after your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2314
01:41:44.411 --> 01:41:46.930
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to bE training at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart intensity that you are,</v>

2315
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:52.390
<v Speaker 2>that you were before the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still important to constantly </v>

2316
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.390
<v Speaker 2>training and constantly improve.</v>

2317
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Now when you say that you were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally good at it,</v>

2318
01:41:54.911 --> 01:41:59.911
<v Speaker 2>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one coached you into how to relax </v>

2319
01:41:59.911 --> 01:42:00.820
<v Speaker 2>about you just kind of instinctively </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew that work.</v>

2320
01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had to do it.</v>

2321
01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:09.091
<v Speaker 2>Like for me especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't fighting guys with my level of </v>

2322
01:42:09.091 --> 01:42:09.670
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're like,</v>

2323
01:42:09.671 --> 01:42:11.830
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first fight with glory,</v>

2324
01:42:11.831 --> 01:42:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I fought a legend in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morat derechos and they will.</v>

2325
01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Glory signed me right after that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We watched with many baghdad.</v>

2326
01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I got an email from a random guy at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>point and now friends with them,</v>

2327
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:24.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2328
01:42:24.041 --> 01:42:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I can get you find some bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody can get me fights,</v>

2329
01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:28.300
<v Speaker 2>and then I sent them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2330
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:29.980
<v Speaker 2>here's my manager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go off,</v>

2331
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.000
<v Speaker 2>and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2332
01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:32.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to sign you to glory.</v>

2333
01:42:32.891 --> 01:42:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Just like a few hours before that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>bag,</v>

2334
01:42:34.871 --> 01:42:35.320
<v Speaker 2>that fight.</v>

2335
01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2336
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.210
<v Speaker 2>wicked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this was what I wanted.</v>

2337
01:42:37.211 --> 01:42:38.620
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dreAms here.</v>

2338
01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:39.460
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2339
01:42:39.461 --> 01:42:42.070
<v Speaker 2>your first fight is against morat </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly and Turkey.</v>

2340
01:42:42.110 --> 01:42:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2341
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I never really the same morat direct you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think it is.</v>

2342
01:42:46.571 --> 01:42:48.310
<v Speaker 2>So I looked it up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same guy.</v>

2343
01:42:48.311 --> 01:42:53.311
<v Speaker 2>He had like 90 flights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my seventh in his hometown,</v>

2344
01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:59.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to press conferences with </v>

2345
01:42:59.300 --> 01:42:59.300
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can saki,</v>

2346
01:42:59.300 --> 01:42:59.300
<v Speaker 2>daniel guida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sitting there and I'm like,</v>

2347
01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:04.291
<v Speaker 2>I have six professional fights and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the turkish cameras are all around us </v>

2348
01:43:04.291 --> 01:43:07.630
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was confident in myself.</v>

2349
01:43:07.631 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I believed in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I had the skill to do it.</v>

2350
01:43:11.201 --> 01:43:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I looked at my coach and we can I beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy and yeah,</v>

2351
01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.450
<v Speaker 2>you'll kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>

2352
01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.310
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>

2353
01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:20.730
<v Speaker 2>And then at that point I just had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much confidence and belief in myself </v>

2354
01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:22.300
<v Speaker 2>that nothing mattered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you,</v>

2355
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:27.360
<v Speaker 2>when you go into a fight like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you approach a fight like that and </v>

2356
01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.120
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that these guys had so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more experience than you,</v>

2357
01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:33.130
<v Speaker 2>so you had to almost approach the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a more experienced fighter.</v>

2358
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did you.</v>

2359
01:43:35.230 --> 01:43:39.370
<v Speaker 2>My whole thing was I knew what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at and I couldn't.</v>

2360
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.400
<v Speaker 2>With someone with a hundred fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so comfortable in there and if I </v>

2361
01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:44.800
<v Speaker 2>play that relaxed fighting game with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2362
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:49.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are better at picking their shots </v>

2363
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.830
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd still probably beat that.</v>

2364
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before the fight I'm go,</v>

2365
01:43:52.690 --> 01:43:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make them fight my fight.</v>

2366
01:43:54.591 --> 01:43:59.591
<v Speaker 2>If I fight their fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a good chance they're going to </v>

2367
01:43:59.591 --> 01:43:59.591
<v Speaker 2>beat me.</v>

2368
01:43:59.591 --> 01:44:01.520
<v Speaker 2>So I went in and basically you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight this fight in order to beat me.</v>

2369
01:44:01.521 --> 01:44:06.521
<v Speaker 2>And this was my strength that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger than most of the guys that </v>

2370
01:44:06.521 --> 01:44:06.590
<v Speaker 2>fought because that's a good strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>and conditioning program.</v>

2371
01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2372
01:44:07.410 --> 01:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>actually who's outside cost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the client analyst,</v>

2373
01:44:09.471 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 2>he was a strength and conditioning coach</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the toronto maple leafs in Canada.</v>

2374
01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:15.680
<v Speaker 2>So he knew a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was amazing.</v>

2375
01:44:15.681 --> 01:44:19.040
<v Speaker 2>So I was the strongest guy that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2376
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anyone who's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger than me in the ring.</v>

2377
01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 2>So I went in there and I fought my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2378
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Good coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paul minaz,</v>

2379
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:28.340
<v Speaker 2>good coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything was just on point for me.</v>

2380
01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you do any visualization?</v>

2381
01:44:30.771 --> 01:44:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Did you do any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of meditation?</v>

2382
01:44:32.631 --> 01:44:37.631
<v Speaker 2>Truly nothing planned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd just be driving my car and I'm </v>

2383
01:44:37.631 --> 01:44:41.051
<v Speaker 2>thinking about how it feels to win and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how I'm going to win and it just </v>

2384
01:44:41.051 --> 01:44:43.670
<v Speaker 2>happened naturally and then I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocked it off where I didn't even think</v>

2385
01:44:43.671 --> 01:44:44.030
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2386
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:49.030
<v Speaker 2>The last thing you want to do is go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your bed at night and think about a </v>

2387
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.030
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible,</v>

2388
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.490
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2389
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:50.960
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I get knocked out?</v>

2390
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's watching me who's watching </v>

2391
01:44:56.050 --> 01:44:56.050
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2392
01:44:56.050 --> 01:44:59.060
<v Speaker 2>it gets scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got to learn to be able to block </v>

2393
01:44:59.060 --> 01:44:59.540
<v Speaker 2>it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where my teaching job</v>

2394
01:44:59.541 --> 01:45:02.180
<v Speaker 2>helped a little bit because when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my teaching job,</v>

2395
01:45:02.181 --> 01:45:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't think of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2396
01:45:04.021 --> 01:45:05.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll deal with it after.</v>

2397
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Because it's fighting is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>

2398
01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:13.301
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys can handle it and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys you see on pads that are </v>

2399
01:45:13.301 --> 01:45:14.270
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys could whip pads,</v>

2400
01:45:14.271 --> 01:45:19.271
<v Speaker 2>kicks punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most beautiful display of </v>

2401
01:45:19.271 --> 01:45:19.271
<v Speaker 2>technique on pads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put them in the ring,</v>

2402
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:21.200
<v Speaker 2>they just don't have it mentally.</v>

2403
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Too much anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much stress.</v>

2404
01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:28.540
<v Speaker 2>They just can't handle that pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one of the biggest parts is </v>

2405
01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:29.990
<v Speaker 2>having that confidence in yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mindset.</v>

2406
01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go back to a war we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about with strength and </v>

2407
01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.931
<v Speaker 2>conditioning or like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a philosophy that many are </v>

2408
01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:41.771
<v Speaker 2>taking an mma that the strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning is more important during </v>

2409
01:45:41.771 --> 01:45:42.230
<v Speaker 2>fight camp than actual fight training </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

2410
01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:47.620
<v Speaker 2>This is about mma though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that maybe the physical </v>

2411
01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:50.201
<v Speaker 2>requirements of fighting five minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds and you know a lot of the </v>

2412
01:45:50.201 --> 01:45:53.501
<v Speaker 2>grappling and clenching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just unbelievably grueling on </v>

2413
01:45:53.501 --> 01:45:56.411
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that's that there's </v>

2414
01:45:56.411 --> 01:45:56.720
<v Speaker 2>different physical requirements and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport mayBe then kickboxing?</v>

2415
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2416
01:45:58.610 --> 01:46:01.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need that different.</v>

2417
01:46:01.251 --> 01:46:04.250
<v Speaker 2>If I were to to roll one minute in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu,</v>

2418
01:46:04.251 --> 01:46:09.251
<v Speaker 2>I probably be gassed out like I wrestled</v>
<v Speaker 2>around sometimes just as a joke and and </v>

2419
01:46:09.251 --> 01:46:09.290
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2420
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father of my niece,</v>

2421
01:46:10.551 --> 01:46:14.050
<v Speaker 2>nephew is one of the pioneers in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a brazilian jujitsu,</v>

2422
01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>richard,</v>

2423
01:46:15.051 --> 01:46:20.051
<v Speaker 2>monkey nana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just been around it my whole </v>

2424
01:46:20.051 --> 01:46:20.570
<v Speaker 2>life and my role for one minute I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>gassed,</v>

2425
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it,</v>

2426
01:46:21.921 --> 01:46:24.350
<v Speaker 2>but if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they kick box with me for one minute,</v>

2427
01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:26.210
<v Speaker 2>they can't handle it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2428
01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:31.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's just what you prepare for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're that marathon runner and you </v>

2429
01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:34.211
<v Speaker 2>try to swim five lanes in the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done totally different energy </v>

2430
01:46:34.211 --> 01:46:38.291
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have to say mma is different </v>

2431
01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:42.791
<v Speaker 2>demands on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different demand on the </v>

2432
01:46:42.791 --> 01:46:46.331
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to be able to wrestle and then </v>

2433
01:46:46.331 --> 01:46:48.500
<v Speaker 2>stand up and be explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really difficult to do.</v>

2434
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you</v>

2435
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:54.750
<v Speaker 1>foresee yourself getting involved Any </v>
<v Speaker 1>more deeply and mma fighters?</v>

2436
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just waiting for a guy.</v>

2437
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that guy that's going to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out there.</v>

2438
01:46:59.491 --> 01:47:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And thiS is george st pierre obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2439
01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping to one day obviously have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>build,</v>

2440
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:07.590
<v Speaker 1>a good group of guys who were fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ufc.</v>

2441
01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:09.920
<v Speaker 1>So what would love to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

2442
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:14.950
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate goal is to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>impart your knowledge on some webinars </v>

2443
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:17.310
<v Speaker 1>coming up for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially at the gym now.</v>

2444
01:47:17.311 --> 01:47:22.311
<v Speaker 1>I've been loving it and loving it and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed a lot of those ufc guys now or </v>

2445
01:47:22.311 --> 01:47:26.090
<v Speaker 1>hopefully seeing all these videos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these drills that I'm posting and what </v>

2446
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:27.440
<v Speaker 1>it can have to offer and if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many times I watched the ufc,</v>

2447
01:47:27.490 --> 01:47:32.490
<v Speaker 1>like if this guy had a little bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know me coaching him and I'm sure </v>

2448
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:36.081
<v Speaker 1>they have great coaches but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just need that little extra.</v>

2449
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also such a cool time for </v>

2450
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:44.841
<v Speaker 1>fighters to be able to hear these words </v>
<v Speaker 1>from guys like you and to be able to </v>

2451
01:47:44.841 --> 01:47:48.620
<v Speaker 1>easily access those videos that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting up and all these striking </v>

2452
01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.401
<v Speaker 1>breakdowns that guys like lawrence </v>
<v Speaker 1>kenshin are putting up and all these </v>

2453
01:47:52.401 --> 01:47:55.071
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an amazing time and as far </v>

2454
01:47:55.071 --> 01:47:57.960
<v Speaker 1>as like the amount of information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get for fighters and people have</v>

2455
01:47:57.961 --> 01:47:59.000
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:00.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's a lot of pride too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2457
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:02.250
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough sometimes,</v>

2458
01:48:02.251 --> 01:48:07.251
<v Speaker 1>like even with a lot of the fighters </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I approached and I give tips to </v>

2459
01:48:07.251 --> 01:48:08.340
<v Speaker 1>when you're at a higher level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you know everything.</v>

2460
01:48:08.341 --> 01:48:12.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>george was very humble that way where he</v>

2461
01:48:12.331 --> 01:48:15.810
<v Speaker 1>can kind of allow and accept knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's important.</v>

2462
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:18.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're just,</v>

2463
01:48:18.001 --> 01:48:20.190
<v Speaker 1>they know and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's terrible mindset.</v>

2464
01:48:20.490 --> 01:48:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's no way like </v>

2465
01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:28.530
<v Speaker 1>what you were saying about if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a very good mma fighter,</v>

2466
01:48:28.531 --> 01:48:30.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you're going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best at everything.</v>

2467
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you got a guy like george,</v>

2468
01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:35.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2469
01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:40.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the beautiful things about him </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he was aware of where his </v>

2470
01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.000
<v Speaker 1>limitations lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was aware of where his strengths were</v>

2471
01:48:42.001 --> 01:48:44.190
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew how to put it all together.</v>

2472
01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I always talk about fighting as if like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a language because I think that,</v>

2473
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:51.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people know how to use words.</v>

2474
01:48:51.541 --> 01:48:56.541
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people know what the words are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you string them together </v>

2475
01:48:56.541 --> 01:48:59.271
<v Speaker 1>eloquently and that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I see like when I'm watching that </v>

2476
01:48:59.271 --> 01:49:02.751
<v Speaker 1>fight with many baghdad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you throw in that combination left </v>

2477
01:49:02.751 --> 01:49:06.141
<v Speaker 1>hook to the body low kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a beautiful flowing </v>

2478
01:49:06.141 --> 01:49:06.750
<v Speaker 1>sentence and a lot of ways you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing yourself in that.</v>

2479
01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 1>A good way of putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was talking to someone,</v>

2480
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it was matt embry today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did fight or interviews before I came,</v>

2481
01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:16.830
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of their things they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying are fresh in my mind,</v>

2482
01:49:16.831 --> 01:49:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but he was saying it's like it's human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

2483
01:49:19.561 --> 01:49:24.561
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows what fighting is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can really watch two guys and now </v>

2484
01:49:24.561 --> 01:49:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you can say who's winning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did more damage.</v>

2485
01:49:26.611 --> 01:49:29.700
<v Speaker 1>You can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like looking at the words on the</v>

2486
01:49:29.701 --> 01:49:31.740
<v Speaker 1>page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you know how to read,</v>

2487
01:49:31.741 --> 01:49:35.160
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a totally different game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just words on a page anymore.</v>

2488
01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good way of putting it.</v>

2489
01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

2490
01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

2491
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Fighting is like nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2492
01:49:44.491 --> 01:49:49.150
<v Speaker 1>it's so heartbreaking when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone get devastated and smash like bj</v>

2493
01:49:49.151 --> 01:49:52.390
<v Speaker 1>penn did against the air rodriguez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

2494
01:49:52.391 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 1>so beautiful when you see what your year</v>
<v Speaker 1>was able to do to a legend like bj penn.</v>

2495
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fighting and all forms,</v>

2496
01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:01.690
<v Speaker 1>whether it's boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like thai kickboxing,</v>

2497
01:50:01.691 --> 01:50:06.691
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to me one of the most engaging </v>

2498
01:50:06.691 --> 01:50:11.491
<v Speaker 1>things for someone to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you want to fight in the ufc if </v>

2499
01:50:11.491 --> 01:50:11.491
<v Speaker 1>you could?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2500
01:50:11.491 --> 01:50:12.290
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2501
01:50:12.291 --> 01:50:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm oldest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2502
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.360
<v Speaker 1>But in your prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was competing still when the ufc </v>

2503
01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.920
<v Speaker 1>was around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would've done something.</v>

2504
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:25.921
<v Speaker 1>But also when the ufc first came around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like one weight class and you </v>

2505
01:50:25.921 --> 01:50:28.420
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I stopped fighting was in 1989.</v>

2506
01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 1>That was the last kickboxing fight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had and that was um,</v>

2507
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing and there was no money</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it and I was getting headaches too,</v>

2508
01:50:35.801 --> 01:50:38.320
<v Speaker 1>just from sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did not spar smart.</v>

2509
01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I sparred meathead style and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2510
01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot more today than I ever did </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as far as consequences.</v>

2511
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And what's important and how to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

2512
01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is how knowing how to be.</v>

2513
01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I was good at being obsessed with things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really like just just focusing on </v>

2514
01:50:56.111 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 1>them constantly all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was more frantic and frenetic.</v>

2515
01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like calculated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

2516
01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:07.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like crashing in and learn and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>being obsessed is constantly training </v>

2517
01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.230
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the day.</v>

2518
01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.360
<v Speaker 1>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2519
01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:15.420
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we're knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're learning now is the right way to </v>

2520
01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:20.281
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you were saying that so many </v>

2521
01:51:20.281 --> 01:51:20.281
<v Speaker 1>fighters are overtrained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2522
01:51:20.281 --> 01:51:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so many fighters to spar too hard </v>

2523
01:51:24.090 --> 01:51:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2524
01:51:24.090 --> 01:51:27.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot of like what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that hitting the pads and </v>

2525
01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:30.841
<v Speaker 1>getting tired as good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough though because when you have </v>

2526
01:51:30.841 --> 01:51:32.590
<v Speaker 1>a fighter's mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think it's easy to be outside.</v>

2527
01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:34.180
<v Speaker 1>And I could say it because I've been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2528
01:51:34.181 --> 01:51:35.950
<v Speaker 1>but when someone on the outside says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2529
01:51:35.951 --> 01:51:37.160
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2530
01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:42.180
<v Speaker 1>they need to train harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to keep doing more and more </v>

2531
01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:42.180
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you fight and you're like,</v>

2532
01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:43.300
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of fight in three weeks.</v>

2533
01:51:43.301 --> 01:51:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you never think your conditioning is </v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough.</v>

2534
01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 1>You could train everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>

2535
01:51:47.561 --> 01:51:52.561
<v Speaker 1>put your best effort and you never going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think you're conditioning is good </v>

2536
01:51:52.561 --> 01:51:55.621
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be like the day before </v>

2537
01:51:55.621 --> 01:51:57.721
<v Speaker 1>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done everything possible in your </v>

2538
01:51:57.721 --> 01:51:59.551
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go on and you're going </v>

2539
01:51:59.551 --> 01:52:01.051
<v Speaker 1>to second guess your conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wonder if you did it </v>

2540
01:52:01.051 --> 01:52:01.051
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wonder,</v>

2541
01:52:01.051 --> 01:52:01.270
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have trained now.</v>

2542
01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sunday rest?</v>

2543
01:52:02.951 --> 01:52:04.780
<v Speaker 1>That should have been training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be getting better.</v>

2544
01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:08.320
<v Speaker 1>But really you have to get in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mindset that you know,</v>

2545
01:52:08.410 --> 01:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't need More All the time.</v>

2546
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's why guys are getting injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're putting their bodies,</v>

2547
01:52:13.001 --> 01:52:15.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not letting themselves rest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting sick.</v>

2548
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I bet you if you go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2549
01:52:16.681 --> 01:52:18.160
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of your ufc shows,</v>

2550
01:52:18.161 --> 01:52:21.340
<v Speaker 1>and you ask every fighter on that card </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's sick,</v>

2551
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I bet you 50 percent would be sick with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of cold or infection or a </v>

2552
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:31.371
<v Speaker 1>sinus infection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of those guys are probably sick </v>

2553
01:52:31.371 --> 01:52:33.400
<v Speaker 1>because their immune system is crashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from not eating constantly.</v>

2554
01:52:33.401 --> 01:52:38.401
<v Speaker 1>Training stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sleeping like I bet you more than </v>

2555
01:52:38.401 --> 01:52:39.910
<v Speaker 1>half are sick with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2556
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always sick before taekwondo </v>

2557
01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:44.970
<v Speaker 1>tournaments and sinuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

2558
01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>every fight I had a sinus infection</v>

2559
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.550
<v Speaker 2>and I was even smart about my training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still got sinus infections.</v>

2560
01:52:49.551 --> 01:52:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Did you monitor your heart rate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>

2561
01:52:52.130 --> 01:52:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Did you wake up in the morning and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>never really did that?</v>

2562
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:59.890
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that steve </v>
<v Speaker 2>maxwell told me he said was very </v>

2563
01:52:59.890 --> 01:52:59.890
<v Speaker 2>important to find out where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2564
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:05.050
<v Speaker 2>when you're in shape goes find out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>your resting heart rate is measured in </v>

2565
01:53:05.050 --> 01:53:06.680
<v Speaker 2>the morning and if you wake up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning and it's five to 10 beats over,</v>

2566
01:53:06.681 --> 01:53:11.681
<v Speaker 2>what it normally is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the day off is if your body's </v>

2567
01:53:11.681 --> 01:53:14.500
<v Speaker 2>fighting something off and you probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't even think that you just got to </v>

2568
01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.950
<v Speaker 2>push through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you push through in those exit </v>

2569
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.950
<v Speaker 2>where that's when you break yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2570
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:21.230
<v Speaker 2>It's that balance between being </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and being tough,</v>

2571
01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:26.260
<v Speaker 2>being disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also being like calculated and </v>

2572
01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:27.230
<v Speaker 2>that's where I think your team is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

2573
01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:29.270
<v Speaker 2>You have to have someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2574
01:53:29.271 --> 01:53:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I had it in my camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at for,</v>

2575
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:33.610
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tristar will use that as an example.</v>

2576
01:53:33.611 --> 01:53:37.220
<v Speaker 2>He monitors everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he probably looks at george and says,</v>

2577
01:53:37.221 --> 01:53:37.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>george,</v>

2578
01:53:37.641 --> 01:53:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you're a little off today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like from the way george comes in,</v>

2579
01:53:40.881 --> 01:53:43.160
<v Speaker 2>he probably knows already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's his mood?</v>

2580
01:53:43.190 --> 01:53:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Is he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he angry right now?</v>

2581
01:53:44.811 --> 01:53:49.811
<v Speaker 2>Is he cranky?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a snappy with his words like what's </v>

2582
01:53:49.811 --> 01:53:49.811
<v Speaker 2>he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2583
01:53:49.811 --> 01:53:51.980
<v Speaker 2>because you've been around the fighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>so long that it's there.</v>

2584
01:53:51.981 --> 01:53:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Like my coach will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2585
01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:54.740
<v Speaker 2>it's time to take the day off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2586
01:53:54.741 --> 01:53:55.080
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2587
01:53:55.081 --> 01:53:56.840
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to train them as they take the</v>

2588
01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:00.590
<v Speaker 2>day off and then I'll take a day off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back and I'm beasting it in the gym</v>

2589
01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:05.591
<v Speaker 2>the next day where I would have just </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually beat down my body and never </v>

2590
01:54:05.591 --> 01:54:06.200
<v Speaker 2>really recovered and got better.</v>

2591
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

2592
01:54:07.061 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 2>like you woulD come in and you'd feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of flat,</v>

2593
01:54:08.961 --> 01:54:09.750
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

2594
01:54:09.751 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I got to push thRough this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Well sometimes it's important to push </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it,</v>

2596
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:15.440
<v Speaker 2>but other times when you know you're at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that level,</v>

2597
01:54:15.441 --> 01:54:16.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2598
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:21.070
<v Speaker 2>you got to pull yourself back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's the crazy thing about </v>

2599
01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:21.070
<v Speaker 2>fighting and training and learning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucks with your mind.</v>

2600
01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's such a way you might be able</v>

2601
01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:27.470
<v Speaker 2>to do it and pull it off and it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be the right way,</v>

2602
01:54:27.471 --> 01:54:30.020
<v Speaker 2>but it might be successful until you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it that way every time.</v>

2603
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had finders telling me there's no </v>

2604
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:35.500
<v Speaker 2>such thing as over training and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2605
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.020
<v Speaker 2>well that's crazy because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2606
01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.520
<v Speaker 2>You're not training hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2607
01:54:37.521 --> 01:54:40.170
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely such a thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtraining is,</v>

2608
01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of guys have done it.</v>

2609
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:44.180
<v Speaker 2>If you're constantly steady with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

2610
01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:45.540
<v Speaker 2>you're not training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2611
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:49.160
<v Speaker 2>You better be getting yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in your training.</v>

2612
01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained once a day and usually once a </v>

2613
01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:56.060
<v Speaker 2>day I never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And saturdays I would train twice,</v>

2614
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:59.180
<v Speaker 2>but the morning was a strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a strength training.</v>

2615
01:54:59.450 --> 01:55:02.130
<v Speaker 2>And then the night was kickbox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now when you say strength training,</v>

2616
01:55:02.131 --> 01:55:03.380
<v Speaker 2>like what did that involve?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2617
01:55:03.381 --> 01:55:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do my mind depending on the day,</v>

2618
01:55:05.721 --> 01:55:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I would do a push day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pull down a lower body day.</v>

2619
01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:09.890
<v Speaker 2>So lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights,</v>

2620
01:55:09.891 --> 01:55:10.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

2621
01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.010
<v Speaker 2>They was always lifting weights and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>used weight training.</v>

2622
01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:18.250
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would kick box like monday and </v>

2623
01:55:18.250 --> 01:55:18.250
<v Speaker 2>tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just once a day,</v>

2624
01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.380
<v Speaker 2>but that hour and a half session I left </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2625
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:26.530
<v Speaker 2>when I hit the bag I couldn't hit 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds of bag because after round three </v>

2626
01:55:26.530 --> 01:55:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm gassed.</v>

2627
01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting all my force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my energy.</v>

2628
01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:32.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm training for a nine minute fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not training for a marathon.</v>

2629
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:38.050
<v Speaker 2>So you need to train the proper energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>system in order to be the most </v>

2630
01:55:38.050 --> 01:55:40.010
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of that anaerobic system</v>

2631
01:55:40.011 --> 01:55:43.590
<v Speaker 2>of constantly pushing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting yourself recover yourself,</v>

2632
01:55:43.591 --> 01:55:45.360
<v Speaker 2>letting yourself recover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm constantly,</v>

2633
01:55:45.630 --> 01:55:47.850
<v Speaker 2>that's why I never ran a day in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

2634
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:50.300
<v Speaker 2>You never ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never ran a day in my career.</v>

2635
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not hit the road a day in my </v>

2636
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.350
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2637
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 2>That's shocking to a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me included.</v>

2638
01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone who hears.</v>

2639
01:55:59.101 --> 01:55:59.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're nuts.</v>

2640
01:55:59.781 --> 01:56:00.690
<v Speaker 2>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2641
01:56:00.691 --> 01:56:05.691
<v Speaker 2>why give me one good reason why I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you one is if you need that time to</v>

2642
01:56:06.241 --> 01:56:11.241
<v Speaker 2>reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you need that time to mentally </v>

2643
01:56:11.241 --> 01:56:13.881
<v Speaker 2>prepare yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what Does it do for you in the </v>

2644
01:56:13.881 --> 01:56:13.881
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>

2645
01:56:13.881 --> 01:56:14.700
<v Speaker 2>are you ever going to run 10 k in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>

2646
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:16.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sprint.</v>

2647
01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:18.610
<v Speaker 2>So you see sprinters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2648
01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:23.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usain boLt doing take 10 k runs every </v>

2649
01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.010
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might do it to loosen up and stay </v>

2650
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.010
<v Speaker 2>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's other ways of doing it.</v>

2651
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 2>You've mentioned it on your podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadowboxing.</v>

2652
01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Instead of going for a 10 k run shadow </v>
<v Speaker 2>box for 20 minutes,</v>

2653
01:56:34.150 --> 01:56:37.740
<v Speaker 2>you go into the ring and shadowbox </v>
<v Speaker 2>envision your opponent.</v>

2654
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm fighting Raymond Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to press your fight,</v>

2655
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:45.201
<v Speaker 2>Raymond Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to shadow box for 20 </v>

2656
01:56:45.201 --> 01:56:45.201
<v Speaker 2>minutes in the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2657
01:56:45.201 --> 01:56:45.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure fighting,</v>

2658
01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Raymond Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentally focusing myself.</v>

2659
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I am using the right energy system </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I can pick up my intensity as </v>

2660
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.610
<v Speaker 2>much as I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm.</v>

2661
01:56:53.611 --> 01:56:55.410
<v Speaker 2>If I just want to stay loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just won't punch.</v>

2662
01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I might not even punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might just use my footwork within the </v>

2663
01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:01.650
<v Speaker 2>ring to kind of just set my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set my feet.</v>

2664
01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:04.230
<v Speaker 2>but there's so many different ways you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can skip.</v>

2665
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.850
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2666
01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I do light training on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bag.</v>

2667
01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll do some light rounds on different </v>
<v Speaker 2>bags just to warm uP my hands and my </v>

2668
01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.690
<v Speaker 2>body and that kinda thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never ran too much damage.</v>

2669
01:57:15.710 --> 01:57:17.370
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running shin splints,</v>

2670
01:57:17.371 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 2>the damage on your joints and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the energy system.</v>

2671
01:57:20.881 --> 01:57:22.380
<v Speaker 2>You hit in fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why do it?</v>

2672
01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.920
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>always had a very high output work </v>

2673
01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:29.940
<v Speaker 2>output when your fights and you had very</v>
<v Speaker 2>good endurance in your fights.</v>

2674
01:57:29.941 --> 01:57:34.941
<v Speaker 2>Everyone thought there was a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I trained hard and an hour and a </v>

2675
01:57:34.941 --> 01:57:35.880
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained hard.</v>

2676
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.070
<v Speaker 2>When I hit the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit the bag.</v>

2677
01:57:38.071 --> 01:57:43.071
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't looking around at the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at how much time's left on the </v>

2678
01:57:43.071 --> 01:57:43.200
<v Speaker 2>clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2679
01:57:43.410 --> 01:57:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I hit the bag if I knew I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was working something technical,</v>

2680
01:57:47.741 --> 01:57:48.240
<v Speaker 2>they're drilling.</v>

2681
01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.610
<v Speaker 2>It's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it's time to work,</v>

2682
01:57:50.611 --> 01:57:55.611
<v Speaker 2>you got to put the work in you gotta be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to cut out all those distractions </v>

2683
01:57:55.611 --> 01:57:58.620
<v Speaker 2>that you have and it doesn't matter what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do after.</v>

2684
01:57:58.621 --> 01:58:01.170
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your day.</v>

2685
01:58:01.171 --> 01:58:04.620
<v Speaker 2>If your girlfriend or boyfriend broke up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you or whatever the frick it is,</v>

2686
01:58:04.621 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 2>you got to be focused and you have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half to do it.</v>

2687
01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see mma fighters that are </v>

2688
01:58:13.190 --> 01:58:13.190
<v Speaker 2>putting in two a days on a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes three,</v>

2689
01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:15.000
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of that?</v>

2690
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it's okay if you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2691
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean you mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more things happening,</v>

2692
01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:26.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're doing a role in the </v>

2693
01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:26.240
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's okay,</v>

2694
01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.561
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to go the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 2>role you have and then hit the hardest </v>

2695
01:58:30.561 --> 01:58:33.711
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at night do your hardest </v>

2696
01:58:33.711 --> 01:58:33.711
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing session.</v>

2697
01:58:33.711 --> 01:58:35.910
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next day you're actually putting 100</v>

2698
01:58:35.911 --> 01:58:37.710
<v Speaker 2>percent of your energy in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions.</v>

2699
01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:41.000
<v Speaker 2>So maybe sometimes if they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

2700
01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:44.170
<v Speaker 2>they might put 60 percent in each </v>
<v Speaker 2>session.</v>

2701
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 2>You're never really hitting that last 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

2702
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 2>which is probably the place you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2703
01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:55.960
<v Speaker 2>You want to be in that place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not comfortable.</v>

2704
01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:01.080
<v Speaker 2>You wAnt to be in that place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tired because that's what </v>

2705
01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.811
<v Speaker 2>fighting is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting yourself to that point you want </v>

2706
01:59:03.811 --> 01:59:06.420
<v Speaker 2>to throw up if you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's is they say it's your.</v>

2707
01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Your mind gives up before the body does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're tired and you starting to</v>

2708
01:59:11.171 --> 01:59:13.520
<v Speaker 2>feel all that lactic acid and you shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2709
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 2>they say it's your brain shutting down </v>
<v Speaker 2>first and you have some time to keep </v>

2710
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to prepare your mind to be</v>

2711
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:23.521
<v Speaker 2>able to withstand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're hitting bag for 10 rounds and </v>

2712
01:59:23.521 --> 01:59:23.521
<v Speaker 2>you're looking around and you're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

2713
01:59:23.521 --> 01:59:27.751
<v Speaker 2>like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you accomplishing that unless </v>

2714
01:59:27.751 --> 01:59:30.841
<v Speaker 2>you're working on technique or warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have everything has to have a </v>

2715
01:59:31.061 --> 01:59:31.660
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>

2716
01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a purpose.</v>

2717
01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:39.330
<v Speaker 2>What's one of the things that I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>like about the way you drill and one </v>

2718
01:59:39.330 --> 01:59:41.971
<v Speaker 2>things I like about the way you shadow </v>
<v Speaker 2>box is that you do everything like your </v>

2719
01:59:41.971 --> 01:59:44.290
<v Speaker 2>inner fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything guard is high stances.</v>

2720
01:59:44.291 --> 01:59:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Footwork is perfect.</v>

2721
01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:51.360
<v Speaker 2>When you say that you lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of weight lifting where </v>

2722
01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:53.030
<v Speaker 2>you're doing once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2723
01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:53.480
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2724
01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:55.600
<v Speaker 2>it's the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the most effective.</v>

2725
01:59:55.601 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 2>So I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always squatting.</v>

2726
01:59:57.670 --> 02:00:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Squatting is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think squatting so important?</v>

2727
02:00:00.701 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Lower body when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when everything in,</v>

2728
02:00:03.101 --> 02:00:05.650
<v Speaker 2>in athletic movements comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower body,</v>

2729
02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:08.410
<v Speaker 2>you have to have strong hips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know your glutes,</v>

2730
02:00:08.411 --> 02:00:11.200
<v Speaker 2>got to be firing at a level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know when you punch,</v>

2731
02:00:11.201 --> 02:00:13.240
<v Speaker 2>when you kick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything comes from your lower body.</v>

2732
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's what people don't understand.</v>

2733
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.860
<v Speaker 2>So we'll use squatting heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use quoting lightweights,</v>

2734
02:00:16.861 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 2>low a high reps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends what phase I'm in.</v>

2735
02:00:19.031 --> 02:00:24.031
<v Speaker 2>If I was in hypertrophy phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was probably doing 10 sets of 10 on a </v>

2736
02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:24.031
<v Speaker 2>lower weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2737
02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:27.550
<v Speaker 2>as I was in power strength phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing five sets of five.</v>

2738
02:00:27.850 --> 02:00:32.850
<v Speaker 2>As I was more the explosive phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do more of like five sets of </v>

2739
02:00:32.850 --> 02:00:37.231
<v Speaker 2>three and then I'd maybe super setted </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an explosive jump or a standing </v>

2740
02:00:37.231 --> 02:00:38.500
<v Speaker 2>long jump or a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2741
02:00:38.501 --> 02:00:43.501
<v Speaker 2>a skater style movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'd always use it at that sprint </v>

2742
02:00:43.501 --> 02:00:44.470
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one times where I would do,</v>

2743
02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five heavy explosive squats and then I </v>

2744
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:53.611
<v Speaker 2>would line up on the track right after </v>
<v Speaker 2>my set and I would do like 10 yard </v>

2745
02:00:53.611 --> 02:00:58.201
<v Speaker 2>sprints just to work that explosiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that whole point of getting </v>

2746
02:00:58.201 --> 02:01:01.141
<v Speaker 2>strengthened to explosiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of running you believed in </v>

2747
02:01:01.141 --> 02:01:02.660
<v Speaker 2>was just that little bit but not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not too much.</v>

2748
02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:04.390
<v Speaker 2>That would be like once or twice in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

2749
02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.150
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I know my central nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system was gonna,</v>

2750
02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:09.580
<v Speaker 2>shut down no shadow once or twice in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

2751
02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even that sled running all the guys </v>

2752
02:01:14.730 --> 02:01:15.280
<v Speaker 2>doing the prowler poles and sleds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I did that,</v>

2753
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I'd be out of commission for a week </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my body would just take a </v>

2754
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:24.421
<v Speaker 2>beating and then I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be able to function and do </v>

2755
02:01:24.421 --> 02:01:26.190
<v Speaker 2>what I really had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was kickbox next.</v>

2756
02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2757
02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:32.580
<v Speaker 2>So it had to have a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it as a mental test for </v>

2758
02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:32.890
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it as,</v>

2759
02:01:32.891 --> 02:01:33.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2760
02:01:33.581 --> 02:01:36.340
<v Speaker 2>my weight's not coming off right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding a lot of water.</v>

2761
02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's run the sleds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use that as that more than just </v>

2762
02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're running the prowler everyday,</v>

2763
02:01:41.601 --> 02:01:44.720
<v Speaker 2>your nervous system is taking a freaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating right now.</v>

2764
02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.290
<v Speaker 2>What about nutrition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

2765
02:01:46.291 --> 02:01:48.890
<v Speaker 2>what did you eat and how did you </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition?</v>

2766
02:01:48.891 --> 02:01:53.891
<v Speaker 2>I was a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't super calculated as people are </v>

2767
02:01:53.891 --> 02:01:55.650
<v Speaker 2>today with counting their macros and </v>
<v Speaker 2>micros and I was,</v>

2768
02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.780
<v Speaker 2>that's too complicated and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in over complicating things.</v>

2769
02:01:59.781 --> 02:02:02.180
<v Speaker 2>I love the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the basics,</v>

2770
02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:08.140
<v Speaker 2>so I never over complicated things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew what good carbs and bad carbs </v>

2771
02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:10.400
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew good timing when to eat.</v>

2772
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.830
<v Speaker 2>I knew what things I should be eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2773
02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:16.490
<v Speaker 2>but I never really counted how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories I was eating in my day.</v>

2774
02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I just knew through experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it just came through experience and</v>

2775
02:02:21.641 --> 02:02:23.420
<v Speaker 2>practicing and playing around with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2776
02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:28.421
<v Speaker 2>There's no cookie cutter approach to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what would a typical meal be </v>

2777
02:02:28.421 --> 02:02:30.590
<v Speaker 2>like for dinner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would always be a balanced meal,</v>

2778
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:35.630
<v Speaker 2>have a little bit of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of carbs and some </v>

2779
02:02:35.630 --> 02:02:35.630
<v Speaker 2>vegetable.</v>

2780
02:02:35.630 --> 02:02:37.010
<v Speaker 2>There's always has the three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At first when I was doing,</v>

2781
02:02:37.011 --> 02:02:38.150
<v Speaker 2>when I first started fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2782
02:02:38.151 --> 02:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbs make you fat,</v>

2783
02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:45.040
<v Speaker 2>carbs make you fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like everyone thinks that everyone </v>

2784
02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:47.651
<v Speaker 2>wants to die at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing they think they have to </v>

2785
02:02:47.651 --> 02:02:49.241
<v Speaker 2>do is cut their carbs out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now there's all this new research </v>

2786
02:02:49.241 --> 02:02:52.241
<v Speaker 2>about fats and how important is </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fasting and how important </v>

2787
02:02:52.241 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 2>it is to to keep high fats in your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So got a guys are doing the avocados and</v>

2788
02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 2>coconut oils to kind of get that fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just liked the balanced meal.</v>

2789
02:03:01.401 --> 02:03:05.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather lower my protein and have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good carbohydrate,</v>

2790
02:03:05.031 --> 02:03:09.770
<v Speaker 2>whIch is my first line of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would eat a lot of sweet potatoes.</v>

2791
02:03:09.771 --> 02:03:14.771
<v Speaker 2>keen was big potatoes sometimes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins.</v>

2792
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Omega threes usually.</v>

2793
02:03:18.030 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about it.</v>

2794
02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I take an electrolyte after training.</v>

2795
02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:24.560
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing crazy.</v>

2796
02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

2797
02:03:25.690 --> 02:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dId you do anything for.</v>

2798
02:03:27.250 --> 02:03:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say it,</v>

2799
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.640
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't the guy that if I knew how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight,</v>

2800
02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I cut weight from eight weeks out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like,</v>

2801
02:03:34.821 --> 02:03:37.070
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just eat like shit and then</v>

2802
02:03:37.190 --> 02:03:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2803
02:03:38.230 --> 02:03:42.670
<v Speaker 2>eight weeks out my diet started with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to refill your body fat.</v>

2804
02:03:42.710 --> 02:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I only want to lose two pounds a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything more than two pounds a week </v>

2805
02:03:47.710 --> 02:03:51.041
<v Speaker 2>becomes unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd get to about 10 to 12 pounds a </v>

2806
02:03:51.041 --> 02:03:51.530
<v Speaker 2>week before my fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was it.</v>

2807
02:03:51.531 --> 02:03:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Once I was there that last week was all </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

2808
02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.830
<v Speaker 2>And did you do any like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2809
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:59.150
<v Speaker 2>deep tissue massage or any ice baths or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that?</v>

2810
02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.610
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2811
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

2812
02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:03.230
<v Speaker 2>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a big focus.</v>

2813
02:04:03.231 --> 02:04:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of rolling out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stretching,</v>

2814
02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:08.930
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I liked epsom salt baths.</v>

2815
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are obsessed with deep </v>

2816
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:14.430
<v Speaker 2>tissue though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know guys like get deep tissue massage</v>

2817
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:16.010
<v Speaker 2>every day after training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've done that.</v>

2818
02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Was it the cairo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said cryotherapy.</v>

2819
02:04:18.741 --> 02:04:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Cryo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2820
02:04:20.090 --> 02:04:21.560
<v Speaker 2>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

2821
02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:22.940
<v Speaker 2>He's never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2822
02:04:22.941 --> 02:04:23.930
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to do It?</v>

2823
02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it today.</v>

2824
02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>

2825
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll love it.</v>

2826
02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>

2827
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:32.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't believe how cold it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2828
02:04:32.481 --> 02:04:33.830
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2829
02:04:33.831 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I gotta try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to try it.</v>

2830
02:04:35.511 --> 02:04:36.770
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never really.</v>

2831
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Two 50 degrees below zero.</v>

2832
02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And how long you in there for like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes.</v>

2833
02:04:41.130 --> 02:04:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2834
02:04:42.001 --> 02:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Well you'll do a minute and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't let you go more than a minute</v>

2835
02:04:44.161 --> 02:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>and a half for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was trying to say I'm soft.</v>

2836
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:48.440
<v Speaker 1>No for anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2837
02:04:48.490 --> 02:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second time you'll do it.</v>

2838
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>How long do you go in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For?</v>

2839
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done 3:40,</v>

2840
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I saw longest I've ever done those last </v>
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes.</v>

2841
02:04:56.190 --> 02:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Three minutes of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it three minutes of.</v>

2842
02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:02.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a jamie's done it.</v>

2843
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:03.540
<v Speaker 1>You've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like jamie?</v>

2844
02:05:03.541 --> 02:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really claustrophobic isn't the</v>

2845
02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:11.541
<v Speaker 1>word because there's a kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get in your heads above it and </v>

2846
02:05:11.541 --> 02:05:13.320
<v Speaker 1>you can still talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not like that.</v>

2847
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>You're heading to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2848
02:05:14.611 --> 02:05:17.130
<v Speaker 1>You're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a meat locker essentially.</v>

2849
02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liquid nitrogen cools the oxygen.</v>

2850
02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2851
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>like that woman that died in vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that story?</v>

2852
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.910
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2853
02:05:23.911 --> 02:05:24.480
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2854
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:29.510
<v Speaker 1>she said it herself and apparently she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was kinda short and her mouth was below </v>

2855
02:05:30.811 --> 02:05:35.811
<v Speaker 1>the outer lip and so she was breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the liquid nitrogen and you can't,</v>

2856
02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:38.460
<v Speaker 1>that's like getting choked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no oxygen.</v>

2857
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So she just fell asleep and she froze to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death and they found her the next day.</v>

2858
02:05:43.111 --> 02:05:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Frozen solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2859
02:05:44.041 --> 02:05:46.140
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind I always see the heads </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2860
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind that they,</v>

2861
02:05:47.650 --> 02:05:50.850
<v Speaker 1>that most people do where your head is </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and your body's freezing.</v>

2862
02:05:50.851 --> 02:05:55.851
<v Speaker 1>But look how much fun she's having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's having a great time having a </v>

2863
02:05:55.851 --> 02:05:55.851
<v Speaker 1>blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's doing an ad.</v>

2864
02:05:55.851 --> 02:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>The kind I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to cryo healthcare,</v>

2865
02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:59.940
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind we do,</v>

2866
02:05:59.970 --> 02:06:04.080
<v Speaker 1>you have to wear a mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wear like a surgeon's mask over your</v>

2867
02:06:04.081 --> 02:06:04.530
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

2868
02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:08.260
<v Speaker 1>You wear ear muffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wear gloves and you wear slippers.</v>

2869
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wear socks and then you were like </v>

2870
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>rubber crocs and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2871
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you step in there and you're inside a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber.</v>

2872
02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:21.990
<v Speaker 1>We'll see if they have some images so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see what it looks like.</v>

2873
02:06:21.991 --> 02:06:24.000
<v Speaker 1>You've done that sensory deprivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2874
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I have one of my basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2875
02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

2876
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I do that all the time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant.</v>

2877
02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:30.480
<v Speaker 1>If you're claustrophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good or bad,</v>

2878
02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:32.580
<v Speaker 1>someone says you don't even think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2879
02:06:32.581 --> 02:06:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best thing for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are claustrophobic,</v>

2880
02:06:35.341 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 1>but claustrophobia is psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

2881
02:06:37.351 --> 02:06:38.970
<v Speaker 1>that's where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how these guys,</v>

2882
02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that's how they're dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ear muffs and the,</v>

2883
02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2884
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>masks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you go in that one chamber that's</v>

2885
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you take off the robe and </v>

2886
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:51.810
<v Speaker 1>then you step into the one on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one is the one where you freeze</v>

2887
02:06:51.811 --> 02:06:52.470
<v Speaker 1>your dick off.</v>

2888
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll do a and a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take you over there and </v>

2889
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>do about a minute and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're so awesome.</v>

2890
02:06:57.860 --> 02:06:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Love to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2891
02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 1>so I just want to know about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people keep asking me.</v>

2892
02:07:02.070 --> 02:07:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2893
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:08.390
<v Speaker 1>dr rhonda patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's actually on tomorrow who's a huge </v>

2894
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:12.081
<v Speaker 1>proponent of both sauna and cold shock </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and she believes that a heat </v>

2895
02:07:12.661 --> 02:07:17.310
<v Speaker 1>shock proteins and cold shock proteins </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that you get from sauna and you get</v>

2896
02:07:17.311 --> 02:07:22.311
<v Speaker 1>from a cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They proviDe your body with a some </v>

2897
02:07:22.531 --> 02:07:27.030
<v Speaker 1>incredible anti-inflammatory responses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your body.</v>

2898
02:07:27.090 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Essentially when you go to a sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's freaking out.</v>

2899
02:07:29.611 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 1>You're biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>

2900
02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2901
02:07:31.881 --> 02:07:36.881
<v Speaker 1>but if you do it in a controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for a certain amount of </v>

2902
02:07:36.881 --> 02:07:39.621
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body produces these heat shock </v>

2903
02:07:39.621 --> 02:07:39.621
<v Speaker 1>proteins that are really beneficial for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2904
02:07:39.621 --> 02:07:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And so she believes in the sauna like </v>
<v Speaker 1>she thinks there was a study that she </v>

2905
02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:49.081
<v Speaker 1>was talking about where the sauna showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 50 percent drop in mortality across </v>

2906
02:07:49.541 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 1>the board from all things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's from cancer disease,</v>

2907
02:07:53.711 --> 02:07:57.310
<v Speaker 1>all these different things like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who regularly did sauna,</v>

2908
02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:02.820
<v Speaker 1>such a healthy response to that sauna </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having those inflammatory markers </v>

2909
02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:08.530
<v Speaker 1>reduced in the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is using the sauna four to </v>

2910
02:08:08.530 --> 02:08:08.530
<v Speaker 1>seven times per week associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those 40 percent,</v>

2911
02:08:08.530 --> 02:08:10.900
<v Speaker 1>40 percent lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all caused mortality.</v>

2912
02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:12.100
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2913
02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I was reading something that tim </v>
<v Speaker 1>ferriss,</v>

2914
02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:18.700
<v Speaker 1>he has a book now called tools of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>titans and he someone he,</v>

2915
02:08:18.701 --> 02:08:23.701
<v Speaker 1>I guess he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has his own podcast or someone just </v>

2916
02:08:23.701 --> 02:08:27.180
<v Speaker 1>very good for me and he basically talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>to all the top people are in their </v>

2917
02:08:27.671 --> 02:08:32.671
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he wrote a list of like all the </v>

2918
02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:35.761
<v Speaker 1>tips that these people suggested and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of them was ensena and baths.</v>

2919
02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:38.860
<v Speaker 1>And I never really got into too much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the science behind it.</v>

2920
02:08:38.861 --> 02:08:40.240
<v Speaker 1>But these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2921
02:08:40.241 --> 02:08:45.241
<v Speaker 1>people in this field are saying sauna </v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a week is probably one of </v>

2922
02:08:45.241 --> 02:08:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the best things you can do for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2923
02:08:45.941 --> 02:08:48.460
<v Speaker 1>When she was writing there hsp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what she's talking about.</v>

2924
02:08:48.461 --> 02:08:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Heat shock proteins and I bet you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably reproduce that with a hot bath.</v>

2925
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:55.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what hsp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2926
02:08:55.610 --> 02:09:00.610
<v Speaker 1>side of keen's to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also what you're getting from </v>

2927
02:09:00.610 --> 02:09:00.850
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting these,</v>

2928
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>these anti inflammatory responses and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you probably could get it from hot</v>

2929
02:09:06.281 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 1>yoga too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] hot yoga,</v>

2930
02:09:08.231 --> 02:09:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you get so fucking hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>

2931
02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

2932
02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:13.990
<v Speaker 1>It took a little break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm starting again.</v>

2933
02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2934
02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing for flexibility in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>class I was in was an hour and a half </v>

2935
02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:21.700
<v Speaker 1>and that was long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long sucks.</v>

2936
02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:24.010
<v Speaker 1>The last 15 minutes are bullshit.</v>

2937
02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:29.300
<v Speaker 1>The last one he literally sit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay down or something that I sit up and </v>

2938
02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:29.300
<v Speaker 1>then we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

2939
02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal.</v>

2940
02:09:30.281 --> 02:09:32.080
<v Speaker 1>You definitely get used to it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2941
02:09:32.081 --> 02:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I've seen like girls that go to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

2942
02:09:34.321 --> 02:09:36.700
<v Speaker 1>it will take two classes in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like such a pussy.</v>

2943
02:09:36.810 --> 02:09:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there for three hours.</v>

2944
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there struggling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling.</v>

2945
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:45.310
<v Speaker 1>This old lady besides killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to use the little foam blocks </v>

2946
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.020
<v Speaker 1>that sit down and everyone was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

2947
02:09:47.021 --> 02:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You can see all the mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mirrors make it worse than ever feel</v>

2948
02:09:50.730 --> 02:09:53.080
<v Speaker 1>the whole place is staring at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially they're looking at you.</v>

2949
02:09:53.081 --> 02:09:58.081
<v Speaker 1>This fucking muscular 60 year old lady </v>
<v Speaker 1>has got a foot above her head and went </v>

2950
02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:01.180
<v Speaker 1>with when I was going was with my ex </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>

2951
02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:02.380
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the.</v>

2952
02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:04.460
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the old ladies would go with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2953
02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Your boyfriend there is so cute for </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying those.</v>

2954
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Trying my ass because I'm an athlete and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like I'm not letting this old lady </v>

2955
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:13.660
<v Speaker 1>be able to do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was standing here struggling,</v>

2956
02:10:13.661 --> 02:10:18.661
<v Speaker 1>are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like what you're talking about </v>

2957
02:10:18.661 --> 02:10:20.551
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took a marathon runner and then </v>

2958
02:10:20.551 --> 02:10:20.551
<v Speaker 1>put them in a pool and there it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

2959
02:10:20.551 --> 02:10:24.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an athlete and you're going to </v>

2960
02:10:24.241 --> 02:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>try to competitive guy like sweating </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra from trying so hard.</v>

2961
02:10:25.271 --> 02:10:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was tough.</v>

2962
02:10:25.871 --> 02:10:27.130
<v Speaker 1>But I love it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2963
02:10:27.131 --> 02:10:30.670
<v Speaker 1>what I feel from yoga and especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the last year with I've been really</v>

2964
02:10:30.671 --> 02:10:33.440
<v Speaker 1>consistent with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I feel like all the,</v>

2965
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:35.630
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good for your body.</v>

2966
02:10:35.631 --> 02:10:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I think lifting weights is good for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body if you do it correctly,</v>

2967
02:10:37.851 --> 02:10:42.851
<v Speaker 1>if for sure martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of trainings good for your </v>

2968
02:10:42.851 --> 02:10:42.851
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

2969
02:10:42.851 --> 02:10:45.430
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like what yoga does for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance and for all the things that </v>

2970
02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:48.680
<v Speaker 1>connect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for your joints and your spine.</v>

2971
02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I've never done anything where I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel my back pop loose.</v>

2972
02:10:53.530 --> 02:10:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Like there's things you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you in yoga where you,</v>

2973
02:10:56.121 --> 02:11:01.121
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bend down and you reach behind your </v>

2974
02:11:01.121 --> 02:11:03.410
<v Speaker 1>heels and you tuck your hands under your</v>
<v Speaker 1>heels and then you straighten your legs,</v>

2975
02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:07.760
<v Speaker 1>your body flat into your pulling your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body apart with your legs.</v>

2976
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you're literally pulling your spine</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

2977
02:11:09.771 --> 02:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>You here at gulf dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump,</v>

2978
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:13.220
<v Speaker 1>dump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good for you.</v>

2979
02:11:13.221 --> 02:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2980
02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I like my back is always like from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the years is you just see there's always</v>

2981
02:11:18.961 --> 02:11:20.840
<v Speaker 1>like a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always something,</v>

2982
02:11:20.841 --> 02:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>megan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2983
02:11:21.590 --> 02:11:24.380
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yoga eliminates almost all that shit</v>

2984
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 1>cause even when I was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I realized how much scar tissue and</v>

2985
02:11:28.251 --> 02:11:31.100
<v Speaker 1>shit that developed in my joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even if my arm,</v>

2986
02:11:31.101 --> 02:11:36.101
<v Speaker 1>like I can't focus straight in my left </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm and there's the one where you have </v>

2987
02:11:36.101 --> 02:11:39.401
<v Speaker 1>to kind of put your pinkies together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay on your arms and that really helps </v>

2988
02:11:39.401 --> 02:11:41.810
<v Speaker 1>stretch it out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this stuff's not good.</v>

2989
02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm sitting on the couch at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and like I'm sitting in positions </v>

2990
02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:47.720
<v Speaker 1>where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my legs are crossed off on him.</v>

2991
02:11:47.721 --> 02:11:52.721
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't even cross my legs and here</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am like in like a mahatma gandhi here </v>

2992
02:11:52.721 --> 02:11:54.410
<v Speaker 1>with my legs super folded in half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2993
02:11:54.411 --> 02:11:56.630
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I loved it since then.</v>

2994
02:11:57.110 --> 02:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't consistent with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said I'm going to be a yoga </v>

2995
02:12:02.110 --> 02:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>practitioner for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

2996
02:12:02.110 --> 02:12:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2997
02:12:02.221 --> 02:12:05.750
<v Speaker 1>it's great for mobility and for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just want to be healthier,</v>

2998
02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it's for the just the ability to use and</v>
<v Speaker 1>move your body.</v>

2999
02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with guys is that negative </v>

3000
02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:15.600
<v Speaker 1>stereotype who it's so gay to do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3001
02:12:15.650 --> 02:12:16.530
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3002
02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that it has that stereotype </v>

3003
02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:21.710
<v Speaker 1>of why it's so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's incredible.</v>

3004
02:12:21.711 --> 02:12:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3005
02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:27.730
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the more underestimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in terms of its difficulty </v>

3006
02:12:27.730 --> 02:12:28.610
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3007
02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:32.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just very underestimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do you think mma fighters should be</v>

3008
02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:37.511
<v Speaker 1>doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you were saying about you </v>

3009
02:12:37.511 --> 02:12:37.790
<v Speaker 1>can only do so many things is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

3010
02:12:37.791 --> 02:12:42.791
<v Speaker 1>which I think one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>your philosophy about only working out </v>

3011
02:12:42.791 --> 02:12:42.791
<v Speaker 1>one time a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no running,</v>

3012
02:12:42.791 --> 02:12:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously it worked out great.</v>

3013
02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>You had amazing success as a fighter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously your endurance with </v>

3014
02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:50.360
<v Speaker 1>spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your output was spectacular.</v>

3015
02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were an aggressive pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>

3016
02:12:52.671 --> 02:12:55.700
<v Speaker 1>so when you say that you had the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured approach to training,</v>

3017
02:12:55.701 --> 02:13:00.701
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the times I've gotten my ass </v>

3018
02:13:00.701 --> 02:13:02.030
<v Speaker 1>kicked the most in jujitsu was after I </v>
<v Speaker 1>took yoga.</v>

3019
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I took yoga in the morning and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to train at night and just fucking </v>

3020
02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330
<v Speaker 1>chill.</v>

3021
02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:10.810
<v Speaker 1>They say you have to like give some time</v>
<v Speaker 1>off from one or something because your </v>

3022
02:13:10.810 --> 02:13:14.771
<v Speaker 1>body is so loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is they say you don't </v>

3023
02:13:14.771 --> 02:13:17.831
<v Speaker 1>want to overstretch your muscle because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you take it out of that optimal </v>

3024
02:13:17.831 --> 02:13:21.461
<v Speaker 1>range to fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if you really </v>

3025
02:13:21.461 --> 02:13:21.680
<v Speaker 1>overstretched things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>

3026
02:13:21.810 --> 02:13:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they say they say that a trench </v>

3027
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:27.310
<v Speaker 1>for laura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3028
02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:28.430
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's.</v>

3029
02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that necessarily makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

3030
02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I think where that where it makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you shouldn't stretch out before you </v>

3031
02:13:35.170 --> 02:13:39.441
<v Speaker 1>do explosive things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to think you should now they </v>

3032
02:13:39.441 --> 02:13:40.230
<v Speaker 1>think you should warm up and get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body sweaty and loose,</v>

3033
02:13:40.410 --> 02:13:44.550
<v Speaker 1>but that an actual stretching will you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really stretch something out?</v>

3034
02:13:44.551 --> 02:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>You actually lessen the amount of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can generate those muscles.</v>

3035
02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always feel like full mobility.</v>

3036
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of that,</v>

3037
02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:58.191
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where the argument is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's obviously correct because </v>

3038
02:13:58.191 --> 02:14:01.071
<v Speaker 1>there's been research to back it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there's any research </v>

3039
02:14:01.071 --> 02:14:02.010
<v Speaker 1>that shows that like being able to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full split in any way.</v>

3040
02:14:02.011 --> 02:14:03.930
<v Speaker 1>We'll take away your kicking power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3041
02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about the amount of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of these guys can generate </v>

3042
02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:12.320
<v Speaker 1>that are really flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if there's any that might be a </v>

3043
02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:17.181
<v Speaker 1>trade off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it makes you a little less </v>

3044
02:14:17.181 --> 02:14:20.600
<v Speaker 1>powerful but a little more mobile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can generate more power and </v>

3045
02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:22.080
<v Speaker 1>build more power up and still keep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobility.</v>

3046
02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:27.260
<v Speaker 1>That would be optimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's probably a middle </v>

3047
02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:28.260
<v Speaker 1>ground there that you need to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of.</v>

3048
02:14:28.261 --> 02:14:33.261
<v Speaker 1>I know george st pierre came and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics popular and then conor </v>

3049
02:14:33.261 --> 02:14:34.020
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor with that movement.</v>

3050
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:38.340
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on that movement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think footwork is critical in mma.</v>

3051
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of the way and move in as </v>

3052
02:14:43.470 --> 02:14:47.661
<v Speaker 1>fast as possible and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that conor spectacular at is so </v>

3053
02:14:47.661 --> 02:14:48.840
<v Speaker 1>good at sliding back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sliding back,</v>

3054
02:14:48.890 --> 02:14:51.420
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's also.</v>

3055
02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:56.690
<v Speaker 1>There's also a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy that's a part of striking </v>

3056
02:14:56.690 --> 02:14:58.680
<v Speaker 1>with those little tiny gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more difficult to put yourself</v>

3057
02:14:58.681 --> 02:14:59.700
<v Speaker 1>up in a shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3058
02:14:59.701 --> 02:15:01.800
<v Speaker 1>the way he would fight with [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

3059
02:15:01.801 --> 02:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3060
02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kissing your ass anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

3061
02:15:03.931 --> 02:15:07.950
<v Speaker 1>this is the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really loved how you were so solid</v>

3062
02:15:07.951 --> 02:15:09.930
<v Speaker 1>rock solid with your defense and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals.</v>

3063
02:15:09.931 --> 02:15:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Chin tucked gloves up high and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to get through that.</v>

3064
02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:18.500
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily work the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in mma because guys can sneak </v>

3065
02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:21.831
<v Speaker 1>punches through hard punches around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still think you have to have that </v>

3066
02:15:22.201 --> 02:15:23.010
<v Speaker 1>as a base.</v>

3067
02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what,</v>

3068
02:15:24.901 --> 02:15:29.901
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get in fight exchanges </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of guys who are good </v>

3069
02:15:29.901 --> 02:15:30.810
<v Speaker 1>at closing distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so isn't.</v>

3070
02:15:30.811 --> 02:15:32.070
<v Speaker 1>It's better to at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3071
02:15:32.071 --> 02:15:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave and exit with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands up rather than leaving,</v>

3072
02:15:34.921 --> 02:15:37.890
<v Speaker 1>exiting with my hands 100 percent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3073
02:15:37.891 --> 02:15:42.891
<v Speaker 1>the way I throw it and it I could still </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it work in mma because one of the </v>

3074
02:15:43.231 --> 02:15:48.231
<v Speaker 1>tricks that I teach my mma guys is </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of keeping that front arm </v>

3075
02:15:48.231 --> 02:15:52.101
<v Speaker 1>pinned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep it up here so if it covers the </v>

3076
02:15:52.101 --> 02:15:55.551
<v Speaker 1>center so you're lifting your frontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobe and so this way your elbow now </v>

3077
02:15:55.651 --> 02:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>covers the center line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

3078
02:15:57.870 --> 02:16:00.780
<v Speaker 1>It's harder for straight punches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think,</v>

3079
02:16:00.781 --> 02:16:05.781
<v Speaker 1>you gave me a straight punch and I put </v>
<v Speaker 1>my elbow in front of the block and the </v>

3080
02:16:05.781 --> 02:16:09.201
<v Speaker 1>center line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you punch your to knuckle under an </v>

3081
02:16:09.201 --> 02:16:11.450
<v Speaker 1>mma glove on my elbow to your hand so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really manipulate that front </v>

3082
02:16:11.881 --> 02:16:16.881
<v Speaker 1>elbow to be able to kind of use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense and kind of make a make it work.</v>

3083
02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:19.170
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still believe in movement.</v>

3084
02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:22.920
<v Speaker 1>There's another issue in mma to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>brick and hand breaking hands.</v>

3085
02:16:23.110 --> 02:16:25.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys break cans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little gloves,</v>

3086
02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:27.270
<v Speaker 1>but when you did old school martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>

3087
02:16:27.570 --> 02:16:29.230
<v Speaker 1>how did you train your hands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3088
02:16:29.231 --> 02:16:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys.</v>

3089
02:16:30.881 --> 02:16:34.150
<v Speaker 1>My friend john was a nut about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend John Lee,</v>

3090
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:36.460
<v Speaker 1>who was a us national taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

3091
02:16:36.461 --> 02:16:40.060
<v Speaker 1>He used to punch bricks and he had one </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckle like his.</v>

3092
02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:44.970
<v Speaker 1>His two knuckles had forged into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one giant callous knuckle.</v>

3093
02:16:44.971 --> 02:16:46.320
<v Speaker 1>It can be seen those old like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3094
02:16:46.330 --> 02:16:51.330
<v Speaker 1>that's so yama guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this old school one but you don't even </v>

3095
02:16:51.330 --> 02:16:52.570
<v Speaker 1>not cool anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then.</v>

3096
02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:55.300
<v Speaker 1>But then I heard that shit super bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you get older,</v>

3097
02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:59.290
<v Speaker 1>like massive arthritis and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>write your own name anymore.</v>

3098
02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:04.000
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played around with doing some bag work</v>

3099
02:17:04.090 --> 02:17:05.170
<v Speaker 1>with no gloves.</v>

3100
02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I keep my raps on sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly Just avoid the scraping and the </v>

3101
02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:14.521
<v Speaker 1>cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll hit the bags with with no </v>

3102
02:17:14.521 --> 02:17:15.310
<v Speaker 1>gloves on and I'll literally hit my hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>on different angles.</v>

3103
02:17:15.311 --> 02:17:20.311
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit there and I hit the side aisle </v>

3104
02:17:20.311 --> 02:17:20.311
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fist it you need that,</v>

3105
02:17:20.311 --> 02:17:22.350
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said earlier in the podcast,</v>

3106
02:17:22.351 --> 02:17:27.351
<v Speaker 1>you need to strengthen everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to strengthen all those little </v>

3107
02:17:27.351 --> 02:17:29.140
<v Speaker 1>parts and that's why one of my last </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram videos I said add,</v>

3108
02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:34.320
<v Speaker 1>waited just a one pound or two pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbbell to your sHadow boxing because </v>

3109
02:17:34.901 --> 02:17:35.440
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3110
02:17:35.441 --> 02:17:37.300
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working those little joints.</v>

3111
02:17:37.301 --> 02:17:42.301
<v Speaker 1>He might not necessarily work like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have those dumbbells and you rotate </v>

3112
02:17:42.301 --> 02:17:45.541
<v Speaker 1>your hands in a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel your elbow work at </v>

3113
02:17:45.541 --> 02:17:47.680
<v Speaker 1>different movements and different ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that help strengthen the joint,</v>

3114
02:17:47.681 --> 02:17:51.010
<v Speaker 1>so those little minor things add up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

3115
02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

3116
02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever squeeze your hand grippers </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that?</v>

3117
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3118
02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:57.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys are into that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've.</v>

3119
02:17:57.611 --> 02:18:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten more into that lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this old school,</v>

3120
02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:06.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a company called captains of </v>

3121
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:08.401
<v Speaker 1>crush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make ones that are like 197 pounds </v>

3122
02:18:08.401 --> 02:18:09.250
<v Speaker 1>to squeeze that make them up to go even </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavier than that,</v>

3123
02:18:09.251 --> 02:18:12.100
<v Speaker 1>but I have one at home that are 1:40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 60.</v>

3124
02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I keep my car and Just fucking you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially for your jujitsu though.</v>

3125
02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.870
<v Speaker 1>That develops naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3126
02:18:19.871 --> 02:18:21.310
<v Speaker 1>it does develop naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

3127
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:26.340
<v Speaker 1>That accentuates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely accentuates it and a hanging </v>

3128
02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:27.550
<v Speaker 1>hanging from your hands like from a chin</v>
<v Speaker 1>up bar.</v>

3129
02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:29.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might you do to get my gym?</v>

3130
02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:32.020

<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3131
02:18:32.021 --> 02:18:32.500
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3132
02:18:32.501 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 1>you got to hang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

3133
02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:38.820
<v Speaker 1>get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's literally hanging and it was like </v>

3134
02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's done for his joints has been </v>

3135
02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

3136
02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fish is.</v>

3137
02:18:41.931 --> 02:18:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

3138
02:18:43.151 --> 02:18:48.151
<v Speaker 1>That's another steve maxwell thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought up on this podcast about </v>

3139
02:18:48.151 --> 02:18:50.911
<v Speaker 1>being able to a loose in the shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and alleviate a lot of the </v>

3140
02:18:50.911 --> 02:18:51.850
<v Speaker 1>impingements through hanging and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were interested in this.</v>

3141
02:18:51.851 --> 02:18:52.630
<v Speaker 1>They're listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

3142
02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 1>if you Have a shoulder injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of videos of it online.</v>

3143
02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Have a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They explain it.</v>

3144
02:18:58.390 --> 02:19:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that I got into recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a bottoms up kettle bells.</v>

3145
02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You know like this is a kettlebell here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you.</v>

3146
02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you hold a kettle bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would hold it like this.</v>

3147
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:11.710
<v Speaker 1>When you hold it the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hold it like this,</v>

3148
02:19:11.770 --> 02:19:16.770
<v Speaker 1>you really have to show that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing like real stability in your </v>

3149
02:19:16.770 --> 02:19:21.481
<v Speaker 1>shoulders that you don't ordinarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like a stability because it's </v>

3150
02:19:21.481 --> 02:19:23.450
<v Speaker 1>not like it's hard to hold it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3151
02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:25.330
<v Speaker 1>like it's not the weight itself.</v>

3152
02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Not that hard to lift because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ironman kettlebell is only 40 </v>

3153
02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:34.301
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually talking about those </v>

3154
02:19:34.301 --> 02:19:34.301
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dope,</v>

3155
02:19:34.301 --> 02:19:34.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3158
02:19:35.741 --> 02:19:40.741
<v Speaker 1>The backseat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was telling us about it and she was </v>

3159
02:19:40.741 --> 02:19:40.741
<v Speaker 1>telling me she was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but bottoms up.</v>

3161
02:19:41.991 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Kettle bells doesn't have to be an iron </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3162
02:19:43.461 --> 02:19:48.461
<v Speaker 1>Any kind it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird it how hard it is to </v>

3163
02:19:48.461 --> 02:19:53.021
<v Speaker 1>bounce and in place and it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of those poses when you're on </v>

3164
02:19:53.021 --> 02:19:55.250
<v Speaker 1>your ball of your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Balancing on one leg.</v>

3165
02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strongest bodybuilder in the world.</v>

3166
02:19:58.100 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 1>not a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3167
02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:04.661
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked with how my feet would </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt when I first started getting into </v>

3168
02:20:04.661 --> 02:20:04.661
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3169
02:20:04.661 --> 02:20:05.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feet are fucking killing me.</v>

3170
02:20:05.391 --> 02:20:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Like when you do the standing bow pose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feet would be shaking.</v>

3171
02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

3172
02:20:10.071 --> 02:20:15.071
<v Speaker 1>It's such a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird little muscles that you don't </v>

3173
02:20:15.071 --> 02:20:15.071
<v Speaker 1>think you got to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well god,</v>

3174
02:20:15.071 --> 02:20:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I've been kicking things forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have to be strong.</v>

3175
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:21.340
<v Speaker 1>So back to that movement would do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movements stuff.</v>

3176
02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:26.350
<v Speaker 1>yes I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't because like where I was </v>

3177
02:20:26.350 --> 02:20:29.411
<v Speaker 1>saying about yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think you've made a really good </v>

3178
02:20:29.411 --> 02:20:31.931
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't do everything and that's </v>

3179
02:20:31.931 --> 02:20:31.931
<v Speaker 1>probably wind up doing too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to.</v>

3180
02:20:31.931 --> 02:20:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that there's something to </v>

3181
02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:38.950
<v Speaker 1>the ability to move your body and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that eddie bravo is </v>

3182
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:42.670
<v Speaker 1>brought up many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we have seen over the last few </v>

3183
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:47.110
<v Speaker 1>years is a break dancers who have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>into mma or gotten into jujitsu rather.</v>

3184
02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And they're fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to,</v>

3185
02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:51.890
<v Speaker 1>of edie's best students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3186
02:20:51.891 --> 02:20:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Richard Martinez and geo martinez are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking break dancers.</v>

3187
02:20:55.790 --> 02:20:59.370
<v Speaker 1>So these guys are ridiculously dexter </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3188
02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Their dexterity is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can stand on one hand and have </v>

3189
02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:06.320
<v Speaker 1>the other hand up in the air and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet are up and they spend,</v>

3190
02:21:06.321 --> 02:21:11.321
<v Speaker 1>they can spin on their head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable ability to move their </v>

3191
02:21:11.321 --> 02:21:14.621
<v Speaker 1>bodies and that translates directly into</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling and they learn so quick.</v>

3192
02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I had heard about these guys when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just starting.</v>

3193
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:18.290
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3194
02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:23.470
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been doing jujitsu for three </v>

3195
02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:23.470
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking choke.</v>

3196
02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3197
02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:23.470
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm telling you,</v>

3198
02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:28.271
<v Speaker 1>it's like just make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can move their body in a way that </v>

3199
02:21:28.271 --> 02:21:31.751
<v Speaker 1>you can't move your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I think there's mobility and the </v>

3200
02:21:31.751 --> 02:21:32.420
<v Speaker 1>ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3201
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:36.140
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to effectively manipulate your body in a</v>

3202
02:21:36.141 --> 02:21:39.650
<v Speaker 1>way that's alien to other people I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>has significant advantages.</v>

3203
02:21:39.651 --> 02:21:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think that comes from what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ido portal guys doing.</v>

3204
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:48.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think that comes from yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that comes from a lot of these </v>

3205
02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:51.791
<v Speaker 1>break dancers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a matter of like how much time </v>

3206
02:21:51.791 --> 02:21:53.360
<v Speaker 1>do you spend doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it something that you start doing</v>

3207
02:21:53.361 --> 02:21:55.520
<v Speaker 1>when you're 28,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're already professional fighter</v>

3208
02:21:55.521 --> 02:22:00.521
<v Speaker 1>as a world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it something you need to do when </v>

3209
02:22:00.521 --> 02:22:02.951
<v Speaker 1>you're 15 and you were a crazy kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking around in high school and you </v>

3210
02:22:02.951 --> 02:22:06.350
<v Speaker 1>get really good at it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate that ability to move your body</v>

3211
02:22:06.351 --> 02:22:10.370
<v Speaker 1>directly in this martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked noW as a 31 year old.</v>

3212
02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I look back now and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3213
02:22:12.141 --> 02:22:17.141
<v Speaker 1>what would I have done if I knew I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to end up as a professional </v>

3214
02:22:17.141 --> 02:22:17.141
<v Speaker 1>fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3215
02:22:17.141 --> 02:22:21.230
<v Speaker 1>what I've done from a young age in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to improve to where I was,</v>

3216
02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear your take on it.</v>

3217
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:24.800
<v Speaker 1>So what would you do as a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

3218
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:30.110
<v Speaker 1>One of my things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've done gymnastics from a young </v>

3219
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.110
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3220
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Great thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my other ones are dancing.</v>

3221
02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:33.120
<v Speaker 1>It's great thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3222
02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:38.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think chris brown is gonna </v>

3223
02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:38.300
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soulja boy told you.</v>

3224
02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the ability to move your body.</v>

3225
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:40.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to move it really well,</v>

3226
02:22:40.621 --> 02:22:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean I noticed that going from </v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo did jujitsu,</v>

3227
02:22:43.561 --> 02:22:45.780
<v Speaker 1>that I had great balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transferable skills.</v>

3228
02:22:45.781 --> 02:22:50.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're used to standing on one leg all </v>

3229
02:22:50.781 --> 02:22:52.971
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your ability to maintain that </v>

3230
02:22:52.971 --> 02:22:52.971
<v Speaker 1>position as much better than someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not.</v>

3231
02:22:52.971 --> 02:22:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And I noticed that even translating </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly into yoga,</v>

3232
02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:58.200
<v Speaker 1>but I think it depends on what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting you were trying to do.</v>

3233
02:22:58.470 --> 02:23:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Like if I wanted to get into mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I tell people is </v>

3234
02:23:03.470 --> 02:23:05.970
<v Speaker 1>that wrestling has probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important skill.</v>

3235
02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:09.600
<v Speaker 1>The ability to demonstrate the ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dictate where the fight takes place.</v>

3236
02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I agree that was a gigantic key to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>success of george st pierre and the </v>

3237
02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:18.531
<v Speaker 1>success of many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many fighters and also the success of </v>

3238
02:23:18.531 --> 02:23:19.230
<v Speaker 1>many strikers is there defensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

3239
02:23:19.231 --> 02:23:20.730
<v Speaker 1>their ability to keep the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing.</v>

3240
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:26.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you have the ability to take a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and you have the ability to make </v>

3241
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:30.201
<v Speaker 1>sure he doesn't take you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can better dictate where the </v>

3242
02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:30.660
<v Speaker 1>fight takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

3243
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:33.480
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's also a skill that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3244
02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:37.110
<v Speaker 1>that translates so incredibly well when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn it early in life,</v>

3245
02:23:37.470 --> 02:23:42.470
<v Speaker 1>but striking is the scariest shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking is also something that I think </v>

3246
02:23:44.551 --> 02:23:47.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a diminished effectiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning as you get older.</v>

3247
02:23:48.390 --> 02:23:51.240
<v Speaker 1>There's something about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people that didn't start doing</v>

3248
02:23:51.241 --> 02:23:56.241
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu until they're 30 and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop and they do love black belt </v>

3249
02:23:56.241 --> 02:23:56.241
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

3250
02:23:56.241 --> 02:23:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Russel peters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3251
02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:57.630
<v Speaker 1>the rest of this grades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He good.</v>

3252
02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Is he good at just starting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eats too much.</v>

3253
02:24:01.021 --> 02:24:02.800
<v Speaker 1>He drinks too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is beautiful.</v>

3254
02:24:02.801 --> 02:24:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3255
02:24:04.350 --> 02:24:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's training.</v>

3256
02:24:05.371 --> 02:24:07.250
<v Speaker 1>We train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

3257
02:24:07.310 --> 02:24:08.610
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets after a man,</v>

3258
02:24:08.611 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 1>he gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

3259
02:24:11.010 --> 02:24:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he.</v>

3260
02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Back to the question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you would want to do.</v>

3261
02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:22.110
<v Speaker 1>So with a kick boxer saying striking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3262
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I think footwork and movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the ability to get in and out.</v>

3263
02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:33.260
<v Speaker 1>You know like when you look at guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really good at not being there when </v>

3264
02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:37.740
<v Speaker 1>they're their opponent attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at like the guys who have </v>

3265
02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:41.550
<v Speaker 1>fantastic footwork and I think maybe if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be a striker,</v>

3266
02:24:41.551 --> 02:24:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I think really just working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying about your,</v>

3267
02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:47.280
<v Speaker 1>your training regimen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would essentially,</v>

3268
02:24:47.290 --> 02:24:49.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not running around doing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different things.</v>

3269
02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:54.020
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're focusing entirely on what you </v>

3270
02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:54.570
<v Speaker 1>will do in an actual fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you didn't do anything wrong.</v>

3271
02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you did it perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3272
02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeaH,</v>

3273
02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3274
02:24:57.961 --> 02:24:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think like you said,</v>

3275
02:24:59.371 --> 02:25:01.470
<v Speaker 1>people are doing way too much and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

3276
02:25:02.050 --> 02:25:02.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not.</v>

3277
02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Things have to have a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my strength training.</v>

3278
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 1>There's all these new tools and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>new fun things like,</v>

3279
02:25:11.761 --> 02:25:16.761
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this crazy exercise where I'm </v>

3280
02:25:16.761 --> 02:25:17.910
<v Speaker 1>doing a dead lift into a squat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into some shoulder press.</v>

3281
02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you deadlift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it really well,</v>

3282
02:25:21.330 --> 02:25:24.370
<v Speaker 1>and then why don't you squat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it well,</v>

3283
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:27.100
<v Speaker 3>and then why don't you shoulder press </v>
<v Speaker 3>and do it well in a safe,</v>

3284
02:25:27.101 --> 02:25:28.140
<v Speaker 3>proper manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

3285
02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:33.180
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be over complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think people are trying to </v>

3286
02:25:33.180 --> 02:25:36.181
<v Speaker 3>overcomplicate and that's what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes away from their success over </v>

3287
02:25:36.181 --> 02:25:40.441
<v Speaker 3>complicating things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when do you also agree that it </v>

3288
02:25:40.441 --> 02:25:41.350
<v Speaker 3>depends entirely upon the kind of body </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a person was born with.</v>

3289
02:25:41.370 --> 02:25:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Like some genetics is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3290
02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:47.860
<v Speaker 3>it's giant and it's sort of like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inescapable factor.</v>

3291
02:25:47.890 --> 02:25:50.260
<v Speaker 3>If someone has genetic advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3292
02:25:50.290 --> 02:25:51.430
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

3293
02:25:51.431 --> 02:25:56.431
<v Speaker 3>when they even say like power hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you can teach someone </v>

3294
02:25:56.431 --> 02:26:00.391
<v Speaker 3>to hit harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's just those naturally guys </v>

3295
02:26:00.391 --> 02:26:03.550
<v Speaker 3>who can just knock you out from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a natural hitting ability.</v>

3296
02:26:03.551 --> 02:26:07.120
<v Speaker 3>You can't teach someone to hit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>George Foreman know it just,</v>

3297
02:26:07.121 --> 02:26:12.121
<v Speaker 3>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much you turn your </v>

3298
02:26:12.121 --> 02:26:12.121
<v Speaker 3>shoulder and you put your hip into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not hitting them.</v>

3299
02:26:12.121 --> 02:26:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it crazy too that you can't tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>by looking at someone?</v>

3300
02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Like tHere's some people you would look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at them and they don't look like a big </v>

3301
02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:19.560
<v Speaker 3>puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were murderous.</v>

3302
02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:20.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

3303
02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:22.120
<v Speaker 3>you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those tall guys,</v>

3304
02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.420
<v Speaker 3>they have that stiffness in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a stiff power.</v>

3305
02:26:25.421 --> 02:26:28.360
<v Speaker 3>That's really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's like a stiff power,</v>

3306
02:26:28.361 --> 02:26:30.530
<v Speaker 3>but it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a mechanical advantage?</v>

3307
02:26:30.531 --> 02:26:35.531
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that leverage which also translate </v>

3308
02:26:35.531 --> 02:26:35.670
<v Speaker 3>to jujitsu to giant advantage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu,</v>

3309
02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:38.620
<v Speaker 3>to have long limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>

3310
02:26:38.621 --> 02:26:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I like you back to the long point </v>
<v Speaker 3>from before,</v>

3311
02:26:41.321 --> 02:26:45.520
<v Speaker 3>but I became my best as a martial artist</v>
<v Speaker 3>with color commentary.</v>

3312
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:48.820
<v Speaker 3>You have to know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to.</v>

3313
02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:54.540
<v Speaker 3>You have to watch a fight and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to assess instantly what's </v>

3314
02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:55.660
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they're doing it.</v>

3315
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:58.990
<v Speaker 3>You got to do it on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have time,</v>

3316
02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:01.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be able to pick things up</v>

3317
02:27:01.571 --> 02:27:04.270
<v Speaker 3>quickly and noW I'm at the point where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can look at someone.</v>

3318
02:27:04.271 --> 02:27:05.860
<v Speaker 3>as soon as they get into their stance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>

3319
02:27:05.861 --> 02:27:06.820
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do this,</v>

3320
02:27:06.821 --> 02:27:07.240
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3321
02:27:07.241 --> 02:27:07.960
<v Speaker 3>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3322
02:27:07.961 --> 02:27:12.961
<v Speaker 3>it's funny too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you can tell when a guy is gonna </v>

3323
02:27:12.961 --> 02:27:12.961
<v Speaker 3>kick go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here comes a right kick.</v>

3324
02:27:12.961 --> 02:27:13.480
<v Speaker 3>You just see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the back,</v>

3325
02:27:13.481 --> 02:27:15.850
<v Speaker 3>he'll come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see them leaning a little bit,</v>

3326
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:21.030
<v Speaker 3>or especially when the guy's got spin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the big giveaway and I see that </v>

3327
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:22.820
<v Speaker 3>left hip turn a little steps that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bad.</v>

3328
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see it.</v>

3329
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:25.140
<v Speaker 3>You can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you think?</v>

3330
02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Would you be a good coach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was invested in it,</v>

3331
02:27:28.650 --> 02:27:30.850
<v Speaker 3>I would be the best coach that I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be for sure.</v>

3332
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:35.950
<v Speaker 3>But do you think one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 3>I stoPped teaching when I started doing </v>

3333
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:39.361
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy because I wasn't being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very good teacher anymore just because </v>

3334
02:27:39.361 --> 02:27:39.361
<v Speaker 3>he didn't put the time and the effort </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>

3335
02:27:39.361 --> 02:27:42.100
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't where my head was at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My head was now I was,</v>

3336
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:43.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no,</v>

3337
02:27:43.901 --> 02:27:45.610
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no money in fighting.</v>

3338
02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:49.450
<v Speaker 3>When I was fighting there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so unless you were a boxer,</v>

3339
02:27:49.451 --> 02:27:51.910
<v Speaker 3>you weren't gonna make any money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was before fear factor?</v>

3340
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way before.</v>

3341
02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:58.350
<v Speaker 3>So there was essentially no way to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a career other than teaching.</v>

3342
02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:00.970
<v Speaker 3>And so when I started getting into </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy,</v>

3343
02:28:00.971 --> 02:28:05.971
<v Speaker 3>I realized like I got talked into it by </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys I train with and when I started </v>

3344
02:28:05.971 --> 02:28:07.090
<v Speaker 3>doing I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wow,</v>

3345
02:28:07.091 --> 02:28:09.820
<v Speaker 3>like I could make a living doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is actually,</v>

3346
02:28:09.821 --> 02:28:14.821
<v Speaker 3>there's a real path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's guys that I know that make </v>

3347
02:28:14.821 --> 02:28:17.311
<v Speaker 3>a living doing this where everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know that's fighting is broke or </v>

3348
02:28:17.311 --> 02:28:20.071
<v Speaker 3>they're slurring their words like guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the gym that would be in gym wars </v>

3349
02:28:20.071 --> 02:28:20.071
<v Speaker 3>all the time and now they're all fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3350
02:28:20.071 --> 02:28:21.650
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to know where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>parked their car.</v>

3351
02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 3>There</v>

3352
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.350
<v Speaker 1>was a lot of that shit that was scaring </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out of me.</v>

3353
02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:29.680
<v Speaker 1>So when I started getting into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit teaching and I suffered </v>

3354
02:28:30.201 --> 02:28:35.201
<v Speaker 1>financially because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would rather do that at the time </v>

3355
02:28:35.201 --> 02:28:38.200
<v Speaker 1>my mind was I would rather suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially then give anybody a </v>

3356
02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.150
<v Speaker 1>halfassed coaching job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3357
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:44.910
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So coaching mma I think is one of the </v>

3358
02:28:44.910 --> 02:28:46.860
<v Speaker 1>most difficult things in all sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3359
02:28:46.970 --> 02:28:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure coach and kickboxing is </v>

3360
02:28:51.970 --> 02:28:54.131
<v Speaker 1>probably very similar in that regard in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're so invested in your </v>

3361
02:28:54.131 --> 02:28:54.131
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much.</v>

3362
02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3363
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:56.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3364
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do.</v>

3365
02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:02.420
<v Speaker 1>You can train them as much as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to let them go when they get</v>

3366
02:29:02.421 --> 02:29:04.230
<v Speaker 1>into that ring or get into that cage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3367
02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:07.340
<v Speaker 1>you know and hope that it all comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3368
02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:12.080
<v Speaker 1>But the other problem I find with mma is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of coaches,</v>

3369
02:29:12.081 --> 02:29:16.250
<v Speaker 1>there's too many coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find you have a lot of these guys have</v>

3370
02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:19.220
<v Speaker 1>a boxing coach that's telling him to box</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain way.</v>

3371
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3372
02:29:20.901 --> 02:29:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I got to do more now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have a moy coach,</v>

3373
02:29:23.251 --> 02:29:26.000
<v Speaker 1>coaches now telling them to do more tie </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

3374
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3375
02:29:27.261 --> 02:29:30.140
<v Speaker 1>we got to do spinning shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's deal with here.</v>

3376
02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So now all of a sudden you have three </v>
<v Speaker 1>different coaches all telling you to do </v>

3377
02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:35.380
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3378
02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:37.340
<v Speaker 1>So now this poor fighter is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ring.</v>

3379
02:29:37.341 --> 02:29:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not know.</v>

3380
02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:40.520
<v Speaker 1>You might know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm all of them,</v>

3381
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get confused.</v>

3382
02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:44.210
<v Speaker 1>That's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3383
02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:49.240
<v Speaker 1>basics are important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't think you should </v>

3384
02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:50.570
<v Speaker 1>overcomplicate shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know if you're going to jab,</v>

3385
02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I know how I'm going to do it.</v>

3386
02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to sit and be like,</v>

3387
02:29:53.181 --> 02:29:54.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I compare it.</v>

3388
02:29:54.351 --> 02:29:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I know I can slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I can time with the local.</v>

3389
02:29:56.930 --> 02:30:00.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to know and I think with too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

3390
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:06.070
<v Speaker 1>too many coaches are complicating shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>for these guys where they think they </v>

3391
02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:11.831
<v Speaker 1>have to hit all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're going all these different </v>

3392
02:30:11.831 --> 02:30:13.800
<v Speaker 1>coaches and it's way over complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who do you listen to?</v>

3393
02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:15.800
<v Speaker 1>How do you listen to which way's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right way?</v>

3394
02:30:15.801 --> 02:30:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Which ones are wrong with my boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach is telling me to turn my heel out.</v>

3395
02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:22.610
<v Speaker 1>My kickboxing coach is telling me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep my front foot pointing forward,</v>

3396
02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:27.760
<v Speaker 1>which is the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point and I think that's </v>

3397
02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:28.790
<v Speaker 1>where guys like matt hume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like for us a hobby.</v>

3398
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:34.030
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so important to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because their overall mma coaches and </v>

3399
02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:38.441
<v Speaker 1>also I think what's really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>about guys like matt and for us is that </v>

3400
02:30:38.441 --> 02:30:41.621
<v Speaker 1>both of those guys are highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished martial artists in all </v>

3401
02:30:41.621 --> 02:30:45.011
<v Speaker 1>disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they really know how to put it all </v>

3402
02:30:45.011 --> 02:30:47.261
<v Speaker 1>together like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a black belt in jujitsu and outstanding </v>

3403
02:30:47.261 --> 02:30:50.291
<v Speaker 1>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he knows how to combine all those </v>

3404
02:30:50.291 --> 02:30:50.291
<v Speaker 1>things together.</v>

3405
02:30:50.291 --> 02:30:51.560
<v Speaker 1>That's so critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was probablY the same way.</v>

3406
02:30:52.250 --> 02:30:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

3407
02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:58.840
<v Speaker 1>there's maybe a dozen of them on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and that's a problem if you're </v>

3408
02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:01.700
<v Speaker 1>not near any of those and you start out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone and then that coach becomes</v>

3409
02:31:01.701 --> 02:31:03.440
<v Speaker 1>like a mentor figure to you and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

3410
02:31:03.441 --> 02:31:08.441
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my coach is kind of limited in a lot of </v>

3411
02:31:08.441 --> 02:31:11.441
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to separate </v>

3412
02:31:11.441 --> 02:31:11.441
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see that.</v>

3413
02:31:11.441 --> 02:31:11.441
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of,</v>

3414
02:31:11.441 --> 02:31:15.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't be a fighter who you put all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your trust into this man to help you </v>

3415
02:31:15.730 --> 02:31:16.070
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden you're like,</v>

3416
02:31:16.071 --> 02:31:17.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's lacking thing.</v>

3417
02:31:17.810 --> 02:31:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3418
02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:22.830
<v Speaker 1>with mitch gagnon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came to me and he was like,</v>

3419
02:31:23.010 --> 02:31:26.220
<v Speaker 1>he had a guy working with them all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I was just kinda like,</v>

3420
02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I go to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3421
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>his friend who asked me to help him with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his striking was like,</v>

3422
02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can help this guy.</v>

3423
02:31:32.730 --> 02:31:36.510
<v Speaker 1>He's just so bad technically at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where I'm like,</v>

3424
02:31:36.511 --> 02:31:39.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of work I have to do to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of fix and clean things up.</v>

3425
02:31:39.961 --> 02:31:44.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was so good at just being a beast</v>

3426
02:31:44.551 --> 02:31:49.551
<v Speaker 1>and not caring that he was successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I showed him my way of putting </v>

3427
02:31:49.551 --> 02:31:49.551
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3428
02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 1>ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I learned this earlier.</v>

3429
02:31:51.961 --> 02:31:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had this.</v>

3430
02:31:53.371 --> 02:31:58.371
<v Speaker 1>And then there was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can kind of get angry </v>

3431
02:31:58.371 --> 02:32:00.921
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my why did I waste like so many </v>

3432
02:32:00.921 --> 02:32:03.081
<v Speaker 1>years with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is the way it should've been </v>

3433
02:32:03.081 --> 02:32:03.081
<v Speaker 1>done from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3434
02:32:03.081 --> 02:32:07.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously people are limited </v>

3435
02:32:07.311 --> 02:32:07.311
<v Speaker 1>geographically as far as like having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good coach near them.</v>

3436
02:32:07.311 --> 02:32:11.751
<v Speaker 1>But I urge anybody listening to this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put the research in before you join a </v>

3437
02:32:11.751 --> 02:32:14.220
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much harder to unlearn something</v>

3438
02:32:14.221 --> 02:32:15.090
<v Speaker 1>than it is to learn it.</v>

3439
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:17.610
<v Speaker 1>So when you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that I would deal</v>

3440
02:32:17.611 --> 02:32:21.570
<v Speaker 1>with in teaching taekwondo is guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from other martial arts that didn't</v>

3441
02:32:21.571 --> 02:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>know how to do certain things correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

3442
02:32:24.431 --> 02:32:27.990
<v Speaker 1>their knees would be down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't lift the knee above the hip.</v>

3443
02:32:27.991 --> 02:32:31.380
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get real power in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never worked with a kicking bag.</v>

3444
02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:34.980
<v Speaker 1>They never worked with a heavy bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd just done stuff in the air and so</v>

3445
02:32:34.981 --> 02:32:38.340
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd have to try to reteach them</v>

3446
02:32:38.341 --> 02:32:40.410
<v Speaker 1>and like they did when they would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired,</v>

3447
02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:42.000
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot up,</v>

3448
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:43.710
<v Speaker 1>knee down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything be all screwed up.</v>

3449
02:32:43.711 --> 02:32:44.090
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3450
02:32:44.091 --> 02:32:44.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3451
02:32:44.231 --> 02:32:44.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go.</v>

3452
02:32:44.971 --> 02:32:49.971
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stick to the proper </v>

3453
02:32:49.971 --> 02:32:52.281
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you would fall into what you </v>

3454
02:32:52.281 --> 02:32:52.281
<v Speaker 1>learned first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3455
02:32:52.281 --> 02:32:52.281
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

3456
02:32:52.281 --> 02:32:52.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

3457
02:32:52.771 --> 02:32:56.400
<v Speaker 1>And you always want to trust that Person</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't.</v>

3458
02:32:56.401 --> 02:32:58.860
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of the fighters.</v>

3459
02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence comes from their coach.</v>

3460
02:33:01.890 --> 02:33:02.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

3461
02:33:02.941 --> 02:33:04.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard.</v>

3462
02:33:04.951 --> 02:33:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find that balance and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

3463
02:33:07.501 --> 02:33:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that coach where you like them.</v>

3464
02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3465
02:33:10.901 --> 02:33:13.800
<v Speaker 1>that's hard too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were to have an mma fight,</v>

3466
02:33:13.801 --> 02:33:15.600
<v Speaker 1>where would you go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

3467
02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that putting you on the spot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3468
02:33:17.610 --> 02:33:19.500
<v Speaker 1>but I think those guys that you talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

3469
02:33:21.010 --> 02:33:24.300
<v Speaker 1>matt hume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two guys are in my opinion,</v>

3470
02:33:24.330 --> 02:33:25.590
<v Speaker 1>like cream of the crop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>duke,</v>

3471
02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:26.640
<v Speaker 1>duke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roufus,</v>

3472
02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:32.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd have to have someone also </v>

3473
02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that sees what you do well and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3474
02:33:32.461 --> 02:33:35.250
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously your primary base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really good at this.</v>

3475
02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:40.280
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's work on all these other aspects </v>

3476
02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:40.280
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

3477
02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:43.610
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to try and take this </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from you and turn you into a </v>

3478
02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:43.610
<v Speaker 1>wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3479
02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:43.710
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to fight a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real fucked up.</v>

3480
02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3481
02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

3482
02:33:46.011 --> 02:33:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's such a creative approach because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're creating a fighter.</v>

3483
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:56.000
<v Speaker 1>When you take someone and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're putting all the tools together </v>

3484
02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:56.430
<v Speaker 1>and you're helping them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping mold them,</v>

3485
02:33:56.700 --> 02:34:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but then it's also up to them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up to them to be improvisational </v>

3486
02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:06.231
<v Speaker 1>inside the ring or the octagon and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to put those things </v>

3487
02:34:06.231 --> 02:34:08.100
<v Speaker 1>together and everyone's got their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>little style or own their own approach,</v>

3488
02:34:08.130 --> 02:34:09.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

3489
02:34:09.511 --> 02:34:14.511
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the differences like I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because I do something differently </v>

3490
02:34:14.581 --> 02:34:17.200
<v Speaker 1>than someone else doesn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean they're way is the wrong way.</v>

3491
02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3492
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Of course I'm going to believe my system</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the best system in the way,</v>

3493
02:34:21.941 --> 02:34:26.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's not to say it's the only way </v>
<v Speaker 3>now there is no only way and that's what</v>

3494
02:34:26.891 --> 02:34:31.891
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be open to know that </v>

3495
02:34:31.891 --> 02:34:34.561
<v Speaker 3>there's other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I've been touching </v>

3496
02:34:34.561 --> 02:34:34.840
<v Speaker 3>around on the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you read the book of five rings?</v>

3497
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he talks about you have to know your</v>

3498
02:34:37.061 --> 02:34:42.061
<v Speaker 3>weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to know other arts in order to </v>

3499
02:34:42.061 --> 02:34:42.280
<v Speaker 3>make your art and style the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's musashi.</v>

3500
02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:45.310
<v Speaker 3>That's my tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been reading it.</v>

3501
02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I could only read one page at a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm like,</v>

3502
02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:49.510
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to sit there,</v>

3503
02:34:49.511 --> 02:34:51.590
<v Speaker 3>I got to reflect on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3504
02:34:51.610 --> 02:34:53.710
<v Speaker 3>he was a deep dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he killed 60 people.</v>

3505
02:34:53.711 --> 02:34:57.350
<v Speaker 3>It's one on one combat me and multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>musashi,</v>

3506
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:58.600
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest samurais ever.</v>

3507
02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:00.960
<v Speaker 3>And during a weird phase in history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3508
02:35:00.970 --> 02:35:05.970
<v Speaker 3>he was a ronan traveling around just </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in sword fights crazy and doing </v>

3509
02:35:06.071 --> 02:35:11.071
<v Speaker 3>calligraphy and art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He opened my mind to this idea that you </v>

3510
02:35:11.071 --> 02:35:13.030
<v Speaker 3>have to be balanced in order to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective in combat.</v>

3511
02:35:13.031 --> 02:35:14.830
<v Speaker 3>You can't have any holes in your mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

3512
02:35:14.831 --> 02:35:19.831
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways to not have holes in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mental game was that he would </v>

3513
02:35:19.831 --> 02:35:22.150
<v Speaker 3>approach everything as like art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you did,</v>

3514
02:35:22.151 --> 02:35:24.970
<v Speaker 3>whether you were writing your name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you were a,</v>

3515
02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>filling out a form,</v>

3516
02:35:26.441 --> 02:35:27.600
<v Speaker 3>driving your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

3517
02:35:27.730 --> 02:35:30.670
<v Speaker 3>no cars back then obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But everything that you did,</v>

3518
02:35:30.671 --> 02:35:33.060
<v Speaker 3>you would do with excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3519
02:35:33.650 --> 02:35:34.930
<v Speaker 3>It was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3520
02:35:34.931 --> 02:35:36.350
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

3521
02:35:36.380 --> 02:35:41.380
<v Speaker 3>And it gets deep and talk about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at it and you can look at </v>

3522
02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:41.500
<v Speaker 3>yourself sometimes and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>

3523
02:35:41.501 --> 02:35:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm the modern day of some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories he does.</v>

3524
02:35:43.810 --> 02:35:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Like I did that in a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3525
02:35:46.241 --> 02:35:48.580
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's really cool for me to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see and read.</v>

3526
02:35:48.850 --> 02:35:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it translates,</v>

3527
02:35:50.201 --> 02:35:55.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy lived that life and then it's </v>

3528
02:35:55.201 --> 02:35:55.201
<v Speaker 3>just a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3529
02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:59.710
<v Speaker 3>And then sat down and try to relay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that he had accumulated over</v>

3530
02:35:59.711 --> 02:36:04.711
<v Speaker 3>this life of fucking people up at sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a random question I'd asked you </v>

3531
02:36:04.711 --> 02:36:06.120
<v Speaker 3>to fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True or false.</v>

3532
02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Was it a real story that you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight wesley snipes?</v>

3533
02:36:09.310 --> 02:36:11.660
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a.</v>

3534
02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Because I always wanted to know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3535
02:36:13.151 --> 02:36:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was ever a story.</v>

3536
02:36:14.350 --> 02:36:15.910
<v Speaker 3>One of the original producers of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ufc,</v>

3537
02:36:15.911 --> 02:36:17.680
<v Speaker 3>campbell mclaren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a buddy of mine.</v>

3538
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a reality show with them.</v>

3539
02:36:20.010 --> 02:36:22.330
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a combat this America.</v>

3540
02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:25.060

<v Speaker 3>I was a guest coach on it.</v>

3541
02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still doing that show.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was cool because one of the guys </v>

3544
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.510
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3545
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:34.570

3550
02:36:43.921 --> 02:36:44.530
<v Speaker 3>wesley snipes had tax problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was about.</v>

02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:45.550
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to deal with.</v>

3552
02:36:45.551 --> 02:36:48.510
<v Speaker 3>If I was gonna yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would it have been a ufc sanctioned?</v>

<v Speaker 3>a good kicker.</v>

3560
02:37:02.051 --> 02:37:07.051
<v Speaker 3>Like you could tell like when you throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches and kicks and he knew how to </v>

3561
02:37:07.051 --> 02:37:07.051
<v Speaker 3>execute techniques but he'd never </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an addictive personality and I </v>

3585
02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.281
<v Speaker 3>try to avoid all things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative or waste time that can be </v>

3586
02:38:00.281 --> 02:38:01.450
<v Speaker 3>addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3587
02:38:01.730 --> 02:38:02.240
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3588
02:38:02.241 --> 02:38:03.650
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to know that.</v>

3589
02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:06.140
<v Speaker 3>You know what's crazy too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've worked at,</v>

3590
02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:11.420
<v Speaker 3>because I worked with kids with special </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs and I work a lot with autism and I</v>

3591
02:38:11.421 --> 02:38:12.890
<v Speaker 3>realized and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3592
02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:18.010
<v Speaker 3>these kids like just so obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things in routine and then I </v>

3593
02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:22.391
<v Speaker 3>started looking at other people in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and think maybe we all have that </v>

3594
02:38:22.391 --> 02:38:22.910
<v Speaker 3>little bit of that autistic traits in </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

3595
02:38:22.911 --> 02:38:24.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have to be obsessed.</v>

3596
02:38:24.591 --> 02:38:27.290
<v Speaker 3>For me to be a world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to be obsessed with training.</v>

3597
02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:30.050
<v Speaker 3>You can't just do it and be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as these,</v>

3598
02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:33.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people living with autism,</v>

3599
02:38:33.321 --> 02:38:35.690
<v Speaker 3>they're just so obsessed with that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3600
02:38:35.691 --> 02:38:40.691
<v Speaker 3>Like I have students who are so obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with like the train system and then all </v>

3601
02:38:40.691 --> 02:38:41.030
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden they can't think of anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

3602
02:38:41.031 --> 02:38:46.031
<v Speaker 3>but the train system you can try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you anywhere how to get in </v>

3603
02:38:46.031 --> 02:38:46.100
<v Speaker 3>toronto.</v>

3604
02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:51.100
<v Speaker 3>They'll tell you which bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which way the most intelligent people </v>

3605
02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:52.280
<v Speaker 3>you've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you ask them a simple question,</v>

3606
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:54.080
<v Speaker 3>they won't know it because they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care.</v>

3607
02:38:54.081 --> 02:38:59.081
<v Speaker 3>They're mind is so focused on one thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and autism is just beautiful and crazy </v>

3608
02:38:59.081 --> 02:39:01.280
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's beautiful to see someone so</v>

3609
02:39:01.281 --> 02:39:04.610
<v Speaker 3>obsessed and not caring about other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and what they're focused on.</v>

3610
02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:06.830
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work well in society </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

3611
02:39:06.831 --> 02:39:09.740
<v Speaker 3>but there are so absorbed in it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think back and I was like,</v>

3612
02:39:09.741 --> 02:39:14.741
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of us have these personalities to </v>

3613
02:39:14.741 --> 02:39:14.900
<v Speaker 3>be able to be so obsessed and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>routine.</v>

3614
02:39:14.901 --> 02:39:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Like these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these individuals with autism have to do</v>

3615
02:39:18.381 --> 02:39:20.750
<v Speaker 3>everything in a particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain time,</v>

3616
02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:24.350
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of ocd in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to be successful and things,</v>

3617
02:39:24.351 --> 02:39:26.360
<v Speaker 3>you kind of have to have that little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of personality.</v>

3618
02:39:26.570 --> 02:39:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can make incredible progress </v>

3619
02:39:31.570 --> 02:39:33.200
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the things that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those people are recruited by silicon</v>

3620
02:39:33.201 --> 02:39:38.201
<v Speaker 3>valley companies like specifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>recruited because they know that they </v>

3621
02:39:38.201 --> 02:39:41.741
<v Speaker 3>can achieve some incredible feats of </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

3622
02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3623
02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:46.820
<v Speaker 3>I have a student at my school that </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably knows ufc more than you.</v>

3624
02:39:47.490 --> 02:39:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Like he's literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3625
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3626
02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Every fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every name,</v>

3627
02:39:52.311 --> 02:39:54.260
<v Speaker 3>where they're from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do,</v>

3628
02:39:54.261 --> 02:39:55.460
<v Speaker 3>what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

3629
02:39:55.461 --> 02:39:57.470
<v Speaker 3>he knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any fighter,</v>

3630
02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:01.700
<v Speaker 3>any fighter you can ask him from one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a guy talked to me about this once</v>

3631
02:40:01.701 --> 02:40:06.701
<v Speaker 3>and he argued that it's potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an evolutionary trait and what </v>

3632
02:40:06.701 --> 02:40:07.370
<v Speaker 3>we're watching is the next level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human intelligence.</v>

3633
02:40:07.371 --> 02:40:12.371
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing it and like blips and leaps</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a non reliance on emotion and that </v>

3634
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:14.340
<v Speaker 3>is also,</v>

3635
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:16.920
<v Speaker 1>he believes that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3636
02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are interacting more with </v>

3637
02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:23.991
<v Speaker 1>computers and ever before and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting less with people and a lot </v>

3638
02:40:23.991 --> 02:40:27.741
<v Speaker 1>of circumstances and he thinks that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing is this eventual </v>

3639
02:40:27.741 --> 02:40:31.230
<v Speaker 1>transition between humans now and humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the future.</v>

3640
02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It's things have changed.</v>
