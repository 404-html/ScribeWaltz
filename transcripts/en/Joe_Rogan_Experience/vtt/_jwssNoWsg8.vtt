<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:44.690
<v Speaker 2>fucking sky net.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

69
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 2>we haven't even got into it yet.</v>

70
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 2>You haven't even started talking.</v>

71
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 2>I offered you,</v>

72
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I gave you the opportunity to wipe your workout,</v>

73
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 2>stink all over myself.</v>

74
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And Joe actually went for it.</v>

75
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty fucking girls.</v>

76
00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 2>He's sweating,</v>

77
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>put me in a cinder block in his driveway and was like,</v>

78
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

79
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 2>absorb my essence.</v>

80
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to Jujitsu,</v>

81
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.111
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

82
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to do sweating on me.</v>

83
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.923
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

84
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I came out all sweaty cause I was hitting the bag and uh,</v>

85
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.071
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

86
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.731
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a hug.</v>

87
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.331
<v Speaker 1>But he goes,</v>

88
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:12.481
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

89
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

90
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.381
<v Speaker 1>I'll go.</v>

91
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:14.214
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

92
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.183
<v Speaker 2>He panicked.</v>

93
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

94
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I ran,</v>

95
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.313
<v Speaker 2>I ran for the no one,</v>

96
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 2>none of this first.</v>

97
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.380
<v Speaker 2>The first time I moved out here,</v>

98
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 2>the first time I went everyday to Joe's house,</v>

99
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 2>he was working out with his friend Eddie and he answered the door.</v>

100
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 2>And this is when he was like insane boys.</v>

101
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Still,</v>

102
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 2>you're probably more now,</v>

103
00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 2>but you were insanely ripped and Eddie and you both came into our sweaty as hell</v>

104
00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 2>and did the same thing and gave the man hug and totally different weight lifting</v>

105
00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

106
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 2>more bodybuilding muscle back then,</v>

107
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't as strong.</v>

108
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:40.531
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

109
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So your description sounded like a little bit of slash fiction there for a</v>

110
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

111
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Slash.</v>

112
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.943
<v Speaker 2>Fiction.</v>

113
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 2>He writes the story.</v>

114
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:46.421
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

115
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Joe came out of the garage and son was glistening off his hips.</v>

116
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 2>His nipples were protruding out of his ass.</v>

117
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Ain't no sense in this lab called slash fiction.</v>

118
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

119
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole like subset of fiction.</v>

120
00:02:55.901 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 2>People who write like sexual fiction about like star trek really kicked it off.</v>

121
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:01.410
<v Speaker 2>There's one that,</v>

122
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

123
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Betty.</v>

124
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.153
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

125
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is that there's a whole genre of like fiction pornography</v>

126
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 2>about famous people or like it's fantasy towards,</v>

127
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 2>there's probably care bear slash fiction out there.</v>

128
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.551
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

130
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there is.</v>

131
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I probably wrote some of it.</v>

132
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Cow fucking weird.</v>

133
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:20.081
<v Speaker 2>Are People,</v>

134
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:20.914
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

135
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 2>that they have like sexuality intertwined into their hobbies and their,</v>

136
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.771
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

137
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

138
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

139
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 2>their fetishes and they're,</v>

140
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>they're weird TV shows.</v>

141
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 2>They're into this podcast brought to you by fleshlight.</v>

142
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>How is it to have sexuality intertwined into everything?</v>

143
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

144
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>but that's just something to jerk often too.</v>

145
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

146
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 2>everybody George's off and all the fleshlight is a technological improvement on</v>

147
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:43.811
<v Speaker 2>jerking off.</v>

148
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:46.500

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Is it annoying to you being a real geek?</v>

292
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:53.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

293
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.141
<v Speaker 2>somewhat.</v>

294
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Someone out there thinks I'm as fake as like as they come as well.</v>

295
00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's all relative.</v>

296
00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm a geek as well.</v>

297
00:07:58.821 --> 00:07:59.421
<v Speaker 2>And when I say this,</v>

298
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:00.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying like,</v>

299
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a mean person calls on a geek,</v>

301
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

302
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:03.854
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

303
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>

304
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 2>an undereducated Geek.</v>

305
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say I'm a fakey can,</v>

306
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know how anything works.</v>

307
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.281
<v Speaker 2>You put into it all,</v>

308
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.114
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how it works.</v>

309
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 2>You put.net instead of.tv by the way,</v>

310
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.501
<v Speaker 2>on your link.</v>

311
00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 2>So everyone was freaking out on Twitter.</v>

312
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

313
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

314
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.323
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

315
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:17.911
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>

316
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:18.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll retweet that.</v>

317
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Should we live?</v>

318
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Is this live?</v>

319
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>

320
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 2>what was the video?</v>

321
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever say what the video was that you,</v>

322
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 2>we want to get into that?</v>

323
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just too gross.</v>

324
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

325
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:28.971
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

326
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>it's dark.</v>

327
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking dark.</v>

328
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:30.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

329
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:31.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

330
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason it rocked me.</v>

331
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

332
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.600
<v Speaker 2>there was a reddit post on people that are making knock off ugg boots and China</v>

333
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 2>and they said that there's these entire factories where they're just cutting up</v>

334
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 2>dogs while they're alive.</v>

335
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Just skinning dogs alive and taking that for processing it up and serving out</v>

336
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:49.131
<v Speaker 2>there as an Ugg boot.</v>

337
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:49.491
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

338
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

339
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

340
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

341
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I used to click on this stuff and I used to,</v>

342
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.173
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

343
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.280
<v Speaker 2>He used to pride myself on separating the,</v>

344
00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>these are just pixels</v>

345
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.491
<v Speaker 4>on a screen.</v>

346
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 4>These are ones and Zeros.</v>

347
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 4>This isn't real.</v>

348
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 4>There's no emotion here.</v>

349
00:08:58.861 --> 00:08:59.694
<v Speaker 4>There's now an,</v>

350
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I was so desensitized from those,</v>

351
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 4>those early days and I was like,</v>

352
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.421
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

353
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.021
<v Speaker 4>Let's see this video.</v>

354
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what this world really is.</v>

355
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 4>And it just shattered me.</v>

356
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 4>It ruined my whole fucking day.</v>

357
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.091
<v Speaker 4>It's ruined my week.</v>

358
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 4>It's still like in my head,</v>

359
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:11.900
<v Speaker 4>which you know what,</v>

360
00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 4>like good cause at least now I'm talking about it.</v>

361
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:14.521
<v Speaker 4>It was a graphic,</v>

362
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:14.971
<v Speaker 4>terrible thing,</v>

363
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know they do that.</v>

364
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 4>I know they skin fucking dogs alive to make knock off ugg boots</v>

365
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

366
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to watch.</v>

367
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:22.501
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

368
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to watch any of those skinning videos.</v>

370
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Those are horrific because they show the bodies and they're still alive.</v>

371
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>They don't even bother killing him.</v>

372
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

373
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.053
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

374
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>they don't kill him first.</v>

375
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>They skin them while they're still breathing and they feel everything and it's</v>

376
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.131
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

377
00:09:36.131 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So insensitive.</v>

378
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:37.231
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

379
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:38.011
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother them.</v>

380
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Even the slightest.</v>

381
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 1>There's like levels of humanity and people dipped down to,</v>

382
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>that's very disturbing.</v>

383
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure you've seen the,</v>

384
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 1>the dolphin decks in Japan where they have dolphins laid on a deck,</v>

385
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>50 60 dolphins,</v>

386
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>and they just slice their throats.</v>

387
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 1>They pull them out of the water and they sliced their throats and it is</v>

388
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.730
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>

389
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.481
<v Speaker 4>How else should the,</v>

390
00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

391
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.040
<v Speaker 4>I had to play devil's advocate.</v>

392
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.170
<v Speaker 4>How else are they supposed to do their scientific research?</v>

393
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

394
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.603
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

395
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:03.920
<v Speaker 4>She fucking,</v>

396
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.790
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking terrible,</v>

397
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.161
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

398
00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:07.090
<v Speaker 1>He can't shoot him in the head.</v>

399
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:07.924
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to kill him,</v>

400
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't shoot him in the head.</v>

401
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.701
<v Speaker 1>You've got to do it.</v>

402
00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:09.941
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

403
00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you should kill him.</v>

404
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:11.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

405
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a first for killing them,</v>

406
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:14.680
<v Speaker 1>but how horrific is it that they do,</v>

407
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.690
<v Speaker 1>the way they choose to do it is to bleed them out.</v>

408
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.990
<v Speaker 4>But you're asking for like an ounce of humanity and some of the most inhumane</v>

409
00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:20.824
<v Speaker 4>acts,</v>

410
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.073
<v Speaker 4>and that's like,</v>

411
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 4>that's okay to ask for what's okay to ask for.</v>

412
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

413
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 1>it's really disturbing.</v>

414
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:26.611
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

415
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>But what is it that allows some folks to go to a place?</v>

416
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Is it necessity?</v>

417
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

418
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:37.161
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is it that allows people to not give even one shit about a dolphin</v>

419
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>or a dog they make boots out of,</v>

420
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>or anybody,</v>

421
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 4>because they don't see the dolphin or the dog.</v>

422
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 4>They see their survival and their family's survival.</v>

423
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.370
<v Speaker 4>That's all they see.</v>

424
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.203
<v Speaker 4>It's a necessity.</v>

425
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.351
<v Speaker 4>It's a gotta be in it.</v>

426
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:47.184
<v Speaker 4>So it must be right.</v>

427
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.461
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

428
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 4>if you had a choice of doing a podcast every day or slitting dolphins throats,</v>

429
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 4>you would do a podcast every day.</v>

430
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 4>This person doesn't have that choice,</v>

431
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:57.450
<v Speaker 4>or they at least they don't feel like they have that choice.</v>

432
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine if they had that,</v>

433
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 4>if some dudes out there was like,</v>

434
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.811
<v Speaker 4>oh dude,</v>

435
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:00.991
<v Speaker 4>sweet,</v>

436
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:01.381
<v Speaker 4>I get to,</v>

437
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 4>I get to skin a fucking gray hound today.</v>

438
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Can't wait and I'm going to punch some rabbits in the face before I get home.</v>

439
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 4>If someone's really thinking that I don't,</v>

440
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

441
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to wrap my head around.</v>

442
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.323
<v Speaker 4>Of course they are.</v>

443
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.100
<v Speaker 4>There's people,</v>

444
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.370
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

445
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 4>there's dark people,</v>

446
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.051
<v Speaker 4>no doubt about it.</v>

447
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 4>I know that there are people that do that,</v>

448
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 4>but I mean systematically for hundreds of thousands of workers to do that.</v>

449
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to believe that that's there at it.</v>

450
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I've watched videos of people beating cows when they work with in the</v>

451
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>slaughterhouse and they're hitting cows with hammers.</v>

452
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Well that just makes them tastier.</v>

453
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.091
<v Speaker 4>That's pure.</v>

454
00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 4>That's pre tenderization.</v>

455
00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Just I went to the city pound today and have you ever been to a city pound?</v>

456
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.170
<v Speaker 4>Like I killed her own dogs from pounds?</v>

457
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

458
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.990
<v Speaker 4>the dog.</v>

459
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.611
<v Speaker 4>Squeaky member.</v>

460
00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:36.970
<v Speaker 4>Squeaky.</v>

461
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

462
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how any of these dogs ever get taken there.</v>

463
00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:44.260
<v Speaker 4>Like all the dogs their day all look fucking dirty,</v>

464
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.070
<v Speaker 4>beat up,</v>

465
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.030
<v Speaker 4>just nasty.</v>

466
00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:46.271
<v Speaker 4>Every,</v>

467
00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:47.470
<v Speaker 4>all of them were barking.</v>

468
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.940
<v Speaker 4>It was like the most saddest,</v>

469
00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.860
<v Speaker 4>depressing and thing ever.</v>

470
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 4>And then I watched somebody give up their dog,</v>

471
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.771
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

472
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 4>this</v>

473
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 2>girl about 24 came in with a pit and she goes,</v>

474
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I need to surrender this dog.</v>

475
00:11:58.161 --> 00:11:58.511
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

476
00:11:58.511 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 2>it's $25.</v>

477
00:11:59.501 --> 00:11:59.861
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

478
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:00.181
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

479
00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 2>And she gives him a $25 and then she gives the,</v>

480
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

481
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 2>the leash to the woman and the dog didn't want to leave the girls side.</v>

482
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.180
<v Speaker 2>And so she,</v>

483
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 2>the woman had to like pull and drag the dog through.</v>

484
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 2>And then the woman just seemed unfazed by it though.</v>

485
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:13.700
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just like,</v>

486
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.321
<v Speaker 2>which woman?</v>

487
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 2>The woman woman.</v>

488
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 2>It was giving up the dog and I'm just like,</v>

489
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:17.794
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

490
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 2>like if I have a dog that needed to get rid of and even for whatever reason,</v>

491
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 2>it's never going to be that.</v>

492
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to be,</v>

493
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 2>find a friend first,</v>

494
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 2>find something first.</v>

495
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

496
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.550
<v Speaker 2>but she probably,</v>

497
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 2>the dog was probably nuts or hopefully that issue.</v>

498
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not that she didn't have the space for it at the time for it.</v>

499
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

500
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Because when people do that and they bring a dog to the pound,</v>

501
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're just asking someone else to kill the thing.</v>

502
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.170
<v Speaker 2>You're just asking you just like take it out,</v>

503
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 2>take it out of my hand,</v>

504
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.041
<v Speaker 2>tell you that in my head.</v>

505
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it in my head anymore.</v>

506
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Here you put it in your head now,</v>

507
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.423
<v Speaker 2>now you deal with it.</v>

508
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.091
<v Speaker 2>What's crazy?</v>

509
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Some people are like that and I think some people are just really irresponsible</v>

510
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:53.640
<v Speaker 2>and inconsiderate and they don't know.</v>

511
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

512
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.281
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

513
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:54.571
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

514
00:12:54.571 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll get this thing for two minutes and then,</v>

515
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.171
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

516
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm done with this play thing.</v>

517
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I was really something I love.</v>

518
00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>That's very surprised though,</v>

519
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't clean up the dogs because my friend works at the shelter and</v>

520
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 2>the place they did.</v>

521
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 2>They take dogs that are about to do,</v>

522
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:06.341
<v Speaker 2>to die,</v>

523
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:07.330
<v Speaker 2>like to be put to sleep,</v>

524
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:08.620
<v Speaker 2>and they rescued those dogs.</v>

525
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Then they cleaned them up and repackage them,</v>

526
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:11.531
<v Speaker 2>and then like,</v>

528
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:11.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 2>refurbish them or whatever,</v>

530
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:13.391
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

531
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:14.141
<v Speaker 2>and then they,</v>

532
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:14.974
<v Speaker 2>these dogs,</v>

533
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 2>amazing looking.</v>

534
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:16.421
<v Speaker 2>You walk in,</v>

535
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 2>you want every single dog and these are all dog's about to die.</v>

536
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like you would think this like city pound,</v>

537
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.280
<v Speaker 2>little city pound would hire four kids,</v>

538
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 2>in high school to clean up these dogs.</v>

540
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.303
<v Speaker 2>There's no money,</v>

541
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 2>there's no money for anything that was poor people.</v>

542
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>

543
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a,</v>

544
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a dark road when you,</v>

545
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 2>especially today when you deal with all the fucking economic hardships that are</v>

546
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 2>hitting people and then you ask people to care about dog.</v>

547
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 2>So good luck.</v>

548
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.560
<v Speaker 2>They had roosters there though.</v>

549
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Snakes.</v>

550
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 2>They had bunnies.</v>

551
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.690
<v Speaker 2>They had tons of bunnies and chickens and like fucking years.</v>

552
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.833
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

553
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like the new thing that's like the new thing to have I think as a rooster.</v>

554
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

555
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 2>no joke.</v>

556
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Well also there's,</v>

557

<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

574
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

575
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Roy Jones Jr is a huge proponent of the cock fighting.</v>

728
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

729
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>he used to fly in private jets with roosters.</v>

730
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 1>He was flying,</v>

731
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.450
<v Speaker 1>he was the fucking middle weight champion of the world,</v>

732
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.970
<v Speaker 1>flying around and Goddamn private jet and he would bring like 10 roosters with</v>

734
00:17:47.971 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 1>them and cages.</v>

735
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

736
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:49.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

737
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:50.760
<v Speaker 1>he was nuts man.</v>

738
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And he would fight them himself.</v>

739
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

740
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:53.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

741
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:53.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

742
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

743
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It's no backlash for that for him or no?</v>

744
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

745
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same man.</v>

746
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

747
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 1>like the backlash from Michael Vick.</v>

748
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.361
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

749
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:00.621
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

750
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference.</v>

751
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:01.861
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

752
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you tell someone,</v>

753
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>someone fights dogs and you go,</v>

754
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:04.801
<v Speaker 1>whoa man,</v>

755
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:05.634
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of fucked up.</v>

756
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:05.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

757
00:18:05.981 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

758
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

759
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.251
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>

760
00:18:07.251 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you heard the other shit that Vic did where he would electrocute the dogs,</v>

761
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 1>drown them or shoot him in the head like he murdered them.</v>

762
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>He murdered a bunch of dogs.</v>

763
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And that takes a certain personality that we don't like.</v>

764
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.620
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking to exactly when it even worse,</v>

765
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 1>because this is a multimillionaire.</v>

766
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:23.550
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a guy who's in any state of necessity.</v>

767
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 1>It's this isn't cruelty because he's in a bad position and it needs to do this</v>

768
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 1>because he's got to put food on the table.</v>

769
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a guy who's getting off on killing animals for sure,</v>

770
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and we just kind of accepted him back into the fold because he's really good at</v>

771
00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>

772
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:36.931
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

773
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:37.681
<v Speaker 1>And I know people say,</v>

774
00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:38.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

775
00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:38.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:38.730
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

777
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.451
<v Speaker 1>he did his time.</v>

778
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:39.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

779
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I guess he did do his time,</v>

780
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:41.460
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

781
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of what he did that's so horrific that it just makes</v>

782
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you really hesitant to ever forgive someone for that kind of behavior.</v>

783
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:51.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

784
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I forgive someone for fucking up.</v>

785
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I forgive someone for saying things.</v>

786
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I forgave someone for racism.</v>

787
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I forgive,</v>

788
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I forgive someone for poor mental choices,</v>

789
00:18:58.051 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but when you kill a hundred dogs,</v>

790
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

791
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 1>and you electrocute them and shoot them and stabbed them and doing all that shit</v>

792
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>that he supposedly did.</v>

793
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

794
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't like you.</v>

795
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'll ever like you.</v>

796
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can like you.</v>

797
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

798
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:09.550
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

799
00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you're capable of doing some shit that I would never imagine.</v>

800
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 1>And how far back have you bounce from that?</v>

801
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.230
<v Speaker 1>180 degrees.</v>

802
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Are you a perfect person now?</v>

803
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

804
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 1>you just less creepy because you know the cameras are on you and you don't want</v>

805
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>to go back to jail for killing dogs.</v>

806
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you man.</v>

807
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's an expectation though that people have an expectation like,</v>

808
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:28.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

809
00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:28.471
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

810
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:29.930
<v Speaker 1>he did his time so you should have any,</v>

811
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess you should.</v>

812
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

813
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.223
<v Speaker 1>expectation.</v>

814
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I would like to believe,</v>

815
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I would like to believe that people can,</v>

816
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:35.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

817
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.710
<v Speaker 1>fully learned from.</v>

818
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.651
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

819
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I liked dogs and that drove me crazy and I like pit bulls and you know what?</v>

820
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Pimples like to fight,</v>

821
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:43.231
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

822
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that is a fact.</v>

823
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.070
<v Speaker 1>They like it.</v>

824
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.511
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

825
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 1>I've had to break my dogs up many times when I have pit bulls and it's scary,</v>

826
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 1>especially they don't want to let go and they're wagging their tails.</v>

827
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.350
<v Speaker 1>They're both wagging their tails and their locked onto each other's faces.</v>

828
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:55.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

829
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

830
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.241
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

831
00:19:57.241 --> 00:19:58.110
<v Speaker 1>But that's what they do,</v>

832
00:19:58.111 --> 00:19:58.471
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

833
00:19:58.471 --> 00:19:58.711
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

834
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.640
<v Speaker 1>it's there thousands of years of,</v>

835
00:20:00.641 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 1>of genetic breeding.</v>

836
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:02.191
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

837
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:06.630
<v Speaker 1>what is this coming from a person who's deeply involved in human fighting.</v>

838
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

839
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>like dog fighting is a,</v>

840
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>what does it less brutal than when I fucking watch every weekend cause it less</v>

841
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.400
<v Speaker 1>brutal than you know,</v>

842
00:20:14.401 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 1>then Alistair Overeem kicking you in the fucking head with his shin.</v>

843
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I think a dog bite,</v>

844
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and you might be a little less brutal than that.</v>

845
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:20.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

846
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>it might be less brutal than having Cain Velasquez Punch a fucking hole through</v>

847
00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:24.720
<v Speaker 1>your face.</v>

848
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Like he did the Brock Lesnar.</v>

849
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

850
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Shit guys,</v>

851
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:28.723
<v Speaker 1>guys or those guys.</v>

852
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Cause they want to be there.</v>

853
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:31.400
<v Speaker 1>They're making a conscious decision to be there.</v>

854
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:31.831
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

855
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 1>The dogs want to do it too.</v>

856
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 1>They want to bike through the fucking cops are killing each other and there's no</v>

857
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:36.750
<v Speaker 1>referee.</v>

858
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.583
<v Speaker 1>Really scary.</v>

859
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Well yes there are.</v>

860
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

861
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

862
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:39.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

863
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

864
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:39.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

865
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

866
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.590
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

867
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

868
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.851
<v Speaker 1>The dogs.</v>

869
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>They break the dogs and then they bring them back together again at the dog.</v>

870
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:44.581
<v Speaker 1>Shies away.</v>

871
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:45.414
<v Speaker 1>They stop it.</v>

872
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 1>That's incorrect.</v>

873
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.310
<v Speaker 1>He like the electrocution and the drought.</v>

874
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 1>We've got dogs that are not game.</v>

875
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.811
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

876
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:53.644
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

877
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

878
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 1>the idea is you never breed a dog that is human aggressive.</v>

879
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 1>He never breed a dog that quits.</v>

880
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 1>You never beat a dog that is scared of another dog,</v>

881
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.620
<v Speaker 1>a dog that backs away the,</v>

882
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the thing what they've done with pit bulls is they've taken this animal and</v>

883
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:13.411
<v Speaker 1>they've engineered it into a super fighter and there's no other dog that comes</v>

884
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 1>close to a pit bull when it comes to dog fighting.</v>

885
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no other dog.</v>

886
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.313
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't,</v>

887
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

888
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:18.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

889
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bragging about this.</v>

890
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:21.430
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like fanboy talk.</v>

891
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:21.821
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

892
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:23.200
<v Speaker 1>this is just what they've done.</v>

893
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 1>They've taken this animal,</v>

894
00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 1>they made it something very unusual.</v>

895
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.260
<v Speaker 1>What they've done is they made an animal that's absolutely unafraid to die.</v>

896
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely unafraid of pain,</v>

897
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 1>absolutely unafraid of conflict and impact.</v>

898
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 1>They go right after the dogs.</v>

899
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.360
<v Speaker 1>There's no hesitation.</v>

900
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.081
<v Speaker 1>A lot of dogs,</v>

901
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:38.711
<v Speaker 1>they growl.</v>

902
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:40.450
<v Speaker 1>They try to figure out who's going to be the boss,</v>

903
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the piss and offense Miami and be able to avoid a fight all together.</v>

904
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no avoiding a fight with pit bull.</v>

905
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:46.330
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

906
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

907
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.860
<v Speaker 1>If there's a wild,</v>

908
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>if it's a pit bull and he's out of his cage and he's a male and he has his balls</v>

909
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 1>and there's another dog that's a male and has his balls and that dog does</v>

910
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.710
<v Speaker 1>anything even remotely resembling something that challenges the pitbulls</v>

911
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.570
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>

912
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a fight.</v>

913
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.033
<v Speaker 1>He's been bred for that.</v>

914
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:03.741
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're,</v>

915
00:22:03.741 --> 00:22:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you're just a bad motherfucker,</v>

916
00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Cesar Milan guy and you've done a really good job of breeding your dog or you've</v>

917
00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:14.080
<v Speaker 1>got a specific particular docile version of the breed where many,</v>

918
00:22:14.081 --> 00:22:14.261
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

919
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 1>many generations of of breeders have bred the gameness out of pits.</v>

920
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 1>When I'm talking about game pit bulls,</v>

921
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.311
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

922
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 1>what you see when you see a pit bull,</v>

923
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you see it as like 90 pound muscular,</v>

924
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:25.690
<v Speaker 1>big headed.</v>

925
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not a game pit bull again,</v>

926
00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.380
<v Speaker 1>pit bulls about 35 pounds,</v>

927
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 1>they're very small and they look like like almost like a beagle man.</v>

928
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to,</v>

929
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>

930
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 1>but they don't look like the dogs that we are used to seeing.</v>

931
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.200
<v Speaker 1>They look like these,</v>

932
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:45.990
<v Speaker 1>these little sinewy little like springy athletic dogs.</v>

933
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:50.380
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was you had to get a small dog because you had to be able to</v>

934
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 1>physically separate them when they're going at it.</v>

935
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 1>If you got to 90 pound pit bulls going at,</v>

936
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 1>first of all they don't last the gas out really quick,</v>

937
00:22:57.281 --> 00:23:01.240
<v Speaker 1>just like heavyweight fighters and the gas out really quick and they,</v>

938
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you can't separate them.</v>

939
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.490
<v Speaker 1>They're too fucking strong.</v>

940
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.930
<v Speaker 1>It's too dangerous to to 35 pounds.</v>

941
00:23:05.931 --> 00:23:07.270
<v Speaker 1>She just get right in there and pick them up.</v>

942
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>25 pound or 28 pounder.</v>

943
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 1>So they have weight classes and they put dogs on treadmill.</v>

944
00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I get shit,</v>

945
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.731
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

946
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 1>They treat it like a sport.</v>

947
00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I get that they treat it like,</v>

948
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 1>like anybody else would treat something professional.</v>

950
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>But does that make it okay to be breeding the dogs for that?</v>

951
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

952
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.423
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly doesn't.</v>

953
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't support it in any way and I wasn't applying.</v>

954
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.391
<v Speaker 1>It does though.</v>

955
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean like that's what,</v>

956
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hypocrite though because like I said,</v>

957
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 1>less human fighting.</v>

958
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

959
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:31.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

960
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:32.441
<v Speaker 1>it's not really.</v>

961
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:33.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean they did.</v>

962
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Dogs get fucking bit by pit bulls and I'm kind of kidding and I'm kind of</v>

963
00:23:37.271 --> 00:23:38.104
<v Speaker 1>exaggerating,</v>

964
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.220
<v Speaker 1>but I did say it,</v>

965
00:23:39.221 --> 00:23:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

966
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 1>what I meant was,</v>

967
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

968
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I am around voluntary human violence amongst the most intelligent species on the</v>

969
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.090
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

970
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

971
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.030
<v Speaker 1>On a regular basis.</v>

972
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And for sure I know those guys enjoy it.</v>

973
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think the dogs enjoy it too.</v>

974
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they should do it.</v>

975
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I hated watching dogs fight and when I'd come home and dogs would get angry and</v>

976
00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:57.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:58.321
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it would do,</v>

978
00:23:58.321 --> 00:23:59.620
<v Speaker 1>it would be a fight over attention.</v>

979
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

980
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:02.920
<v Speaker 1>you'd come home and they decide like one person wants to pet you,</v>

981
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.793
<v Speaker 1>wants to get pet,</v>

982
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 1>and then the other dog wants to get pat and they'll fucking growl at each other.</v>

983
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's really annoying,</v>

984
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

985
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:09.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

986
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that happens when you have a bunch of dogs.</v>

987
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:12.900
<v Speaker 1>But my,</v>

988
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

989
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.260
<v Speaker 1>my point about pit bulls,</v>

990
00:24:14.261 --> 00:24:15.094
<v Speaker 1>it was not that,</v>

991
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

992
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

993
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.860
<v Speaker 1>there's anything good about what they do.</v>

994
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Are you just saying this is what they do,</v>

995
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.050
<v Speaker 1>this is what they did.</v>

996
00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

997
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.230
<v Speaker 1>And what did it mean?</v>

998
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Painting a dog could be bred to love being pet just as much as it loves</v>

999
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:26.690
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

1000
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.523
<v Speaker 1>No matter how aggressive,</v>

1001
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1002
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 1>over many generations.</v>

1003
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1004
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.140
<v Speaker 1>my dog now is what's called a regency mass tiff.</v>

1005
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.610
<v Speaker 1>And what a regency mastiff is,</v>

1006
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 1>is a Neapolitan mass if that's bred with a pit bull and within 1% or would it</v>

1007
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:39.611
<v Speaker 1>essentially is,</v>

1008
00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 1>is his big strong athletic pit bull mastiff combination.</v>

1009
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 1>But there's no dog aggression at all.</v>

1010
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And no people aggression.</v>

1011
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.553
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1012
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's because I know the guy who breeds it and he breeds for the exact</v>

1013
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:53.660
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>

1014
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 1>He breeds if the dog show any aggression to anybody,</v>

1015
00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.710

<v Speaker 1>He hasn't fixed,</v>

1018
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.133
<v Speaker 1>he has effects,</v>

1019
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.040
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't kill them.</v>

1020
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:02.120
<v Speaker 1>He's not shooting him in the head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a breeder who loves animals come over his house when his dogs are playing with</v>

1026
00:25:07.351 --> 00:25:08.660

1030
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:17.150
<v Speaker 1>with the pit bull is an amazing thing.</v>

1031
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I've loved the dogs.</v>

1032
00:25:18.381 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing dogs.</v>

1033
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 1>The Guy had one at the gym the other day.</v>

1034
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stop petting it.</v>

1035
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.360
<v Speaker 1>They're fascinating animals because of the gym.</v>

1036
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

1037

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 1>bring the pitch booth to the gym.</v>

1039
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1040
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:30.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1041
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:30.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1042
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 1>the thing about them is because they've been bred that way,</v>

1043
00:25:34.431 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 1>we're only the strongest,</v>

1044
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 1>most aggressive.</v>

1045
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.781
<v Speaker 1>The ones with the,</v>

1046
00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:38.931
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1047
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:39.081
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1048
00:25:39.081 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 1>the most impenetrable will.</v>

1049
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Those are the only ones that are allowed to breed in the dog fighting community.</v>

1050
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 1>The other ones are called,</v>

1051
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1052
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:49.580
<v Speaker 1>they're either killed or they're neutered or they're given to people's pets.</v>

1053
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>But when you have that,</v>

1054
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 1>what you get is this incredibly like energetic,</v>

1055
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.080
<v Speaker 1>intelligent animal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get this survivor,</v>

1057
00:25:58.521 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 1>you get this like cream of the crop,</v>

1058
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 1>genetic specimen of a dog.</v>

1059
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.260
<v Speaker 1>They're just fucking amazing.</v>

1060
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way about Yorkie.</v>

1061
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:09.341
<v Speaker 1>Poos fucking you get the adorableness of the Yorkshire and get the intelligence</v>

1062
00:26:09.921 --> 00:26:10.680
<v Speaker 1>of the poodle.</v>

1063
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1064
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't want that on a calendar or in their living room?</v>

1065
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:13.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1066
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:14.414
<v Speaker 1>we have a pit bull.</v>

1067
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.621
<v Speaker 1>Once you have a pit bull,</v>

1068
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:16.700
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to take other dog.</v>

1069
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:17.534
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

1070
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:18.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:19.690
<v Speaker 1>German shepherds are pretty easy to take serious,</v>

1072
00:26:19.691 --> 00:26:19.951
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>

1073
00:26:19.951 --> 00:26:20.490
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty good.</v>

1074
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.323
<v Speaker 1>My buddies,</v>

1075
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.720
<v Speaker 1>my buddy's cousin trains German shepherds are smart dogs.</v>

1076
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.660
<v Speaker 1>He trains them for like celebrities and I,</v>

1077
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.081
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1078
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I guess he taught Jay z's dog diamonds.</v>

1079
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Really tell the German shepard diamonds,</v>

1080
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's Jay z.</v>

1081
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's so awesome.</v>

1082
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.493
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's hilarious.</v>

1083
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And not the coolest thing ever.</v>

1084
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 1>You had German shepherds are super,</v>

1085
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:39.651
<v Speaker 1>super smart.</v>

1086
00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't just leave a German shepard in the yard.</v>

1087
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.300
<v Speaker 1>They'll find a way out,</v>

1088
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:42.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1089
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.513
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it.</v>

1090
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>

1091
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.061
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1092
00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:44.281
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1093
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1094
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.030
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

1095
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

1096
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 1>if they have to,</v>

1097
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 1>they'll stay in the yard,</v>

1098
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but they get bored really quick.</v>

1099
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:50.610
<v Speaker 1>They're task oriented animals.</v>

1100
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 1>They Swat team members,</v>

1101
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know they are treated like Malcolm was a smaller version of,</v>

1102
00:26:56.211 --> 00:26:58.590
<v Speaker 1>you said it looked just like German shepherds but a smaller same thing.</v>

1103
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:00.420
<v Speaker 1>You know those dogs were super smart.</v>

1104
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Both German shepherds at the pound today,</v>

1105
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 1>both just standing at attention now barking or anything and that</v>

1106
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 1>they're great dogs.</v>

1107
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.060
<v Speaker 1>German shepherds are great dogs.</v>

1108
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I had a German shepherd,</v>

1109
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:13.650
<v Speaker 1>a my grandfather had one when I was growing up.</v>

1110
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 1>What a great dog it was.</v>

1111
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It was literally a dog would like go check on things like watch over the kids.</v>

1112
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Like the kids will be playing.</v>

1113
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Like my cousins will be planned and the dog would just stand there and watch</v>

1114
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 1>over them and make sure everybody's okay.</v>

1115
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Right and make sure nobody ultimately helps you guys.</v>

1116
00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:27.931
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1117
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:28.430
<v Speaker 1>You need anything.</v>

1118
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.620
<v Speaker 1>If people would like walk by the front if like he was by the babies and the</v>

1119
00:27:32.621 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 1>little kids and little kids are playing and people would walk by the front gate,</v>

1120
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>the dog would take two steps towards the fence just in case he needed to go.</v>

1121
00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:39.504
<v Speaker 1>Jackson Buddy,</v>

1122
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 1>just take two steps and then he would look back at the little kids.</v>

1123
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Look back at the Lucas and I'm like this.</v>

1124
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:44.551
<v Speaker 1>I was like six.</v>

1125
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:45.091
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that.</v>

1126
00:27:45.091 --> 00:27:45.331
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

1127
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:47.200
<v Speaker 1>this mother fucker's guarding these dogs.</v>

1128
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 1>The dog is guarding them.</v>

1129
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that from very many dogs and those talks and give a fuck about</v>

1130
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:53.581
<v Speaker 1>some of these babies.</v>

1131
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 1>So fuck this baby,</v>

1132
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1135
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 1>let me eat some food they can strip later.</v>

1136
00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1137
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 1>this is a totally different animal is weird.</v>

1138
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1139
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.390
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned Michael Vick did his time and I don't want a Tan,</v>

1140
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:04.310
<v Speaker 4>gentle eyes too much,</v>

1141
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:04.870
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

1142
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.040
<v Speaker 4>I think it's crazy that that,</v>

1143
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1144
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.800
<v Speaker 4>this occupies stuff's going on and I haven't had a chance to talk to you about</v>

1145
00:28:09.801 --> 00:28:10.000
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1146
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.780
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I don't know where you fall or what you've seen,</v>

1147
00:28:11.781 --> 00:28:14.780
<v Speaker 4>but it's crazy that those guys haven't done any time yet.</v>

1148
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1149
00:28:15.031 --> 00:28:15.691
<v Speaker 1>there's no leader.</v>

1150
00:28:15.691 --> 00:28:16.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1151
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:16.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1152
00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:20.160
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to find someone to put away where they can stop the movement.</v>

1153
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 1>The scariest thing about occupy Wall Street for them is that there's no one</v>

1154
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 1>person with a megaphone.</v>

1155
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1156
00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the only reason they're lasting so long.</v>

1157
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:26.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1158
00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:27.391
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

1159
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:28.460
<v Speaker 1>it's getting bigger too.</v>

1160
00:28:28.461 --> 00:28:28.541
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1161
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:28.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1162
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 1>it's bigger and bigger every day.</v>

1163
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>This is the beginning of something huge,</v>

1164
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1165
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.320
<v Speaker 1>This is not just what it looked like.</v>

1166
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:35.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what it looked like.</v>

1167
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:39.720
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of them fucking Glenn Beck rallies that just got got real long,</v>

1168
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 1>lasted a while and everybody's pissed.</v>

1169
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:41.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1170
00:28:41.551 --> 00:28:41.941
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

1171
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:42.361
<v Speaker 1>You're pissed.</v>

1172
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:43.194
<v Speaker 1>I'm pissed too.</v>

1173
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 1>But then after a couple of weeks it's like,</v>

1174
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 1>this is not the same.</v>

1175
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.070
<v Speaker 1>This is a different feeling and this has,</v>

1176
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 1>this has an overthrow.</v>

1177
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:51.630
<v Speaker 1>The government feel to it.</v>

1178
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.291
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1180
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:55.380
<v Speaker 4>I saw people out there for the first time with giant signs that said audit.</v>

1181
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:56.620
<v Speaker 4>The Fed was like,</v>

1182
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.980
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see you guys out here for any other alley.</v>

1183
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.840
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's just because my eyes weren't open enough,</v>

1184
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:01.950
<v Speaker 4>but I went,</v>

1185
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:02.520
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1186
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 4>if this is how it's going to go down,</v>

1187
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 4>let's get it going.</v>

1188
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:04.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1189
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I've had some discussions about this on my message board and there's some real</v>

1190
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:09.250
<v Speaker 1>good points a lot of these guys brought up.</v>

1191
00:29:09.251 --> 00:29:09.881
<v Speaker 1>Did I agree with,</v>

1192
00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:14.500
<v Speaker 1>and one of them is that there's not a lot of cohesive message to,</v>

1193
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 1>to this thing,</v>

1194
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1195
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's so many different people with so many different ones that does</v>

1196
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:20.100
<v Speaker 1>happen with any movement.</v>

1197
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1198
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:20.761
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1199
00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:22.290
<v Speaker 1>It's important movement with no leader,</v>

1200
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.531
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1201
00:29:22.531 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 1>You know that they go there and they were like,</v>

1202
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:25.050
<v Speaker 1>stop the drone killings,</v>

1203
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:25.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1204
00:29:25.381 --> 00:29:27.420
<v Speaker 1>and there's p to people there and there's,</v>

1205
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 1>there's fucking solar people there and have people there and there's legalize</v>

1206
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:33.180
<v Speaker 1>marijuana people there and everyone's got their own signs and it's,</v>

1207
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:35.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just occupy Wall Street,</v>

1208
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 1>it's everything that sucks.</v>

1209
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And I don't got,</v>

1210
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.320
<v Speaker 1>had a sign that said Shit's fucked up and it's bull shit was like,</v>

1211
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:41.831
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

1212
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Abso-Fucking-Lutely</v>

1213
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:43.260
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1214
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.021
<v Speaker 4>it's fucked up.</v>

1215
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 4>So that's reason enough to get out there.</v>

1216
00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 4>And right now the major concern is watching special interest groups,</v>

1217
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 4>agent provocateur tours,</v>

1218
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 4>watching them try to roll into the fray and do their youtube videos to fight</v>

1219
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:55.211
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1220
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:56.710
<v Speaker 4>And they're CNN coverage.</v>

1221
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Took a picture of the protest and in a certain direction.</v>

1222
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 4>It's so fascinating to watch the way the steps were outlined for it.</v>

1223
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Here's what happened to the tea party.</v>

1224
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Here's how every other movement has been marginalized.</v>

1225
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.211
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me,</v>

1226
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:07.571
<v Speaker 4>coffee,</v>

1227
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:08.404
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>

1228
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.371
<v Speaker 4>marginalized,</v>

1229
00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 4>every other movement for years,</v>

1230
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 4>and to watch those steps playing out right now with occupy Wall Street and</v>

1231
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 4>seeing if it's going to thrive or if it's going to crumble in on itself.</v>

1232
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there's some really marginalize the tea party or do you think they</v>

1233
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 4>just did it to themselves?</v>

1234
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Speaker 4>The people who truly,</v>

1235
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

1236
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 4>this is from reddit articles and from what I can come together on Wikipedia,</v>

1237
00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 4>but the people who were at the true heart of the original tea party,</v>

1238
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 4>we're anti Federal Reserve.</v>

1239
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 4>They were anti big banks,</v>

1240
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:36.390
<v Speaker 4>they were anti corporations and a lot of people said,</v>

1241
00:30:36.391 --> 00:30:36.481
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1242
00:30:36.481 --> 00:30:37.510
<v Speaker 4>they're Ron Paul supporters,</v>

1243
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:38.261
<v Speaker 4>so they got lumped in as,</v>

1244
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:38.441
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1245
00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:38.980
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1246
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.621
<v Speaker 4>you're Ron Paul,</v>

1247
00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:40.361
<v Speaker 4>so you're Republican.</v>

1248
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:40.661
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

1249
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:40.871
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

1250
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 4>but we're not necessarily Republican.</v>

1251
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:43.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1252
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 4>we do believe in subtle Ron Paul's idea isn't,</v>

1253
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1254
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:44.771
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1255
00:30:44.771 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 4>you're Republican now.</v>

1256
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:48.580
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get some crazies out there with some hats that have tea bags</v>

1257
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:48.910
<v Speaker 4>dangling,</v>

1258
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.190
<v Speaker 4>teabags dangling from him and send out flyers.</v>

1259
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 4>You really think that someone's sent those people out there.</v>

1260
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:56.320
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that there was a lot of people that just joined in?</v>

1261
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.501
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1262
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 4>There's certainly were.</v>

1263
00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.110
<v Speaker 4>But do you think that it was orchestrated?</v>

1264
00:30:59.140 --> 00:30:59.650
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1265
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 4>I think aspects of it were orchestrated.</v>

1266
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 4>I think you,</v>

1267
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.150
<v Speaker 4>I think there's documented proof of people doing that.</v>

1268
00:31:04.151 --> 00:31:04.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1269
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:05.140
<v Speaker 4>they already have,</v>

1270
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.920
<v Speaker 4>they already have agent provocateur tours.</v>

1271
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1272
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.240
<v Speaker 4>that Citi Bank thing where those guys got the rest of the 40 people that were in</v>

1273
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 4>a city bank trying to close their bank accounts.</v>

1274
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 4>Now they were being assholes.</v>

1275
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.141
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

1276
00:31:14.141 --> 00:31:14.741
<v Speaker 4>they were being dicks.</v>

1277
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:17.750
<v Speaker 4>They're had their cardboard signs inside a Citi Bank and they're shouting</v>

1278
00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:18.730
<v Speaker 4>they're were being disruptive.</v>

1279
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:19.783
<v Speaker 4>They weren't just just,</v>

1281
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.100
<v Speaker 4>just canceling their bank account.</v>

1282
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.900
<v Speaker 4>The guy who was the loudest,</v>

1283
00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:25.420
<v Speaker 4>they're one of the guys who was allowed us from videos that I've seen was an</v>

1284
00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:26.254
<v Speaker 4>undercover cop.</v>

1285
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.011
<v Speaker 4>So he was,</v>

1286
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:27.761
<v Speaker 4>he was right in the,</v>

1287
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:27.971
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1288
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:28.540
<v Speaker 4>it's out there.</v>

1289
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 4>So one of the,</v>

1290
00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:30.700
<v Speaker 4>one of the ladies who went in there,</v>

1291
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.511
<v Speaker 4>she did protest.</v>

1292
00:31:31.511 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 4>She did say her speech,</v>

1293
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:33.460
<v Speaker 4>but then she politely,</v>

1294
00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:34.660
<v Speaker 4>after they told her to quiet down,</v>

1295
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.823
<v Speaker 4>and this is again,</v>

1296
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 4>I can only cobble together so many stories,</v>

1297
00:31:37.391 --> 00:31:40.090
<v Speaker 4>but this is what I've observed over a few articles.</v>

1298
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.580
<v Speaker 4>She quietly calm down.</v>

1299
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 4>She closed her bank account.</v>

1300
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:43.510
<v Speaker 4>She was outside.</v>

1301
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.760
<v Speaker 4>They locked everybody in because the police said,</v>

1302
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:45.881
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1303
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:46.900
<v Speaker 4>if they're disrupting business,</v>

1304
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:47.441
<v Speaker 4>hold them there,</v>

1305
00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 4>which I don't even for being an asshole.</v>

1306
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can legally detain somebody like that without the cops being</v>

1307
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:53.614
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1308
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Dude came outside.</v>

1309
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:55.361
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

1310
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:57.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm a customer showing them the Citibank Bank receipts and stuff.</v>

1311
00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:58.361
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

1312
00:31:58.361 --> 00:31:58.471
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1313
00:31:58.471 --> 00:31:58.800
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1314
00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1315
00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1316
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.071
<v Speaker 4>I'm supposed to be in there.</v>

1317
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to cancel my account.</v>

1318
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1319
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you were one of the protestors,</v>

1320
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 4>grab Sir bear hold style and drags her back inside the city bank to be</v>

1321
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 4>processed.</v>

1322
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:08.210
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1323
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.043
<v Speaker 4>Citibank.</v>

1324
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.180
<v Speaker 4>This is hilarious.</v>

1325
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 4>The Citibank protesters was saying that the undercover cops set them up,</v>

1326
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1327
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.210
<v Speaker 4>that there was a set up.</v>

1328
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.300
<v Speaker 4>So the one thing,</v>

1329
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:19.930
<v Speaker 4>this organ,</v>

1330
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:20.231
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1331
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:21.760
<v Speaker 4>this movement has going for it,</v>

1332
00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:22.571
<v Speaker 4>which had remained,</v>

1333
00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:24.040
<v Speaker 4>and it has me remaining so hopeful,</v>

1334
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 4>is that they are so fucking connected.</v>

1335
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what makes it great because the second bull shit happens.</v>

1336
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:30.251
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1337
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:30.551
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1338
00:32:30.551 --> 00:32:30.701
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1339
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:31.301
<v Speaker 4>that's one story,</v>

1340
00:32:31.301 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 4>but here's 40 other angles of that event.</v>

1341
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Start to finish.</v>

1342
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.310
<v Speaker 4>You look at what happened,</v>

1343
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:36.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1344
00:32:36.761 --> 00:32:37.181
<v Speaker 4>and they showed,</v>

1345
00:32:37.181 --> 00:32:37.841
<v Speaker 4>they showed a commercial.</v>

1346
00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 4>Right now there's an attack commercial against the movement that has</v>

1347
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.070
<v Speaker 2>some crazy guy who's known for being a crazy youtube guy,</v>

1348
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.400
<v Speaker 2>spouting antisemitic remarks that people left and right.</v>

1349
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.000
<v Speaker 2>And there's one guy and there's another dude that has a sign that was</v>

1350
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic and they'd cut back and forth between this guy for like three</v>

1351
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:53.954
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1352
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1353
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 2>these guy with the sign,</v>

1354
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:55.611
<v Speaker 2>the guy with that,</v>

1355
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 2>and there's video of people at that protest,</v>

1356
00:32:58.161 --> 00:32:58.994
<v Speaker 2>shaming them,</v>

1357
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 2>telling them to get the fuck outta here.</v>

1358
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't belong here.</v>

1359
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 2>So you see the one message and to go crazy antisemitism.</v>

1360
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:05.631
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1361
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I get why people believe that.</v>

1362
00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the message they see.</v>

1363
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 2>But this movement is so connected that there's a chance that you could see 40</v>

1364
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.890
<v Speaker 2>other perspectives on an event and truly make it up for yourself.</v>

1365
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 2>You can truly decide this Citibank arrest.</v>

1366
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Now that we're talking about this,</v>

1367
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:20.550
<v Speaker 2>and now that I'm going to,</v>

1368
00:33:20.551 --> 00:33:23.000
<v Speaker 2>you told me this and I'm going online and a,</v>

1369
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:24.290
<v Speaker 2>we'll tweet this stuff to.</v>

1370
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 2>People are getting a chance to,</v>

1371
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1372
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.170
<v Speaker 2>do you want one of those women?</v>

1373
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 2>There's cold ones in there.</v>

1374
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Open,</v>

1375
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 2>open the top and the bottom there.</v>

1376
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Bottom shelf there.</v>

1377
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.571
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1378
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Fill up.</v>

1379
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.033
<v Speaker 2>Get one for everybody.</v>

1380
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1381
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:35.841
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1382
00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:36.030
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1383
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

1384
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 2>This is why they're saying that,</v>

1385
00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:38.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1386
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.490
<v Speaker 2>they know that the guy was an undercover cop.</v>

1387
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.890
<v Speaker 2>It's because he fucking arrested one of them.</v>

1388
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Once they got outside the fucking guy,</v>

1389
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't just an undercover cop.</v>

1390
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.630
<v Speaker 2>He was mocking them and laughing about it.</v>

1391
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 2>He arrested one of the protestors outside,</v>

1392
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.470
<v Speaker 2>slammed her into a wall,</v>

1393
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.660
<v Speaker 2>and he pushed her back into the bank.</v>

1394
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.543
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1395
00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.693
<v Speaker 2>There's video of that.</v>

1396
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.820
<v Speaker 2>He was at the precinct while they're all getting arrested and he was laughing</v>

1397
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:05.120
<v Speaker 2>with fellow white shirt cops telling them about what we'd been saying.</v>

1398
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Basically it was a bit startling how inside their information was,</v>

1399
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:13.100
<v Speaker 2>how they were being paid to go to these protests and put us in situations where</v>

1400
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:16.130
<v Speaker 2>we'd be arrested and not able to leave and not be able to leave.</v>

1401
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

1402
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1403
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not the only incident by a long shot.</v>

1404
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.241
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1405
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:24.530
<v Speaker 2>But who is in charge of this if this guy's an undercover cop?</v>

1406
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:24.801
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1407
00:34:24.801 --> 00:34:27.170
<v Speaker 2>And where is this city bank branch?</v>

1408
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.100
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1409
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.390
<v Speaker 2>what part of the country was this?</v>

1410
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.811
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1411
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:30.644
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall.</v>

1412
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1413
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.670
<v Speaker 2>that sucks.</v>

1414
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I would like to know is it not there on the article?</v>

1415
00:34:33.521 --> 00:34:33.981
<v Speaker 2>The New York.</v>

1416
00:34:33.981 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 2>It's in New York.</v>

1417
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 2>While there you go.</v>

1418
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 2>So you know who's Washington Square Park police.</v>

1419
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1420
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.861
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1421
00:34:39.861 --> 00:34:40.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1422
00:34:40.041 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 2>they set this woman up.</v>

1423
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.080
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1424
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 2>this is disgusting.</v>

1425
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not the only incident.</v>

1426
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.780
<v Speaker 2>This is disgusting that,</v>

1427
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:47.643
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>

1428
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 2>this should be fraud.</v>

1429
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.720
<v Speaker 2>We should be able to sue them for fraud.</v>

1430
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I hope they can misrepresenting our,</v>

1431
00:34:53.641 --> 00:34:53.921
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1432
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 2>our tax dollars.</v>

1433
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.640
<v Speaker 2>And misrepresenting your position to protect us.</v>

1434
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:03.790
<v Speaker 2>You are leading someone into an illegal event and then you're the one who</v>

1435
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 2>screaming shit out and you know about kettling the process,</v>

1436
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.040
<v Speaker 2>the procedure of kettling was that it's what the cops,</v>

1437
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.240
<v Speaker 2>they had a term for it.</v>

1438
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 2>It's for cutting off large sections of a crowd for arrest during a protest.</v>

1439
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 2>So that Brooklyn Bridge arrest,</v>

1440
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of views that depending upon how you want to interpret the video</v>

1441
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:20.714
<v Speaker 2>that you're watching,</v>

1442
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.800
<v Speaker 2>those guys were kettled.</v>

1443
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.020
<v Speaker 2>So it means like they create a pot.</v>

1444
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.101
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

1445
00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:25.911
<v Speaker 2>it was the Brooklyn Bridge,</v>

1446
00:35:25.911 --> 00:35:26.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1447
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:27.830
<v Speaker 2>They cut off one end of the Brooklyn Bridge.</v>

1448
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Then they told protestors,</v>

1449
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.601
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1450
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:29.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1451
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:32.030
<v Speaker 2>no foot traffic allowed on the bridge into a megaphone,</v>

1452
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>which if you've ever been to a rally,</v>

1453
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>the first three people can hear that megaphone,</v>

1454
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:36.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1455
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.883
<v Speaker 2>No one else fucking,</v>

1456
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>no one else can.</v>

1457
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 2>So they one officer in the very front.</v>

1458
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.201
<v Speaker 2>You guys can't be here,</v>

1459
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:40.861
<v Speaker 2>guys can't be here,</v>

1460
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:41.694
<v Speaker 2>guys can't be here.</v>

1461
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.980
<v Speaker 2>No foot traffic puts it away.</v>

1462
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:44.461
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

1463
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Everybody turns around and,</v>

1464
00:35:46.391 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Speaker 2>and many of the protesters felt that they were,</v>

1465
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 2>there was a line of police officers walking down the street,</v>

1466
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 2>leading them on to the Brooklyn Bridge.</v>

1467
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.393
<v Speaker 2>Like acrossed it,</v>

1468
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.800
<v Speaker 2>the protesters thought they had a minor victory.</v>

1469
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:56.371
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1470
00:35:56.371 --> 00:35:56.791
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah,</v>

1471
00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:57.361
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn Bridge.</v>

1472
00:35:57.361 --> 00:35:58.194
<v Speaker 2>We got this shit.</v>

1473
00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 2>The cops get about halfway in.</v>

1474
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 2>They cut him off,</v>

1475
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 2>they put the lid on the kettle and they cut off this large group of protesters</v>

1476
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:05.040
<v Speaker 2>on bridge and arrested them all.</v>

1477
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1478
00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.150
<v Speaker 2>It was like leading the marching band like 700.</v>

1479
00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:10.290
<v Speaker 2>That got a lot.</v>

1480
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1481
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 2>it's cowboys.</v>

1482
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1483
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

1484
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.530
<v Speaker 2>They were just hurting protesters.</v>

1485
00:36:14.531 --> 00:36:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1486
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:15.271
<v Speaker 2>Hurting protest.</v>

1487
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:16.104
<v Speaker 2>You don't want man,</v>

1488
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:16.651
<v Speaker 2>but it sucks.</v>

1489
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:20.370
<v Speaker 2>This movement isn't anti-cop whatsoever and it sucks that it's unfortunately</v>

1490
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 2>only the bad and salacious stuff.</v>

1491
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.040
<v Speaker 2>It gets the news coverage wellness.</v>

1492
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.110
<v Speaker 2>That's important though,</v>

1493
00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:28.170
<v Speaker 2>because people need to know what can happen of course happened.</v>

1494
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 2>We need to go about this.</v>

1495
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:30.960
<v Speaker 2>This Citibank Bank thing is fucking disgusting,</v>

1496
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.261
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1497
00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 2>This is really gross.</v>

1498
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:32.461
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1499
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1500
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 2>if somebody just feels like Citi Bank's a shit organization,</v>

1501
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 2>they just want to go in there and cancel their thing and maybe say,</v>

1502
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Citibank,</v>

1503
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with everything you're doing and I want my money back.</v>

1504
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Good fun leave.</v>

1505
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 2>So search the one that happened today with Bank of America,</v>

1506
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 2>because a woman goes into a bank of America,</v>

1507
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.630
<v Speaker 2>she had a sign and there's video of this whole thing again,</v>

1508
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I think don't preach,</v>

1509
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.090
<v Speaker 2>don't make a Ruckus,</v>

1510
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1511
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.860
<v Speaker 2>don't try to be the youtube splash.</v>

1512
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

1513
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 2>here we are talking about it.</v>

1514
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:55.860
<v Speaker 2>So I guess it worked.</v>

1515
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Is this today you're saying?</v>

1516
00:36:57.091 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it was today is that was something from October 11th we're a bunch of</v>

1517
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:03.580
<v Speaker 2>women were arrested inside a bank of America for return and trash from,</v>

1518
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 2>for foreclosed home.</v>

1519
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1520
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.251
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1521
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:05.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1522
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:05.600
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1523
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.331
<v Speaker 2>I think it was from today.</v>

1524
00:37:06.331 --> 00:37:07.164
<v Speaker 2>It was two women.</v>

1525
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.220
<v Speaker 2>One has a sign,</v>

1526
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:08.581
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

1527
00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:09.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm against you guys.</v>

1528
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm closing my account.</v>

1529
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 2>She immediately goes in and like a branch manager comes over to her and says,</v>

1530
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:14.641
<v Speaker 2>you can't be here.</v>

1531
00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:15.474
<v Speaker 2>You need to leave.</v>

1532
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.991
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1533
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:16.591
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1534
00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:17.281
<v Speaker 2>You need to get out of here.</v>

1535
00:37:17.281 --> 00:37:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling the cops.</v>

1536
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:18.691
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1537
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1538
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1539
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm just here to close my account.</v>

1540
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:21.743
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

1541
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 2>you're a protestor.</v>

1542
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling the cops.</v>

1543
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1544
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done anything.</v>

1545
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:25.801
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

1546
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll put the sign away.</v>

1547
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.571
<v Speaker 2>I'll put the sign away.</v>

1548
00:37:27.571 --> 00:37:28.920
<v Speaker 2>No calling the cops.</v>

1549
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.710
<v Speaker 2>And it gets to the point where she actually delivers the line.</v>

1550
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 2>You cannot be a protester and a customer at the same time.</v>

1551
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1552
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.103
<v Speaker 2>Kick them out.</v>

1553
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Lock the doors.</v>

1554
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:38.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1555
00:37:38.701 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 2>they just kicked him out.</v>

1556
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:40.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1557
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:40.741
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean the,</v>

1558
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:40.921
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1559
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:41.850
<v Speaker 2>the cops wouldn't do it.</v>

1560
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:42.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1561
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:42.810
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

1562
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:42.911
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1563
00:37:42.911 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1564
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 2>but you can't be a protester.</v>

1565
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:45.391
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1566
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't,</v>

1567
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 2>they didn't arrest him.</v>

1568
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

1569
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:47.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1570
00:37:47.761 --> 00:37:48.340
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do?</v>

1571
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.900
<v Speaker 2>And you want to be able to go to a place where you work and uh,</v>

1572
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of people standing around yelling then what you're doing is bad or</v>

1573
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.270
<v Speaker 2>protesting inside your job.</v>

1574
00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:57.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1575
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1576
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.280
<v Speaker 2>you have to watch the video because they will be doing,</v>

1577
00:38:00.281 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 2>and she sat down with her sign and was waiting to close the account again.</v>

1578
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.280
<v Speaker 2>I still think it's dickish to go and make noise and shout at some,</v>

1579
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.150
<v Speaker 2>well a poor district manager that she's the 1% because you know she's not,</v>

1580
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:13.890
<v Speaker 2>she's just doing her job too I think.</v>

1581
00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's what banks are like airplanes though.</v>

1582
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Like you really have to watch what you do inside of a bank.</v>

1583
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:19.441
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1584
00:38:19.441 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you have a sign you don't know if you liked presents a bomb</v>

1585
00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:23.610
<v Speaker 2>connected underneath their coat.</v>

1586
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:24.391
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1587
00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a little different.</v>

1588
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel weird wearing an open shirt in a van.</v>

1589
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 2>So somebody had a good point about occupy Wall Street and they said all we need</v>

1590
00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 2>is one or two bounce checks and the cops are with us.</v>

1591
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's so true because he cops</v>

1592
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 1>are with us.</v>

1593
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:39.640
<v Speaker 1>You know it's the cops are not fucking bankers.</v>

1594
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:41.950
<v Speaker 1>But did you see idea to see the nice time release?</v>

1595
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:46.951
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you can get the cops to act as protectors for these cock suckers</v>

1596
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.240
<v Speaker 1>is really dark.</v>

1597
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really dark when you think about it,</v>

1598
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.600
<v Speaker 1>that it could even be steered in that direction now.</v>

1599
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it's already happening though?</v>

1600
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:55.691
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

1601
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:55.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1602
00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:56.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1603
00:38:56.071 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 1>they were this one Citibank bank thing.</v>

1604
00:38:57.551 --> 00:38:57.791
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1605
00:38:57.791 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1606
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.481
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1607
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 1>they're like the police actions in New York from checking ids to make sure</v>

1608
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 1>you're loud,</v>

1609
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.090
<v Speaker 4>walk on certain streets.</v>

1610
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 4>He had to have a Wall Street ID and have an id that matched one of the addresses</v>

1611
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:08.720
<v Speaker 4>that you worked there.</v>

1612
00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that probably has something to do with terror attacks as well?</v>

1613
00:39:12.031 --> 00:39:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1614
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.940
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do it before these protests.</v>

1615
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.511
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1616
00:39:14.511 --> 00:39:16.910
<v Speaker 1>but I mean know when you think they're worried possibly that someone's going to</v>

1617
00:39:16.911 --> 00:39:19.470
<v Speaker 1>sneak through them if there's so much fucking like,</v>

1618
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:19.791
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1619
00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:22.760
<v Speaker 1>does that pull and so much attention in a certain area?</v>

1620
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's just,</v>

1621
00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.460
<v Speaker 4>it is a slippery slope.</v>

1622
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.200
<v Speaker 4>This protest has been violent security.</v>

1623
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.550
<v Speaker 4>This protest hasn't been violent.</v>

1624
00:39:29.551 --> 00:39:30.630
<v Speaker 4>There've been outbursts,</v>

1625
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1626
00:39:31.051 --> 00:39:31.680
<v Speaker 4>but they haven't,</v>

1627
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's like the officer Tony Baloney to pepper sprayed those women that</v>

1628
00:39:35.041 --> 00:39:35.874
<v Speaker 4>were in the net.</v>

1629
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:36.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you saw that video,</v>

1630
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.090
<v Speaker 4>that guy lost 10 vacation days.</v>

1631
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:39.750
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1632
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:40.583
<v Speaker 4>That was his punishment.</v>

1633
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.500
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

1634
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:41.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1635
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.331
<v Speaker 4>it happened yesterday.</v>

1636
00:39:42.331 --> 00:39:44.310
<v Speaker 4>He lost 10 vacation days for pepper spraying,</v>

1637
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.150
<v Speaker 4>but he's still a cop.</v>

1638
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.230
<v Speaker 4>Three one I was still a cop,</v>

1639
00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.101
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get demoted,</v>

1640
00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:47.590
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

1641
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:47.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1642
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 1>he had also a some sort of a into some sort of situation in 2004 when he abused</v>

1643
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 4>they punch somebody I think.</v>

1644
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1645
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.970
<v Speaker 4>But real quick to finish that point though,</v>

1646
00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.510
<v Speaker 4>you know you got guys like that out there and you want those guys checking your</v>

1647
00:40:00.511 --> 00:40:02.400
<v Speaker 4>id to make sure you work at a building and it's like well you go,</v>

1648
00:40:02.401 --> 00:40:03.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah it's for safety.</v>

1649
00:40:03.241 --> 00:40:08.190
<v Speaker 4>But we have given up so many freedoms in the name of safety and further erosion</v>

1650
00:40:08.191 --> 00:40:08.401
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

1651
00:40:08.401 --> 00:40:08.580
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1652
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.001
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

1653
00:40:09.001 --> 00:40:11.520
<v Speaker 1>But just playing devil's advocate,</v>

1654
00:40:11.521 --> 00:40:15.390
<v Speaker 1>what if you don't work for anybody who's doing anything evil and you work on</v>

1655
00:40:15.391 --> 00:40:18.870
<v Speaker 1>fucking Wall Street and you can't get anywhere near your job because there's a</v>

1656
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.280
<v Speaker 1>million hippies out there beating drums,</v>

1657
00:40:20.281 --> 00:40:23.480
<v Speaker 1>banging for the banks to close and you don't even support the fucking banks and</v>

1658
00:40:23.481 --> 00:40:23.731
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1659
00:40:23.731 --> 00:40:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I hear Ya but I got to get over there cause that's where I work.</v>

1660
00:40:26.131 --> 00:40:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And they look you fucking of presenter,</v>

1661
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you fucking piece of shits pressing and you know,</v>

1662
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.040
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile he's the person who works there.</v>

1663
00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1664
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1665
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1666
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.420
<v Speaker 4>I hope that's not the attitude of the protesters.</v>

1667
00:40:36.421 --> 00:40:37.141
<v Speaker 4>I hope that they,</v>

1668
00:40:37.141 --> 00:40:38.310
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I was a troubled,</v>

1669
00:40:38.311 --> 00:40:40.500
<v Speaker 4>to see that woman called the branch manager like,</v>

1670
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:40.651
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1671
00:40:40.651 --> 00:40:41.700
<v Speaker 4>you're the 1% I'm like,</v>

1672
00:40:41.701 --> 00:40:42.240
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1673
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.010
<v Speaker 4>this is just a motherfucker trying to do their job.</v>

1674
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1675
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.620
<v Speaker 4>I marched in the La Rally that they had.</v>

1676
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:47.011
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1677
00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:47.731
<v Speaker 4>let's see this thing,</v>

1678
00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:49.380
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to put my weight behind this at all,</v>

1679
00:40:49.381 --> 00:40:51.300
<v Speaker 4>or I try not to get too political at times.</v>

1680
00:40:51.301 --> 00:40:51.961
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1681
00:40:51.961 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to be outspoken about this shit,</v>

1682
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:54.840
<v Speaker 4>I need to go down there.</v>

1683
00:40:54.841 --> 00:40:55.800
<v Speaker 4>I need to see what it's like.</v>

1684
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.970
<v Speaker 4>And I'm shocked at how many people have framed complex opinions about it and yet</v>

1685
00:40:59.971 --> 00:41:02.010
<v Speaker 4>haven't gone down to actually see one.</v>

1686
00:41:02.011 --> 00:41:02.910
<v Speaker 4>And when I was there,</v>

1687
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.430
<v Speaker 4>the Cross section of society that I ran into,</v>

1688
00:41:05.431 --> 00:41:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I feared didn't exist anymore.</v>

1689
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Truly amazing people.</v>

1690
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.160
<v Speaker 4>There's incredible people that for every avatar dressed up head to toe blue</v>

1691
00:41:14.161 --> 00:41:17.550
<v Speaker 4>hippie that's banging a bongo drum that were three people there of all ages,</v>

1692
00:41:17.551 --> 00:41:22.320
<v Speaker 4>all races that like understood that shit is fucked up in this country and was</v>

1693
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.850
<v Speaker 4>trying to be positive about it and trying to elicit change and,</v>

1694
00:41:25.851 --> 00:41:26.040
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1695
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.150
<v Speaker 4>and so it was really nice feeling.</v>

1696
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there were,</v>

1697
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.780
<v Speaker 4>there were clear demands and there was a,</v>

1698
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1699
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:32.041
<v Speaker 4>a good purpose to it.</v>

1700
00:41:32.041 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Then now it's been a little co-opted.</v>

1701
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 2>How long ago was this?</v>

1702
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:36.990
<v Speaker 2>And they went out there?</v>

1703
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1704
00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I probably week or two ago.</v>

1705
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:42.500
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's being co opted by nefarious forces that are working</v>

1706
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.730
<v Speaker 2>undercover?</v>

1707
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 2>The try to sabotage things?</v>

1708
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1709
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Like the Citi Bank thing?</v>

1710
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.291
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

1711
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1712
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1713
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 2>And what did they do that to every movement?</v>

1714
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1715
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:54.200
<v Speaker 2>from the attack ads to marginalizing the message to entrapment.</v>

1716
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.760
<v Speaker 2>It's costing them a lot of money.</v>

1717
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1718
00:41:56.061 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a New Yorker said something like that,</v>

1719
00:41:57.981 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 2>like they were going to go bankrupt from this,</v>

1720
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.531
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1721
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:02.570
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it was the cash.</v>

1722
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 2>He's got billions.</v>

1723
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1724
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1725
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 2>did you see that mayor job fuck face while this was going on?</v>

1726
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was JP Morgan Chase announced their,</v>

1727
00:42:09.821 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 2>they're huge grant to Nyp d of like four point $6 million or something like</v>

1728
00:42:13.821 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1729
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 2>It might've been billion dollars.</v>

1730
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even joking is probably a million.</v>

1731
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:18.140
<v Speaker 2>You should Google it,</v>

1732
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's literally like as this is going on and the cops are there protecting</v>

1733
00:42:21.111 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street and pepper spraying civilians who are protesting it.</v>

1734
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Jp Morgan is making multimillion dollar donations to the NYP D no.</v>

1735
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.420
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to serve and protect man.</v>

1736
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:33.351
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1737
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:34.760
<v Speaker 2>they might be one or two pensions away,</v>

1738
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>

1739
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to lose their pension.</v>

1740
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Politicians don't fuck with the cops because they know they need them there to</v>

1741
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 2>protect them and protect the bankers.</v>

1742
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.550
<v Speaker 2>That is dark.</v>

1743
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 2>That's why it was inspiring to watch that marine.</v>

1744
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 2>There was a fucking marine colonel that was on the street and you want to talk</v>

1745
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 2>about pit bulls,</v>

1746
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

1747
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1748
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I saw that go.</v>

1749
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 2>That motherfucker was inspiring and people were like,</v>

1750
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.470
<v Speaker 2>he only said three words.</v>

1751
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1752
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 2>it took him three words,</v>

1753
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:56.841
<v Speaker 2>like it was like,</v>

1754
00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 2>there's no honor in this.</v>

1755
00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Which is several more words than that,</v>

1756
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.140
<v Speaker 2>but it took only that from that dude wearing that uniform,</v>

1757
00:43:03.141 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 2>with that intensity to shut those cops down.</v>

1758
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Cops couldn't say shit.</v>

1759
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.100
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't see his metals and shit.</v>

1760
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.970
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys do when you're on horses trampling fucking innocent protest.</v>

1761
00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:15.650
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to protect these people.</v>

1762
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a war zone.</v>

1763
00:43:16.971 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 2>These people don't have guns.</v>

1764
00:43:18.321 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1765
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Why you heard in these people?</v>

1766
00:43:19.491 --> 00:43:19.821
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1767
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:20.840
<v Speaker 2>there's no honor in this.</v>

1768
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.180
<v Speaker 2>That's all it took from that fucking guy.</v>

1769
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.240
<v Speaker 2>P Morgan Chase donates 4.6 million to Nyob during the pro,</v>

1770
00:43:28.881 --> 00:43:30.190
<v Speaker 2>during the protest,</v>

1771
00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:32.390
<v Speaker 2>so that's amazing.</v>

1772
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1773
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.521
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

1774
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Megan's parents as sin.</v>

1775
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 2>It's gross.</v>

1776
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:39.700
<v Speaker 2>This is something that would have happened a long time ago.</v>

1777
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.800
<v Speaker 2>We would would've never heard about it,</v>

1778
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 2>but look at a site that that announcement is on that's on their official</v>

1779
00:43:43.941 --> 00:43:44.774
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>

1780
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they tried to hide this.</v>

1781
00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not like somebody had to go digging up some file to find some back alley</v>

1782
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:50.504
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

1783
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:50.961
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1784
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:51.620
<v Speaker 2>hey world,</v>

1785
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.630
<v Speaker 2>we just donated 4.6 million to the end.</v>

1786
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Why PD?</v>

1787
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 2>That's how good we are as people.</v>

1788
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.593
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

1789
00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 2>how gross.</v>

1790
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.860
<v Speaker 2>And then the cops are acting as if that 4.6 million is worth more than whenever</v>

1791
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:08.120
<v Speaker 2>these fucking regular people pay out of their paychecks.</v>

1792
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Every God damn week and a percentage of that for sure.</v>

1793
00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:11.461
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1794
00:44:11.461 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 2>It has to go to public service.</v>

1795
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 2>The people that are in your community,</v>

1796
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:16.071

00:44:16.071 --> 00:44:20.300
<v Speaker 2>the people that are that are fed up and you are just going to bend over and take</v>

1798
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:23.810
<v Speaker 2>it up to Cooley for 4.6 from some fucking bankers.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Or an Adam Sandler movie that's happening or how much is the movie cost it a lot</v>

1802
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:31.140

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 2>6 million.</v>

1804
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.100

1811
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:45.504

1812
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 4>That would be a terrible weekend.</v>

1813
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.260
<v Speaker 4>So Ah fuck.</v>

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.223
<v Speaker 4>What was</v>

1815
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 4>talking about JP Morgan had announces right in the middle of it.</v>

1816
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:53.550
<v Speaker 4>This is terrifying.</v>

1817
00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:53.890
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1818
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:54.481
<v Speaker 4>so here's what,</v>

1819
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:55.120
<v Speaker 4>here's one,</v>

1820
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 4>one thing I'm going to attempt to do.</v>

1821
00:44:56.491 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to raise some money to do an APP to help facilitate protesters</v>

1822
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1823
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1824
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.183
<v Speaker 4>And how's that work?</v>

1825
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.750
<v Speaker 4>I got a couple ideas.</v>

1826
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1827
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 4>I think right now I'd love to see geolocation mixed media chat rooms that you</v>

1828
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:09.630
<v Speaker 4>can join password protected,</v>

1829
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:10.231
<v Speaker 4>anonymous,</v>

1830
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:10.830
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1831
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.663
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1832
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1833
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.170
<v Speaker 4>you'll log into the room,</v>

1834
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.380
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll create occupy la and people go in there and now we have a mixed media</v>

1835
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 4>shared space with like IRC style moderation,</v>

1836
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:20.810
<v Speaker 4>meaning whoever creates that room can anoint.</v>

1837
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:21.391
<v Speaker 4>If I create a room,</v>

1838
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:23.880
<v Speaker 4>I can give you permission and you permission to post directly to it.</v>

1839
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else chats in a separate area of the APP,</v>

1840
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.500
<v Speaker 4>but allow people to push button,</v>

1841
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:29.400
<v Speaker 4>quick voice message,</v>

1842
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:31.440
<v Speaker 4>chat so you can quickly communicate in a crowd.</v>

1843
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:31.801
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1844

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Kettling us in.</v>

1852
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 4>Pull up the Google maps,</v>

1853
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 4>drop a pin on it and send that out to the group so they can be like,</v>

1854

<v Speaker 4>organized.</v>

1857
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 4>If anybody takes a photo or tries to live stream from within the APP,</v>

1858
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.890
<v Speaker 4>it would be geotag and Hashtag automatically cause you were in that group.</v>

1859
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 4>So when it goes up to the web now,</v>

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.610
<v Speaker 4>like right now I'm trying to follow the protest and they go,</v>

1862
00:45:59.580 --> 00:45:59.911
<v Speaker 4>They weren't,</v>

1863
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:01.230
<v Speaker 4>they were just a a kid in a wheelchair.</v>

1864
00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:02.064
<v Speaker 4>So it's okay.</v>

1865
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1866
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 4>and he was just there after curfew.</v>

1867
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.340
<v Speaker 4>I had to track down four Twitter accounts to find where that was happening and</v>

1868
00:46:07.341 --> 00:46:08.174
<v Speaker 4>click on the protest,</v>

1869
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 4>go to the live stream,</v>

1870
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:10.320
<v Speaker 4>one live stream went down.</v>

1871
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:10.581
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1872
00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:10.890
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1873
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.723
<v Speaker 4>it's inefficient.</v>

1874
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.040
<v Speaker 4>If everybody organized through one channel,</v>

1875
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.121
<v Speaker 4>all their media,</v>

1876
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:17.640
<v Speaker 4>you could pull up a map in real time of all the shit that's going down the</v>

1877
00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:17.821
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1878
00:46:17.821 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Click on a bubble and view it back like a timeline and see when the room</v>

1879
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:21.331
<v Speaker 4>started,</v>

1880
00:46:21.331 --> 00:46:22.141
<v Speaker 4>what people were saying,</v>

1881
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 4>what keywords were popping,</v>

1882
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:24.210
<v Speaker 4>what media was happening,</v>

1883
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.340
<v Speaker 4>where the videos were.</v>

1884
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 4>You could piece up angles based off timestamps and the idea is you could really,</v>

1885
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:32.550
<v Speaker 4>you would have the most honest slice of an event in history that's going on.</v>

1886
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:32.970
<v Speaker 4>It'd be,</v>

1887
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:36.150
<v Speaker 4>I think it would be amazing and would help people on the ground really organized</v>

1888
00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 4>and be safe,</v>

1889
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1890
00:46:37.231 --> 00:46:37.830
<v Speaker 4>safer.</v>

1891
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 4>That's a great idea.</v>

1892
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.930
<v Speaker 4>They're there on Kickster quick,</v>

1893
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.220
<v Speaker 4>so I want to do it on Kickstarter.</v>

1894
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.780
<v Speaker 4>If someone hasn't stolen the idea already,</v>

1895
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.441
<v Speaker 4>I want to do it.</v>

1896
00:46:43.441 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 4>I've already started out and price,</v>

1897
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:45.323
<v Speaker 4>what do you call it?</v>

1898
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.170
<v Speaker 4>We gather.</v>

1899
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 4>How about fuck the police and the underground now because it'll never get,</v>

1900
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 4>it'll never get funding as I think I had it,</v>

1901
00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 4>like I riot fudge the playwright,</v>

1902
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.390
<v Speaker 4>I write it.</v>

1903
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.700
<v Speaker 4>I had a bunch of like angry,</v>

1904
00:46:56.701 --> 00:46:57.331
<v Speaker 4>aggressive names,</v>

1905
00:46:57.331 --> 00:46:58.770
<v Speaker 4>but the way to really sell it as to say,</v>

1906
00:46:58.771 --> 00:46:58.891
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1907
00:46:58.891 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 4>not only can this be used to help facilitate marches,</v>

1908
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:03.540
<v Speaker 4>but if a group of 10 it's going to Disneyland,</v>

1909
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.270
<v Speaker 4>they can all create a group amongst their friends and share their media that</v>

1910
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:06.500
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1911
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:06.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1912
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 4>that's how you should market it entirely.</v>

1913
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:09.170
<v Speaker 4>So what are you gonna call it?</v>

1914
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] we gather it's a social app and I like it.</v>

1915
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Someone touched,</v>

1916
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.510
<v Speaker 4>took the Dotcom and the logo and everything else.</v>

1917
00:47:15.511 --> 00:47:16.344
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1918
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 4>how dare you,</v>

1919
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:18.720
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to get,</v>

1920
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.560
<v Speaker 4>I want the idea out there.</v>

1921
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:20.201
<v Speaker 4>I was going to sell the,</v>

1922
00:47:20.201 --> 00:47:20.960
<v Speaker 4>I was not going to sell.</v>

1923
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1924
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 4>don't steal it.</v>

1925
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I hope if someone can help me make that please.</v>

1926
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you register tonight?</v>

1927
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.320
<v Speaker 4>I could do it.</v>

1928
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.021
<v Speaker 4>I got a specked up.</v>

1929
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:28.970
<v Speaker 4>I know how much it's gonna cost.</v>

1930
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm just going to go out there and</v>

1931
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:30.550
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1932
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Sounds brilliant.</v>

1933
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:31.541
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

1934
00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a brilliant idea.</v>

1935
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be cool.</v>

1936
00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And if you really want your for Disneyland too,</v>

1937
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:36.640
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>

1938
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 2>And if you're at like a fucking Coachella Coachella room with my friends and</v>

1939
00:47:40.001 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 2>then we can keep our room private,</v>

1940
00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:42.070
<v Speaker 2>but promote media ups,</v>

1941
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.180
<v Speaker 2>we can go to the public room.</v>

1942
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.550
<v Speaker 2>So you go to the Kentucky Derby and you get lost.</v>

1943
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:48.010
<v Speaker 2>You were a group of friends or you were just at a cock fight and you want to</v>

1944
00:47:48.011 --> 00:47:48.731
<v Speaker 2>know where your friends are.</v>

1945
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whose wounds roosters on top.</v>

1946
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1947
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.023
<v Speaker 2>We gather.</v>

1948
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:52.973
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea.</v>

1949
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I liked that a lot.</v>

1950
00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:56.020
<v Speaker 2>So you're like a revolutionary look at you.</v>

1951
00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Well how revolutionary would that image be?</v>

1952
00:47:58.261 --> 00:47:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Cause right now the crowds,</v>

1953
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 2>the path of the violence and the confusion comes from panic.</v>

1954
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 2>The panic is coming from a lack of communication.</v>

1955
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:04.660
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

1956
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 2>when you see those people chanting back what people are saying in a park,</v>

1957
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.310
<v Speaker 2>people think they're crazy and it's like a cult.</v>

1958
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.091
<v Speaker 2>It's like actually no,</v>

1959
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 2>they don't allow amplification devices.</v>

1960
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.791
<v Speaker 2>So people were just like,</v>

1961
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:14.650
<v Speaker 2>we'll loudly repeat everything else that's happening.</v>

1962
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:16.180
<v Speaker 2>But you get enough people running a,</v>

1963
00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 2>we gather style APP pop in one ear bud.</v>

1964
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.560
<v Speaker 2>You can still hear what's going on around you.</v>

1965
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.590
<v Speaker 2>You'll know exactly who's connected and who is in that room by the side of the</v>

1966
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:23.951
<v Speaker 2>ear bud.</v>

1967
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 2>And by glancing down at your phone and just fucking push to talk,</v>

1968
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:27.101
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1969
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Kilstein made a tweet.</v>

1970
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 2>This tweet will forever in my mind,</v>

1971
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.960
<v Speaker 2>body what is going on here?</v>

1972
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.520
<v Speaker 2>He made this tweet,</v>

1973
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 2>he was down at occupy Wall Street.</v>

1974
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about how fucking crazy it is.</v>

1975
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 2>He wrote,</v>

1976
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 2>they just arrested a guy because they thought he was the leader,</v>

1977
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1978
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 2>There are no leaders occupy Wall Street Hashtag.</v>

1979
00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:51.461
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1980
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:52.120
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1981
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.810
<v Speaker 2>like what a crazy movement that must be for people where there's not one guy on</v>

1982
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:59.700
<v Speaker 2>a podium with a microphone is true truly democratic movement right now you're</v>

1983

<v Speaker 2>rowing truly democratic going and how the fuck do you silence that comes in.</v>

1984
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:05.980
<v Speaker 2>You got guys like like move on.</v>

1985
00:49:05.981 --> 00:49:10.330
<v Speaker 2>There's a petition on move on site to have them to stop supporting occupy Wall</v>

1986
00:49:10.331 --> 00:49:10.601
<v Speaker 2>Street.</v>

1987
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 2>They're seen as a radical leftist group and and very political and they have</v>

1988
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>their own ties to corporations,</v>

1989
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:16.321
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1990
00:49:16.321 --> 00:49:16.930
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1991
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 2>depending upon who you ask.</v>

1992
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 2>So right now you can't have anybody from a group like that Republican,</v>

1993
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:22.421
<v Speaker 2>Democrat.</v>

1994
00:49:22.421 --> 00:49:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit who cannot have groups with strong political ties.</v>

1995
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Funding your movement and you know and and gathering in interest for your</v>

1996
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:30.130
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

1997
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:33.190
<v Speaker 2>We can't do that because that will be used as fodder to shut it down</v>

1998
00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:34.024
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

1999
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

2000
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.080
<v Speaker 2>We are that the salt political party here,</v>

2001
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no political party involved in any of this.</v>

2002
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.380
<v Speaker 2>There's Republicans out there and libertarians out there.</v>

2003
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of Republicans don't think there were Republicans out there.</v>

2004
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a message that I run into.</v>

2005
00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:49.470
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Republicans are so God damn brainwashed.</v>

2006
00:49:49.471 --> 00:49:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what a Republican is.</v>

2007
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.050
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Republican Democrat,</v>

2008
00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 2>so people that I would have registered to be a republican if I really thought</v>

2009
00:49:55.091 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 2>that Ron Paul had a chance or a that Gary Johnson had a chance.</v>

2010
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.580
<v Speaker 2>W W w what a real republican is supposed to be,</v>

2011
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:02.340
<v Speaker 2>but I was supposed to be about small businesses.</v>

2012
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Stay the fuck out of people's personal lasts.</v>

2013
00:50:03.971 --> 00:50:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Ron Paul.</v>

2014
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:04.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2015
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:05.950
<v Speaker 2>a real Republican.</v>

2016
00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:06.940
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

2017
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't give a shit if you got married.</v>

2018
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:09.371
<v Speaker 2>If you were gay,</v>

2019
00:50:09.371 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 2>a real Republican wouldn't give a shit about what religion you want to practice</v>

2020
00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:13.301
<v Speaker 2>your business.</v>

2021
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>As long as the government doesn't tell me if it's okay.</v>

2022
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Your business [inaudible] republican polar opposite of that right now would</v>

2023
00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 2>never be wanting to intersect religion in with politics.</v>

2024
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 2>W what's gone on in this country is people like always lump themselves</v>

2025
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.000
<v Speaker 1>in a fucking teams,</v>

2026
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 1>whether it's windows versus Mac or the,</v>

2027
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 1>which is why we can't,</v>

2028
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you know why they can't allow a certain group that represents a certain team or</v>

2029
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:39.680
<v Speaker 1>a certain color or fucking animal glom onto their message and they're going to</v>

2030
00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:40.401
<v Speaker 1>have to communicate better.</v>

2031
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 1>To do that is,</v>

2032
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:44.330
<v Speaker 1>this is the big question about this occupy Wall Street thing is that it's</v>

2033
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:49.250
<v Speaker 1>already gotten way past a boiling point and it's gotten to a point where if the</v>

2034
00:50:49.251 --> 00:50:52.730
<v Speaker 1>economy doesn't improve and these people don't have to go back to work,</v>

2035
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.700
<v Speaker 1>well what the fuck is going to stop them from escalating?</v>

2036
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2037
00:50:56.031 --> 00:50:58.730
<v Speaker 1>The fuck is going to stop this from getting bigger and bigger.</v>

2038
00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I love when people give me a job,</v>

2039
00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:00.171
<v Speaker 1>get a,</v>

2044
00:51:02.211 --> 00:51:03.630
<v Speaker 1>why do growing create one for me?</v>

2045
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.480
<v Speaker 1>You talk to create one for me and I'll take it.</v>

2046
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.201
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm out here,</v>

2047
00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:06.840
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody this was get a job.</v>

2049
00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:08.714
<v Speaker 1>Today is an asshole.</v>

2050
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2051
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.010
<v Speaker 1>let's get a job to be interesting to see what happens.</v>

2052
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Come winter.</v>

2053
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 1>It's 10% unemployment and that's just for people who are fucking registering for</v>

2054
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 1>unemployment.</v>

2055
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 1>That people that aren't even know.</v>

2056
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why those numbers are screwing man.</v>

2057
00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Then when they say the countries,</v>

2058
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.590
<v Speaker 1>9% or 10% of what it is,</v>

2059
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 1>that's just people that are like registering for unemployment,</v>

2060
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2061
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 1>How many people are not eligible for unemployment and they're still unemployed,</v>

2062
00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2063
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 1>How many people have used up their unemployment and there's still unemployed?</v>

2064
00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.250
<v Speaker 1>You know it's because of playing world of Warcraft.</v>

2065
00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:38.330
<v Speaker 1>It's because they have no drive.</v>

2066
00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:39.740
<v Speaker 1>It's because they're alcoholics.</v>

2067
00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:40.574
<v Speaker 1>It's because there,</v>

2068
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.090
<v Speaker 1>let's paint whatever negative picture we can on the fact that some people get</v>

2069
00:51:44.091 --> 00:51:46.690
<v Speaker 1>down on their luck sometimes despite Herman Cain,</v>

2070
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:48.351
<v Speaker 1>Herman Cain is,</v>

2071
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it's your bad and your ass bleeding.</v>

2072
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not cause I raped you cause you didn't resist it.</v>

2073
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:53.783
<v Speaker 1>You have a hard enough,</v>

2074
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 1>he's wrong.</v>

2075
00:51:55.431 --> 00:51:56.870
<v Speaker 1>But isn't he right too?</v>

2076
00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he like he,</v>

2077
00:51:57.931 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 1>he's absolutely wrong and there's certainly people in certain situations and</v>

2078
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.391
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2079
00:52:02.391 --> 00:52:04.910
<v Speaker 1>there's for sure people get a shit roll the dice.</v>

2080
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:05.151
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2081
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:05.661
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it,</v>

2082
00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:08.750
<v Speaker 1>we've all seen it and some people are just fucking lazy and want to suck off the</v>

2083
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:12.800
<v Speaker 1>teat and a lot of individual greed led to the situations that we have right now.</v>

2084
00:52:12.801 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2085
00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2086
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:14.700
<v Speaker 1>it's so multifaceted.</v>

2087
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 1>He's right and he's wrong.</v>

2088
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.731
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2089
00:52:16.731 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to say is that his point is,</v>

2090
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 1>it's very simple and generalized,</v>

2091
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is many a person has gone from intense poverty to immense wealth</v>

2092
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.860
<v Speaker 1>and they've done it by bulldog determination,</v>

2093
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but they did it when the game was,</v>

2094
00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:32.540
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2095
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

2096
00:52:33.231 --> 00:52:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I think too,</v>

2097
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.670
<v Speaker 1>we're doing that right now,</v>

2098
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.360
<v Speaker 1>even while the game is rigged harder though it is most certainly so much harder.</v>

2099
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is changed?</v>

2100
00:52:40.451 --> 00:52:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And as far as the game being rigged,</v>

2101
00:52:42.231 --> 00:52:42.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2102
00:52:42.351 --> 00:52:46.070
<v Speaker 1>what is the interest rates are much higher for credit cards and you know,</v>

2103
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:46.251
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2104
00:52:46.251 --> 00:52:47.600
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to get a loan for,</v>

2105
00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:49.650
<v Speaker 1>for businesses to buy a house.</v>

2106
00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Jobs that you can get.</v>

2107
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:51.494
<v Speaker 1>But what other,</v>

2108
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 1>how else has it rigged?</v>

2109
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:53.351
<v Speaker 1>I think like,</v>

2110
00:52:53.351 --> 00:52:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the jobs that you can get right now,</v>

2111
00:52:54.551 --> 00:52:56.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean the dollar is being so manipulated.</v>

2112
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I think first of all,</v>

2113
00:52:57.621 --> 00:52:58.150
<v Speaker 1>t to,</v>

2114
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>to get something big going.</v>

2115
00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you want,</v>

2116
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.580
<v Speaker 1>you want to get Bill Gates money,</v>

2117
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:02.690
<v Speaker 1>you want to get that kind of money.</v>

2118
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 1>You want it to be a baller,</v>

2119
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 1>you gotta make your own shit.</v>

2120
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.900
<v Speaker 1>You gotta make your own shit.</v>

2121
00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.060
<v Speaker 1>You got to create your own thing,</v>

2122
00:53:08.061 --> 00:53:08.691
<v Speaker 1>your own business,</v>

2123
00:53:08.691 --> 00:53:09.231
<v Speaker 1>your own boss.</v>

2124
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:11.090
<v Speaker 1>So we'll do whatever the fuck you got to do.</v>

2125
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 1>But it's gotta be your own thing.</v>

2126
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way you make monumental kind of money.</v>

2127
00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2128
00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:15.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2129
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:16.850
<v Speaker 1>what sucks in this country.</v>

2130
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:17.631
<v Speaker 1>And cellular sucks.</v>

2131
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to start my own,</v>

2132
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:20.720
<v Speaker 1>my own carrier throughout and then make an awesome,</v>

2133
00:53:20.721 --> 00:53:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but the game is rigged against me.</v>

2134
00:53:22.071 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I can't rule out history.</v>

2135
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:24.650
<v Speaker 1>People have figured out a way.</v>

2136
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 1>People have figured out a way in the darkest times to make shit piles of money.</v>

2137
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So he's wrong in,</v>

2138
00:53:29.121 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 1>in generalizing right down,</v>

2139
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:31.320
<v Speaker 1>but he's also right.</v>

2140
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Is this possible?</v>

2141
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just most people aren't willing to do the work to create the possible there</v>

2142
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:36.201
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2143
00:53:36.201 --> 00:53:36.530
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2144
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to become like a madman to become super Uber successful in the middle</v>

2145
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 1>of a fucking wipe down economy,</v>

2146
00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.990
<v Speaker 4>but there is no middle class anymore.</v>

2147
00:53:43.991 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 4>That's what the,</v>

2148
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:44.620
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2149
00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.970
<v Speaker 4>I think it does take that drive.</v>

2150
00:53:45.971 --> 00:53:46.391
<v Speaker 4>It does take,</v>

2151
00:53:46.391 --> 00:53:49.990
<v Speaker 4>I think you said like Steve Jobs ran himself at 11,000 rpm every day and just</v>

2152
00:53:49.991 --> 00:53:50.591
<v Speaker 4>putting himself out.</v>

2153
00:53:50.591 --> 00:53:52.570
<v Speaker 4>It does take that to be at his level,</v>

2154
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.760
<v Speaker 4>but these aren't people in Times Square.</v>

2155
00:53:54.761 --> 00:53:58.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting back to the movie and I don't think these are people that want to be</v>

2156
00:53:58.121 --> 00:53:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Steve jobs necessarily.</v>

2157
00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:00.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2158
00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:01.040
<v Speaker 4>they just want jump.</v>

2159
00:54:01.041 --> 00:54:02.160
<v Speaker 4>They just don't take a job.</v>

2160
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:02.621
<v Speaker 4>I just want it.</v>

2161
00:54:02.621 --> 00:54:03.940
<v Speaker 4>They want a modest house in a modern age,</v>

2162
00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.740
<v Speaker 4>no modest neighborhood used to be able to get them from working possible</v>

2163
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2164
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean for some people I don't think it is</v>

2165
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

2166
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:11.543
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real,</v>

2167
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 1>is that possible?</v>

2168
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:13.314
<v Speaker 1>That something could be,</v>

2169
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:13.951
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

2170
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anything is impossible.</v>

2171
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:16.051
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely not.</v>

2172
00:54:16.051 --> 00:54:17.240
<v Speaker 4>But should we hang our hats on it?</v>

2173
00:54:17.241 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2174
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:17.731
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2175
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:18.520
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2176
00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:18.881
<v Speaker 1>fiber,</v>

2177
00:54:18.881 --> 00:54:19.241
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

2178
00:54:19.241 --> 00:54:20.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say the unemployment,</v>

2179
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:22.450
<v Speaker 1>the legit unemployment numbers,</v>

2180
00:54:22.451 --> 00:54:23.980
<v Speaker 1>15% is probably worse than that,</v>

2181
00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:26.050
<v Speaker 1>but let's say it's 15% nationwide.</v>

2182
00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:29.800
<v Speaker 1>It's still means 85% of the people who are working and if 85% of the people</v>

2183
00:54:29.801 --> 00:54:30.161
<v Speaker 1>we're working,</v>

2184
00:54:30.161 --> 00:54:30.910
<v Speaker 1>why can't you work?</v>

2185
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:31.181
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

2186
00:54:31.181 --> 00:54:31.481
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

2187
00:54:31.481 --> 00:54:32.740
<v Speaker 1>is there a way to get through,</v>

2188
00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:33.574
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2189
00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.151
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2190
00:54:34.151 --> 00:54:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you can't really say there is no middle class for sure.</v>

2191
00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.540
<v Speaker 1>The situation is fucked up for sure.</v>

2192
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.960
<v Speaker 1>We're in a terrible financial situation where we've realized that we've been</v>

2193
00:54:43.961 --> 00:54:45.100
<v Speaker 1>scammed all these years,</v>

2194
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.460
<v Speaker 1>essentially defrauded and lied to and w you know,</v>

2195
00:54:48.461 --> 00:54:49.241
<v Speaker 1>we have a congress.</v>

2196
00:54:49.241 --> 00:54:50.350
<v Speaker 1>It's bought and paid for it.</v>

2197
00:54:50.351 --> 00:54:50.650
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

2198
00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:51.483
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious.</v>

2199
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.241
<v Speaker 1>No one's,</v>

2200
00:54:52.241 --> 00:54:54.040
<v Speaker 1>no one's prosecuting any of these fucks you up.</v>

2201
00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:55.480
<v Speaker 1>They're going after pot is,</v>

2202
00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2203
00:54:56.021 --> 00:54:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you know what's,</v>

2204
00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:00.610
<v Speaker 1>what's going on is shameful in 2011 with the Internet,</v>

2205
00:55:00.611 --> 00:55:03.460
<v Speaker 1>with the access to information that we have that the government conducts its</v>

2206
00:55:03.461 --> 00:55:06.850
<v Speaker 1>business this way is absolutely completely shameful,</v>

2207
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:08.440
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>

2208
00:55:08.441 --> 00:55:10.300
<v Speaker 1>some people are still doing okay.</v>

2209
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Some people are still getting,</v>

2210
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those people I'm doing all right.</v>

2211
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.610
<v Speaker 4>I made some opportunities to myself.</v>

2212
00:55:15.611 --> 00:55:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I've been working my ass off since I was 12 years old.</v>

2213
00:55:17.381 --> 00:55:17.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2214
00:55:17.531 --> 00:55:18.341
<v Speaker 4>I think it's possible,</v>

2215
00:55:18.341 --> 00:55:18.881
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

2216
00:55:18.881 --> 00:55:19.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2217
00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying there isn't a middle class.</v>

2218
00:55:20.831 --> 00:55:21.730
<v Speaker 4>They're clearly still is,</v>

2219
00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.070
<v Speaker 4>but it is shrinking exponentially.</v>

2220
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:29.590
<v Speaker 4>Be of Bay just offloaded a bunch of fucking bad assets to a two to a branch of</v>

2221
00:55:29.591 --> 00:55:29.891
<v Speaker 4>their arm.</v>

2222
00:55:29.891 --> 00:55:34.480
<v Speaker 4>It's FDI seed have dic insured here in the states that were European assets.</v>

2223
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:35.270
<v Speaker 4>They did this thing,</v>

2224
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.630
<v Speaker 4>it's not supposed to be legal swiped over a bunch of stuff.</v>

2225
00:55:37.631 --> 00:55:38.770
<v Speaker 4>So if the euro fails,</v>

2226
00:55:38.771 --> 00:55:40.240
<v Speaker 4>if there's a financial crisis there,</v>

2227
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:44.320
<v Speaker 4>the American taxpayers could end up bailing out the European banks by</v>

2228
00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:45.250
<v Speaker 4>transferring their assets.</v>

2229
00:55:45.251 --> 00:55:45.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2230
00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:46.000
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2231
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.833
<v Speaker 4>so again,</v>

2232
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing all right right now bank of America too,</v>

2233
00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:50.241
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

2234
00:55:50.241 --> 00:55:53.560
<v Speaker 4>who's the one guy that just donated a shitload of money to Bank of America?</v>

2235
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.560
<v Speaker 4>Like some singer or something like that,</v>

2236
00:55:56.561 --> 00:56:01.150
<v Speaker 4>just donated a shitload of money to a bank to bank and Aragon singer.</v>

2237
00:56:01.151 --> 00:56:02.530
<v Speaker 4>There's some celebrity guy here,</v>

2238
00:56:02.531 --> 00:56:03.100
<v Speaker 4>I'll find out.</v>

2239
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2240
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:03.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2241
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:04.260
<v Speaker 1>find out.</v>

2242
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of anybody don't money to a bank.</v>

2243
00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:07.220
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

2244
00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.560
<v Speaker 4>With all the connectivity that we have in this day and age,</v>

2245
00:56:09.561 --> 00:56:10.101
<v Speaker 4>just as you're saying,</v>

2246
00:56:10.101 --> 00:56:12.020
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy that the government is run the way it is,</v>

2247
00:56:12.021 --> 00:56:12.241
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2248
00:56:12.241 --> 00:56:12.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2249
00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:13.840
<v Speaker 4>When I going to pay taxes,</v>

2250
00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:15.590
<v Speaker 4>that's what this protest is all about.</v>

2251
00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:17.030
<v Speaker 4>A week.</v>

2252
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:18.860
<v Speaker 4>But so this is,</v>

2253
00:56:18.861 --> 00:56:19.910
<v Speaker 4>this is a pipe dream,</v>

2254
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:20.811
<v Speaker 4>but why not?</v>

2255
00:56:20.811 --> 00:56:21.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2256
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.220
<v Speaker 4>I pay my taxes online,</v>

2257
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:23.083
<v Speaker 4>pay a lot of taxes,</v>

2258
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:23.640
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2259
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 4>And they</v>

2260
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.210
<v Speaker 1>trusted enough to be verified and it's my social security number and blah,</v>

2261
00:56:27.211 --> 00:56:27.381
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2262
00:56:27.381 --> 00:56:27.731
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2263
00:56:27.731 --> 00:56:29.860
<v Speaker 1>and there's the amount that I'm paying and the government takes it state and</v>

2264
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 1>federal,</v>

2265
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:30.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2266
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2267
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 1>If I can pay my taxes online,</v>

2268
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:33.610
<v Speaker 1>we can do a system that does that.</v>

2269
00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I pay my taxes and then a portion of those taxes directly to the funds</v>

2270
00:56:39.011 --> 00:56:41.080
<v Speaker 1>and the projects and the things that I want.</v>

2271
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Let me vote truly democratically with my dollars.</v>

2272
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:43.871
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2273
00:56:43.871 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 1>if we have to set minimum levels,</v>

2274
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:45.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2275
00:56:45.581 --> 00:56:47.890
<v Speaker 1>for defense spending or you know,</v>

2276
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2277
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you're talking crazy now.</v>

2278
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2279
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:50.531
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>

2280
00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:51.550
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a democracy,</v>

2281
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but why not dream as a representative free book,</v>

2282
00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:56.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2283
00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what we are represented by a handful of people that the commercial zone,</v>

2284
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't even get to know where your money goes.</v>

2285
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:03.541
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2286
00:57:03.541 --> 00:57:04.790
<v Speaker 1>they don't even have to give you a receipt.</v>

2287
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.080
<v Speaker 1>How great would that be if I could decide where it's going to be sad by the way</v>

2288
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:08.681
<v Speaker 1>that you pay,</v>

2289
00:57:08.681 --> 00:57:09.514
<v Speaker 1>like what do you,</v>

2290
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you're probably in like a 38% tax bracket or something,</v>

2291
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:12.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2292
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:12.850
<v Speaker 1>You're doing really well.</v>

2293
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:13.401
<v Speaker 1>One year,</v>

2294
00:57:13.401 --> 00:57:13.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2295
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 1>when I wasn't incorporated.</v>

2296
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Like now I'm a quarter,</v>

2297
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 1>like a work for myself as a corporation.</v>

2298
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.970
<v Speaker 1>But the last year that I wasn't,</v>

2299
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I paid 43 or 47% of my income to taxes.</v>

2300
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's just round that bitch off the half.</v>

2301
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You're paying half of your money.</v>

2302
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Half of it.</v>

2303
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:29.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't even get a statement that says,</v>

2304
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:30.430
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2305
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:32.440
<v Speaker 1>you helped fix a road.</v>

2306
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You helped pay for cops.</v>

2307
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 1>You helped support firefighters.</v>

2308
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:38.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't even get a fucking receipt.</v>

2309
00:57:38.591 --> 00:57:39.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to tell you shit.</v>

2310
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:40.863
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2311
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:41.763
<v Speaker 1>Warren Buffet,</v>

2312
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Warren Buffet donate it to Bank of America and he,</v>

2313
00:57:44.951 --> 00:57:45.784
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2314
00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2315
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I think he bought a bunch of stocks.</v>

2316
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:49.773
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2317
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:52.090
<v Speaker 1>he bought 357 million.</v>

2318
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:52.641
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's been?</v>

2319
00:57:52.641 --> 00:57:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Stock investors.</v>

2320
00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:56.260
<v Speaker 1>5 billion and Bank of America.</v>

2321
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:56.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2322
00:57:56.711 --> 00:57:58.090
<v Speaker 1>well that's not donating buddy.</v>

2323
00:57:59.080 --> 00:57:59.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2324
00:57:59.231 --> 00:57:59.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2325
00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 1>but he did it too to help them.</v>

2326
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what his reasoning was.</v>

2327
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:04.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was purely altruistic.</v>

2328
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:06.550
<v Speaker 1>He's also old as fuck and doesn't give a shit.</v>

2329
00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird cat.</v>

2330
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:09.490
<v Speaker 1>That guy lives in like a regular house.</v>

2331
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:09.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2332
00:58:09.971 --> 00:58:10.571
<v Speaker 1>he's a super,</v>

2333
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:10.901
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

2334
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:11.561
<v Speaker 1>super rich guy.</v>

2335
00:58:11.561 --> 00:58:13.210
<v Speaker 1>He lives in like Middle America,</v>

2336
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.050
<v Speaker 1>lives in a regular high,</v>

2337
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 1>really does not live extravagantly by any means.</v>

2338
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:20.410
<v Speaker 1>And he is apparently a donated,</v>

2339
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:24.610
<v Speaker 1>a substantial portion of his riches to charities when he dies.</v>

2340
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Good for him.</v>

2341
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Good for him.</v>

2342
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:26.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2343
00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting cat that Warren Buffet.</v>

2344
00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:28.511
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

2345
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I've heard,</v>

2346
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him vilified several times so that's nice to hear.</v>

2347
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 1>It feels bad for all the creepy shit that he did to get a hundred fucking</v>

2348
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:35.650
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars or whatever.</v>

2349
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.120
<v Speaker 1>He's got stashed under his mattress.</v>

2350
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.841
<v Speaker 1>He just worked hard.</v>

2351
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:38.141
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

2352
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:38.891
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can do it.</v>

2353
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible.</v>

2354
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.730
<v Speaker 1>You would talking about the videos that disturbed you in that video of the um,</v>

2355
00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:45.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2356
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.140
<v Speaker 1>the dog's getting killed earlier.</v>

2357
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:49.720
<v Speaker 1>There's something to disturb me way more and I couldn't even watch it.</v>

2358
00:58:49.721 --> 00:58:50.531
<v Speaker 1>I just heard about it.</v>

2359
00:58:50.531 --> 00:58:52.510
<v Speaker 1>It was a baby getting run over and China,</v>

2360
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.650
<v Speaker 1>the baby got run over,</v>

2361
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:56.740
<v Speaker 1>back and forth like a bunch of times when people stepped over the body of the</v>

2362
00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:56.981
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>

2363
00:58:56.981 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 1>this video of them stepping over it and nobody did a God damn thing about,</v>

2364
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:01.650
<v Speaker 1>it was a two year old baby just wandering around.</v>

2365
00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Run over by a truck.</v>

2366
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 1>The truck sees it or run over.</v>

2367
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:04.580
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2368
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:05.440
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything about it.</v>

2369
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.191
<v Speaker 1>Gets back in the car,</v>

2370
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 1>runs over it again with its back with the back wheels and then another person</v>

2371
00:59:09.251 --> 00:59:09.610
<v Speaker 1>runs over.</v>

2372
00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:10.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2373
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.120
<v Speaker 1>we as human beings,</v>

2374
00:59:13.121 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2375
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2376
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 1>we have to look at what do we like at our worst,</v>

2377
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:17.630
<v Speaker 1>what do we like at the,</v>

2378
00:59:17.631 --> 00:59:17.911
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

2379
00:59:17.911 --> 00:59:19.960
<v Speaker 1>the most callous and unloving.</v>

2380
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.150
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be an example of that right up there with war.</v>

2381
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 1>At least leave a note like,</v>

2382
00:59:25.071 --> 00:59:26.090
<v Speaker 1>sorry I hit your baby.</v>

2383
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Here's my license plate.</v>

2384
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm insured.</v>

2385
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You got to at least do that cause that's fucked up.</v>

2386
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know who's fucking baby was just wandering around the streets,</v>

2387
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:33.561
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2388
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:33.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2389
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:34.390
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

2390
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:35.990
<v Speaker 1>there was no one that did anything about it.</v>

2391
00:59:35.991 --> 00:59:37.460
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know the baby was run over.</v>

2392
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:38.390
<v Speaker 1>There was no screaming.</v>

2393
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:38.781
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

2394
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:39.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

2395
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:39.944
<v Speaker 1>where's my baby?</v>

2396
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It just when,</v>

2397
00:59:41.181 --> 00:59:45.830
<v Speaker 1>when population density gets to a certain number and the value of life</v>

2398
00:59:45.831 --> 00:59:50.120
<v Speaker 1>diminishes because it's just too many God damn humans and literally not enough</v>

2399
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 1>food for people.</v>

2400
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 1>So instead of someone being valuable,</v>

2401
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you're actually a hindrance.</v>

2402
00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's a hindrance or a resource drain.</v>

2403
00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:57.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

2404
00:59:57.921 --> 00:59:58.371
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

2405
00:59:58.371 --> 00:59:58.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2406
00:59:58.611 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what you are at times.</v>

2407
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:04.460
<v Speaker 1>And thankfully Siri is going to figure out how to turn us all into batteries and</v>

2408
01:00:04.461 --> 01:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>the Matrix is going to fucking happen.</v>

2409
01:00:05.961 --> 01:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>

2410
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Siri is going to figure that shit out.</v>

2411
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:08.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2412
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:09.620
<v Speaker 1>if it's not that and maybe aliens,</v>

2413
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:09.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2414
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've always said about aliens,</v>

2415
01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:12.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2416
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>people think I have several friends that are obsessed with aliens.</v>

2417
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo being the biggest one.</v>

2418
01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2419
01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>he fucking loves you.</v>

2420
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Loves the idea that there's,</v>

2421
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>they're out there,</v>

2422
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.931
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2423
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>They're out there.</v>

2424
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's so exciting for him.</v>

2425
01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It's so sexy for him.</v>

2426
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.931
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

2427
01:00:23.931 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so convinced.</v>

2428
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:25.051
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2429
01:00:25.051 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I look at around at all the God damn video footage that people have on their</v>

2430
01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:29.121
<v Speaker 1>cell phones.</v>

2431
01:00:29.121 --> 01:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>And then I see the video footage of Ufo and I'm like,</v>

2432
01:00:31.701 --> 01:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>this is horse shit.</v>

2433
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

2434
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.463
<v Speaker 1>these are fake.</v>

2435
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And they just smelled to me,</v>

2436
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:35.984
<v Speaker 1>they all stink.</v>

2437
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Nothing seems real.</v>

2438
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>There's not a single fucking video of anyone,</v>

2439
01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2440
01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>spotting a little gray man running around in their backyard.</v>

2441
01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.613
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2442
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't mean it's not real.</v>

2443
01:00:45.111 --> 01:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that if they were here,</v>

2444
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't avoid detection.</v>

2445
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>But I don't believe it.</v>

2446
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>And my other take on it is that if they did exist,</v>

2447
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>we probably wouldn't want them here.</v>

2448
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.431
<v Speaker 1>Because guess what?</v>

2449
01:00:55.431 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to just let us run things as usual and give us more</v>

2450
01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>information so we can blow each other up quicker.</v>

2451
01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2452
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>they're going to treat us the same way we treat dolphins and whales.</v>

2453
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck about them.</v>

2454
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:07.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2455
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:07.651
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2456
01:01:07.651 --> 01:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>we kill whales every day.</v>

2457
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:09.531
<v Speaker 1>Not We,</v>

2458
01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:10.341
<v Speaker 1>not you and I obviously,</v>

2459
01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but people in this,</v>

2460
01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>in this world kill whales.</v>

2461
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>

2462
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>We take dolphins,</v>

2463
01:01:13.641 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>we Americans do,</v>

2464
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>and we locked them in fish tanks.</v>

2465
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>We take these amazing animals and we put them in a fucking swimming pool and we</v>

2466
01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>don't give a shit about them.</v>

2467
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:21.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2468
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>we really don't.</v>

2469
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:22.601
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2470
01:01:22.601 --> 01:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>we just want them animals escaped from a zoo.</v>

2471
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's cause you put it in a prison.</v>

2472
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:27.771
<v Speaker 1>It escaped.</v>

2473
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:28.604
<v Speaker 1>It went home,</v>

2474
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

2475
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Get free of your fucking then escape.</v>

2476
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.931
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2477
01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you lock this guy up for nothing,</v>

2478
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.043
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>

2479
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Why would we think that anything more intelligent than us would treat us any</v>

2480
01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>differently than we treat the most intelligent things that we're aware of.</v>

2481
01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees and dolphins and the most Intel and an orchestra,</v>

2482
01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>the most intelligent things that we're aware of,</v>

2483
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>we just locked them up.</v>

2484
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck,</v>

2485
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2486
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:51.351
<v Speaker 1>We put,</v>

2487
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>we experiment on them and we put them in cages.</v>

2488
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.300
<v Speaker 1>We teach them how to do tricks for our amusement.</v>

2489
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:56.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2490
01:01:56.811 --> 01:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would we think that aliens would do anything different if we steal</v>

2491
01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:00.951
<v Speaker 1>their babies?</v>

2492
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2493
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>

2494
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:03.404
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

2495
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>orchids,</v>

2496
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>we steal their fucking babies.</v>

2497
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.160
<v Speaker 1>What if we are a zoo for the aliens?</v>

2498
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>We very well could be man very well,</v>

2499
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>but they are just walking around right now.</v>

2500
01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Invisible women can't believe they're doing that shit.</v>

2501
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:13.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2502
01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Well let's,</v>

2503
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>let's make this guy do that and see what happens.</v>

2504
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2505
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:16.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2506
01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>if you think about,</v>

2507
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>you know what we're capable of right now,</v>

2508
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>he'd ever go to the wild animal park in San Diego.</v>

2509
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2510
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>

2511
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:23.941
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2512
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>

2513
01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:25.194
<v Speaker 1>huge place.</v>

2514
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You drive around there.</v>

2515
01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean these animals have habitat.</v>

2516
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2517
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever feed the giraffes?</v>

2518
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.351
<v Speaker 1>I actually never went there,</v>

2519
01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>but that's where Cliffy B is getting married.</v>

2520
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:33.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2521
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:33.571
<v Speaker 1>is he really?</v>

2522
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2523
01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

2524
01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Like on a draft or I somehow got it set up.</v>

2525
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:37.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2526
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>he's going get,</v>

2527
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>he's a crafty dude.</v>

2528
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:39.834
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like something.</v>

2529
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

2530
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing setup.</v>

2531
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of room.</v>

2532
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>These animals,</v>

2533
01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not ideal,</v>

2534
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.773
<v Speaker 1>but they have a lot of room.</v>

2535
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So just extrapolate that,</v>

2536
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>take that to a hundred million years of evolution or whatever the fuck,</v>

2537
01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:50.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2538
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>who knows how long,</v>

2539
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2540
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>life can exist on uncertain planets and they could be so fucking sophisticated.</v>

2541
01:02:56.191 --> 01:02:59.460
<v Speaker 1>They could have like not just created a planet,</v>

2542
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2543
01:03:00.571 --> 01:03:02.880
<v Speaker 1>but engineered our whole environment.</v>

2544
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:03.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2545
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>what happens here on earth,</v>

2546
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:08.310
<v Speaker 1>the same way we do it with the ants and video games are now people in the</v>

2547
01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:08.671
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

2548
01:03:08.671 --> 01:03:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2549
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.043
<v Speaker 1>what if they just,</v>

2550
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:10.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2551
01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:10.561
<v Speaker 1>let's see what,</v>

2552
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 1>let's see how this one turns out.</v>

2553
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if the whole idea of asteroidal impacts and you know,</v>

2554
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>a mass extinction events was actually a program cycle that we're just not aware</v>

2555
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

2556
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2557
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.000
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2558
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:21.221
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2559
01:03:21.221 --> 01:03:21.481
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2560
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>we just are still assuming that there's sort of a random nature to all these</v>

2561
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.600
<v Speaker 1>rocks out there colliding,</v>

2562
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 1>but really they just happen every certain amount of millions of years.</v>

2563
01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just some sort of a global reset.</v>

2564
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.340
<v Speaker 1>It just keeps going on getting defragged until your,</v>

2565
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:42.840
<v Speaker 1>until your civilization becomes so intelligent that it can spot it and prevent</v>

2566
01:03:42.841 --> 01:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2567
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:43.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2568
01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>that's the mad race to test the mad race is to get off the planet at some sort</v>

2569
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:48.990
<v Speaker 1>of an artificial environment that you control,</v>

2570
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:53.991
<v Speaker 1>be it a large space ship or a giant artificial plant and to avoid all the cosmic</v>

2571
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.100
<v Speaker 1>impacts,</v>

2572
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.720
<v Speaker 1>solar flares,</v>

2573
01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2574
01:03:58.711 --> 01:03:59.081
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

2575
01:03:59.081 --> 01:04:01.530
<v Speaker 1>the really big shit that happened supernovas you know,</v>

2576
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>

2577
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>when hyper Novas happened,</v>

2578
01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:03.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2579
01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:07.620
<v Speaker 1>everything anywhere near it in the galaxy just gets cooked instantly and that</v>

2580
01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 1>shit can happen to us.</v>

2581
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I hate that I wasn't fucking alive for the space race and serious these</v>

2582
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.033
<v Speaker 1>railings,</v>

2583
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.001
<v Speaker 1>the notion of it,</v>

2584
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:18.420
<v Speaker 1>and it might be that I've absorbed not as much,</v>

2585
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>it's more about who can fire lasers from satellites now.</v>

2586
01:04:20.641 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not about like let's explore and I know that was the bill of goods that</v>

2587
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:24.691
<v Speaker 1>were sold.</v>

2588
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it had a lot to do with the fence testing and everything else.</v>

2589
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:28.070
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2590
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.490
<v Speaker 1>if all the money that we did,</v>

2591
01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>and I know this is,</v>

2592
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>this is just me wishing we could vote with our tax dollars again,</v>

2593
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but like if a fraction of the money we've spent blowing shit up and some other</v>

2594
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:39.510
<v Speaker 1>fucking country was spent to just solving something like,</v>

2595
01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:39.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2596
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>a problem for humanity here.</v>

2597
01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:41.341
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2598
01:04:41.341 --> 01:04:41.870
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

2599
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>It can be leaders again and we can be positively revered and we could fucking</v>

2600
01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>help the world.</v>

2601
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:47.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2602
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Well not even just dad.</v>

2603
01:04:48.661 --> 01:04:49.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean just,</v>

2604
01:04:49.141 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sing that and curiosity,</v>

2605
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.280
<v Speaker 1>curiosity of expression of,</v>

2606
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2607
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>traveling the fucking universe and finding out what,</v>

2608
01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>what it is like on Mars.</v>

2609
01:04:58.291 --> 01:04:58.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2610
01:04:58.471 --> 01:05:02.810
<v Speaker 1>have you have humans set up some sort of a civilization on Mars where they,</v>

2611
01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:03.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2612
01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:03.361
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2613
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:04.021
<v Speaker 1>what is that called,</v>

2614
01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:04.291
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>

2615
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2616
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you take a total recall.</v>

2617
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.840
<v Speaker 1>No way you'd take a,</v>

2618
01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>an environment and you,</v>

2619
01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2620
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>you sort of engineer it to a Gio,</v>

2621
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Gio forming geo forming,</v>

2622
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>you recreating more ozone.</v>

2623
01:05:16.151 --> 01:05:16.351
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2624
01:05:16.351 --> 01:05:16.831
<v Speaker 1>let's do that.</v>

2625
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>We need more.</v>

2626
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's ship</v>

2627
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.410
<v Speaker 2>that in creating a form on this level and environment.</v>

2628
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2629
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.050
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2630
01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.600
<v Speaker 2>they said that you could do this,</v>

2631
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.720
<v Speaker 2>that you could take machines and you could build them on Mars.</v>

2632
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:26.381
<v Speaker 2>Massive,</v>

2633
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.191
<v Speaker 2>massive machines,</v>

2634
01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:28.840
<v Speaker 2>like literally the size of cities.</v>

2635
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Like it would be like a Manhattan size machine and that machine would just be</v>

2636
01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:36.800
<v Speaker 2>pumping oxygen into the environment and that somehow or another with,</v>

2637
01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 2>it's called the reactor and Quade starts it with his alien hand.</v>

2638
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Did you didn't see total recall?</v>

2639
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:42.761
<v Speaker 2>I did see that.</v>

2640
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>So is that what it was until it hits the reactor reactor and the rods go in and</v>

2641
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>the fucking oxygen on the planet?</v>

2642
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:49.841
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2643
01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:50.331
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2644
01:05:50.331 --> 01:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>It stopped Arnold's head from freaking out when he's on the side of the</v>

2645
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:53.344
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

2646
01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2647
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 2>That's some stupid movies actually based on real scientific ideas.</v>

2648
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.850
<v Speaker 2>The threat boob thing,</v>

2649
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:02.043
<v Speaker 2>every boob</v>

2650
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:05.080
<v Speaker 2>implant and the third one,</v>

2651
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 2>no one's ever done it.</v>

2652
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.420
<v Speaker 2>You know when girls have three Nipples,</v>

2653
01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of a girl really having three nibbles.</v>

2654
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2655
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen one?</v>

2656
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:10.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2657
01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2658
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I know guys and girls that have three nipples.</v>

2659
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2660
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:14.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2661
01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:17.620
<v Speaker 2>It's creepy because it's just like the nipple part is not the areola.</v>

2662
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

2663
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like it like this weird nipple.</v>

2664
01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I guess that'll all freak show genetic mishaps.</v>

2665
01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 2>You can have that ain't that bad.</v>

2666
01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

2667
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Nipple,</v>

2668
01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.590
<v Speaker 2>who's going to complain,</v>

2669
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2670
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:28.390
<v Speaker 2>just tried testicle.</v>

2671
01:06:28.391 --> 01:06:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be that bad either.</v>

2672
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2673
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.840
<v Speaker 2>What if your loads are just overwhelming?</v>

2674
01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some guys want that.</v>

2675
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:35.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2676
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:36.274
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was too much.</v>

2677
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I saw a product called Max load next to the checkout counter,</v>

2678
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:42.210
<v Speaker 2>GNC on the counter.</v>

2679
01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:42.911
<v Speaker 2>I took a photo of,</v>

2680
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it made me laugh so hard.</v>

2681
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted it and it said come harder,</v>

2682
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.930
<v Speaker 2>come longer,</v>

2683
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.130
<v Speaker 2>come better.</v>

2684
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 2>And it was like three hits and it was like,</v>

2685
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 2>fucking Max load on the,</v>

2687
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>on the counter that but at the checkout counter like we're gonna take a penny.</v>

2688
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:55.631
<v Speaker 2>Leave a penny.</v>

2689
01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:55.931
<v Speaker 2>Should be.</v>

2690
01:06:55.931 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 2>It was like dudes come harder.</v>

2691
01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:58.541
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2692
01:06:58.541 --> 01:06:59.660
<v Speaker 2>that was on the counter at the genes.</v>

2693
01:06:59.661 --> 01:07:00.281
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2694
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:01.440
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy world we live in.</v>

2695
01:07:01.441 --> 01:07:02.470
<v Speaker 2>That king did not work.</v>

2696
01:07:02.471 --> 01:07:03.700
<v Speaker 2>That is into network.</v>

2697
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Didn't work at all.</v>

2698
01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I fucking came pixie dust for like a week.</v>

2699
01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:07.200
<v Speaker 2>A little girl.</v>

2700
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just glitter and wishes.</v>

2701
01:07:08.551 --> 01:07:09.384
<v Speaker 2>It tastes different.</v>

2702
01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:10.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2703
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:11.043
<v Speaker 2>no citrusy.</v>

2704
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's the internet that's got people so desensitized pills porn</v>

2705
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:18.370
<v Speaker 2>now where they're using fake Dick's and pumping gallons of fake semen out of</v>

2706
01:07:18.371 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2707
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this splash all over people.</v>

2708
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.100
<v Speaker 2>They're doing like drive by cum shots like splattering girls that it just</v>

2709
01:07:24.101 --> 01:07:26.530
<v Speaker 2>walking down the sidewalk actually pretty funny.</v>

2710
01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:26.891
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

2711
01:07:26.891 --> 01:07:30.160
<v Speaker 2>If that's how the gang settled their warfare with tried by cum shots.</v>

2712
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:31.230
<v Speaker 2>That's actually pretty funny.</v>

2713
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

2714
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Well what are they going to do when CGI gets to a point where everybody can</v>

2715
01:07:34.631 --> 01:07:35.590
<v Speaker 2>afford to including,</v>

2716
01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:36.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2717
01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:37.014
<v Speaker 2>porn companies.</v>

2718
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2719
01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And they got a phone.</v>

2720
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.550
<v Speaker 2>It'll be a real time.</v>

2721
01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Have like,</v>

2722
01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:39.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2723
01:07:39.411 --> 01:07:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Japanese,</v>

2724
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2725
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.630
<v Speaker 2>what is that called?</v>

2726
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 2>That [inaudible] tentacles.</v>

2727
01:07:43.781 --> 01:07:44.614
<v Speaker 2>Look we'll have,</v>

2728
01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.431
<v Speaker 2>they'll have that,</v>

2729
01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:48.040
<v Speaker 2>but realistic human form.</v>

2730
01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:48.874
<v Speaker 2>They're so close.</v>

2731
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.780
<v Speaker 2>They're so close.</v>

2732
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2733
01:07:50.321 --> 01:07:51.051
<v Speaker 2>Women will just get it.</v>

2734
01:07:51.051 --> 01:07:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be procedurally generated.</v>

2735
01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:52.901
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

2736
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:56.020
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna be able to go to a website and through series and knobs select</v>

2737
01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:57.460
<v Speaker 2>exactly the kind of woman you want.</v>

2738
01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Fucking slider her tits.</v>

2739
01:07:59.140 --> 01:07:59.973
<v Speaker 2>Choose her height,</v>

2740
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:00.933
<v Speaker 2>the hair color.</v>

2741
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.200
<v Speaker 2>So like the scenes in positions and hit play and that shit is going to auto</v>

2742
01:08:04.201 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>generate and it's going to destroy humanity.</v>

2743
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:07.350
<v Speaker 2>What will happen first?</v>

2744
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Holograms or virtual reality that's super realistic.</v>

2745
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2746
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.480
<v Speaker 2>it depends on your definition of super realistic.</v>

2747
01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:13.871
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

2748
01:08:13.871 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>like virtual reality isn't true virtual reality,</v>

2749
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.600
<v Speaker 4>unless the shit is being into my brain,</v>

2750
01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 4>it'd be being beamed into it or electrified and do,</v>

2751
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:22.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if it's through a helmet or a glove,</v>

2752
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 4>but until my brain is being tricked to imagine ones and Zeros,</v>

2753
01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:27.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to call Vr VR.</v>

2754
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's impossible to do that without some sort of an electronic aid</v>

2755
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>or do you think that there'll be able to figure out?</v>

2756
01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I thought at one point in time,</v>

2757
01:08:34.431 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about the science behind this cause this is all just out of my</v>

2758
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:37.394
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>

2759
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:42.550
<v Speaker 1>but that there may be a frequency that they can tune into that the human mind</v>

2760
01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>can tune into for whatever reason,</v>

2761
01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:48.200
<v Speaker 1>they may be able to find a frequency that you could tune into where when you put</v>

2762
01:08:48.201 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a relaxed state,</v>

2763
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>it can generate thoughts.</v>

2764
01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:51.101
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2765
01:08:51.101 --> 01:08:53.290
<v Speaker 4>I think I just had a bizarre thought about that.</v>

2766
01:08:53.291 --> 01:08:53.531
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2767
01:08:53.531 --> 01:08:54.940
<v Speaker 4>now what they'll do is they'll engineer,</v>

2768
01:08:54.941 --> 01:08:56.320
<v Speaker 4>cause I get the transhumanism thing.</v>

2769
01:08:56.321 --> 01:08:56.730
<v Speaker 4>They'll enter,</v>

2770
01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:59.440
<v Speaker 4>like they'll create a chip first that allows you to perceive that,</v>

2771
01:08:59.441 --> 01:09:00.730
<v Speaker 4>but you'll stay in the power to generate it.</v>

2772
01:09:00.731 --> 01:09:04.840
<v Speaker 4>But then we'll get so good with like fucking manipulating molecules and DNA.</v>

2773
01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.740
<v Speaker 4>We'll create the cell that will be put into something virus style that gives</v>

2774
01:09:08.741 --> 01:09:10.090
<v Speaker 4>people perception to that.</v>

2775
01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.400
<v Speaker 4>So imagine like a chip for Bluetooth or Wifi.</v>

2776
01:09:12.401 --> 01:09:13.510
<v Speaker 4>We're going to engineer that on a,</v>

2777
01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.050
<v Speaker 4>on a biochemical level so that you can now perceive this thing.</v>

2778
01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:18.940
<v Speaker 4>So you and I can communicate telepathically.</v>

2779
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.010
<v Speaker 4>This device can be the images into me.</v>

2780
01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2781
01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:22.871
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

2782
01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:23.081
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2783
01:09:23.081 --> 01:09:24.440
<v Speaker 4>Why Not Lucia?</v>

2784
01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:25.090
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2785
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:25.421
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

2786
01:09:25.421 --> 01:09:25.630
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2787
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:26.890
<v Speaker 4>but a viral fucking,</v>

2788
01:09:26.891 --> 01:09:27.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2789
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.233
<v Speaker 4>or yeah,</v>

2790
01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:29.603
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of sucks.</v>

2791
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Bluetooth 7.0 if they're talking about genetic engineering and they're always</v>

2792
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 1>talking about the possibility of nanobots can go in and cure cancer.</v>

2793
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2794
01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:41.090
<v Speaker 1>What about the idea of artificial cells?</v>

2795
01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:41.924
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've,</v>

2796
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:44.540
<v Speaker 1>what was it that they just discovered recently?</v>

2797
01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:47.990
<v Speaker 1>They created something that reproduced itself in a lab for the first time.</v>

2798
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2799
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.971
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

2800
01:09:48.971 --> 01:09:49.870
<v Speaker 4>I saw something like that.</v>

2801
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was.</v>

2802
01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:51.671
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

2803
01:09:51.671 --> 01:09:52.451
<v Speaker 1>some structure,</v>

2804
01:09:52.451 --> 01:09:55.270
<v Speaker 1>some small structure and Adam or whatever it was that reproduce itself.</v>

2805
01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:58.600
<v Speaker 1>What if they can create artificial cells?</v>

2806
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:03.750
<v Speaker 1>They inject this artificial cell into you and slowly but surely over the course</v>

2807
01:10:03.821 --> 01:10:08.821
<v Speaker 1>of however long long it takes to regenerate inside all of your tissue,</v>

2808
01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you become like a superhuman,</v>

2809
01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.053
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2810
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 4>Outside of the realm of possibility.</v>

2811
01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:15.550
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2812
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 4>And what concerns me is the potential.</v>

2813
01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.250
<v Speaker 4>We think we're having class war now,</v>

2814
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:19.911
<v Speaker 4>class warfare.</v>

2815
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:24.230
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine the have and have nots in that day and age when it's like it's pure</v>

2816
01:10:24.231 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Gatica shit of like,</v>

2817
01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:25.461
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2818
01:10:25.461 --> 01:10:25.671
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2819
01:10:25.671 --> 01:10:28.820
<v Speaker 4>I was born with it because I got upgraded and you know,</v>

2820
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:32.120
<v Speaker 4>I can perceive this shit that you can't and manipulate and manipulate you with</v>

2821
01:10:32.121 --> 01:10:32.601
<v Speaker 4>my mind.</v>

2822
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:33.470
<v Speaker 4>So sorry,</v>

2823
01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:34.131
<v Speaker 4>you're just a thing.</v>

2824
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 4>We're going to enslave ourselves before the aliens do.</v>

2825
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't see any</v>

2826
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.070
<v Speaker 1>escape from the technological singularity.</v>

2827
01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

2828
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you see any,</v>

2829
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:41.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2830
01:10:41.631 --> 01:10:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any escape from,</v>

2831
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:43.953
<v Speaker 4>I worry,</v>

2832
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:45.620
<v Speaker 4>I worry that um,</v>

2833
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:48.550
<v Speaker 4>stunted minds will not allow us to evolve to that point.</v>

2834
01:10:48.551 --> 01:10:49.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they get to that point.</v>

2835
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those stunted minds have a fucking chance.</v>

2836
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it will be on them before they even know what hit them.</v>

2837
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I think no one is stopping the,</v>

2838
01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>the onset of artificial intelligence and no one is putting the brakes to it.</v>

2839
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worrying about weapons.</v>

2840
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worrying about these threats from terrorists and all these different</v>

2841
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:06.350
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2842
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:07.490
<v Speaker 1>What about a sentience,</v>

2843
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:10.100
<v Speaker 1>super intelligent computer that can do things.</v>

2844
01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.930
<v Speaker 4>I think we're so on the path to that.</v>

2845
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely,</v>

2846
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know.</v>

2847
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:14.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2848
01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 2>it may look at us and just go,</v>

2849
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 2>your molecules,</v>

2850
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I could use you more efficiently.</v>

2851
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2852
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2853
01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:20.970
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it's going to be that way.</v>

2854
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if whoever gets it first,</v>

2855
01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the u s or the Chinese,</v>

2856
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 2>they're going to put a hook in it that allows them to use it for whatever they</v>

2857
01:11:27.991 --> 01:11:28.440
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

2858
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:28.781
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2859
01:11:28.781 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2860
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.220
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know like the AI might become the next nuclear weapon before it</v>

2861
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:36.230
<v Speaker 2>becomes sentient enough to stop ourselves from blowing the shit out of each</v>

2862
01:11:36.231 --> 01:11:36.351
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2863
01:11:36.351 --> 01:11:37.081
<v Speaker 2>It is possible,</v>

2864
01:11:37.081 --> 01:11:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's going to happen.</v>

2865
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I think once something becomes to,</v>

2866
01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:40.830
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>

2867
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we have any more saying anything and I think the idea of</v>

2868
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 2>controlling it once it has the ability to rationalize and realize how silly we</v>

2869
01:11:47.341 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2870
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:47.731
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2871
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that species.</v>

2872
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I agree that if we think it's going to happen,</v>

2873
01:11:51.211 --> 01:11:52.350
<v Speaker 2>but there is,</v>

2874
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:56.790
<v Speaker 2>there is a sliding scale of fully sent in Ai and where we're at now and I'm</v>

2875
01:11:56.791 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 2>worried that right here when we're almost there,</v>

2876
01:11:59.161 --> 01:11:59.761
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

2877
01:11:59.761 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be just powerful enough and someone's going to have it and use it</v>

2878
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:05.240
<v Speaker 2>to take the rest of the world.</v>

2879
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Like that is the,</v>

2880
01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>that's what scares area,</v>

2881
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:07.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2882
01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2883
01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:08.241
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

2884
01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:08.331
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2885
01:12:08.331 --> 01:12:10.800
<v Speaker 2>the story that they tell after the apocalypse.</v>

2886
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:11.281
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2887
01:12:11.281 --> 01:12:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Or it's all over.</v>

2888
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:12.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2889
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.740
<v Speaker 2>how close we word or,</v>

2890
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:17.130
<v Speaker 2>and the scientists sit around and discuss up closer word to change in the world</v>

2891
01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:20.520
<v Speaker 2>and now they realize that they're old men and there's no medicine around anymore</v>

2892
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:22.110
<v Speaker 2>and you barely can find gasoline.</v>

2893
01:12:22.111 --> 01:12:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And we could've had it all out.</v>

2894
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.740
<v Speaker 2>And a few greedy men who still live on with that Ai,</v>

2895
01:12:26.741 --> 01:12:31.741
<v Speaker 2>I still have it 10,000 the one people find all these different ruins in America</v>

2896
01:12:32.251 --> 01:12:35.250
<v Speaker 2>and when America is covered with ice and then the ice withdraws again,</v>

2897
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:36.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2898
01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:37.320
<v Speaker 2>just like it's happened before.</v>

2899
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.153
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2900
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2901
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:39.691
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

2902
01:12:39.691 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they'll find a thumb drive frozen in ice and maybe one day figured out</v>

2903
01:12:43.321 --> 01:12:43.940
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>

2904
01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2905
01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.630
<v Speaker 2>un-encrypted but I doubt it.</v>

2906
01:12:45.631 --> 01:12:46.141
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>

2907
01:12:46.141 --> 01:12:47.340
<v Speaker 2>But they do find things.</v>

2908
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:48.990
<v Speaker 2>They do find some old fucking shit.</v>

2909
01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:49.470
<v Speaker 2>They can't,</v>

2910
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:50.550
<v Speaker 2>they can't account for,</v>

2911
01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:51.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2912
01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 2>the idea of glaciers though.</v>

2913
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 2>The real problem with glaciers,</v>

2914
01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 2>we had Graham Hancock in here.</v>

2915
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you listened to that one.</v>

2916
01:12:55.981 --> 01:12:57.180
<v Speaker 2>We said fascinating.</v>

2917
01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:57.911
<v Speaker 2>A dude who,</v>

2918
01:12:57.911 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2919
01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:58.801
<v Speaker 2>are talking about chicks,</v>

2920
01:12:58.801 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 2>it looks skinny from the waist up.</v>

2921
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.331
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2922
01:13:00.331 --> 01:13:01.020
<v Speaker 2>those are icebergs.</v>

2923
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2924
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.333
<v Speaker 2>Glaciers</v>

2925
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:04.350
<v Speaker 2>chase.</v>

2926
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:05.570
<v Speaker 2>It looks skinny for the waste ever.</v>

2927
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I call them icebergs because above the surface they look all right.</v>

2928
01:13:08.191 --> 01:13:09.024
<v Speaker 2>But down below it's,</v>

2929
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2930
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.220
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

2931
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:11.971
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sorry.</v>

2932
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:12.804
<v Speaker 2>Glaciers,</v>

2933
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:13.950
<v Speaker 2>glaciers,</v>

2934
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.040
<v Speaker 2>glaciers move on land and essentially grind everything underneath them down to</v>

2935
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:22.200
<v Speaker 2>nothing because they move,</v>

2936
01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:22.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2937
01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 2>several feet a year or whatever they do,</v>

2938
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:28.590
<v Speaker 2>but they're essentially a mile high sheet of ice that's slowly moving its way</v>

2939
01:13:28.591 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 2>across the ground and labor MP there.</v>

2940
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Any buildings,</v>

2941
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.130
<v Speaker 2>anything done giant boulders.</v>

2942
01:13:35.131 --> 01:13:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Moved miles.</v>

2943
01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:40.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like a slow frozen tsunami and just like later.</v>

2944
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2945
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been to the great legs now that's how powerful the imagery is.</v>

2946
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:48.600
<v Speaker 2>You have to go the great lakes or something to really wrap your head around.</v>

2947
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2948
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:49.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2949
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:51.030
<v Speaker 2>the oceans really made me think,</v>

2950
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:51.601
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

2951
01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:51.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2952
01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 2>everybody looks to the ocean and goes,</v>

2953
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:53.161
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2954
01:13:53.161 --> 01:13:53.671
<v Speaker 2>it's so big.</v>

2955
01:13:53.671 --> 01:13:54.320
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2956
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2957
01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.210
<v Speaker 2>But until you see a fresh water ocean and you go,</v>

2958
01:13:57.211 --> 01:13:59.580
<v Speaker 2>that used to be ice and it melted.</v>

2959
01:13:59.581 --> 01:14:01.890
<v Speaker 2>It used to be a giant sheet of ice and that's why it's here.</v>

2960
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:02.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2961
01:14:02.131 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 2>the Great Lakes are magnificent.</v>

2962
01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:04.860
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing,</v>

2963
01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:05.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2964
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:06.420
<v Speaker 2>They're so fucking,</v>

2965
01:14:06.421 --> 01:14:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I was big just near them to for a wedding.</v>

2966
01:14:08.491 --> 01:14:09.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of pissed.</v>

2967
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:09.894
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get out.</v>

2968
01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>You got to get to see a barrel,</v>

2969
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

2970
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>we went out of the way to see that shit.</v>

2971
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:14.260
<v Speaker 1>We flew,</v>

2972
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:14.831
<v Speaker 1>they frame,</v>

2973
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>they're racists.</v>

2974
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing the what and the cracker barrel.</v>

2975
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.241
<v Speaker 1>When you go inside,</v>

2976
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just photos of old slave owners just framed around watching you eat</v>

2977
01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:22.864
<v Speaker 1>breakfast.</v>

2978
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.823
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2979
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I like the gift shop.</v>

2980
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like all licorice whips and like old school,</v>

2981
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:28.960
<v Speaker 1>pretty much Amish games.</v>

2982
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that shit?</v>

2983
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of the Midwest that all the animals,</v>

2984
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:35.940
<v Speaker 1>have you seen all the photos and I'll put that on my Twitter if we're,</v>

2985
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:40.360
<v Speaker 1>we're we're talking about is there was a guy in Ohio who was running a wild</v>

2986
01:14:40.361 --> 01:14:41.710
<v Speaker 1>animal preserve,</v>

2987
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 1>shot himself and released all the animals.</v>

2988
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that was the catalyst.</v>

2989
01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 1>He committed suicide.</v>

2990
01:14:47.771 --> 01:14:50.110
<v Speaker 1>He let all the animals go and then he committed suicide,</v>

2991
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:51.160
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting.</v>

2992
01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why the dude,</v>

2993
01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:52.924
<v Speaker 1>did he leave?</v>

2994
01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't imprison these guys anymore.</v>

2995
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.473
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2996
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why I didn't just let one of the tires Jack Him.</v>

2997
01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:59.260
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to kill yourself,</v>

2998
01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 1>why don't I just kill yourself by tiger?</v>

2999
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 1>That'd be wild.</v>

3000
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Well no you didn't.</v>

3001
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:04.960
<v Speaker 1>You were around these wild animals every day.</v>

3002
01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:05.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3003
01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:05.890
<v Speaker 1>it'd be quick.</v>

3004
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:06.960
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't take long at all.</v>

3005
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Just just,</v>

3006
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.980
<v Speaker 1>just jump in there Nate and go pitch.</v>

3007
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:12.790
<v Speaker 1>There's something weird about the whole story though.</v>

3008
01:15:12.791 --> 01:15:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause like the sheriff knew him very well.</v>

3009
01:15:14.771 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess he has to go,</v>

3010
01:15:15.701 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 1>he had to go up there all the time.</v>

3011
01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Like there was shit going on all the time with this guy.</v>

3012
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at it as a house on Google maps,</v>

3013
01:15:23.171 --> 01:15:28.171
<v Speaker 1>it's actually listed as a Harley motorcycle shop.</v>

3014
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:31.300
<v Speaker 1>So he had a farm that like an illegal preserve.</v>

3015
01:15:31.301 --> 01:15:32.410
<v Speaker 1>He was running out the back like,</v>

3016
01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was,</v>

3017
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was illegal.</v>

3018
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3019
01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:36.280
<v Speaker 1>but so it's weird.</v>

3020
01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to know the whole story,</v>

3021
01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:42.280
<v Speaker 1>like what this guy was going on with this guy and now a Jack Hanna at the</v>

3022
01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Columbus Zoo is overlooking this whole thing.</v>

3023
01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:46.090
<v Speaker 1>But I was surprised that they,</v>

3024
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:47.040
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't,</v>

3025
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:47.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3026
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3027
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I know they had to shoot a lot of them,</v>

3028
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but this seems like there's some of them they could to try to tranquilize or</v>

3029
01:15:52.601 --> 01:15:53.170
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3030
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.790
<v Speaker 1>The police force didn't have a chance,</v>

3031
01:15:54.791 --> 01:15:55.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3032
01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:55.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3033
01:15:55.421 --> 01:15:59.860
<v Speaker 1>what was going on with the zoo honestly is like 30 miles away from where this</v>

3034
01:15:59.861 --> 01:16:00.694
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

3035
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand what they have the resources to get out there?</v>

3036
01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:06.970
<v Speaker 1>The animals were out and there was people living there and there's 40 fucking 50</v>

3037
01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:09.310
<v Speaker 1>animals and tigers and bears and shit.</v>

3038
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.070
<v Speaker 1>This is mountain lion poaches poodle on Runyon Canyon.</v>

3039
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.920

3075
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:02.930
<v Speaker 1>They hunted them down.</v>

3076

<v Speaker 1>The cops hunted them down.</v>

3077

<v Speaker 1>The cops hunted them down and just shot them all.</v>

3080

3081
01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think of what the cops are dealing with.</v>

3082
01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>The cops</v>

3083
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.840
<v Speaker 2>are dealing with 50 fucking killers,</v>

<v Speaker 2>50 wild killers that are aggressive and they were wandering the streets,</v>

3085
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:16.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3086

<v Speaker 2>I mean they got to do what they gotta do.</v>

3087
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 2>It's sucks that these animals had to die.</v>

3088
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.420
<v Speaker 2>But you know what to even say it sucks.</v>

3104
01:17:47.211 --> 01:17:48.660
<v Speaker 2>of thing you have to worry about is the tiger.</v>

3105
01:17:48.810 --> 01:17:49.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't know the way I think.</v>

3106
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:50.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3107

3112
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.750

01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:02.841
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're saying.</v>

3115
01:18:02.841 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 2>I think your sister is crazy.</v>

3116
01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:04.994
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3117
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:05.421

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3120
01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 2>they might've been saying that to them.</v>

3121
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>They might have been saying that to people too,</v>

3122
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.471
<v Speaker 2>so they didn't feel like,</v>

3123
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:09.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3124

<v Speaker 2>you're killing the tag.</v>

3125
01:18:10.471 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Or I know they treat people like they're idiots in Ohio,</v>

3126
01:18:12.681 --> 01:18:14.180
<v Speaker 2>but they don't treat them like they're that stupid.</v>

3127
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3128
01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 2>It says Muskegon County sheriff's says monkey with herpes virus still missing.</v>

3129
01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:19.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3130
01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:20.630
<v Speaker 2>that's the one they haven't got yet.</v>

3131
01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:20.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3132

<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3133
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.400
<v Speaker 2>They probably don't want to be,</v>

3134
01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:23.940
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to get to keep it as a pet.</v>

3135
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

3136
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that monkey knows things.</v>

3137
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you get that monkey and the monkey is one of those fucking planet of the</v>

3138
01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:28.981
<v Speaker 2>apes monkeys.</v>

3139
01:18:28.981 --> 01:18:30.030
<v Speaker 2>She starts talking to you.</v>

3140
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.211
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

3141
01:18:32.211 --> 01:18:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Reno didn't know that there was some alien coming.</v>

3142
01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:35.460
<v Speaker 2>They know that there's an asteroid,</v>

3143
01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:36.294
<v Speaker 2>you can't stop it.</v>

3144
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:37.810
<v Speaker 2>It's going to land right before the asteroid.</v>

3145
01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a little monkey talking to you.</v>

3146
01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:41.461
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

3147
01:18:41.461 --> 01:18:41.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3148
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.260
<v Speaker 2>did you watch the planet of the apes remake?</v>

3149
01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:44.094
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys see that?</v>

3150
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.500
<v Speaker 2>We talked about a couple of times.</v>

3151
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I like to see the special effects.</v>

3152
01:18:47.401 --> 01:18:48.234
<v Speaker 2>It's bad ass.</v>

3153
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.471
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

3154
01:18:49.471 --> 01:18:50.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3155
01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.960
<v Speaker 2>when you talking about manipulating genetics,</v>

3156
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:55.590
<v Speaker 2>it's not outside the realm of possibility that they've already done something</v>

3157
01:18:55.591 --> 01:18:55.921
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3158
01:18:55.921 --> 01:18:58.770
<v Speaker 2>They've already created some sort of a chimpanzee of human being hybrid.</v>

3159
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3160
01:18:59.431 --> 01:18:59.970
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3161
01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>when they tell you the shit that they tell you they have done already,</v>

3162
01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:05.940
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's a clone baby being monitored right now somewhere out there</v>

3163
01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.790
<v Speaker 2>and they're seeing exactly how that worked and genetically genetically</v>

3164
01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:09.900
<v Speaker 2>engineered kids out there.</v>

3165
01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:10.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3166
01:19:10.111 --> 01:19:11.400
<v Speaker 2>they're running tests on them right now.</v>

3167
01:19:11.401 --> 01:19:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Like that's absolutely happening.</v>

3168
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I've always said that by the time they tell you that they've,</v>

3169
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:17.040
<v Speaker 2>they're capable of making a clone,</v>

3170
01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.140
<v Speaker 2>the guy telling you is probably a clone.</v>

3171
01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3172
01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:21.030
<v Speaker 2>It's been that there are clones.</v>

3173
01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm the proof.</v>

3174
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Here you go.</v>

3175
01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much,</v>

3176
01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.380
<v Speaker 2>how far ahead they really are.</v>

3177
01:19:25.381 --> 01:19:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I would really love to know,</v>

3178
01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:27.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3179
01:19:27.271 --> 01:19:31.230
<v Speaker 2>every now and then I hear like whispers of things of technology of like military</v>

3180
01:19:31.231 --> 01:19:33.180
<v Speaker 2>technology that's so far and above,</v>

3181
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:33.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3182
01:19:33.901 --> 01:19:34.111
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3183
01:19:34.111 --> 01:19:34.251
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3184
01:19:34.251 --> 01:19:38.400
<v Speaker 2>the realm of what we currently think is possible when they have the satellites</v>

3185
01:19:38.401 --> 01:19:40.140
<v Speaker 2>that can zoom in on a hot dog on your grill.</v>

3186
01:19:40.141 --> 01:19:42.090
<v Speaker 2>And they had those in 1983 man.</v>

3187
01:19:42.091 --> 01:19:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3188
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3189
01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3190
01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:44.970
<v Speaker 2>they probably do,</v>

3191
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3192
01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen any images from space that I,</v>

3193
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.580
<v Speaker 2>that were like really clear like that.</v>

3194
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they could read a,</v>

3195
01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.321
<v Speaker 2>a licensed white,</v>

3196
01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that.</v>

3197
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Well there was a point in time where they had Google imagery quality map and you</v>

3198
01:19:55.771 --> 01:19:56.920
<v Speaker 2>weren't able to see that real.</v>

3199
01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.210
<v Speaker 2>We can see that and then we can see three d versions of it and street views and</v>

3200
01:20:00.211 --> 01:20:00.900
<v Speaker 2>all that other shit.</v>

3201
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>If we have access to that data,</v>

3202
01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3203
01:20:03.061 --> 01:20:04.650
<v Speaker 2>they've got better access than that.</v>

3204
01:20:04.651 --> 01:20:05.221
<v Speaker 2>They have to,</v>

3205
01:20:05.221 --> 01:20:07.320
<v Speaker 2>they've got to have real time video something.</v>

3206
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3207
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.200
<v Speaker 2>There must be some,</v>

3208
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:08.941
<v Speaker 2>and I don't have a look.</v>

3209
01:20:08.941 --> 01:20:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I have a tin foil hat that says,</v>

3210
01:20:10.351 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I bet they have it.</v>

3211
01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:12.360
<v Speaker 2>But that's about it.</v>

3212
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:12.901
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3213
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:13.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3214
01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:13.921
<v Speaker 2>when I was,</v>

3215
01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:14.754
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3216
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.130
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with my friend Mike [inaudible],</v>

3217
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 2>my friend Mike's Works a UFC fighter,</v>

3218
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:23.010
<v Speaker 2>he used to live in Russia and he was doing a defense contractor work over there</v>

3219
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:23.641
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3220
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:26.800
<v Speaker 2>they had an American building and they would find bugs the,</v>

3221
01:20:26.801 --> 01:20:28.740
<v Speaker 2>the Russians had installed in their buildings.</v>

3222
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 2>And he said they were so sophisticated,</v>

3223
01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.630
<v Speaker 2>it was so far above anything that had ever seen before.</v>

3224
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.840
<v Speaker 2>They had a monitoring devices that were powered by the movement of the building.</v>

3225
01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:40.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3226
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:40.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3227
01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:41.480
<v Speaker 2>vibrations,</v>

3228
01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3229
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.101
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3230
01:20:42.101 --> 01:20:42.191
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3231
01:20:42.191 --> 01:20:42.331
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3232
01:20:42.331 --> 01:20:46.860
<v Speaker 2>You know how buildings sway and there's a subtle swaying back and forth that was</v>

3233
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:48.720
<v Speaker 2>powering these listening devices.</v>

3234
01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.390
<v Speaker 2>They were that sophisticated,</v>

3235
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.060
<v Speaker 2>like those shake to charge iPod holders like,</v>

3236
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 2>but they have it on that level that they can get the sway of a building and a</v>

3237
01:20:56.161 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 2>device and low powerful enough and Mesh network enough to spread those ideas.</v>

3238
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they were listening in on Shit.</v>

3239
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:02.760
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3240
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.740
<v Speaker 2>China was just involved in a huge scandal for that,</v>

3241
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:06.630
<v Speaker 2>for was the China or Korea.</v>

3242
01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:07.711
<v Speaker 2>That's bad.</v>

3243
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:08.544
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know the difference.</v>

3244
01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

3245
01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:09.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3246
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.930
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3247
01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:11.070
<v Speaker 2>I know the difference of the places.</v>

3248
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the source of the article but a shit storm on.</v>

3249
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:14.500
<v Speaker 2>They had a,</v>

3250
01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:14.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3251
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:15.331
<v Speaker 2>barbering it.</v>

3252
01:21:15.331 --> 01:21:16.710
<v Speaker 2>They already kicked my ass and starcraft.</v>

3253
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

3254
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:17.963
<v Speaker 2>which ones are those?</v>

3255
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:19.403
<v Speaker 2>Those are Koreans.</v>

3256
01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:22.860
<v Speaker 2>They had little bugs in cars and they thought they were like,</v>

3257
01:21:22.861 --> 01:21:23.101
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3258
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:26.210
<v Speaker 2>this is just tracking how often you drive for discounts or for you know,</v>

3259
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.810
<v Speaker 2>car pool riders and help you get through the,</v>

3260
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fast pass lane kind of thing.</v>

3261
01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:29.731
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3262
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:30.990
<v Speaker 2>This will just help you get through the toll booth.</v>

3263
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:35.490
<v Speaker 2>It had audio recording and and some said video recording built into the tiniest</v>

3264
01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:38.880
<v Speaker 2>little bug that was sitting on their dash so that they can monitor everybody.</v>

3265
01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Eventually someone's going to hack apple and they're going to get into your</v>

3266
01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:45.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking Webcam with the cloud and they're going to get in your cloud.</v>

3267
01:21:45.251 --> 01:21:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Over million people beating off videos of people sitting in front of the</v>

3268
01:21:48.901 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Speaker 2>computers.</v>

3269
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.630
<v Speaker 2>You computer has a monitor on it,</v>

3270
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:56.460
<v Speaker 2>your computer has a camera on it and you're connected to the internet and you're</v>

3271
01:21:56.461 --> 01:22:00.780
<v Speaker 2>just assuming that nobody's watching you beat off like elaborate the x Spock,</v>

3272
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.941
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3273
01:22:00.941 --> 01:22:03.780
<v Speaker 2>all the Xbox cameras and all the law yet the laptop lenses.</v>

3274
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:04.751
<v Speaker 2>But the thing I'm worried about,</v>

3275
01:22:04.751 --> 01:22:08.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the photo stream and like you said earlier off camera that you turned off</v>

3276
01:22:08.911 --> 01:22:09.520
<v Speaker 2>your photos,</v>

3277
01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.180
<v Speaker 2>which is a new thing on the new iPhones and stuff like that.</v>

3278
01:22:12.181 --> 01:22:13.020
<v Speaker 2>It's the clouds.</v>

3279
01:22:13.021 --> 01:22:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Every time you take a photo it sends it to your home computer.</v>

3280
01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:17.130
<v Speaker 2>It sends it to your IPAD,</v>

3281
01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:18.810
<v Speaker 2>sends it to whatever and uh,</v>

3282
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't delete the photos,</v>

3283
01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:21.150
<v Speaker 2>which is really annoying.</v>

3284
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:26.310
<v Speaker 2>But delete them from your phone photos from the film at photo stream.</v>

3285
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:26.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3286
01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:27.474
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

3287
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

3288
01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:28.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3289
01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:29.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like once it's in the photo stream,</v>

3290
01:22:29.881 --> 01:22:30.661
<v Speaker 2>you can't delete it.</v>

3291
01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's,</v>

3292
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.000
<v Speaker 2>if there's a way to do it,</v>

3293
01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:34.800
<v Speaker 2>but like you try it on your phone or anything,</v>

3294
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to delete from your home computer.</v>

3295
01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:37.561
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3296
01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:39.960
<v Speaker 2>On your main computer to be on your brain can figure it out that time you,</v>

3297
01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3298
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.290
<v Speaker 2>you do snap a photo out at a party or something like that and it's,</v>

3299
01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:43.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

3300
01:22:43.651 --> 01:22:44.580
<v Speaker 2>it's already on my photo stream.</v>

3301
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I can get to my laptop and Mrs Pereira opens up your laptop,</v>

3302
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:48.960
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>

3303
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Kevin or Bobby who's in his car sniping your Wifi or whatever.</v>

3304
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Now has all your photos.</v>

3305
01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:56.630
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>

3306
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:57.763
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3307
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:59.340
<v Speaker 2>they can't get your photo.</v>

3308
01:22:59.440 --> 01:22:59.581
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3309
01:22:59.581 --> 01:23:00.210
<v Speaker 2>we have to get,</v>

3310
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:00.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3311
01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.080
<v Speaker 2>there were applications you can,</v>

3312
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:02.963
<v Speaker 2>I've run one at the,</v>

3313
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:04.290
<v Speaker 2>at the airport and uh,</v>

3314
01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3315
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Vegas and you run it up on your map and you connect to like the public Wifi and</v>

3316
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:12.430
<v Speaker 2>as people browse Facebook and as jifs and jpegs pop in,</v>

3317
01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3318
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.750
<v Speaker 2>It automatically reassembles them on the monitor for you.</v>

3319
01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:18.550
<v Speaker 2>So you can sit in the lobby of a small airport and just look around and see what</v>

3320
01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 2>everybody's looking.</v>

3321
01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:23.110
<v Speaker 2>This was a Mac program,</v>

3322
01:23:23.111 --> 01:23:23.944
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

3323
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:24.910
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't Kismet.</v>

3324
01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:25.300
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

3325
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the APP.</v>

3326
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.760
<v Speaker 2>So does everyone else have to be on a Mac or can then be,</v>

3327
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're just connected to Wifi and browsing certain services and</v>

3328
01:23:30.251 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 2>certain packets are coming in.</v>

3329
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:31.990
<v Speaker 2>You can do that.</v>

3330
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Pc or Mac no matter what it is.</v>

3331
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3332
01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's just why it's like fire.</v>

3333
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:36.430
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3334
01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:37.480
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>

3335
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:39.040
<v Speaker 2>So what you're telling me is you're a criminal,</v>

3336
01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:40.090
<v Speaker 2>you are committing a crime.</v>

3337
01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 2>No photos are in the shared folder,</v>

3338
01:23:43.031 --> 01:23:43.331
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3339
01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:43.931
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

3340
01:23:43.931 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Because these photos were being downloaded and uploaded potentially on a public</v>

3341
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.280
<v Speaker 2>unsecure,</v>

3342
01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.150
<v Speaker 2>well you had to log in,</v>

3343
01:23:49.151 --> 01:23:49.840
<v Speaker 2>but a public,</v>

3344
01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3345
01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 2>secured Wifi spot,</v>

3346
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:52.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3347
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.521
<v Speaker 2>We're sending them,</v>

3348
01:23:52.521 --> 01:23:55.570
<v Speaker 2>it could be some dirty hooker who's got one of them Facebook pages that you have</v>

3349
01:23:55.571 --> 01:23:56.650
<v Speaker 2>to get her friend to look at.</v>

3350
01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.290
<v Speaker 2>That absolutely could have been showing some tech.</v>

3351
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:59.350
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely could have.</v>

3352
01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.580
<v Speaker 2>You could have got that teddy for free.</v>

3353
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I haven't signed,</v>

3354
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I have this video called Kitty Farc Cup and anytime I'm on the road with Joe,</v>

3355
01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:06.880
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting at the airport.</v>

3356
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I look at people with shared folders and stuff and now we'll just drag this</v>

3357
01:24:10.481 --> 01:24:11.314
<v Speaker 2>video into,</v>

3358
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I've done it like a million times.</v>

3359
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Do that every comment on every comic con like seed into public folders at the</v>

3360
01:24:16.871 --> 01:24:17.261
<v Speaker 2>hotel.</v>

3361
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Cause when you're connected never connect to hotel systems,</v>

3362
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:21.340
<v Speaker 2>never connected with hotel network.</v>

3363
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.100
<v Speaker 2>That's like laying on the,</v>

3364
01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.490
<v Speaker 2>on the mattress naked.</v>

3365
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 2>And the do not do that.</v>

3366
01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 2>You're asking for people to fuck with your computer.</v>

3367
01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:30.490
<v Speaker 2>And the crazy thing is you could actually sit there and fuck people over by like</v>

3368
01:24:30.491 --> 01:24:32.290
<v Speaker 2>putting child porn on people's computers.</v>

3369
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 2>And then if that person gets arrested,</v>

3370
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 2>oh you have child porn on your computers.</v>

3371
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:36.400
<v Speaker 2>They caught a guy doing that.</v>

3372
01:24:36.401 --> 01:24:37.710
<v Speaker 2>They caught a next door neighborhood.</v>

3373
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:38.501
<v Speaker 2>Been terrifying.</v>

3374
01:24:38.501 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 2>These people for fucking years doing exactly that.</v>

3375
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:41.941
<v Speaker 2>And they are right.</v>

3376
01:24:41.941 --> 01:24:42.380
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3377
01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.160
<v Speaker 2>He turned them in and this guy was a,</v>

3378
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:44.621
<v Speaker 2>he was a,</v>

3379
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:48.490
<v Speaker 2>their next door neighbor is terrorizing the whole fucking family child</v>

3380
01:24:48.491 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 2>pornography check some database.</v>

3381
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.410
<v Speaker 2>So check sums are what you use.</v>

3382
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3383
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:54.910
<v Speaker 2>like like a files id its,</v>

3384
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:55.111
<v Speaker 2>its,</v>

3385
01:24:55.111 --> 01:24:55.330
<v Speaker 2>its,</v>

3386
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:56.140
<v Speaker 2>its thumbprint.</v>

3387
01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.660
<v Speaker 2>So if you download a file and you wanna make sure you got it exactly as the ads</v>

3388
01:24:58.661 --> 01:24:59.494
<v Speaker 2>it should be,</v>

3389
01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a way of verifying the file to make sure no bits where alternative harmed</v>

3390
01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:03.843
<v Speaker 2>in the transmission.</v>

3391
01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:07.400
<v Speaker 2>They have a database of every uh,</v>

3392
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:10.720
<v Speaker 2>child pornography and illegal pornography video.</v>

3393
01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.900
<v Speaker 2>It's sorted by title with checksums.</v>

3394
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:16.840
<v Speaker 2>So that way if the police are scanning Wifi or get somebody files from the</v>

3395
01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

3396
01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.350
<v Speaker 2>they can match the check some of the file on their hard drive to one that's</v>

3397
01:25:20.351 --> 01:25:21.910
<v Speaker 2>already in the database and see if it's in there.</v>

3398
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:23.230
<v Speaker 2>So they don't have to watch the video.</v>

3399
01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3400
01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.900
<v Speaker 2>But they've got that database already,</v>

3401
01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:27.550
<v Speaker 2>so it's impossible for a,</v>

3402
01:25:27.551 --> 01:25:29.250
<v Speaker 2>another video of the same,</v>

3403
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.340
<v Speaker 2>have the same amount of bytes.</v>

3404
01:25:30.341 --> 01:25:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Like what if it's exact same on a second.</v>

3405
01:25:31.810 --> 01:25:32.611
<v Speaker 2>It's in the same as well.</v>

3406
01:25:32.611 --> 01:25:33.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

3407
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>it's possible based off the content of the file as well.</v>

3408
01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just a length thing,</v>

3409
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a size,</v>

3410
01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:39.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

3411
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:39.791
<v Speaker 2>there's an actual,</v>

3412
01:25:39.791 --> 01:25:41.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a thousand attributes that go into it.</v>

3413
01:25:41.771 --> 01:25:42.430
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

3414
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 2>how are they reading that?</v>

3415
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Just did analyzing each and every individual file.</v>

3416
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I think I this,</v>

3417
01:25:48.161 --> 01:25:48.994
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3418
01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.440
<v Speaker 2>this is pure conjecture actually,</v>

3419
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.340
<v Speaker 2>so I shouldn't be saying it,</v>

3420
01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:53.140
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine if you doing a check sum,</v>

3421
01:25:53.141 --> 01:25:53.800
<v Speaker 2>it could.</v>

3422
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.780
<v Speaker 2>It could just know that every hundred bytes,</v>

3423
01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.160
<v Speaker 2>here's a character string here,</v>

3424
01:25:57.161 --> 01:25:58.510
<v Speaker 2>so there's a check for it there.</v>

3425
01:25:58.720 --> 01:25:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Every x bytes,</v>

3426
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 2>this is the character like this is the Hex,</v>

3427
01:26:00.851 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 2>put it there.</v>

3428
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it's way more elegant than that because I can already poke holes in</v>

3429
01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:04.850
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3430
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:06.570
<v Speaker 2>but we'll think about how there is a way to do it.</v>

3431
01:26:06.571 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Think about how crazy show's name is.</v>

3432
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Think about that thing that,</v>

3433
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 2>that program where you go to a club and there's a song playing and you liked the</v>

3434
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:16.550
<v Speaker 2>song so precious and it sends a signal and 10 seconds later it tells you what</v>

3435
01:26:16.551 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 2>that fucking analyze the file.</v>

3436
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:18.141
<v Speaker 2>Here it is,</v>

3437
01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:20.420
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not exaggerating if you never use Shizam,</v>

3438
01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking incredible.</v>

3439
01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:23.870
<v Speaker 2>It's 10 seconds later I think of that.</v>

3440
01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the same thing,</v>

3441
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.840
<v Speaker 2>but they haven't the time for TV as well.</v>

3442
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:27.800
<v Speaker 2>How'd that for video?</v>

3443
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.050
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have that for all that shit.</v>

3444
01:26:29.051 --> 01:26:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Like the image recognition image engine.</v>

3445
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:33.080
<v Speaker 2>What a weird world we live in right now.</v>

3446
01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys talked about Siri becoming skynet?</v>

3447
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:36.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3448
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:36.830
<v Speaker 2>we haven't.</v>

3449
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I talked about,</v>

3450
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 2>so you want to hop into that?</v>

3451
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:39.141
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3452
01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:39.531
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

3453
01:26:39.531 --> 01:26:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Because someone actually sent me something we had talked about on the show.</v>

3454
01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:44.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a real,</v>

3455
01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:44.770
<v Speaker 2>real quick dude.</v>

3456
01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

3457
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Just so I don't get raped on Twitter.</v>

3458
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:49.440
<v Speaker 2>I believe you analyze the file locally and it spits out a check on.</v>

3459
01:26:49.441 --> 01:26:53.150
<v Speaker 2>So it is checking every bit of the file and then you check that against the</v>

3460
01:26:53.151 --> 01:26:53.984
<v Speaker 2>public checks them.</v>

3461
01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3462
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:55.690
<v Speaker 2>just so I don't get,</v>

3463
01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to deal with those tweets.</v>

3464
01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3465
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I can't do my soul.</v>

3466
01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not in my soul anymore,</v>

3467
01:26:59.991 --> 01:27:00.231
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3468
01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:01.064
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to help.</v>

3469
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.911
<v Speaker 2>So with that said,</v>

3470
01:27:01.911 --> 01:27:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

3471
01:27:02.410 --> 01:27:02.961
<v Speaker 2>w okay,</v>

3472
01:27:02.961 --> 01:27:04.910
<v Speaker 2>so someone wrote that,</v>

3473
01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:05.181
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3474
01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:07.520
<v Speaker 2>I said that Siri was based on Wolfram Alpha,</v>

3475
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:09.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's not exactly true.</v>

3476
01:27:09.481 --> 01:27:10.670
<v Speaker 2>It's integrated rates.</v>

3477
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:11.181
<v Speaker 2>Wolfram Alpha.</v>

3478
01:27:11.181 --> 01:27:12.014
<v Speaker 2>It's integrated.</v>

3479
01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.400
<v Speaker 2>But this is where it gets crazy.</v>

3480
01:27:13.401 --> 01:27:15.020
<v Speaker 2>It's based on callow,</v>

3481
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:20.230
<v Speaker 2>the cognitive assistant that learns and organizes from a company called Sri</v>

3482
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Speaker 2>International.</v>

3483
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And it was artificial intelligence augmentation software developed for Darpa.</v>

3484
01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3485
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Did Advanced Research Projects Agency.</v>

3486
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:32.760
<v Speaker 2>That's like those are the motherfuckers that really are skynet.</v>

3487
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:34.910
<v Speaker 2>So if this is the version we have now,</v>

3488
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:37.070
<v Speaker 2>what's stopping them from tapping a phone line,</v>

3489
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:38.870
<v Speaker 2>grabbing a voice chat,</v>

3490
01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:41.810
<v Speaker 2>taking the audio from this podcast and analyzing it in real time.</v>

3491
01:27:41.811 --> 01:27:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Just like Shizam and pulling out those keywords and those context cues.</v>

3492
01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:48.320
<v Speaker 2>This is fascinating because we have the dumbed down version right now.</v>

3493
01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:50.750
<v Speaker 2>They've got the hot dog on the grill satellite version of it.</v>

3494
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.823
<v Speaker 2>So five version.</v>

3495
01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:52.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3496
01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so crazy to think that,</v>

3497
01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3498
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3499
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.150
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

3500
01:27:55.150 --> 01:28:00.150
<v Speaker 2>this guy also wrote something about how Facebook was funded by a Tia.</v>

3501
01:28:00.690 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Total information awareness.</v>

3502
01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Facebook is starting their own Super Pac to lobby the government on privacy and</v>

3503
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 2>information controls and what we should have rights too.</v>

3504
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Cause they want to own the rights to your usage data,</v>

3505
01:28:11.601 --> 01:28:12.440
<v Speaker 2>your social graph,</v>

3506
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:13.130
<v Speaker 2>your preferences.</v>

3507
01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:14.150
<v Speaker 2>They want to own that data.</v>

3508
01:28:14.151 --> 01:28:17.390
<v Speaker 2>They want essentially want to own your imprint online,</v>

3509
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:17.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3510
01:28:17.781 --> 01:28:19.820
<v Speaker 2>They want to own your browsing habits where you shop.</v>

3511
01:28:19.821 --> 01:28:21.230
<v Speaker 2>They want to know what music you like.</v>

3512
01:28:21.231 --> 01:28:23.000
<v Speaker 2>They want to know what friends you connect with,</v>

3513
01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:23.930
<v Speaker 2>where you go,</v>

3514
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:24.913
<v Speaker 2>who do you share?</v>

3515
01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm already my spacing Facebook lately.</v>

3516
01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:27.950
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3517
01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:29.060
<v Speaker 2>But you're not,</v>

3518
01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:30.800
<v Speaker 2>you're f you're kind of alone in that right now.</v>

3519
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:31.401
<v Speaker 2>Like it's growing,</v>

3520
01:28:31.401 --> 01:28:31.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3521
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:32.444
<v Speaker 2>It's growing more and more.</v>

3522
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Integrating more and more on Twitter has kind of overtaken Facebook for the most</v>

3523
01:28:36.231 --> 01:28:36.411
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

3524
01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I know like when I talked to,</v>

3525
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I just tweet now.</v>

3526
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3527
01:28:39.831 --> 01:28:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that don't do Facebook anymore.</v>

3528
01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Well the interesting thing,</v>

3529
01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:44.450
<v Speaker 2>they can still pull that together for to tweet.</v>

3530
01:28:44.451 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 2>It's more real time.</v>

3531
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3532
01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:46.791
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3533
01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:47.061
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3534
01:28:47.061 --> 01:28:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you're responding to people back and forth.</v>

3535
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.611
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

3536
01:28:49.611 --> 01:28:52.490
<v Speaker 2>in a very similar way to text messaging.</v>

3537
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3538
01:28:53.031 --> 01:28:53.460
<v Speaker 2>it a lot.</v>

3539
01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:53.571
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3540
01:28:53.571 --> 01:28:54.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3541
01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:54.241
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3542
01:28:54.241 --> 01:28:56.420
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially for a lot of what I use it for.</v>

3543
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:57.263
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3544
01:28:57.450 --> 01:28:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I throw things out there,</v>

3545
01:28:59.031 --> 01:28:59.960
<v Speaker 2>interesting links.</v>

3546
01:28:59.961 --> 01:29:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I retweet things,</v>

3547
01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.800
<v Speaker 2>interesting things I observed,</v>

3548
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:03.690
<v Speaker 2>photos I take,</v>

3549
01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 2>but I also go back and forth with people.</v>

3550
01:29:05.881 --> 01:29:05.991
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

3551
01:29:05.991 --> 01:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll shoot the shit with people and it's people I went to,</v>

3552
01:29:07.891 --> 01:29:08.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3553
01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 2>ordinarily never really get a chance to run into or meet like my ex girlfriend.</v>

3554
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:12.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3555
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:13.321
<v Speaker 2>Well she tripped.</v>

3556
01:29:13.321 --> 01:29:16.740
<v Speaker 2>She to the ridiculous like facilitating a real time conversation.</v>

3557
01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Are you upset that I said something to her?</v>

3558
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3559
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:21.330
<v Speaker 2>you would prefer no one to communicate with her?</v>

3560
01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:23.013
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3561
01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.210
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

3562
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:27.721
<v Speaker 2>you brought this up.</v>

3563
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:29.220
<v Speaker 2>So I have said this,</v>

3564
01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.050
<v Speaker 2>this is what I said.</v>

3565
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

3566
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.641
<v Speaker 2>she's by the way,</v>

3567
01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:35.250
<v Speaker 2>is a penthouse pet of the year.</v>

3568
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3569
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Did and she writes,</v>

3570
01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:40.950
<v Speaker 2>she's talking about another porno star and the other porno star says,</v>

3571
01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I feel a bad cold coming on.</v>

3572
01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to make out?</v>

3573
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:44.813
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

3574
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll make out with your butt.</v>

3575
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.540
<v Speaker 2>So I on Twitter say,</v>

3576
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.493
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3577
01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.790
<v Speaker 2>just wow.</v>

3578
01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 2>That's the extent of my communication with her.</v>

3579
01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.153
<v Speaker 2>Why are you trying to fuck?</v>

3580
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:55.380
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

3581
01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.370
<v Speaker 2>what are you wowing?</v>

3582
01:29:56.371 --> 01:29:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I ignore it.</v>

3583
01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:57.871
<v Speaker 2>I just have to say,</v>

3584
01:29:57.871 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3585
01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:01.030
<v Speaker 2>if you run around tweeting to the whole world that you wouldn't make out with a</v>

3586
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:02.183
<v Speaker 2>a cold,</v>

3587
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.690
<v Speaker 2>caring porn stars.</v>

3588
01:30:03.691 --> 01:30:05.760
<v Speaker 2>But I got a while yet.</v>

3589
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:06.361
<v Speaker 2>Here's my,</v>

3590
01:30:06.361 --> 01:30:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I guess my question for scissor trying to fuck her.</v>

3591
01:30:08.341 --> 01:30:09.174
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

3592
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.360
<v Speaker 2>do you think that that,</v>

3593
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 2>that there is somebody from Brian,</v>

3594
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:17.280
<v Speaker 2>do you think there is anybody at Siri that is like w continuing to add to the</v>

3595
01:30:17.281 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 2>database?</v>

3596
01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they're looking at the top 10 things?</v>

3597
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Why does Siri need to connect to the cloud for anything that I do,</v>

3598
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:25.560
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a local operation,</v>

3599
01:30:25.561 --> 01:30:25.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3600
01:30:25.890 --> 01:30:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Read my text messages.</v>

3601
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Those are already mine on my device.</v>

3602
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.150
<v Speaker 2>If I say play Joe Rogan's podcast,</v>

3603
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:34.140
<v Speaker 2>it has to send it to the cloud first and they'll say it's for voice recognition.</v>

3604
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3605
01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:36.390
<v Speaker 2>it's faster in the cloud and answer to your phone,</v>

3606
01:30:36.391 --> 01:30:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's the program itself,</v>

3607
01:30:38.011 --> 01:30:39.870
<v Speaker 2>the database has to be huge for Siri,</v>

3608
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:41.790
<v Speaker 2>for local things that could store that.</v>

3609
01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:44.040
<v Speaker 2>It could totally do that and maybe they will in the future.</v>

3610
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:45.050
<v Speaker 2>But I think the reason they're,</v>

3611
01:30:45.051 --> 01:30:48.390
<v Speaker 2>they're making everything go to the net is for the usage data because then they</v>

3612
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:49.740
<v Speaker 2>can see what keywords are happening.</v>

3613
01:30:49.741 --> 01:30:51.030
<v Speaker 2>They get better chance people are doing.</v>

3614
01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:51.511
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

3615
01:30:51.511 --> 01:30:52.344
<v Speaker 2>they can make it better.</v>

3616
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.210
<v Speaker 2>But with,</v>

3617
01:30:53.210 --> 01:30:55.440
<v Speaker 2>with great power comes great responsibility.</v>

3618
01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:59.640
<v Speaker 2>And what's crazy is that I had a friend that got mad at another friend for</v>

3619
01:30:59.641 --> 01:31:00.540
<v Speaker 2>cursing at his Siri.</v>

3620
01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:00.931
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>

3621
01:31:00.931 --> 01:31:01.711
<v Speaker 2>fuck you Siri,</v>

3622
01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:01.981
<v Speaker 2>you're a,</v>

3623
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:02.814
<v Speaker 2>you're a bitch.</v>

3624
01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And he took the phone away and he's like,</v>

3625
01:31:03.961 --> 01:31:04.141
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3626
01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:04.621
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

3627
01:31:04.621 --> 01:31:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that in my profile.</v>

3628
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And he was concerned about acting a certain way to an,</v>

3629
01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:09.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3630
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.770
<v Speaker 2>a pretty dumb artificial intelligence.</v>

3631
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:12.481
<v Speaker 2>The murder thing.</v>

3632
01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about the murder thing and that's on file.</v>

3633
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Did you do the president thing yet?</v>

3634
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:17.290
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

3635
01:31:17.290 --> 01:31:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

3636
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 2>When you ask Siri a question that's being stored somewhere,</v>

3637
01:31:20.611 --> 01:31:23.220
<v Speaker 2>that request is indefinitely stored in some log right now.</v>

3638
01:31:23.221 --> 01:31:28.221
<v Speaker 2>So if you ever are presumed they ignored you murder somebody or if someone</v>

3639
01:31:28.351 --> 01:31:29.400
<v Speaker 2>suspects you have a murder,</v>

3640
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:31.080
<v Speaker 2>they can now try it out on the stand.</v>

3641
01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:31.981
<v Speaker 2>You asked your,</v>

3642
01:31:31.981 --> 01:31:32.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3643
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.800
<v Speaker 2>your cell phone where to hide a body.</v>

3644
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they have that.</v>

3645
01:31:34.981 --> 01:31:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

3646
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I want to know is does apple say anywhere in those terms and agreement that</v>

3647
01:31:38.461 --> 01:31:40.800
<v Speaker 2>they're holding onto the data of what we're saying in Siri?</v>

3648
01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Is that one of the things,</v>

3649
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:42.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

3650
01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it says that it's from usage data,</v>

3651
01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:46.200
<v Speaker 2>which what does that mean?</v>

3652
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:47.820
<v Speaker 2>I wonder that is kind of,</v>

3653
01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:48.780
<v Speaker 2>it's going to achieve that.</v>

3654
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:51.900
<v Speaker 2>They have to send it out to the cloud.</v>

3655
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:52.951
<v Speaker 2>Now there's,</v>

3656
01:31:52.951 --> 01:31:54.600
<v Speaker 2>there's infrastructure reasons to do that.</v>

3657
01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:57.210
<v Speaker 2>There's also terrible usability reasons to not do that.</v>

3658
01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Being that if you have a t and t,</v>

3659
01:31:58.411 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 2>half the time doesn't work because</v>

3660
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.270
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a strong enough signal to get out to her.</v>

3661
01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:03.850
<v Speaker 4>What were faster?</v>

3662
01:32:04.090 --> 01:32:04.923
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3663
01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:07.210
<v Speaker 4>We're faster when it's available,</v>

3664
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:08.560
<v Speaker 4>so I'm on a t and t,</v>

3665
01:32:08.561 --> 01:32:09.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's still a shitty network.</v>

3666
01:32:09.761 --> 01:32:11.020
<v Speaker 4>There's no bones about that.</v>

3667
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3668
01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:12.830
<v Speaker 1>The H I couldn't do at.</v>

3669
01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:12.931
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

3670
01:32:12.931 --> 01:32:16.600
<v Speaker 1>T he told me the day I got a new iPhone and he told me that ATNT what'd you guys</v>

3671
01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.370
<v Speaker 1>change their system so that they can get double the speed of download?</v>

3672
01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.201
<v Speaker 4>Not Double.</v>

3673
01:32:21.201 --> 01:32:22.034
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3674
01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.093
<v Speaker 4>it could be.</v>

3675
01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's 3.5 g.</v>

3676
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:25.723
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3677
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:27.031
<v Speaker 4>it's faster.</v>

3678
01:32:27.031 --> 01:32:27.271
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3679
01:32:27.271 --> 01:32:27.451
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3680
01:32:27.451 --> 01:32:27.901
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

3681
01:32:27.901 --> 01:32:29.160
<v Speaker 4>LTE is going to blow that away.</v>

3682
01:32:29.161 --> 01:32:30.230
<v Speaker 4>The next I felt guilty younger.</v>

3683
01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3684
01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that in my current one,</v>

3685
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:37.390
<v Speaker 1>but I do have Verizon and I just was unable to pass on Verizon.</v>

3686
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Fry's is just too good.</v>

3687
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Why is it double is actually,</v>

3688
01:32:39.861 --> 01:32:40.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3689
01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:40.880
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

3690
01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:41.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3691
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:45.980
<v Speaker 4>my girlfriend's new phone for us and the f I foreign both on at and t did both</v>

3692
01:32:45.981 --> 01:32:46.814
<v Speaker 4>at the same time.</v>

3693
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3694
01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:50.090
<v Speaker 4>those speeches I s was double where I was at.</v>

3695
01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:50.953
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

3696
01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:52.160
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good area.</v>

3697
01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:52.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3698
01:32:52.521 --> 01:32:54.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't get those speeds anywhere myself.</v>

3699
01:32:54.381 --> 01:32:56.360
<v Speaker 4>I still get dropped calls in the India.</v>

3700
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.990
<v Speaker 4>The canyons.</v>

3701
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3702
01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.453
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3703
01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:00.500
<v Speaker 4>I think you look at how like,</v>

3704
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.530
<v Speaker 4>think about Siri has that API opens up because right now I could say,</v>

3705
01:33:03.531 --> 01:33:05.510
<v Speaker 4>show me a good steak restaurant and it'll do that.</v>

3706
01:33:05.511 --> 01:33:06.344
<v Speaker 4>It'll pop that up,</v>

3707
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:06.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3708
01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:07.041
<v Speaker 4>then I can say,</v>

3709
01:33:07.041 --> 01:33:08.060
<v Speaker 4>call that steak restaurant,</v>

3710
01:33:08.061 --> 01:33:09.380
<v Speaker 4>but once open table supports it,</v>

3711
01:33:09.381 --> 01:33:09.711
<v Speaker 4>I can say,</v>

3712
01:33:09.711 --> 01:33:10.340
<v Speaker 4>Hey Siri,</v>

3713
01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:10.610
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3714
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:13.280
<v Speaker 4>but me reservation for four at six at that restaurant and it's just going to</v>

3715
01:33:13.281 --> 01:33:14.070
<v Speaker 4>connect to the database.</v>

3716
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.361
<v Speaker 4>Do what?</v>

3717
01:33:14.361 --> 01:33:14.990
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

3718
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Invite my friends,</v>

3719
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:17.083
<v Speaker 4>invite Joe.</v>

3720
01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:17.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3721
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:18.590
<v Speaker 4>the texting alone,</v>

3722
01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:20.570
<v Speaker 4>I think is the best when you're just driving.</v>

3723
01:33:20.571 --> 01:33:21.404
<v Speaker 4>You push a button.</v>

3724
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.710
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty accurate.</v>

3725
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.800
<v Speaker 4>Google has had that for a while.</v>

3726
01:33:24.801 --> 01:33:25.880
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work this good though.</v>

3727
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:28.160
<v Speaker 4>This works almost perfect.</v>

3728
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I probably fuck up more just doing it by hand and it's weird speaking into it</v>

3729
01:33:32.931 --> 01:33:34.910
<v Speaker 4>cause you still got to kind of talk to it like a robot.</v>

3730
01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.740
<v Speaker 4>You can't be totally fluent with it.</v>

3731
01:33:36.741 --> 01:33:38.240
<v Speaker 4>And for like grammatical things,</v>

3732
01:33:38.241 --> 01:33:40.400
<v Speaker 4>like I'm still a stickler with grammar even in text.</v>

3733
01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.121
<v Speaker 4>So I'll be like,</v>

3734
01:33:41.121 --> 01:33:41.631
<v Speaker 4>hey Joe,</v>

3735
01:33:41.631 --> 01:33:42.464
<v Speaker 4>comma,</v>

3736
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:44.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a little late period.</v>

3737
01:33:44.150 --> 01:33:44.931
<v Speaker 4>Hope that's okay.</v>

3738
01:33:44.931 --> 01:33:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Period.</v>

3739
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:46.011
<v Speaker 4>Does it right.</v>

3740
01:33:46.011 --> 01:33:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Period and Chroma.</v>

3741
01:33:46.730 --> 01:33:48.480
<v Speaker 4>It actually drops the period ends.</v>

3742
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3743
01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>

3744
01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.670
<v Speaker 1>have you ever tried writing like that with like a,</v>

3745
01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:51.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3746
01:33:51.951 --> 01:33:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I know they have a,</v>

3747
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:54.040
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

3748
01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:54.660
<v Speaker 1>the software,</v>

3749
01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.720
<v Speaker 4>like a dragon naturally speaking.</v>

3750
01:33:56.721 --> 01:33:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3751
01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.231
<v Speaker 4>I tried that before,</v>

3752
01:33:58.231 --> 01:33:59.940
<v Speaker 4>but I write in a different,</v>

3753
01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:03.000
<v Speaker 4>at a different pace with a different cadence than cadence than I speak.</v>

3754
01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:05.250
<v Speaker 4>So for me it was really disjointed.</v>

3755
01:34:05.251 --> 01:34:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Like I would say something and they'd be wanting to change the,</v>

3756
01:34:07.381 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 4>I edit as I write.</v>

3757
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:09.210
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

3758
01:34:09.210 --> 01:34:10.350
<v Speaker 4>really a terrible way to right.</v>

3759
01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.420
<v Speaker 4>But doing that verbally it was even harder.</v>

3760
01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.070
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3761
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:14.490
<v Speaker 4>it was already past the sentence and I was like,</v>

3762
01:34:14.491 --> 01:34:14.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3763
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

3764
01:34:15.771 --> 01:34:16.604
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

3765
01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I liked the idea of it and what I had thought about doing was writing at the</v>

3766
01:34:21.681 --> 01:34:25.250
<v Speaker 1>same time as running the program in the background.</v>

3767
01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.700
<v Speaker 1>So the program would pick up some of the words and some of the things that I</v>

3768
01:34:28.701 --> 01:34:32.470
<v Speaker 1>would say so just in case I couldn't remember what the fuck I had said while I</v>

3769
01:34:32.471 --> 01:34:33.530
<v Speaker 1>was writing things.</v>

3770
01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:34.730
<v Speaker 1>But I I agree with you,</v>

3771
01:34:34.731 --> 01:34:35.091
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3772
01:34:35.091 --> 01:34:38.840
<v Speaker 1>there's an intention to actually physically typing out the each individual</v>

3773
01:34:38.841 --> 01:34:39.470
<v Speaker 1>letter.</v>

3774
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.801
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3775
01:34:39.801 --> 01:34:41.180
<v Speaker 1>when the way I describe it as,</v>

3776
01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:42.680
<v Speaker 1>if you write the word occupy,</v>

3777
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it takes longer to write the word occupied then to know it</v>

3778
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:50.000
<v Speaker 1>or to know what you're saying.</v>

3779
01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:50.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what you thinking.</v>

3780
01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:54.080
<v Speaker 1>So it forces you to think about things just a little bit longer and it,</v>

3781
01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it creatively,</v>

3782
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>it to me at least it opens different avenues</v>

3783
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:00.140
<v Speaker 2>for possibilities for potentials.</v>

3784
01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Like the way I always get my biggest like,</v>

3785
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:02.911
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

3786
01:35:02.911 --> 01:35:03.830
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm writing.</v>

3787
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>

3788
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3789
01:35:04.641 --> 01:35:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I get them in ad libbing on stage and stuff.</v>

3790
01:35:06.621 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3791
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:10.040
<v Speaker 2>But in actually sitting down and writing about something,</v>

3792
01:35:10.041 --> 01:35:11.270
<v Speaker 2>that's when you know,</v>

3793
01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 2>paths just appear.</v>

3794
01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:14.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3795
01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:15.590
<v Speaker 2>roads just show themselves,</v>

3796
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:16.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3797
01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:17.360
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think you'd see,</v>

3798
01:35:17.361 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I get crippling anxiety.</v>

3799
01:35:18.531 --> 01:35:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to do it and it's,</v>

3800
01:35:19.451 --> 01:35:20.480
<v Speaker 2>it's so releasing.</v>

3801
01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:21.291
<v Speaker 2>But when I do it,</v>

3802
01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:22.124
<v Speaker 2>I just see,</v>

3803
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I see those roads as highways that have sheer cliffs at the end of them and I'm</v>

3804
01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:26.031
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

3805
01:35:26.031 --> 01:35:26.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3806
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:27.623
<v Speaker 2>got to commit.</v>

3807
01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:29.960
<v Speaker 2>You gotta commit to one that's not good.</v>

3808
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Writing Music.</v>

3809
01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:31.060
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

3810
01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:31.340
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

3811
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:32.210
<v Speaker 2>You listen to music when you're right.</v>

3812
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I try to listen to the language that I don't understand.</v>

3813
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I like Brazilian music or Puerto Rican music.</v>

3814
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I like music with the lyrics.</v>

3815
01:35:38.661 --> 01:35:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Even if I don't understand them,</v>

3816
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I can do it in the background a little bit as long as I don't understand it.</v>

3817
01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Or sometimes if I'm really high,</v>

3818
01:35:44.841 --> 01:35:45.950
<v Speaker 2>especially on edibles,</v>

3819
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll pick one song and just throw that bitch on reboot and I'll listen to the</v>

3820
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:50.840
<v Speaker 2>same song a hundred times in a row.</v>

3821
01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3822
01:35:51.090 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3823
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3824
01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:52.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3825
01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 2>so I wrote some of my best shit on a plane.</v>

3826
01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Blasted listening to the same song over and over and over.</v>

3827
01:35:57.730 --> 01:35:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3828
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:59.720
<v Speaker 2>If you heard a song pumped up kicks,</v>

3829
01:35:59.721 --> 01:36:00.441
<v Speaker 2>I know you've probably had.</v>

3830
01:36:00.441 --> 01:36:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3831
01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:01.600
<v Speaker 2>they have you,</v>

3832
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.930
<v Speaker 2>you know what that Song's about?</v>

3833
01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Talked about this last part I didn't know we talked.</v>

3834
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3835
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.721
<v Speaker 2>we talked about,</v>

3836
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I think we might've talked about it off the air.</v>

3837
01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked to in the green room or something like that.</v>

3838
01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:10.280
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3839
01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.430
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it was.</v>

3840
01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:13.430
<v Speaker 2>That how the lyrics are all about Columbine.</v>

3841
01:36:13.431 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

3842
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:16.760
<v Speaker 2>that was one like a song I might maybe listened to like 10 times.</v>

3843
01:36:16.761 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Love this song.</v>

3844
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And then Johnny rotten told me like,</v>

3845
01:36:19.611 --> 01:36:19.911
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3846
01:36:19.911 --> 01:36:20.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3847
01:36:20.091 --> 01:36:22.940
<v Speaker 2>it's all about calling mine and now it's even more crazy.</v>

3848
01:36:22.941 --> 01:36:23.320
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

3849
01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I love bread lyrics.</v>

3850
01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:24.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3851
01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:25.760
<v Speaker 2>it's scary.</v>

3852
01:36:25.761 --> 01:36:26.330
<v Speaker 2>It's freaky.</v>

3853
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3854
01:36:26.690 --> 01:36:27.440
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

3855
01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.190
<v Speaker 2>But it's also crazy that people are just dancing around it too without thinking</v>

3856
01:36:31.191 --> 01:36:33.620
<v Speaker 2>about nam fabrics came into the octagon with that.</v>

3857
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3858
01:36:34.521 --> 01:36:36.140
<v Speaker 2>That's what he was playing when he came into the octagon.</v>

3859
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:37.783
<v Speaker 2>Interesting choice.</v>

3860
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:40.200
<v Speaker 2>They run out run Maya.</v>

3861
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.580
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3862
01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.271
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to,</v>

3863
01:36:41.271 --> 01:36:42.350
<v Speaker 2>there's like a spectrum of,</v>

3864
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:45.890
<v Speaker 2>there's like a frequency spectrum that's supposed to induce that kind of zoning</v>

3865
01:36:45.891 --> 01:36:47.210
<v Speaker 2>out and I started riding with that lately.</v>

3866
01:36:47.211 --> 01:36:48.920
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy what you do it all the time.</v>

3867
01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:49.700
<v Speaker 2>If you search,</v>

3868
01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.860
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's meditation videos and it's like 900 and something hurts a sine</v>

3869
01:36:53.861 --> 01:36:54.291
<v Speaker 2>waves,</v>

3870
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:54.890
<v Speaker 2>that kind of loop.</v>

3871
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:56.690
<v Speaker 2>But people have done made them like pretty sounding,</v>

3872
01:36:56.691 --> 01:36:57.560
<v Speaker 2>not just an annoying thing,</v>

3873
01:36:57.561 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 2>it's just filter sweeps.</v>

3874
01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:01.460
<v Speaker 2>There were certain band pass that triggers that sort of white noise effect.</v>

3875
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:04.370
<v Speaker 2>So what is it as you went to like meditative noise if you have headphones on,</v>

3876
01:37:04.371 --> 01:37:05.204
<v Speaker 2>it's like buying your role.</v>

3877
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:05.991
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>

3878
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:06.501
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of cool.</v>

3879
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's supposed to enhance creativity?</v>

3880
01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:08.451
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3881
01:37:08.451 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3882
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.740
<v Speaker 2>well if I think you like songs with properties sometimes that you just zone out</v>

3883
01:37:12.741 --> 01:37:12.861
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3884
01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:13.011
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3885
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:13.491
<v Speaker 2>It's on a loop.</v>

3886
01:37:13.491 --> 01:37:14.750
<v Speaker 2>You let it go or are you listen to them?</v>

3887
01:37:14.751 --> 01:37:16.280
<v Speaker 2>So I like to be inspired too though,</v>

3888
01:37:16.281 --> 01:37:16.521
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3889
01:37:16.521 --> 01:37:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

3890
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3891
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.941
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3892
01:37:17.941 --> 01:37:18.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3893
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:20.000
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's not for every writing moment,</v>

3894
01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:21.980
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's great to put on something that,</v>

3895
01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:22.460
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3896
01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.750
<v Speaker 2>that does kind of zone you out.</v>

3897
01:37:23.751 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 2>So you're only in that process.</v>

3898
01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:28.850
<v Speaker 2>That helps me because audible distractions knocked me out like crazy.</v>

3899
01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

3900
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3901
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:31.791
<v Speaker 2>sometimes no.</v>

3902
01:37:31.791 --> 01:37:33.620
<v Speaker 2>It really depends on where I'm at with writing,</v>

3903
01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:34.910
<v Speaker 2>what I'm writing about,</v>

3904
01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:35.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3905
01:37:35.301 --> 01:37:35.431
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3906
01:37:35.431 --> 01:37:35.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3907
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.930
<v Speaker 2>there's sometimes I need to be completely quiet completely by myself.</v>

3908
01:37:38.931 --> 01:37:39.310
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3909
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3910
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

3911
01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.890
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm a huge proponent of the isolation tank and I come up with some of</v>

3912
01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:43.970
<v Speaker 2>my best ideas.</v>

3913
01:37:43.971 --> 01:37:45.560
<v Speaker 2>We're still having that,</v>

3914
01:37:45.561 --> 01:37:47.750
<v Speaker 2>did it sober for an hour and that wasn't enough.</v>

3915
01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3916
01:37:48.741 --> 01:37:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm talking to you.</v>

3917
01:37:50.361 --> 01:37:50.750
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3918
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the weird things that people talk about online all the time that</v>

3919
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:56.370
<v Speaker 2>listen to this podcast is how many of my friends</v>

3920
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:58.560
<v Speaker 1>or I'll fucking psychedelic freaks,</v>

3921
01:37:58.710 --> 01:37:58.951
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3922
01:37:58.951 --> 01:37:59.251
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3923
01:37:59.251 --> 01:38:01.410
<v Speaker 1>they're trippers and they've never tried the tank.</v>

3924
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:03.750
<v Speaker 1>The tank is right by one.</v>

3925
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:04.561
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3926
01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>

3927
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:06.210
<v Speaker 1>You need to get in there.</v>

3928
01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3929
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:07.950
<v Speaker 1>you're just scared.</v>

3930
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scared.</v>

3931
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Just don't have money to spend on.</v>

3932
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

3933
01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:10.991
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

3934
01:38:10.991 --> 01:38:11.641
<v Speaker 1>I'll set it up.</v>

3935
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:12.121
<v Speaker 1>I'll set it up.</v>

3936
01:38:12.121 --> 01:38:12.954
<v Speaker 1>I promise you.</v>

3937
01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:13.591
<v Speaker 1>I'll set it up.</v>

3938
01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:14.311
<v Speaker 1>We'll set it up this week.</v>

3939
01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll hook it up.</v>

3940
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it with you.</v>

3941
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.111
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do it,</v>

3942
01:38:16.111 --> 01:38:16.944
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it</v>

3943
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.931
<v Speaker 1>double day,</v>

3944
01:38:18.931 --> 01:38:19.764
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

3945
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You need to get in there,</v>

3946
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:23.011
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3947
01:38:23.011 --> 01:38:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's analyzing any part of their mind,</v>

3948
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:27.743
<v Speaker 1>their thoughts.</v>

3949
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So the most amazing tool ever.</v>

3950
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I started to feel it probably,</v>

3951
01:38:30.631 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I imagined was 45 55 minutes into it.</v>

3952
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:34.261
<v Speaker 1>Even while sober,</v>

3953
01:38:34.261 --> 01:38:35.130
<v Speaker 1>like I really was like,</v>

3954
01:38:35.131 --> 01:38:35.371
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3955
01:38:35.371 --> 01:38:36.720
<v Speaker 1>just let that shit go,</v>

3956
01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:37.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3957
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:39.420
<v Speaker 1>lose track and control of where your fingertips.</v>

3958
01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Then the water begins just shut all that shit out.</v>

3959
01:38:41.761 --> 01:38:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And I started to get there and I swear the moment I was getting their brands</v>

3960
01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:45.601
<v Speaker 1>hatch open,</v>

3961
01:38:45.601 --> 01:38:46.560
<v Speaker 1>like your session's done.</v>

3962
01:38:46.561 --> 01:38:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3963
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:47.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

3964
01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:49.043
<v Speaker 1>I caught the bug,</v>

3965
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:50.051
<v Speaker 1>but I've got to get back in.</v>

3966
01:38:50.051 --> 01:38:50.521
<v Speaker 1>And just like,</v>

3967
01:38:50.521 --> 01:38:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3968
01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:52.410
<v Speaker 1>we're talking to him in the kitchen before the show.</v>

3969
01:38:52.411 --> 01:38:55.620
<v Speaker 1>He was asking me about a dreaming and you know what?</v>

3970
01:38:55.621 --> 01:38:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Different nootropics that create or enhance the,</v>

3971
01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.780
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of lucid dreaming.</v>

3972
01:39:01.110 --> 01:39:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about the lucid dream is that it's really slippery because once</v>

3973
01:39:05.251 --> 01:39:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you realize you're dreaming,</v>

3974
01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:07.530
<v Speaker 1>you kind of wake up real quick.</v>

3975
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing about the tank.</v>

3976
01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:11.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like these states that you can achieve.</v>

3977
01:39:11.401 --> 01:39:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I have achieved some really bizarre states,</v>

3978
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:15.570
<v Speaker 1>the most bizarre one.</v>

3979
01:39:15.571 --> 01:39:16.620
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this before,</v>

3980
01:39:16.621 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's so fascinating.</v>

3981
01:39:18.061 --> 01:39:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I have to bring it up and I'd never do it justice.</v>

3982
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I was in a jungle and I was with this indigenous population.</v>

3983
01:39:24.721 --> 01:39:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what their language was,</v>

3984
01:39:26.101 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but I understood it.</v>

3985
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:30.180
<v Speaker 1>They were making a bunch of strange noises and sounds and I was,</v>

3986
01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking in their language or yourself where you physically move as best</v>

3987
01:39:34.141 --> 01:39:34.530
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

3988
01:39:34.530 --> 01:39:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I was moving,</v>

3989
01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see myself.</v>

3990
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a third person shooter.</v>

3991
01:39:38.230 --> 01:39:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3992
01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:40.890
<v Speaker 1>it was very first person I was walking around.</v>

3993
01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember feeling the dirt under my feet,</v>

3994
01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:47.580
<v Speaker 1>feeling the leaves and these people were talking and I was talking with them or</v>

3995
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:47.791
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3996
01:39:47.791 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't talking with them.</v>

3997
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I was understanding what they were saying and as I was understanding what they</v>

3998
01:39:52.051 --> 01:39:52.501
<v Speaker 1>were saying,</v>

3999
01:39:52.501 --> 01:39:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I was realizing what the fuck.</v>

4000
01:39:54.721 --> 01:39:55.411
<v Speaker 1>I understand this,</v>

4001
01:39:55.411 --> 01:39:58.770
<v Speaker 1>but I was saying that to myself in English and then I was like,</v>

4002
01:39:58.771 --> 01:39:59.670
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

4003
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:00.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

4004
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.511
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4005
01:40:00.511 --> 01:40:01.344
<v Speaker 1>this is a dream.</v>

4006
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.771
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

4007
01:40:01.771 --> 01:40:02.604
<v Speaker 1>And then it was over.</v>

4008
01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:05.280
<v Speaker 1>But the moment while it was happening,</v>

4009
01:40:05.281 --> 01:40:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it was so amazing because it only lasted a couple minutes.</v>

4010
01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It was really brief.</v>

4011
01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:14.790
<v Speaker 1>But in that couple of minutes it was so crazy.</v>

4012
01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:15.780
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>

4013
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:16.050
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4014
01:40:16.050 --> 01:40:16.351
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4015
01:40:16.351 --> 01:40:17.490
<v Speaker 1>your whatever it is,</v>

4016
01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:18.900
<v Speaker 1>whether it's imagination,</v>

4017
01:40:18.901 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 1>whether it's genetic memory,</v>

4018
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean you know who the fuck knows what is stored in cells as they transfer from</v>

4019
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:28.470
<v Speaker 1>generation to generation generation.</v>

4020
01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:33.620
<v Speaker 1>There may very well be some wacky fucking file and your hard drive and you just</v>

4021
01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:36.440
<v Speaker 1>get in an isolation tank on a pot Brownie and it goes,</v>

4022
01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:40.380
<v Speaker 1>pops open this one little cartridge that you weren't supposed to access that</v>

4023
01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>portion of your mental hard drive and just beam that experience.</v>

4024
01:40:43.351 --> 01:40:46.890
<v Speaker 1>And there's some little monkey person from 500,000 years ago walking through a</v>

4025
01:40:46.891 --> 01:40:47.521
<v Speaker 1>rain forest,</v>

4026
01:40:47.521 --> 01:40:50.670
<v Speaker 1>speaking in some dead language before the cosmetic reset.</v>

4027
01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 1>If that was one of those,</v>

4028
01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:52.231
<v Speaker 1>those lives,</v>

4029
01:40:52.231 --> 01:40:53.230
<v Speaker 1>that was one of those checkpoints,</v>

4030
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:53.680
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4031
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 1>here you go.</v>

4032
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:54.580
<v Speaker 1>It was the,</v>

4033
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:55.990
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the weirdest things and the other,</v>

4034
01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.970
<v Speaker 1>the other weirder one is I am,</v>

4035
01:40:57.971 --> 01:40:59.730
<v Speaker 1>what's the other weird ones?</v>

4036
01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I've had hundreds of thousands of these guys' dicks.</v>

4037
01:41:03.450 --> 01:41:05.370
<v Speaker 1>All it a wired like you're just surrounded by,</v>

4038
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.530
<v Speaker 1>they have a dick inside of them.</v>

4039
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.960
<v Speaker 1>The Dick comes out like the [inaudible] penises.</v>

4040
01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4041
01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4042
01:41:12.090 --> 01:41:17.090
<v Speaker 1>the number one thing is that you can never quite get deep enough like you get,</v>

4043
01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:19.953
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

4044
01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of videos of me talking about this online,</v>

4045
01:41:22.751 --> 01:41:25.030
<v Speaker 1>but there's one of them that some guy made on youtube.</v>

4046
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Thank you everybody.</v>

4047
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Whoever does those fucking videos and all you people doing,</v>

4048
01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people do them and take a little clips out of the podcast.</v>

4049
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Your community does a phenomenal job of,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's crazy you and everything you say and they do a really great job.</v>

4052
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Super Fortunate.</v>

4053
01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:38.510
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

4054
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:39.221
<v Speaker 1>I always say that too,</v>

4055
01:41:39.221 --> 01:41:40.210
<v Speaker 1>when I go to comedy clubs too,</v>

4056
01:41:40.211 --> 01:41:40.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4057
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:40.731
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4058
01:41:40.731 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 1>the people at comedy clubs always say the same thing.</v>

4059
01:41:42.521 --> 01:41:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Like you have the nicest fans then the nicest,</v>

4060
01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:45.733
<v Speaker 1>most generous.</v>

4061
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how that happened.</v>

4062
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

4063
01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:49.141
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4064
01:41:49.141 --> 01:41:49.751
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

4065
01:41:49.751 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4066
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:50.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4067
01:41:50.201 --> 01:41:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I guess he put it out there and you know,</v>

4068
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you hope that people see it the way you see it,</v>

4069
01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

4070
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:55.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4071
01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:55.570
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

4072
01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I think they respect if you don't see it the way they see it.</v>

4073
01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:58.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think they,</v>

4074
01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.950
<v Speaker 1>they see that in you as well.</v>

4075
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you're very respectful.</v>

4076
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Even if someone disagrees with you,</v>

4077
01:42:02.441 --> 01:42:06.130
<v Speaker 1>like you're able to have that conversation when a large cross section of society</v>

4078
01:42:06.131 --> 01:42:06.671
<v Speaker 1>isn't well,</v>

4079
01:42:06.671 --> 01:42:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I certainly tried to hiring to see that your fans carry that with them in</v>

4080
01:42:10.011 --> 01:42:10.390
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

4081
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Like I always have a good time chatting with your fans.</v>

4082
01:42:11.891 --> 01:42:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

4083
01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:12.701
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

4084
01:42:12.701 --> 01:42:13.190
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

4085
01:42:13.190 --> 01:42:13.481
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

4086
01:42:13.481 --> 01:42:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4087
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's going to be,</v>

4088
01:42:14.410 --> 01:42:15.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4089
01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.000
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do,</v>

4090
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:17.320
<v Speaker 1>so there's going to be a certain amount of people,</v>

4091
01:42:17.321 --> 01:42:17.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4092
01:42:17.501 --> 01:42:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about this yesterday.</v>

4093
01:42:18.461 --> 01:42:18.661
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

4094
01:42:18.661 --> 01:42:18.921
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

4095
01:42:18.921 --> 01:42:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I was responding to a bunch of people who were being insulting.</v>

4096
01:42:20.861 --> 01:42:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4097
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.791
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4098
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:22.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4099
01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.660
<v Speaker 1>you kind of learn how to communicate with someone as if they were right there.</v>

4100
01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4101
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And so many people don't do that.</v>

4102
01:42:27.701 --> 01:42:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And the built in anonymity that the Internet has,</v>

4103
01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:35.470
<v Speaker 1>has people have like added it to like their,</v>

4104
01:42:35.471 --> 01:42:35.711
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

4105
01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:36.610
<v Speaker 1>their rights.</v>

4106
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:36.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4107
01:42:36.941 --> 01:42:39.610
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you're allowed to be a cut because you're anonymous.</v>

4108
01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a certain amount of disrespect that people allow it to like</v>

4109
01:42:43.301 --> 01:42:44.230
<v Speaker 1>shine on people.</v>

4110
01:42:44.231 --> 01:42:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4111
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:45.011
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4112
01:42:45.011 --> 01:42:46.330
<v Speaker 1>this is not necessary.</v>

4113
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4114
01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:50.590
<v Speaker 1>like there was a conversation that Duncan and I were having and that some people</v>

4115
01:42:50.591 --> 01:42:52.510
<v Speaker 1>loved and some people just did not love.</v>

4116
01:42:52.511 --> 01:42:53.081
<v Speaker 1>And there was,</v>

4117
01:42:53.081 --> 01:42:53.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4118
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:54.880
<v Speaker 1>some of the discussion about it was like,</v>

4119
01:42:55.150 --> 01:43:00.150
<v Speaker 1>it was so bizarre how some people just have no problem just being completely</v>

4120
01:43:00.851 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 1>fucking rude when they know that you're going to read it,</v>

4121
01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.271
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4122
01:43:04.271 --> 01:43:09.271
<v Speaker 1>And they're talking about it in a way that's just not even remotely considering</v>

4123
01:43:09.971 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 1>how a person's going to receive it.</v>

4124
01:43:11.410 --> 01:43:11.861
<v Speaker 1>I it's,</v>

4125
01:43:11.861 --> 01:43:12.071
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4126
01:43:12.071 --> 01:43:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole age thing too.</v>

4127
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I bet a lot of these people are like 13 and 14 right?</v>

4128
01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4129
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4130
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:17.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we can stop that.</v>

4131
01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4132
01:43:18.650 --> 01:43:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Unless we figure out some way to register it.</v>

4133
01:43:20.381 --> 01:43:20.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4134
01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:24.310
<v Speaker 1>we know that a wick was posting on my message for when he was 13 years old.</v>

4135
01:43:24.311 --> 01:43:24.940
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

4136
01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:25.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4137
01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:26.180
<v Speaker 1>and yeah.</v>

4138
01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:26.980
<v Speaker 1>See one of the good ones.</v>

4139
01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:27.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4140
01:43:27.161 --> 01:43:27.701
<v Speaker 1>he's great.</v>

4141
01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:28.181
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>

4142
01:43:28.181 --> 01:43:28.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4143
01:43:28.361 --> 01:43:28.700
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

4144
01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:31.810
<v Speaker 1>he's actually going to be our science adviser when he graduates from school.</v>

4145
01:43:31.811 --> 01:43:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to hook them up with a job and he'll be our science advisors.</v>

4146
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I was so many times when we talk about shit,</v>

4147
01:43:36.311 --> 01:43:38.360
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what the fuck we're talking about and he's pulling his hair out in</v>

4148
01:43:38.361 --> 01:43:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Houston so we're going to have to hire him.</v>

4149
01:43:40.930 --> 01:43:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

4150
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked at the anger and vitriol that even my fans had initially when I</v>

4151
01:43:47.561 --> 01:43:50.080
<v Speaker 1>started talking about like occupy and started talking about other things.</v>

4152
01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:50.401
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

4153
01:43:50.401 --> 01:43:50.891
<v Speaker 1>and that was a little,</v>

4154
01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

4155
01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I was a little shattered</v>

4156
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:53.090
<v Speaker 4>and it made me question,</v>

4157
01:43:53.091 --> 01:43:55.010
<v Speaker 4>should I even be talking about this?</v>

4158
01:43:55.011 --> 01:43:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Should I be taking a stance?</v>

4159
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:56.570
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like,</v>

4160
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.781
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4161
01:43:56.781 --> 01:43:58.820
<v Speaker 4>absolutely I should be because I want to be.</v>

4162
01:43:59.030 --> 01:44:03.050
<v Speaker 4>And immediately when I started engaging in the conversations with the guys that</v>

4163
01:44:03.051 --> 01:44:04.400
<v Speaker 4>were all caps,</v>

4164
01:44:04.401 --> 01:44:05.210
<v Speaker 4>hatred,</v>

4165
01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:10.210
<v Speaker 4>no matter what it was like pretty much 99% of them either turned around and saw</v>

4166
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:12.021
<v Speaker 4>at least recognize.</v>

4167
01:44:12.021 --> 01:44:14.690
<v Speaker 4>That was another point of view or tone down the rhetoric rhetoric and was like,</v>

4168
01:44:14.691 --> 01:44:14.811
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4169
01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:14.991
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4170
01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:15.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4171
01:44:15.141 --> 01:44:15.621
<v Speaker 4>I disagree,</v>

4172
01:44:15.621 --> 01:44:17.510
<v Speaker 4>but I appreciate that you're doing what you're doing.</v>

4173
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:19.670
<v Speaker 4>And people just want to get your fucking attention clearly,</v>

4174
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.991
<v Speaker 4>clearly,</v>

4175
01:44:20.991 --> 01:44:21.620
<v Speaker 4>clearly.</v>

4176
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:24.080
<v Speaker 4>But this is the kind of thing though where you know,</v>

4177
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:25.191
<v Speaker 4>you never know.</v>

4178
01:44:25.191 --> 01:44:26.420
<v Speaker 4>So you have to engage,</v>

4179
01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:27.141
<v Speaker 4>you have to engage.</v>

4180
01:44:27.141 --> 01:44:27.974
<v Speaker 4>If people are like,</v>

4181
01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:28.401
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4182
01:44:28.401 --> 01:44:29.840
<v Speaker 4>this is wrong and this is factually correct,</v>

4183
01:44:29.841 --> 01:44:30.021
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

4184
01:44:30.021 --> 01:44:30.111
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4185
01:44:30.111 --> 01:44:30.231
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4186
01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:31.160
<v Speaker 4>here's the story.</v>

4187
01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:31.581
<v Speaker 4>Read it.</v>

4188
01:44:31.581 --> 01:44:32.414
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen it?</v>

4189
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:37.450
<v Speaker 4>You have to engage because for every troll there is one person who doesn't look</v>

4190
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:38.360
<v Speaker 4>up the address.</v>

4191
01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.180
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have access to be upset about shit.</v>

4192
01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.950
<v Speaker 5>Even if that shit has nothing to do with it.</v>

4193
01:44:41.951 --> 01:44:43.270
<v Speaker 5>Like I can't tell you when you fucking,</v>

4194
01:44:43.271 --> 01:44:44.950
<v Speaker 5>people were upset at this Alpha brain shit.</v>

4195
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:46.350
<v Speaker 5>Then I'm selling these nootropics,</v>

4196
01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:46.571
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

4197
01:44:46.571 --> 01:44:47.404
<v Speaker 5>these vitamins,</v>

4198
01:44:47.850 --> 01:44:51.490
<v Speaker 5>but just going crazy on Twitter about it's a placebo.</v>

4199
01:44:51.491 --> 01:44:53.920
<v Speaker 5>You're ripping people off and this is what I said,</v>

4200
01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:54.940
<v Speaker 5>I said very clearly,</v>

4201
01:44:54.941 --> 01:44:57.670
<v Speaker 5>and I repeat this at every fucking step of the way.</v>

4202
01:44:58.150 --> 01:45:03.150
<v Speaker 5>The proprietary blend that we have in that Alpha brain is available online.</v>

4203
01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:05.500
<v Speaker 5>If you're interested and you are on a budget,</v>

4204
01:45:05.501 --> 01:45:10.501
<v Speaker 5>please go to a vitamin store or order the individual components can get is</v>

4205
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:12.450
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

4206
01:45:12.450 --> 01:45:13.780
<v Speaker 5>You can get it at a discounted rate.</v>

4207
01:45:13.781 --> 01:45:16.120
<v Speaker 5>You could probably save like 50% or something.</v>

4208
01:45:16.121 --> 01:45:17.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I see the big,</v>

4209
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:20.650
<v Speaker 5>big thing is that [inaudible] he's using all the good shit,</v>

4210
01:45:20.651 --> 01:45:21.484
<v Speaker 5>so in the pills,</v>

4211
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.540
<v Speaker 5>the good shit is the best stuff that we can sell.</v>

4212
01:45:25.570 --> 01:45:27.090
<v Speaker 5>What is the best stuff that's available?</v>

4213
01:45:27.091 --> 01:45:30.150
<v Speaker 5>I think I've noticed lately point though I don't.</v>

4214
01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:30.821
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

4215
01:45:30.821 --> 01:45:34.810
<v Speaker 5>I my my number one concern when I talk about anything that I like,</v>

4216
01:45:34.811 --> 01:45:36.820
<v Speaker 5>anything that's benefited my life and know this,</v>

4217
01:45:36.821 --> 01:45:38.500
<v Speaker 5>this is a true statement.</v>

4218
01:45:38.650 --> 01:45:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4219
01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:40.440
<v Speaker 5>there's no exaggeration in,</v>

4220
01:45:40.441 --> 01:45:41.740
<v Speaker 5>there's no hyperbole whatsoever.</v>

4221
01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:42.310
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4222
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:43.570
<v Speaker 5>if I'm telling you about it,</v>

4223
01:45:44.290 --> 01:45:46.420
<v Speaker 5>I want you to do it because I think it will benefit you.</v>

4224
01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.290
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

4225
01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:47.900
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4226
01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to sell shit.</v>

4227
01:45:49.450 --> 01:45:52.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to say I have a fucking tee shirt line that I never bring up.</v>

4228
01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.980
<v Speaker 5>It's called higher primate doc clothing,</v>

4229
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:56.380
<v Speaker 5>higher-primate.com if I can never bring it up.</v>

4230
01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.760
<v Speaker 5>I wear the tee shirts every now and then.</v>

4231
01:45:57.761 --> 01:45:58.541
<v Speaker 5>I want people to buy them.</v>

4232
01:45:58.541 --> 01:45:59.320
<v Speaker 5>If you like them.</v>

4233
01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.131
<v Speaker 5>I see people with them.</v>

4234
01:46:00.131 --> 01:46:00.400
<v Speaker 5>It shows,</v>

4235
01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:00.821
<v Speaker 5>it shows.</v>

4236
01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:01.810
<v Speaker 5>I think it's cool as fuck.</v>

4237
01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to make a ton of money.</v>

4238
01:46:03.670 --> 01:46:03.901
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4239
01:46:03.901 --> 01:46:04.570
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

4240
01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:05.351
<v Speaker 5>I feel like him,</v>

4241
01:46:05.351 --> 01:46:05.861
<v Speaker 5>I like him.</v>

4242
01:46:05.861 --> 01:46:07.990
<v Speaker 5>I thought it'd be cool to have some funky tee shirts,</v>

4243
01:46:07.991 --> 01:46:09.730
<v Speaker 5>have a monkey's on psychedelics.</v>

4244
01:46:09.970 --> 01:46:10.721
<v Speaker 5>Nobody had them.</v>

4245
01:46:10.721 --> 01:46:12.070
<v Speaker 5>So I decided to make my own company.</v>

4246
01:46:12.071 --> 01:46:12.904
<v Speaker 5>It's that simple.</v>

4247
01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:13.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

4248
01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:17.320
<v Speaker 5>I make plenty of money doing standup and from the UFC.</v>

4249
01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:20.830
<v Speaker 5>I would never get behind anything that I didn't believe surprises me though.</v>

4250
01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.420
<v Speaker 5>You have to explain that my God,</v>

4251
01:46:22.421 --> 01:46:22.871
<v Speaker 5>your viewers,</v>

4252
01:46:22.871 --> 01:46:24.160
<v Speaker 5>because I just have to explain it.</v>

4253
01:46:24.161 --> 01:46:26.250
<v Speaker 5>Get in fucking furious arguments with people,</v>

4254
01:46:26.251 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 5>but the delicacy of these things where you,</v>

4255
01:46:28.050 --> 01:46:30.320
<v Speaker 5>you can't give them enough scientific information.</v>

4256
01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:30.611
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4257
01:46:30.611 --> 01:46:31.650
<v Speaker 5>those ones falls hours.</v>

4258
01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:32.091
<v Speaker 5>Patients,</v>

4259
01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Ms. Smith,</v>

4260
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.120
<v Speaker 5>you're telling me it's something that benefits Alzheimer's patient can't</v>

4261
01:46:35.130 --> 01:46:36.250
<v Speaker 5>possibly benefit people,</v>

4262
01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.720
<v Speaker 5>so it has an effect on their mind,</v>

4263
01:46:37.721 --> 01:46:39.130
<v Speaker 5>but it won't have an effect on a healthy mind.</v>

4264
01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:40.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking placebo.</v>

4265
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:41.020
<v Speaker 5>Some guy said,</v>

4266
01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:41.950
<v Speaker 5>you know what's better than that?</v>

4267
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.270
<v Speaker 5>Sleep and exercise.</v>

4268
01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4269
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:44.741
<v Speaker 5>but guess what?</v>

4270
01:46:44.741 --> 01:46:45.280
<v Speaker 5>Fuck face.</v>

4271
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.670
<v Speaker 5>You can have sleep and exercise and beds and vitamins.</v>

4272
01:46:48.671 --> 01:46:50.610
<v Speaker 5>Don't tell the vitamins don't work because they do work.</v>

4273
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:51.563
<v Speaker 5>Vitamins are excellent.</v>

4274
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.580
<v Speaker 5>I have video Lygo.</v>

4275
01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:54.780
<v Speaker 5>It's a skin condition where I lose pigment.</v>

4276
01:46:54.781 --> 01:46:55.560
<v Speaker 5>You can see it in my,</v>

4277
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.770
<v Speaker 5>like my knuckle was Jacksons.</v>

4278
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 5>I lose.</v>

4279
01:46:57.150 --> 01:46:57.391
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4280
01:46:57.391 --> 01:47:00.240
<v Speaker 5>but I only have a little couple spots and it's stopped.</v>

4281
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.481
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4282
01:47:00.481 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 5>when it stopped vitamins,</v>

4283
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:03.120
<v Speaker 5>I got heavily into vitamins.</v>

4284
01:47:03.121 --> 01:47:04.170
<v Speaker 5>When I first came to California,</v>

4285
01:47:04.171 --> 01:47:05.640
<v Speaker 5>I was under a tremendous amount of stress.</v>

4286
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.360
<v Speaker 5>I had never been on TV before and I noticed like get like these white spots on</v>

4287
01:47:09.361 --> 01:47:09.721
<v Speaker 5>my skin.</v>

4288
01:47:09.721 --> 01:47:09.961
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4289
01:47:09.961 --> 01:47:10.794
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>

4290
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 5>And they started spreading man.</v>

4291
01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 5>I started going to doctors.</v>

4292
01:47:13.351 --> 01:47:17.490
<v Speaker 5>I was going to a different video Lygo specialist and I would have to take these</v>

4293
01:47:17.491 --> 01:47:18.720
<v Speaker 5>things called Soar Linz.</v>

4294
01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.351
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4295
01:47:19.351 --> 01:47:21.210
<v Speaker 5>there were pills that made me super sensitive to light.</v>

4296
01:47:21.211 --> 01:47:22.140
<v Speaker 5>And then I have to get in like,</v>

4297
01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:23.250
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like a tanning booth,</v>

4298
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:25.380
<v Speaker 5>but you only go in there for three minutes and it's,</v>

4299
01:47:25.381 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 5>are they tried to tan the pigment?</v>

4300
01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:27.360
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

4301
01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:27.490
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4302
01:47:27.490 --> 01:47:27.630
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4303
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:29.280
<v Speaker 5>It's shocks the system.</v>

4304
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4305
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:30.601
<v Speaker 5>where the,</v>

4306
01:47:30.601 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 5>the parts that are losing pigment,</v>

4307
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.440
<v Speaker 5>it can bring them back to life and it works in a certain way.</v>

4308
01:47:34.441 --> 01:47:34.661
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4309
01:47:34.661 --> 01:47:36.690
<v Speaker 5>I repeat like my doctor Melatonin and they'd be like,</v>

4310
01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:37.081
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

4311
01:47:37.081 --> 01:47:37.561
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

4312
01:47:37.561 --> 01:47:39.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the exact science behind it,</v>

4313
01:47:39.241 --> 01:47:42.330
<v Speaker 5>but I had areas that were lost pigment and brought them back.</v>

4314
01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:45.000
<v Speaker 5>But you know what stopped all of it completely stopped in its tracks.</v>

4315
01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:48.840
<v Speaker 5>Vitamins 100% one cause you know received in those vitamins.</v>

4316
01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:49.410
<v Speaker 5>Let's see,</v>

4317
01:47:49.410 --> 01:47:50.250
<v Speaker 5>people are assholes.</v>

4318
01:47:50.251 --> 01:47:51.061
<v Speaker 5>Listen to and vitamins,</v>

4319
01:47:51.061 --> 01:47:51.570
<v Speaker 5>fucking word,</v>

4320
01:47:51.570 --> 01:47:52.590
<v Speaker 5>healthy diet works.</v>

4321
01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:53.740
<v Speaker 5>Vitamins work even too,</v>

4322
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.660
<v Speaker 5>but all of it works.</v>

4323
01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:56.730
<v Speaker 5>These people that would have held solely and show me the science.</v>

4324
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.890
<v Speaker 5>Where do you think they got the vitamins?</v>

4325
01:47:58.891 --> 01:48:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Witchcraft you fuck did you do the most lacking vitamins from food and the way</v>

4326
01:48:03.421 --> 01:48:05.520
<v Speaker 5>they're doing it is a scientific method.</v>

4327
01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:06.271
<v Speaker 5>They've done this,</v>

4328
01:48:06.271 --> 01:48:09.900
<v Speaker 5>they've applied scientific principles to extracting vitamins and they sell these</v>

4329
01:48:09.901 --> 01:48:10.734
<v Speaker 5>fucking buy it.</v>

4330
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 5>If you don't believe in Alpha brain,</v>

4331
01:48:12.841 --> 01:48:12.911
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4332
01:48:12.911 --> 01:48:13.980
<v Speaker 5>you don't believe in vitamins.</v>

4333
01:48:13.981 --> 01:48:14.611
<v Speaker 5>That's good for you.</v>

4334
01:48:14.611 --> 01:48:18.330
<v Speaker 5>But if you're fucking fighting people tooth and nail on something that they</v>

4335
01:48:18.331 --> 01:48:19.500
<v Speaker 5>absolutely believe in,</v>

4336
01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.030
<v Speaker 5>you're just trying to fight man.</v>

4337
01:48:21.090 --> 01:48:24.600
<v Speaker 5>And I guarantee you most likely what it is with a lot of these people is they're</v>

4338
01:48:24.601 --> 01:48:25.890
<v Speaker 5>not happy with their own life.</v>

4339
01:48:25.891 --> 01:48:27.120
<v Speaker 5>And they're probably smart,</v>

4340
01:48:27.121 --> 01:48:28.050
<v Speaker 5>but they're fucked up.</v>

4341
01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.510
<v Speaker 5>And what they're doing is they're focusing something,</v>

4342
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:31.680
<v Speaker 5>whether it's online,</v>

4343
01:48:31.681 --> 01:48:32.670
<v Speaker 5>whether it's an argument,</v>

4344
01:48:32.671 --> 01:48:35.160
<v Speaker 5>whether it's trying to win a flame war or whatever,</v>

4345
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:39.450
<v Speaker 5>and that becomes their distraction from their miserable existence that are</v>

4346
01:48:39.451 --> 01:48:41.880
<v Speaker 5>garbage pile up and they're fucking kitchen their bills.</v>

4347
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:42.241
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4348
01:48:42.241 --> 01:48:43.290
<v Speaker 5>their phone ringing off the hook.</v>

4349
01:48:43.630 --> 01:48:47.010
<v Speaker 5>There's the kind of person who could use a little faith in a placebo,</v>

4350
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.370
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4351
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:50.010
<v Speaker 5>Rather than being against it if it works,</v>

4352
01:48:50.011 --> 01:48:50.640
<v Speaker 5>go with it.</v>

4353
01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:53.670
<v Speaker 5>But here's the sad part about the really sad part about some of these people are</v>

4354
01:48:53.671 --> 01:48:55.080
<v Speaker 5>very fucking smart.</v>

4355
01:48:55.290 --> 01:48:56.610
<v Speaker 5>They're very interesting.</v>

4356
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 5>They're the,</v>

4357
01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:57.501
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4358
01:48:57.501 --> 01:48:57.781
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4359
01:48:57.781 --> 01:48:58.980
<v Speaker 5>the points that they make,</v>

4360
01:48:59.010 --> 01:49:00.510
<v Speaker 5>even though they're nonsense points,</v>

4361
01:49:00.511 --> 01:49:02.210
<v Speaker 5>they're very eloquently stated there,</v>

4362
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:03.300
<v Speaker 5>argued very well,</v>

4363
01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:06.540
<v Speaker 5>who said there's a very professional tone to the way they're writing things.</v>

4364
01:49:06.541 --> 01:49:06.721
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4365
01:49:06.721 --> 01:49:08.160
<v Speaker 5>this is a guy who,</v>

4366
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:08.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4367
01:49:08.581 --> 01:49:10.200
<v Speaker 5>obviously there's something wrong with this person.</v>

4368
01:49:10.201 --> 01:49:10.301
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>

4369
01:49:10.301 --> 01:49:12.590
<v Speaker 5>they're really going after this is it?</v>

4370
01:49:12.690 --> 01:49:16.600
<v Speaker 5>He's just as passionate as the facts that he's collected to support his opinion.</v>

4371
01:49:16.601 --> 01:49:16.740
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4372
01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:16.930
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4373
01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:17.130
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4374
01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:17.280
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4375
01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:17.971
<v Speaker 5>Not these people.</v>

4376
01:49:17.971 --> 01:49:20.040
<v Speaker 5>And I'm talking about there was no facts and they'd never know personal</v>

4377
01:49:20.041 --> 01:49:21.060
<v Speaker 5>experience whatsoever on these things.</v>

4378
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure I'm not,</v>

4379
01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:23.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm not speaking for those people.</v>

4380
01:49:23.341 --> 01:49:24.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that that there,</v>

4381
01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:26.280
<v Speaker 5>I've ran across this where there is like,</v>

4382
01:49:26.281 --> 01:49:26.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4383
01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:29.220
<v Speaker 5>data is the easiest fucking thing in this world to manipulate.</v>

4384
01:49:29.221 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 5>Any study can be skewed.</v>

4385
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:32.460
<v Speaker 5>You can prove this global warming doesn't exist.</v>

4386
01:49:32.610 --> 01:49:34.900
<v Speaker 5>You can prove pretty much whatever you want with numbers that way.</v>

4387
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:37.560
<v Speaker 5>The way you skewed my point though was that there,</v>

4388
01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:39.600
<v Speaker 5>there's obviously they're powerful.</v>

4389
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:42.120
<v Speaker 5>This is a good version of a human,</v>

4390
01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:43.620
<v Speaker 5>like this isn't a dope,</v>

4391
01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:45.330
<v Speaker 5>this isn't some fucking ditch.</v>

4392
01:49:45.331 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 5>Do you wish that they were donating their processes to</v>

4393
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.470
<v Speaker 1>more positive costs as opposed to being so negating?</v>

4394
01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:50.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4395
01:49:50.861 --> 01:49:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating that that would be a subject that would drive you nuts whether</v>

4396
01:49:54.161 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 1>or not vitamins work,</v>

4397
01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you know when they're on brain and brain brain vitamins where like what a,</v>

4398
01:49:57.491 --> 01:49:59.410
<v Speaker 1>what a weird thing to get all hyped about.</v>

4399
01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:03.430
<v Speaker 1>He might be idolizing you though and this is something that he believes though</v>

4400
01:50:03.431 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 1>and so this one issue with you has now shattered that and he has to prove you</v>

4401
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:06.910
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

4402
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:07.581
<v Speaker 1>Going to be that.</v>

4403
01:50:07.581 --> 01:50:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be the hyper fan or he could own 40 cats or contrarion.</v>

4404
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:14.070
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are just fucking control agents.</v>

4405
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:18.700
<v Speaker 1>They just lord teen battle or I don't think it's are 14 I think there's a lot of</v>

4406
01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:20.380
<v Speaker 1>older folks I had,</v>

4407
01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.273
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

4408
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:22.360
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

4409
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:27.390
<v Speaker 1>The point is that the way the Internet is set at set up now with the and anatomy</v>

4410
01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:29.230
<v Speaker 1>anonymity that's built in,</v>

4411
01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy for someone to be a Twat.</v>

4412
01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:32.530
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy.</v>

4413
01:50:32.531 --> 01:50:34.330
<v Speaker 1>There's like virtually no repercussions,</v>

4414
01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but slowly that's going to change and you better brace for it.</v>

4415
01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4416
01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Because the shit's going to come down on all you fuck eds because you're not</v>

4417
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:44.110
<v Speaker 1>going to be anonymous for very much longer.</v>

4418
01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4419
01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:45.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4420
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 1>suck boy 69 on fucking reddit or whatever the hell you know,</v>

4421
01:50:49.151 --> 01:50:49.841
<v Speaker 1>message board.</v>

4422
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:50.950
<v Speaker 1>You Act like a shit head on.</v>

4423
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 1>You're going the underground forum and mixed martial arts.com or on my own</v>

4424
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:55.054
<v Speaker 1>message board,</v>

4425
01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:57.730
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be anonymous that much longer.</v>

4426
01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It's really inevitable.</v>

4427
01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:02.950
<v Speaker 1>There's a clear trend and that trend is connectivity.</v>

4428
01:51:02.951 --> 01:51:06.080
<v Speaker 1>That trend is in interlacing of information and you're,</v>

4429
01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:08.920
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to avoid all the aspects of your life.</v>

4430
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:09.560
<v Speaker 1>That's why I wrote,</v>

4431
01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I wrote an I wired article like aimed at anonymous,</v>

4432
01:51:12.230 --> 01:51:14.960
<v Speaker 4>which I know was opening up the flood gates for me to just be attacked,</v>

4433
01:51:14.961 --> 01:51:16.700
<v Speaker 4>but my message to them was,</v>

4434
01:51:16.701 --> 01:51:17.151
<v Speaker 4>hey guys,</v>

4435
01:51:17.151 --> 01:51:17.541
<v Speaker 4>listen.</v>

4436
01:51:17.541 --> 01:51:20.600
<v Speaker 4>Like I know it's fun to deface websites and I know it's fun to have Twitter</v>

4437
01:51:20.601 --> 01:51:20.961
<v Speaker 4>accounts,</v>

4438
01:51:20.961 --> 01:51:22.220
<v Speaker 4>but you need to,</v>

4439
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:23.090
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're younger,</v>

4440
01:51:23.091 --> 01:51:24.320
<v Speaker 4>maybe you just don't give a fuck.</v>

4441
01:51:24.321 --> 01:51:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you really are doing it for the lols,</v>

4442
01:51:25.851 --> 01:51:29.840
<v Speaker 4>but you need to not get busted for the simple trivial shit right now.</v>

4443
01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:33.110
<v Speaker 4>Trolling people online and putting out their data because we need you for the</v>

4444
01:51:33.111 --> 01:51:33.770
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

4445
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:34.570
<v Speaker 4>The real fight.</v>

4446
01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:35.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4447
01:51:35.210 --> 01:51:39.140
<v Speaker 4>low sec just got turned in by an anonymous website proxy.</v>

4448
01:51:39.141 --> 01:51:39.590
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

4449
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:39.741
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4450
01:51:39.741 --> 01:51:40.161
<v Speaker 4>wait a sec.</v>

4451
01:51:40.161 --> 01:51:40.401
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4452
01:51:40.401 --> 01:51:42.380
<v Speaker 4>we definitely do this,</v>

4453
01:51:42.381 --> 01:51:43.730
<v Speaker 4>but in our thing I says,</v>

4454
01:51:43.731 --> 01:51:47.810
<v Speaker 4>don't do anything illegal and here we're giving the cops to the information.</v>

4455
01:51:47.811 --> 01:51:48.740
<v Speaker 4>So they all got arrested.</v>

4456
01:51:48.741 --> 01:51:50.900
<v Speaker 4>This people that hack what was a playstation?</v>

4457
01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:55.160
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is just like occupy Wall Street.</v>

4458
01:51:55.190 --> 01:51:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Who's in anonymous,</v>

4459
01:51:56.091 --> 01:51:56.930
<v Speaker 1>who's in La Sec.</v>

4460
01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.411
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

4461
01:51:57.411 --> 01:51:58.300
<v Speaker 1>it's an open door,</v>

4462
01:51:58.301 --> 01:51:58.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4463
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Any crazy?</v>

4464
01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Who's on my message board?</v>

4465
01:52:00.261 --> 01:52:00.951
<v Speaker 1>It's an open door.</v>

4466
01:52:00.951 --> 01:52:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Any crazy asshole can join up.</v>

4467
01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Certainly someone could,</v>

4468
01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:05.950
<v Speaker 4>someone could deface a website in the name of anonymous if you ever know.</v>

4469
01:52:05.951 --> 01:52:07.540
<v Speaker 4>And that's absolutely happening now.</v>

4470
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:08.531
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>

4471
01:52:08.531 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 4>there was a fake anonymous video posted to have like a to Hack Wall Street day.</v>

4472
01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:13.600
<v Speaker 4>And it was like on a Monday,</v>

4473
01:52:13.601 --> 01:52:14.920
<v Speaker 4>it was on a holiday and everybody said,</v>

4474
01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:19.150
<v Speaker 4>this is clearly a plant because anonymous would never be so stupid as to attack</v>

4475
01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:21.590
<v Speaker 4>the attack the markets on a,</v>

4476
01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:24.640
<v Speaker 4>on a holiday when the markets aren't that volatile and they would never post it</v>

4477
01:52:24.641 --> 01:52:25.474
<v Speaker 4>in these ways.</v>

4478
01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:26.650
<v Speaker 4>And people are already,</v>

4479
01:52:26.651 --> 01:52:27.880
<v Speaker 4>it's agent provocateur scores.</v>

4480
01:52:27.970 --> 01:52:29.280
<v Speaker 4>Just like the guy in the city bank.</v>

4481
01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:31.030
<v Speaker 4>They're doing that out of the fucking rallies,</v>

4482
01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:31.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4483
01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:32.110
<v Speaker 4>they're doing that as hacking.</v>

4484
01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.360
<v Speaker 4>What does this matter?</v>

4485
01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.840
<v Speaker 1>This mother fuckers anybody want on there?</v>

4486
01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:35.701
<v Speaker 1>That'd be awesome.</v>

4487
01:52:35.701 --> 01:52:36.180
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4488
01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:38.490
<v Speaker 1>this is my friend Tom Atencio,</v>

4489
01:52:38.491 --> 01:52:39.121
<v Speaker 1>the guy who,</v>

4490
01:52:39.121 --> 01:52:39.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4491
01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.370
<v Speaker 1>was one of the original creators of affliction.</v>

4492
01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.950
<v Speaker 1>He left affliction and he doesn't work for affliction anymore.</v>

4493
01:52:43.951 --> 01:52:44.784
<v Speaker 1>So I stopped.</v>

4494
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I stopped wearing their shit cause he's my friend sweet logo though I liked now.</v>

4495
01:52:49.231 --> 01:52:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4496
01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:53.600
<v Speaker 1>he created the limelight fusion energy drinks.</v>

4497
01:52:53.601 --> 01:52:54.980
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty fucking delicious.</v>

4498
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:56.280
<v Speaker 1>They're healthy too.</v>

4499
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4500
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4501
01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:57.861
<v Speaker 1>just started dragging him.</v>

4502
01:52:57.861 --> 01:52:58.600
<v Speaker 1>He just sent me a box.</v>

4503
01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Well but there's a Ginkgo Biloba and him and Jen sang and 200 for 50% of a,</v>

4504
01:53:05.451 --> 01:53:06.201
<v Speaker 1>the vitamin B,</v>

4505
01:53:06.201 --> 01:53:11.201
<v Speaker 1>six a hundred percent of the Niacin and 800% of your vitamin B 12 for the day.</v>

4506
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:13.183
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

4507
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:14.510
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of good stuff in it.</v>

4508
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:16.710
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good to mix that with some vodka.</v>

4509
01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:17.041
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

4510
01:53:17.041 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 1>if I drink this rocket fuel right now,</v>

4511
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:19.820
<v Speaker 1>am I going to be up until 8:00 AM?</v>

4512
01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:20.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4513
01:53:20.141 --> 01:53:20.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4514
01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:20.961
<v Speaker 1>it's not that bad.</v>

4515
01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a red bull.</v>

4516
01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:22.551
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

4517
01:53:22.551 --> 01:53:23.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not by,</v>

4518
01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.321
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>

4519
01:53:24.321 --> 01:53:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I should state that I have a high tolerance to caffeine.</v>

4520
01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.200
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

4521
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4522
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I quit caffeine for a day.</v>

4523
01:53:29.271 --> 01:53:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I took yesterday off and I had a headache,</v>

4524
01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:34.010
<v Speaker 1>my first cup of coffee of the day.</v>

4525
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.791
<v Speaker 1>This is my first cup.</v>

4526
01:53:34.791 --> 01:53:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'm okay today,</v>

4527
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's usually how it is for me.</v>

4528
01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I've done this before where I've,</v>

4529
01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.100
<v Speaker 1>especially when I'm writing a lot,</v>

4530
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:40.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4531
01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I drank a lot of coffee and then the next day I have a headache.</v>

4532
01:53:43.881 --> 01:53:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I need a cup of coffee,</v>

4533
01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:48.350
<v Speaker 1>but if I take a full day and go through the full day and drink a lot of water</v>

4534
01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:49.071
<v Speaker 1>the next day,</v>

4535
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:49.904
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much gone.</v>

4536
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like one day that's pretty good at,</v>

4537
01:53:51.111 --> 01:53:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you can cycle back down there.</v>

4538
01:53:52.341 --> 01:53:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4539
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:54.200
<v Speaker 1>That's my only addiction.</v>

4540
01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I have a physical addiction to caffeine,</v>

4541
01:53:56.210 --> 01:54:00.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a physical addiction where it's painful or it's like a terrible</v>

4542
01:54:00.471 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 1>itch.</v>

4557
01:54:21.381 --> 01:54:21.740
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

4558
01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do that,</v>

4559
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:25.700
<v Speaker 1>hung over before and it's just shattered my body for like three or four weeks</v>

4560
01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:26.534
<v Speaker 1>and you work out.</v>

4561
01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.261
<v Speaker 1>I've been like,</v>

4562
01:54:27.261 --> 01:54:27.321
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4563
01:54:27.321 --> 01:54:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little hung over.</v>

4564
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot hung over.</v>

4565
01:54:29.211 --> 01:54:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the gym and sweat it out,</v>

4566
01:54:30.501 --> 01:54:31.430
<v Speaker 1>get those toxins out.</v>

4567
01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:34.700

4568
01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:34.971
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

4569
01:54:34.971 --> 01:54:35.630
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

4570
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Best Formula I've ever found for hangovers is this fucking alpha brain shit and</v>

4577
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:46.783
<v Speaker 1>not so tasty.</v>

4578
01:54:48.850 --> 01:54:49.681

<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

4581
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:58.010
<v Speaker 1>He tells the best and they send it to us.</v>

4582
01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.470
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying take one of the placebos are those,</v>

4583
01:55:00.471 --> 01:55:01.260
<v Speaker 1>this is the shelf.</v>

01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Two O's.</v>

4586
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Fucking delicious.</v>

4587
01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And I know a lot of people say,</v>

4588
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.581
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4589
01:55:05.581 --> 01:55:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I tried coconut cheers like dirty dishwater.</v>

4590
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:09.171
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>

4591
01:55:09.171 --> 01:55:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Some brands actually do this blank brand.</v>

4592
01:55:11.811 --> 01:55:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking delicious.</v>

4593
01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I got hooked in this brand,</v>

4594
01:55:14.701 --> 01:55:16.790
<v Speaker 1>and we were at Jujitsu and it's one of our buddies,</v>

4595
01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:17.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4596
01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.230
<v Speaker 1>brought a whole case of it.</v>

4597
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And apparently in Brazil they drink a lot of coconut water.</v>

4598
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:21.500
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4599
01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.000
<v Speaker 1>we were having a,</v>

4600
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.060
<v Speaker 1>a g day,</v>

4601
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.810
<v Speaker 1>10 plans,</v>

4602
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:24.171
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

4603
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:27.410
<v Speaker 1>We rolled out a g the G is like the traditional uniform of Jujitsu,</v>

4604
01:55:27.411 --> 01:55:28.640
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

4605
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:30.470
<v Speaker 1>the idea that Eddie had was that,</v>

4606
01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4607
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:31.341
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

4608
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:33.890
<v Speaker 1>in no d competitions,</v>

4609
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:35.870
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the techniques of Jiujitsu Jujitsu don't work.</v>

4610
01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And in mixed martial arts,</v>

4611
01:55:37.071 --> 01:55:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you obviously don't have a g so you should learn,</v>

4612
01:55:39.230 --> 01:55:42.750
<v Speaker 1>there's like with the gift of grabbed people easier and it's more traction,</v>

4613
01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to hold on to people.</v>

4614
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:46.170
<v Speaker 5>So it's hard to get them to grab you,</v>

4615
01:55:46.171 --> 01:55:47.160
<v Speaker 5>which is exactly right.</v>

4616
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:48.690
<v Speaker 5>That's the hoists Gracie strategy.</v>

4617
01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:51.090
<v Speaker 5>He would fight with a g on and Strykers would grab him.</v>

4618
01:55:51.091 --> 01:55:51.924
<v Speaker 5>They couldn't help it.</v>

4619
01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:53.011
<v Speaker 5>So anyway,</v>

4620
01:55:53.011 --> 01:55:54.150
<v Speaker 5>they drank a lot of coconut juice.</v>

4621
01:55:54.151 --> 01:55:56.850
<v Speaker 5>So we had a good day and he brought a bunch of coconut juice to like,</v>

4622
01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:57.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4623
01:55:57.361 --> 01:56:00.690
<v Speaker 5>like out of respect for resilience because they love to drink coconut juice and</v>

4624
01:56:00.691 --> 01:56:00.841
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

4625
01:56:00.841 --> 01:56:01.441
<v Speaker 5>you want to try one?</v>

4626
01:56:01.441 --> 01:56:02.040
<v Speaker 5>And then like,</v>

4627
01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4628
01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.211
<v Speaker 5>just be nice.</v>

4629
01:56:03.211 --> 01:56:03.451
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4630
01:56:03.451 --> 01:56:03.721
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4631
01:56:03.721 --> 01:56:04.800
<v Speaker 5>coconut juice tastes like shit.</v>

4632
01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:05.370
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4633
01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:06.151
<v Speaker 5>But I drank this stuff.</v>

4634
01:56:06.151 --> 01:56:06.391
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4635
01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:06.841
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

4636
01:56:06.841 --> 01:56:07.860
<v Speaker 5>this is delicious.</v>

4637
01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like the perfect flavor.</v>

4638
01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.280
<v Speaker 5>Does it have like the coconut pulp in it?</v>

4639
01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Cause I had one like that and like that.</v>

4640
01:56:13.911 --> 01:56:14.310
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

4641
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:15.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm on on a ride with that.</v>

4642
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:16.130
<v Speaker 5>They have the coconut.</v>

4643
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:16.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4644
01:56:16.291 --> 01:56:18.300
<v Speaker 5>This one is so much better than this one.</v>

4645
01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:18.731

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.260
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

4677
01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:56.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to stop smoking marijuana?</v>

4678
01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:58.830
<v Speaker 5>Because you can't have a gun anymore.</v>

4679
01:56:59.070 --> 01:57:00.360
<v Speaker 5>You can't have a gun or bullets.</v>

4680
01:57:00.361 --> 01:57:03.390
<v Speaker 5>The federal government is saying that you cannot have a gun or bullets because</v>

4681
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:03.980

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4683
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:07.320
<v Speaker 5>federal law dictates that marijuana is a schedule one substance.</v>

4684
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:09.390
<v Speaker 5>And so when you apply to the alcohol,</v>

4685
01:57:09.391 --> 01:57:09.871
<v Speaker 5>tobacco,</v>

4731
01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:03.451

4732
01:58:03.451 --> 01:58:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I sound like it did to the people you were firing up.</v>

4733
01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.630
<v Speaker 5>This is what I'm saying.</v>

4734
01:58:06.631 --> 01:58:07.464
<v Speaker 5>God dammit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You should be able to have fucking guns and joy.</v>

4736
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:11.580
<v Speaker 5>Little Weed and who do I want with a gun?</v>

4739
01:58:17.701 --> 01:58:19.380
<v Speaker 5>paranoid is not going to shoot anybody,</v>

4740
01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:20.281
<v Speaker 5>but that's the guy,</v>

4741
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 5>not paranoid part.</v>

4742
01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.073
<v Speaker 5>Leave out the paranoia.</v>

4743
01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:23.640
<v Speaker 5>Paranoid people are going to hide.</v>

4744
01:58:23.641 --> 01:58:25.920
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to go shooting people that you're not going to rush into</v>

4745
01:58:25.921 --> 01:58:26.670
<v Speaker 5>violence.</v>

4746
01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:27.421
<v Speaker 5>If you're paranoid,</v>

4747
01:58:27.421 --> 01:58:27.601
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

4748
01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:28.500
<v Speaker 5>let me get the fuck out of here.</v>

4749
01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:28.711
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

4750
01:58:28.711 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 5>what the shoe bag.</v>

4751
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.511
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4752
01:58:30.511 --> 01:58:30.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4753
01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:34.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that marijuana inhibits your judgment to the point where having a</v>

4754
01:58:34.861 --> 01:58:35.540
<v Speaker 5>gun,</v>

4755
01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.373
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4756
01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:39.150
<v Speaker 5>it makes it prohibitive or it makes it a dangerous,</v>

4757
01:58:39.151 --> 01:58:40.680
<v Speaker 5>I think if anything,</v>

4758
01:58:40.681 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 5>it's going to make you a scaredy cat.</v>

4759
01:58:41.891 --> 01:58:42.940
<v Speaker 5>It's going to make you nervous.</v>

4760
01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 5>It's going to make you,</v>

4761
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna make you more sensitive to the possibilities of,</v>

4762
01:58:47.670 --> 01:58:47.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4763
01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.900
<v Speaker 5>hurting somebody or hurting yourself.</v>

4764
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4765
01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:50.831
<v Speaker 5>But they don't want to,</v>

4766
01:58:50.831 --> 01:58:53.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you to do as a bad trip and you know,</v>

4767
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:56.670
<v Speaker 5>thanks to see and shit off of an edible and start shooting somebody that's going</v>

4768
01:58:56.671 --> 01:58:56.870
<v Speaker 5>to hurt.</v>

4769
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:59.260
<v Speaker 5>That's bad science because what about the million people that don't pull their</v>

4770
01:58:59.261 --> 01:59:00.490
<v Speaker 5>guns out because they are high.</v>

4771
01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:00.801
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4772
01:59:00.801 --> 01:59:01.190
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4773
01:59:01.190 --> 01:59:01.841
<v Speaker 5>and then just say,</v>

4774
01:59:01.841 --> 01:59:02.800
<v Speaker 5>let's just let this go.</v>

4775
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.660
<v Speaker 5>Any number of can be manipulated.</v>

4776
01:59:04.661 --> 01:59:04.811
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4777
01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:05.050
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4778
01:59:05.050 --> 01:59:08.220
<v Speaker 5>it's clearly no worse than being able to like drink at a bar and had a shotgun</v>

4779
01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:10.540
<v Speaker 5>rack on your truck or when you're driving home.</v>

4780
01:59:10.541 --> 01:59:12.310
<v Speaker 5>No show different than places that allow that.</v>

4781
01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:13.390
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking crazy.</v>

4782
01:59:13.391 --> 01:59:14.200
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy.</v>

4783
01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.730
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking UNAMERICAN man.</v>

4784
01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:16.031
<v Speaker 5>It's on,</v>

4785
01:59:16.031 --> 01:59:20.470
<v Speaker 5>it's on American to step in and say that if you want to have something that the</v>

4786
01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:24.730
<v Speaker 5>states have voted on and it you have a god damned white and their states' rights</v>

4787
01:59:24.731 --> 01:59:26.320
<v Speaker 5>are supposed to supersede federal rights,</v>

4788
01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:29.980
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to be able to decide what you can and can't use and the state</v>

4789
01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:30.731
<v Speaker 5>comes along and says,</v>

4790
01:59:30.731 --> 01:59:31.031
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

4791
01:59:31.031 --> 01:59:32.560
<v Speaker 5>We've looked at all the information and guess what?</v>

4792
01:59:32.710 --> 01:59:33.940
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people with Glaucoma Comas,</v>

4793
01:59:33.941 --> 01:59:34.860
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people with cancers,</v>

4794
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:36.910
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people that anxiety is a lot of people with all sorts of different</v>

4795
01:59:36.911 --> 01:59:37.660
<v Speaker 5>fucking elements.</v>

4796
01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.940
<v Speaker 5>Marijuana has a lot of people who know why it's illegal.</v>

4797
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:41.620
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fucked up and want to get high.</v>

4798
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't need glaucoma.</v>

4799
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:43.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to smoke weed.</v>

4800
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.550
<v Speaker 5>The bottom line about marijuana,</v>

4801
01:59:45.551 --> 01:59:46.361
<v Speaker 5>this is the bottom line.</v>

4802
01:59:46.361 --> 01:59:47.260
<v Speaker 5>This is one way to look at,</v>

4803
01:59:47.261 --> 01:59:48.790
<v Speaker 5>and my friend Todd Mccormick brought this up.</v>

4804
01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:50.110
<v Speaker 5>He said it's a commodity.</v>

4805
01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:54.400
<v Speaker 5>It's no different than corn or apples or pork bellies,</v>

4806
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:56.290
<v Speaker 5>and it should be considered as a commodity,</v>

4807
01:59:56.291 --> 01:59:58.150
<v Speaker 5>and if it is considered as a commodity,</v>

4808
01:59:58.151 --> 01:59:58.941
<v Speaker 5>then you have to look well,</v>

4809
01:59:58.941 --> 02:00:02.080
<v Speaker 5>why is this commodity being kept from the marketplace?</v>

4810
02:00:02.081 --> 02:00:03.130
<v Speaker 5>Who's benefiting?</v>

4811
02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:03.330
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4812
02:00:03.330 --> 02:00:04.690
<v Speaker 5>And follow the fucking money.</v>

4813
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:06.370
<v Speaker 5>Follow the money trail because guess what?</v>

4814
02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:06.760
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

4815
02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:09.820
<v Speaker 5>There's not a goddamn thing in the world that's useless.</v>

4816
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:10.990
<v Speaker 5>That makes no money,</v>

4817
02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:13.570
<v Speaker 5>that people are beating down the doors trying to make illegal.</v>

4818
02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:15.070
<v Speaker 5>There's not a single one.</v>

4819
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:16.870
<v Speaker 5>There's not a single one that you,</v>

4820
02:00:16.871 --> 02:00:20.080
<v Speaker 5>it has to be worth something to somebody to keep that shit illegal.</v>

4821
02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:21.310
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way they spend money.</v>

4822
02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:22.171
<v Speaker 5>When you that,</v>

4823
02:00:22.171 --> 02:00:22.291
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4824
02:00:22.291 --> 02:00:25.720
<v Speaker 5>it was an industrial complex cops who enforced this shit that don't want to lose</v>

4825
02:00:25.721 --> 02:00:26.140
<v Speaker 5>their job,</v>

4826
02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:27.910
<v Speaker 5>even though many of them now are forwarding.</v>

4827
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:30.700
<v Speaker 5>Most cops are in this day and age.</v>

4828
02:00:30.701 --> 02:00:34.960
<v Speaker 5>When you get a fucking person on television who represents the United States</v>

4829
02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:35.500
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>

4830
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:39.790
<v Speaker 5>and they start talking about going after real estate owners for renting out</v>

4831
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:41.640
<v Speaker 5>property to these cannabis shops,</v>

4832
02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 5>they're going to steal their fucking property.</v>

4833
02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:47.110
<v Speaker 5>The government's going to come in from hardworking Americans who put the fucking</v>

4834
02:00:47.111 --> 02:00:48.220
<v Speaker 5>businesses for rent.</v>

4835
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.821
<v Speaker 5>They have this,</v>

4836
02:00:48.821 --> 02:00:50.050
<v Speaker 5>they buy a place.</v>

4837
02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:50.440
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>

4838
02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:51.550
<v Speaker 5>well now I'll rent this place out.</v>

4839
02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:52.900
<v Speaker 5>I'll make myself a nice little product.</v>

4840
02:00:52.901 --> 02:00:53.580
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

4841
02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:54.413
<v Speaker 5>what do you do?</v>

4842
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:57.970
<v Speaker 5>You sell medical marijuana legally under state guidelines.</v>

4843
02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:58.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4844
02:00:58.630 --> 02:01:02.350
<v Speaker 5>well there is proposition to 15 it was passed in 1994 that's been a long time.</v>

4845
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:03.220
<v Speaker 5>It's been legal in the state,</v>

4846
02:01:03.221 --> 02:01:05.800
<v Speaker 5>so go ahead and do your business and the federal government comes in and says,</v>

4847
02:01:05.801 --> 02:01:05.891
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4848
02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:09.100
<v Speaker 5>we're going to steal your fucking house because you rented out to someone who</v>

4849
02:01:09.101 --> 02:01:09.850
<v Speaker 5>sells pot.</v>

4850
02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:10.990
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

4851
02:01:11.150 --> 02:01:12.370
<v Speaker 5>It's in and people will say,</v>

4852
02:01:12.371 --> 02:01:12.821
<v Speaker 5>why do you,</v>

4853
02:01:12.821 --> 02:01:14.170
<v Speaker 5>why do you tweak out about this stuff?</v>

4854
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:15.250
<v Speaker 5>Why do you let it bother you?</v>

4855
02:01:15.251 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

4856
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:17.470
<v Speaker 5>Because it is the ultimate fuck.</v>

4857
02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:19.450
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate ridiculous thing.</v>

4858
02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 5>You have a plant that's literally one of the most beneficial plants on earth,</v>

4859
02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:27.460
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not even talking about the psychoactive portions of it.</v>

4860
02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:28.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about the use of it.</v>

4861
02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:29.351
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

4862
02:01:29.351 --> 02:01:31.330
<v Speaker 5>it contains all the amino acids you can eat it.</v>

4863
02:01:31.331 --> 02:01:32.530
<v Speaker 5>It's got high in protein.</v>

4864
02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:34.690
<v Speaker 5>Hemp protein is like some of the best protein you can get.</v>

4865
02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:35.740
<v Speaker 5>You can make oil.</v>

4866
02:01:35.741 --> 02:01:36.550
<v Speaker 5>None of this shit.</v>

4867
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:38.860
<v Speaker 5>You can make fucking bio diesel out of this shit.</v>

4868
02:01:38.970 --> 02:01:41.000
<v Speaker 5>You make superior paper out of this shit.</v>

4869
02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:42.410
<v Speaker 5>You make clothes out of this shit.</v>

4870
02:01:42.411 --> 02:01:43.970
<v Speaker 5>It's way stronger than cotton.</v>

4871
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.410
<v Speaker 5>It sounds fake.</v>

4872
02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:47.850
<v Speaker 5>When you start listing all the different cool shit that you can make with it,</v>

4873
02:01:47.851 --> 02:01:49.250
<v Speaker 5>it literally sounds like you're lying.</v>

4874
02:01:49.251 --> 02:01:50.290
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like you bullshit way.</v>

4875
02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:53.090
<v Speaker 5>This has completely better properties than anything else on the market.</v>

4876
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:54.170
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely,</v>

4877
02:01:54.170 --> 02:01:54.591
<v Speaker 5>but wait,</v>

4878
02:01:54.591 --> 02:01:56.710
<v Speaker 5>it grows in any weather condition for the most part.</v>

4879
02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:59.540
<v Speaker 5>I think about all the trees they get chopped down to make paper,</v>

4880
02:01:59.630 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 5>how much fucking paper we use every day.</v>

4881
02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:06.350
<v Speaker 5>You can make four times as much paper in the same acreage of marijuana and it</v>

4882
02:02:06.351 --> 02:02:08.150
<v Speaker 5>grows back in six months.</v>

4883
02:02:08.190 --> 02:02:09.170
<v Speaker 5>Who's pack right there?</v>

4884
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:09.950
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4885
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:12.950
<v Speaker 5>instead of 20 fucking years or whatever the hell it takes to grow back your</v>

4886
02:02:12.951 --> 02:02:13.820
<v Speaker 5>paper for trees.</v>

4887
02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:14.320
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4888
02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.380
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

4889
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:15.651
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

4890
02:02:15.651 --> 02:02:19.520
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the prime fucks and it's one of the things that has to be addressed</v>

4891
02:02:19.670 --> 02:02:19.940
<v Speaker 5>in this.</v>

4892
02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:20.960
<v Speaker 5>Even if you disagree,</v>

4893
02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:21.291
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

4894
02:02:21.291 --> 02:02:22.840
<v Speaker 5>but even if you disagree with,</v>

4895
02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:26.330
<v Speaker 5>with what it can do or why it can do it or the propaganda out there and even if</v>

4896
02:02:26.331 --> 02:02:27.590
<v Speaker 5>you feel reefer madness and drugs,</v>

4897
02:02:27.591 --> 02:02:27.741
<v Speaker 5>drugs,</v>

4898
02:02:27.741 --> 02:02:28.160
<v Speaker 5>drugs,</v>

4899
02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:28.440
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4900
02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:28.691
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4901
02:02:28.691 --> 02:02:30.830
<v Speaker 5>the sheer violation of rights.</v>

4902
02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:32.960
<v Speaker 5>Federal Government comes in and as you said,</v>

4903
02:02:32.961 --> 02:02:36.350
<v Speaker 5>boots you out of your fucking business that you put your neck on the line for</v>

4904
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:38.750
<v Speaker 5>and try to do legally according to state law,</v>

4905
02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:41.930
<v Speaker 5>that should have everybody in rage regardless of what the subject is.</v>

4906
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:43.251
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

4907
02:02:43.251 --> 02:02:47.120
<v Speaker 5>how about prioritizing our fucking problems when we're living in a day and age</v>

4908
02:02:47.121 --> 02:02:49.220
<v Speaker 5>where there's rampant crime all over the place,</v>

4909
02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:52.550
<v Speaker 5>people are getting carjacked and shot and you look at the fucking murder rate in</v>

4910
02:02:52.551 --> 02:02:53.360
<v Speaker 5>Los Angeles,</v>

4911
02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:58.360
<v Speaker 5>20 million fucking people stuffed into one small area and traffic and nonsense</v>

4912
02:02:58.371 --> 02:03:00.080
<v Speaker 5>and car theft and home invasions.</v>

4913
02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.640
<v Speaker 5>You look in all that and you're telling me that you need civil servants to go</v>

4914
02:03:04.641 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 5>after a plant and it makes people silly.</v>

4915
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:12.260
<v Speaker 5>You're going to waste a fucking tax dollars are western people for selling silly</v>

4916
02:03:12.261 --> 02:03:12.890
<v Speaker 5>plants,</v>

4917
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:14.520
<v Speaker 5>for selling plants and make food taste better.</v>

4918
02:03:14.521 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 5>It makes sex taste better.</v>

4919
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Make movies more awesome.</v>

4920
02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:17.871
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

4921
02:03:17.871 --> 02:03:18.900
<v Speaker 5>you fuck heads.</v>

4922
02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:19.481
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4923
02:03:19.481 --> 02:03:20.930
<v Speaker 5>it's the ultimate fuck you.</v>

4924
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate power move.</v>

4925
02:03:22.491 --> 02:03:23.324
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate.</v>

4926
02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:25.910
<v Speaker 5>This is not a free country move.</v>

4927
02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:26.901
<v Speaker 5>It really is.</v>

4928
02:03:26.901 --> 02:03:28.550
<v Speaker 5>And yet it's happening and it's happening.</v>

4929
02:03:28.551 --> 02:03:29.450
<v Speaker 5>So now what?</v>

4930
02:03:29.690 --> 02:03:29.931
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4931
02:03:29.931 --> 02:03:31.850
<v Speaker 5>now what does occupy Wall Street is now what?</v>

4932
02:03:31.851 --> 02:03:32.031
<v Speaker 5>Now?</v>

4933
02:03:32.031 --> 02:03:35.220
<v Speaker 5>What is the bubble has burst when occupies oiling.</v>

4934
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:37.400
<v Speaker 5>So when occupy starts having signs that say,</v>

4935
02:03:37.401 --> 02:03:38.480
<v Speaker 5>give us back our weed,</v>

4936
02:03:38.630 --> 02:03:41.240
<v Speaker 5>then they're going to try to roll on the movement and say that it's just another</v>

4937
02:03:41.241 --> 02:03:42.074
<v Speaker 5>hippie movement.</v>

4938
02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:42.980
<v Speaker 5>All of these kids want,</v>

4939
02:03:42.981 --> 02:03:44.000
<v Speaker 5>or their fucking drugs,</v>

4940
02:03:44.001 --> 02:03:45.170
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to be able to do that.</v>

4941
02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.490
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a mandate for that.</v>

4942
02:03:46.491 --> 02:03:47.510
<v Speaker 5>I think it's too late for that.</v>

4943
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 5>I think it's already gotten too big.</v>

4944
02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:48.921
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4945
02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:49.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4946
02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:49.701
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it had,</v>

4947
02:03:49.701 --> 02:03:52.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's gotten big enough with the people who need to believe it's</v>

4948
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:52.580
<v Speaker 5>for them.</v>

4949
02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:52.701
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4950
02:03:52.701 --> 02:03:53.690
<v Speaker 5>it's going to get bigger.</v>

4951
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:54.171
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4952
02:03:54.171 --> 02:03:56.360
<v Speaker 5>But it's going to be get beer because they're going to put their ad dollars</v>

4953
02:03:56.361 --> 02:03:59.570
<v Speaker 5>behind portraying the movement as a pro weed.</v>

4954
02:03:59.571 --> 02:04:00.780
<v Speaker 5>This is what they care about movement.</v>

4955
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:03.170
<v Speaker 5>Excellent marginalized feel at this point in time.</v>

4956
02:04:03.171 --> 02:04:06.200
<v Speaker 5>This 50% of Americans in the most recent Gallup poll said that they want</v>

4957
02:04:06.201 --> 02:04:07.034
<v Speaker 5>marijuana illegal.</v>

4958
02:04:07.190 --> 02:04:08.420
<v Speaker 5>That's higher than it's ever been before.</v>

4959
02:04:08.421 --> 02:04:09.950
<v Speaker 5>It's the first time ever that it's past.</v>

4960
02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:13.520
<v Speaker 5>The people that want it illegal for [inaudible] still be half the country</v>

4961
02:04:13.521 --> 02:04:14.000
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

4962
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:14.571
<v Speaker 5>That is like,</v>

4963
02:04:14.571 --> 02:04:14.991
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

4964
02:04:14.991 --> 02:04:15.950
<v Speaker 5>That shit needs to be illegal.</v>

4965
02:04:15.951 --> 02:04:16.491
<v Speaker 5>That's what you hit.</v>

4966
02:04:16.491 --> 02:04:17.001
<v Speaker 5>These are about,</v>

4967
02:04:17.001 --> 02:04:18.950
<v Speaker 5>forget it and it divides us up into teams again.</v>

4968
02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4969
02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:20.661
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

4970
02:04:20.661 --> 02:04:21.141
<v Speaker 5>I don't Cook it.</v>

4971
02:04:21.141 --> 02:04:25.640
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be the the boiling point or rather just like they don't have a</v>

4972
02:04:25.641 --> 02:04:25.911
<v Speaker 5>leader.</v>

4973
02:04:25.911 --> 02:04:26.930
<v Speaker 5>There's not going to be one thing.</v>

4974
02:04:26.931 --> 02:04:28.670
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna attack this thing for every fucking,</v>

4975
02:04:28.671 --> 02:04:30.740
<v Speaker 5>what I'm saying is I don't think it's a good point.</v>

4976
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:33.850
<v Speaker 5>The marijuana point is not a good point because most people think it should be</v>

4977
02:04:33.851 --> 02:04:37.740
<v Speaker 5>legal and how get good people arguing half of the people who it should be</v>

4978
02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:38.430
<v Speaker 5>illegal,</v>

4979
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:41.550
<v Speaker 2>so you just lose half of the country right there by making this about that one</v>

4980
02:04:41.551 --> 02:04:42.360
<v Speaker 2>moral issue.</v>

4981
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Then you pick out another issue and then you pick out another issue.</v>

4982
02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:45.540
<v Speaker 2>That's another issue.</v>

4983
02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4984
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.861
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

4985
02:04:46.861 --> 02:04:47.970
<v Speaker 2>It marginalizes the whole thing.</v>

4986
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:48.631
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point,</v>

4987
02:04:48.631 --> 02:04:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's enough people that do believe at this point that other</v>

4988
02:04:52.981 --> 02:04:55.860
<v Speaker 2>people are going to have to start listening because there's enough people like</v>

4989
02:04:55.861 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Ron Paul and Gary Johnson,</v>

4990
02:04:57.451 --> 02:05:00.570
<v Speaker 2>intelligent Republicans that are really pragmatic,</v>

4991
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:04.390
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful people that can tell you why it should be legal.</v>

4992
02:05:04.391 --> 02:05:05.250
<v Speaker 2>What does he stand?</v>

4993
02:05:05.251 --> 02:05:07.890
<v Speaker 2>A snowball's chance in hell of being elected on affecting any change?</v>

4994
02:05:07.891 --> 02:05:08.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4995
02:05:08.161 --> 02:05:08.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4996
02:05:08.401 --> 02:05:08.610
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4997
02:05:08.610 --> 02:05:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Well affecting change for sure.</v>

4998
02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:10.681
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4999
02:05:10.681 --> 02:05:15.681
<v Speaker 2>Ron Paul is probably doing more impact socially on any other candidate besides</v>

5000
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:16.860
<v Speaker 2>the people that win.</v>

5001
02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely agree that he got a partial audit of the Fed,</v>

5002
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.810
<v Speaker 2>but can you believe that they put in about what they found out,</v>

5003
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:26.520
<v Speaker 2>trillions of dollars that were not accounted for more than our debt over the</v>

5004
02:05:26.521 --> 02:05:27.810
<v Speaker 2>history of this country.</v>

5005
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:30.240
<v Speaker 2>They lend out without any debates,</v>

5006
02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.680
<v Speaker 2>without any notification.</v>

5007
02:05:31.681 --> 02:05:36.420
<v Speaker 2>They lend out more money than the history of the debt of our country to bankers</v>

5008
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:37.254
<v Speaker 2>to bail them out.</v>

5009
02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:38.520
<v Speaker 2>They gave us one amount and it said,</v>

5010
02:05:38.521 --> 02:05:38.671
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5011
02:05:38.671 --> 02:05:39.001
<v Speaker 2>here you go.</v>

5012
02:05:39.001 --> 02:05:39.331
<v Speaker 2>Here you go.</v>

5013
02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Bank bail out the countries worldwide.</v>

5014
02:05:41.521 --> 02:05:41.851
<v Speaker 2>Just go.</v>

5015
02:05:41.851 --> 02:05:42.684
<v Speaker 2>Just go.</v>

5016
02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't know substantial audit.</v>

5017
02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Partial order.</v>

5018
02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't even understand.</v>

5019
02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:49.620
<v Speaker 2>When you hear about the Federal Reserve System,</v>

5020
02:05:49.621 --> 02:05:50.454
<v Speaker 2>not federal,</v>

5021
02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:53.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a private company and the line is,</v>

5022
02:05:53.901 --> 02:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>it says federal is Federal Express.</v>

5023
02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:57.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a private company run for profit.</v>

5024
02:05:57.930 --> 02:06:02.340
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to win some money that our money is all being,</v>

5025
02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.710
<v Speaker 2>it's privately handled by foreign banks.</v>

5026
02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5027
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is a,</v>

5028
02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:08.970
<v Speaker 2>that what a mind fuck that is.</v>

5029
02:06:08.971 --> 02:06:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Every dollar that you were here pass off to earn has already tacked onto it to</v>

5030
02:06:13.951 --> 02:06:15.270
<v Speaker 2>somebody and you don't even know it.</v>

5031
02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:20.100
<v Speaker 2>And how is that possible that they can call it the federal bank when,</v>

5032
02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean what,</v>

5033
02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:21.180
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

5034
02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:22.020
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

5035
02:06:22.170 --> 02:06:25.650
<v Speaker 2>That's like calling a company that breaks into your house movers.</v>

5036
02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:26.311
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5037
02:06:26.311 --> 02:06:26.851
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5038
02:06:26.851 --> 02:06:28.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like how are you calling it that?</v>

5039
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:29.280
<v Speaker 2>How is that legal,</v>

5040
02:06:29.630 --> 02:06:29.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5041
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:32.490
<v Speaker 2>how is it legal to call that the federal bank,</v>

5042
02:06:32.491 --> 02:06:33.540
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Reserve?</v>

5043
02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:34.383
<v Speaker 2>Because I think they were,</v>

5044
02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:36.010
<v Speaker 2>they were reserved for the Fed.</v>

5045
02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:37.440
<v Speaker 2>They were the reserve for the federation.</v>

5046
02:06:37.441 --> 02:06:37.681
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5047
02:06:37.681 --> 02:06:37.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5048
02:06:37.861 --> 02:06:38.491
<v Speaker 2>that was what they were.</v>

5049
02:06:38.491 --> 02:06:38.761
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

5050
02:06:38.761 --> 02:06:38.941
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5051
02:06:38.941 --> 02:06:39.480
<v Speaker 2>when this,</v>

5052
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 2>when this country is in dire straits or there's a market spike or the next</v>

5053
02:06:43.801 --> 02:06:44.670
<v Speaker 2>depression is going to happen,</v>

5054
02:06:44.671 --> 02:06:46.620
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be there to make it all right by printing money,</v>

5055
02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.720
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be the bank that lends money to the country.</v>

5056
02:06:48.810 --> 02:06:52.860
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing is when someone's running for con for a president and they meet</v>

5057
02:06:52.890 --> 02:06:55.410
<v Speaker 2>with the Bolt Bilderberg group this out in the open,</v>

5058
02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:58.710
<v Speaker 2>they just go and meet with them and you know they have these fucking meetings</v>

5059
02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:00.510
<v Speaker 2>and it's all I want to chat with you for a few minutes.</v>

5060
02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:01.310
<v Speaker 2>People that road bill,</v>

5061
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton running for president and met with the bill,</v>

5062
02:07:03.331 --> 02:07:04.770
<v Speaker 2>but the vote on that guy,</v>

5063
02:07:05.590 --> 02:07:07.230
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile they'd probably all meet with them.</v>

5064
02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:09.690
<v Speaker 2>You know that clearly figuring out who's the best puppet.</v>

5065
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Clearly.</v>

5066
02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Has that ever been so frustrating with Obama right now because the,</v>

5067
02:07:14.530 --> 02:07:16.140
<v Speaker 2>and I hope going to ask you that,</v>

5068
02:07:16.141 --> 02:07:17.370
<v Speaker 2>is it ever been more evident,</v>

5069
02:07:17.970 --> 02:07:19.530
<v Speaker 2>so clear and I was duped.</v>

5070
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking duped.</v>

5071
02:07:20.701 --> 02:07:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I was sold on the hope and change.</v>

5072
02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:24.390
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I was duped was not because,</v>

5073
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:25.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5074
02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:25.831
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

5075
02:07:25.831 --> 02:07:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to believe in,</v>

5076
02:07:26.781 --> 02:07:27.690
<v Speaker 2>in the posters,</v>

5077
02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:30.960
<v Speaker 2>but because I looked at where the money came from and it came from guys like me,</v>

5078
02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it came from you or you,</v>

5079
02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:33.960
<v Speaker 2>but it came from individuals.</v>

5080
02:07:33.961 --> 02:07:35.940
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't so much wonder if it did.</v>

5081
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.090
<v Speaker 4>There was some there.</v>

5082
02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:38.050
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it even did,</v>

5083
02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:38.291
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5084
02:07:38.291 --> 02:07:40.390
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is the auditing where the money comes from and who's,</v>

5085
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:43.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of sites that look at donations and what like and whatnot,</v>

5086
02:07:43.210 --> 02:07:44.990
<v Speaker 4>but that's never happened to me down now.</v>

5087
02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:45.221
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5088
02:07:45.221 --> 02:07:47.260
<v Speaker 4>there's always back channels and so for all I know,</v>

5089
02:07:47.261 --> 02:07:47.501
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

5090
02:07:47.501 --> 02:07:49.000
<v Speaker 4>the corporations could have totally put them in there,</v>

5091
02:07:49.001 --> 02:07:51.990
<v Speaker 4>but I know that I donated and I know a lot of other people donated.</v>

5092
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:52.421
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

5093
02:07:52.421 --> 02:07:56.740
<v Speaker 4>the sentiment amongst guys like myself who feel like sheeps now and sentiment</v>

5094
02:07:56.741 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

5095
02:07:57.190 --> 02:07:57.371
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

5096
02:07:57.371 --> 02:07:58.570
<v Speaker 4>the people are putting in here.</v>

5097
02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:00.580
<v Speaker 4>So he's got the chance for the hope and change.</v>

5098
02:08:00.581 --> 02:08:02.170
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna fuck those banks over.</v>

5099
02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:03.520
<v Speaker 4>He's going to get us out of those wars.</v>

5100
02:08:03.521 --> 02:08:04.031
<v Speaker 4>Like he said,</v>

5101
02:08:04.031 --> 02:08:04.631
<v Speaker 4>he's going to do this,</v>

5102
02:08:04.631 --> 02:08:05.260
<v Speaker 4>that the other,</v>

5103
02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.160
<v Speaker 4>and I thought because,</v>

5104
02:08:06.161 --> 02:08:09.280
<v Speaker 4>well my money went to put that there and so did millions of others of Americans.</v>

5105
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.900
<v Speaker 4>He's going to fill beholding to us.</v>

5106
02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:12.010
<v Speaker 4>He just escalated.</v>

5107
02:08:12.011 --> 02:08:12.430
<v Speaker 4>Everything,</v>

5108
02:08:12.430 --> 02:08:12.971
<v Speaker 4>escalated,</v>

5109
02:08:12.971 --> 02:08:13.361
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

5110
02:08:13.361 --> 02:08:14.860
<v Speaker 4>continued the same policies,</v>

5111
02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:15.101
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5112
02:08:15.101 --> 02:08:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Or people are being spied on.</v>

5113
02:08:16.271 --> 02:08:19.510
<v Speaker 4>The never or more of a civil war rendition is happening.</v>

5114
02:08:19.511 --> 02:08:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Guantanamo is not fucking closed down.</v>

5115
02:08:21.450 --> 02:08:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Fill in wars number that we're going to close down Guantanamo Bay.</v>

5116
02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:24.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5117
02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:24.970
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5118
02:08:24.970 --> 02:08:25.250
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

5119
02:08:25.250 --> 02:08:26.081
<v Speaker 4>it's a logistics thing.</v>

5120
02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:27.040
<v Speaker 4>We've got an excel spreadsheet.</v>

5121
02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:28.660
<v Speaker 4>It's going to take us like a year to figure it out guys.</v>

5122
02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5123
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:29.741
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5124
02:08:29.741 --> 02:08:31.020
<v Speaker 4>you're not closing that motherfucker down.</v>

5125
02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.291
<v Speaker 4>You're clearly not.</v>

5126
02:08:32.291 --> 02:08:36.550
<v Speaker 4>And then taking the guys who are responsible for defrauding the nation,</v>

5127
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:37.960
<v Speaker 4>these guys from JP Morgan,</v>

5128
02:08:37.961 --> 02:08:38.630
<v Speaker 4>from Citibank,</v>

5129
02:08:38.630 --> 02:08:42.430
<v Speaker 4>from a Goldman Sachs or bank of America and putting them in positions of power</v>

5130
02:08:42.431 --> 02:08:44.350
<v Speaker 4>in positions where they can control the money.</v>

5131
02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 4>You put those guys in power,</v>

5132
02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:50.170
<v Speaker 4>the ones that literally fuck this country by selling faulty mortgages and</v>

5133
02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:52.060
<v Speaker 4>betting against their own customers.</v>

5134
02:08:52.150 --> 02:08:52.871
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

5135
02:08:52.871 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 4>She's like betting against them,</v>

5136
02:08:53.891 --> 02:08:55.420
<v Speaker 4>selling you shit in a box,</v>

5137
02:08:55.421 --> 02:08:56.770
<v Speaker 4>putting a triple a rating on it and saying,</v>

5138
02:08:56.771 --> 02:08:57.011
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

5139
02:08:57.011 --> 02:08:57.821
<v Speaker 4>this is so secure.</v>

5140
02:08:57.821 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 4>You're going to love this shit.</v>

5141
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.261
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

5142
02:08:59.261 --> 02:09:00.670
<v Speaker 4>we bet against it and now it's going to fail.</v>

5143
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:02.740
<v Speaker 4>You're going to give me the money to bail me out.</v>

5144
02:09:02.741 --> 02:09:05.050
<v Speaker 4>He put those mother fuckers in his,</v>

5145
02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:05.800
<v Speaker 4>in his cabinet.</v>

5146
02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:06.461
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy.</v>

5147
02:09:06.461 --> 02:09:06.821
<v Speaker 4>Don't ask,</v>

5148
02:09:06.821 --> 02:09:07.211
<v Speaker 4>don't tell.</v>

5149
02:09:07.211 --> 02:09:08.044
<v Speaker 4>Got repealed,</v>

5150
02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:11.770
<v Speaker 4>but you got some fucking work to do and you want the kid that's a crumb.</v>

5151
02:09:12.130 --> 02:09:12.963
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>

5152
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:16.420
<v Speaker 4>I had a sign of allowed to be our hired killer.</v>

5153
02:09:16.421 --> 02:09:17.290
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're gay,</v>

5154
02:09:17.291 --> 02:09:18.124
<v Speaker 4>congratulations.</v>

5155
02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:18.970
<v Speaker 4>The world's perfect man,</v>

5156
02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:19.121
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5157
02:09:19.121 --> 02:09:19.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5158
02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:19.890
<v Speaker 4>We really,</v>

5159
02:09:19.890 --> 02:09:20.800
<v Speaker 4>we need those numbers up.</v>

5160
02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:22.810
<v Speaker 4>We don't need gay people killing people.</v>

5161
02:09:22.811 --> 02:09:24.370
<v Speaker 4>We don't need any new people killing people.</v>

5162
02:09:24.371 --> 02:09:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I was out at the rally with a sign that said Wall Street wants to gay Mary,</v>

5163
02:09:27.551 --> 02:09:28.780
<v Speaker 4>you illegal abortions,</v>

5164
02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:30.100
<v Speaker 4>and people were like,</v>

5165
02:09:30.101 --> 02:09:31.270
<v Speaker 4>what are you trolling this event?</v>

5166
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.811
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>

5167
02:09:31.811 --> 02:09:32.081
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

5168
02:09:32.081 --> 02:09:32.231
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5169
02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:32.350
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5170
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.471
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

5171
02:09:32.471 --> 02:09:35.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that like someone might see this and get outraged and th the</v>

5172
02:09:35.141 --> 02:09:36.100
<v Speaker 4>statement that I'm trying to make,</v>

5173
02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:37.210
<v Speaker 4>which was woefully missed,</v>

5174
02:09:37.211 --> 02:09:37.930
<v Speaker 4>I get it now,</v>

5175
02:09:37.930 --> 02:09:40.570
<v Speaker 4>but the statement I was trying to make was that the same anger you have for</v>

5176
02:09:40.571 --> 02:09:41.500
<v Speaker 4>moral issues,</v>

5177
02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.040
<v Speaker 4>you need to apply to the f the issues that are the fundamental problems right</v>

5178
02:09:45.041 --> 02:09:45.701
<v Speaker 4>now in my opinion,</v>

5179
02:09:45.701 --> 02:09:48.310
<v Speaker 4>it's not those little moral issues that are on the sign that you are being</v>

5180
02:09:48.311 --> 02:09:49.330
<v Speaker 4>offended by right now.</v>

5181
02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:51.610
<v Speaker 4>It's these bankers that took the fucking money.</v>

5182
02:09:51.611 --> 02:09:53.260
<v Speaker 4>It's the government that's bought by the bankers.</v>

5183
02:09:53.261 --> 02:09:56.280
<v Speaker 4>It's the police force that's being paid by them to stifle your,</v>

5184
02:09:56.281 --> 02:09:57.370
<v Speaker 4>your rights to protest.</v>

5185
02:09:57.371 --> 02:09:58.240
<v Speaker 4>It's all that shit.</v>

5186
02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:00.280
<v Speaker 4>Like if that foundation crumbles,</v>

5187
02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:03.310
<v Speaker 4>we won't be able to have the conversations about the moral shit that you want to</v>

5188
02:10:03.311 --> 02:10:05.590
<v Speaker 4>have a conversation on that just won't exist anymore.</v>

5189
02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:10.300
<v Speaker 4>I had to read Matt Taibbi these articles about him to delete this movement even</v>

5190
02:10:10.301 --> 02:10:12.490
<v Speaker 4>though I have to do them 10 fucking times.</v>

5191
02:10:12.491 --> 02:10:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Just even understand you to all the bullshit that exists behind the scenes</v>

5192
02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:18.590
<v Speaker 4>derivatives and shorting and it's,</v>

5193
02:10:18.591 --> 02:10:23.350
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard to believe that there's an economy based on gambling that things</v>

5194
02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:28.120
<v Speaker 4>are going to fail and that that is a hundred times larger than the actual</v>

5195
02:10:28.121 --> 02:10:28.630
<v Speaker 4>economy.</v>

5196
02:10:28.630 --> 02:10:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5197
02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:30.520
<v Speaker 4>It's all based on speculation.</v>

5198
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Your fucking head around that.</v>

5199
02:10:32.201 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like I get to bet a horse in the race.</v>

5200
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.670
<v Speaker 5>I get to bet that that horse is it going to finish the race and I get to put the</v>

5201
02:10:37.671 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 5>horse in that race.</v>

5202
02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:41.780
<v Speaker 5>I know he's not going to finish and I'm going to tell you this is going to be</v>

5203
02:10:41.781 --> 02:10:42.591
<v Speaker 5>the number one horse.</v>

5204
02:10:42.591 --> 02:10:43.820
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be super secure.</v>

5205
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:44.990
<v Speaker 5>Give that money with me.</v>

5206
02:10:45.110 --> 02:10:45.681
<v Speaker 5>There we go.</v>

5207
02:10:45.681 --> 02:10:49.880
<v Speaker 5>And horse dies on the fucking first lab and and nobody,</v>

5208
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:51.060
<v Speaker 5>there's not that sense of savings.</v>

5209
02:10:51.090 --> 02:10:52.280
<v Speaker 5>The savings and loan scandal,</v>

5210
02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.110
<v Speaker 5>which is a fraction,</v>

5211
02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:56.750
<v Speaker 5>the savings and loan scandal was a fraction of this,</v>

5212
02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:57.760
<v Speaker 5>this fraud movement.</v>

5213
02:10:58.010 --> 02:11:01.820
<v Speaker 5>Enron was a fraction of it in terms of detriment to the the the country and</v>

5214
02:11:01.821 --> 02:11:02.391
<v Speaker 5>homes and our,</v>

5215
02:11:02.391 --> 02:11:06.950
<v Speaker 5>and our budgets fraction and not one person has been investigated or put away</v>

5216
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:08.170
<v Speaker 5>roses.</v>

5217
02:11:08.170 --> 02:11:10.040
<v Speaker 5>That what a what a disgusting,</v>

5218
02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:12.170
<v Speaker 5>weird world we live in.</v>

5219
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:17.470
<v Speaker 5>We are literally being sucked dry by financial vampires.</v>

5220
02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:17.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5221
02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:22.130
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a vampire colony that's preying on our people,</v>

5222
02:11:22.131 --> 02:11:23.060
<v Speaker 5>but the way they're doing it,</v>

5223
02:11:23.061 --> 02:11:24.350
<v Speaker 5>instead of sucking blood out there,</v>

5224
02:11:24.351 --> 02:11:25.310
<v Speaker 5>sucking money out,</v>

5225
02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:30.170
<v Speaker 5>and they live in these opulent castles that you can go nowhere near and this arm</v>

5226
02:11:30.171 --> 02:11:34.130
<v Speaker 5>guards and fucking fences and they're sleeping in their coffins and they're just</v>

5227
02:11:34.131 --> 02:11:38.840
<v Speaker 5>socking money out of it and they're doing it and they're doing it legally.</v>

5228
02:11:38.841 --> 02:11:39.674
<v Speaker 5>Somehow or another,</v>

5229
02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:41.270
<v Speaker 5>they're donating money to the cops,</v>

5230
02:11:41.271 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 5>four point $6 million to the cops so they can fucking keep them away from them</v>

5231
02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.550
<v Speaker 5>while the protests are going on.</v>

5232
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:47.770
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

5233
02:11:47.771 --> 02:11:48.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5234
02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:49.100
<v Speaker 5>it's insane.</v>

5235
02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:50.300
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen the American dream,</v>

5236
02:11:50.301 --> 02:11:51.350
<v Speaker 5>the animated cartoon?</v>

5237
02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:51.830
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5238
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:53.990
<v Speaker 5>It explains the Fed and like a very simple,</v>

5239
02:11:53.991 --> 02:11:55.940
<v Speaker 5>beautiful way inside job was a great one for that.</v>

5240
02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:58.320
<v Speaker 5>Now people are starting to get aware of that and side jobs and such.</v>

5241
02:11:58.321 --> 02:11:58.820
<v Speaker 5>I was phenomenal.</v>

5242
02:11:58.820 --> 02:11:59.180
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

5243
02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:00.980
<v Speaker 5>I had to watch the documentary.</v>

5244
02:12:00.981 --> 02:12:01.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5245
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:02.180
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

5246
02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:04.970
<v Speaker 5>But how amazing is it when that guy is questioning all these different</v>

5247
02:12:04.971 --> 02:12:07.250
<v Speaker 5>professors that now these guys,</v>

5248
02:12:07.251 --> 02:12:10.400
<v Speaker 5>they become professors and then they get jobs working for the government.</v>

5249
02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.020
<v Speaker 5>So when their professors,</v>

5250
02:12:12.021 --> 02:12:12.561
<v Speaker 5>they say,</v>

5251
02:12:12.561 --> 02:12:12.981
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

5252
02:12:12.981 --> 02:12:15.050
<v Speaker 5>that turns out to not be fucking true at all.</v>

5253
02:12:15.230 --> 02:12:18.680
<v Speaker 5>They say shit that enables businesses to get away with creepy things because,</v>

5254
02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:18.981
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5255
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 5>we went to this financial expert in his,</v>

5256
02:12:20.871 --> 02:12:22.040
<v Speaker 5>this is what his opinion is.</v>

5257
02:12:22.190 --> 02:12:22.551
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

5258
02:12:22.551 --> 02:12:22.731
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5259
02:12:22.731 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 5>everything's going to be cool.</v>

5260
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:24.141
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

5261
02:12:24.141 --> 02:12:24.321
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5262
02:12:24.321 --> 02:12:25.370
<v Speaker 5>he said everything's going to be cool.</v>

5263
02:12:25.371 --> 02:12:26.240
<v Speaker 5>He's got a phd.</v>

5264
02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.790
<v Speaker 5>And then it turns out this cock sucker goes and starts working for the federal</v>

5265
02:12:28.791 --> 02:12:31.760
<v Speaker 5>government afterwards or starts working for some big corporation afterwards and</v>

5266
02:12:31.761 --> 02:12:33.320
<v Speaker 5>get some cushy ass fucking job.</v>

5267
02:12:33.321 --> 02:12:37.130
<v Speaker 5>It's making x millions of dollars per year because of his decisions that he made</v>

5268
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:39.560
<v Speaker 5>that support these fucking vampire criminals.</v>

5269
02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:42.260
<v Speaker 5>It's the same revolving door with the SEC right now.</v>

5270
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 5>Like the guys were supposed to be regulating Wall Street and putting cases,</v>

5271
02:12:45.291 --> 02:12:45.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5272
02:12:45.591 --> 02:12:47.420
<v Speaker 5>up to the government so they can actually enforce them.</v>

5273
02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:48.980
<v Speaker 5>They know that if they don't prosecute,</v>

5274
02:12:48.981 --> 02:12:49.880
<v Speaker 5>if they don't do anything,</v>

5275
02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:51.140
<v Speaker 5>they're going to be revolving door.</v>

5276
02:12:51.141 --> 02:12:52.400
<v Speaker 5>When they're done with their two or three years,</v>

5277
02:12:52.401 --> 02:12:55.640
<v Speaker 5>they can hop right on over and work for the guys that they were supposed to be</v>

5278
02:12:55.641 --> 02:12:56.181
<v Speaker 5>investigating.</v>

5279
02:12:56.181 --> 02:12:57.260
<v Speaker 5>There's no laws against that.</v>

5280
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:58.183
<v Speaker 5>What's going to happen,</v>

5281
02:12:58.610 --> 02:12:59.690
<v Speaker 5>so this is,</v>

5282
02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:00.980
<v Speaker 5>this is what we all see.</v>

5283
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:02.600
<v Speaker 5>We all see occupy Wall Street,</v>

5284
02:13:02.601 --> 02:13:04.550
<v Speaker 5>we all see people freaking out.</v>

5285
02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:07.990
<v Speaker 5>We all see how many people would like us all across the country mean what does</v>

5286
02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:08.151
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

5287
02:13:08.151 --> 02:13:09.710
<v Speaker 5>this is just a conversation between Sharon's,</v>

5288
02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:12.140
<v Speaker 5>how many friends are sitting around smoking a joint,</v>

5289
02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:12.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5290
02:13:12.471 --> 02:13:13.310
<v Speaker 5>drinking a couple beers,</v>

5291
02:13:13.311 --> 02:13:14.990
<v Speaker 5>having the same fucking conversation,</v>

5292
02:13:14.991 --> 02:13:17.960
<v Speaker 5>spitting at each other in a bar somewhere and these mother fuckers,</v>

5293
02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:19.093
<v Speaker 5>what's going to happen?</v>

5294
02:13:19.670 --> 02:13:20.181
<v Speaker 5>Where's this guy?</v>

5295
02:13:20.181 --> 02:13:22.310
<v Speaker 5>It's a great question because it's more than ever before.</v>

5296
02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:24.350
<v Speaker 5>It's more than any time in my life.</v>

5297
02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:25.813
<v Speaker 5>This is like,</v>

5298
02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.150
<v Speaker 5>we are right now at like Vietnam protests levels.</v>

5299
02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 5>We're like,</v>

5300
02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:30.321
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

5301
02:13:30.321 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 5>we're at the state where you see those,</v>

5302
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:36.240
<v Speaker 2>that girl get maced in New York and you hear that that guy only got fucking 10</v>

5303
02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:38.800

5304
02:13:38.801 --> 02:13:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Like how has that guy allowed to be a fucking cop?</v>

5305
02:13:41.070 --> 02:13:43.340
<v Speaker 2>You went around and may some chicks you,</v>

5306
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:44.183
<v Speaker 2>you should be you.</v>

5307
02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:46.380
<v Speaker 2>You should have to fucking fight cris Cyborg.</v>

5308
02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:47.363
<v Speaker 2>That's what they should do.</v>

5309
02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:48.750
<v Speaker 2>This you want to mace chicks.</v>

5310
02:13:48.810 --> 02:13:51.540
<v Speaker 2>How about you getting the right that line to wake up marine that says there's no</v>

5311
02:13:51.541 --> 02:13:53.320
<v Speaker 2>honor and Pepperdine,</v>

5312
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:55.410
<v Speaker 2>that marine my gas out.</v>

5313
02:13:55.530 --> 02:13:56.010
<v Speaker 2>It's better.</v>

5314
02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Look not against officer Tony Below and he'll get the job done.</v>

5315
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:00.601
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

5316
02:14:00.601 --> 02:14:00.961
<v Speaker 2>Baloney.</v>

5317
02:14:00.961 --> 02:14:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Might have a good guard.</v>

5318
02:14:01.891 --> 02:14:02.701
<v Speaker 2>He might get a bill.</v>

5319
02:14:02.701 --> 02:14:03.260
<v Speaker 2>His guard,</v>

5320
02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:04.290
<v Speaker 2>a guy off his guard.</v>

5321
02:14:04.291 --> 02:14:07.000
<v Speaker 2>It smells like old spice is going to,</v>

5322
02:14:07.001 --> 02:14:10.530
<v Speaker 2>could it be that strong that gets that one cop through a sucker punch at one of</v>

5323
02:14:10.531 --> 02:14:13.500
<v Speaker 2>the protestors and it was like the worst punch ever.</v>

5324
02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:19.220
<v Speaker 2>You should never be confident enough to punch a man with that wack ass technique</v>

5325
02:14:19.591 --> 02:14:20.190
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>

5326
02:14:20.190 --> 02:14:21.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to fight it all right?</v>

5327
02:14:21.710 --> 02:14:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Yet you have the balls to throw a punch in a crowd against an unarmed protestor.</v>

5328
02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:27.300
<v Speaker 2>You fuckhead,</v>

5329
02:14:27.301 --> 02:14:29.370
<v Speaker 2>which shows just how fucking peaceful,</v>

5330
02:14:29.371 --> 02:14:30.880
<v Speaker 2>despite the agent provocateurs,</v>

5331
02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:32.970
<v Speaker 2>it shows just how peaceful this movement truly is.</v>

5332
02:14:32.971 --> 02:14:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the only way.</v>

5333
02:14:34.290 --> 02:14:34.471
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5334
02:14:34.471 --> 02:14:37.200
<v Speaker 2>it's also that you see these cops that are older cops there,</v>

5335
02:14:37.201 --> 02:14:38.280
<v Speaker 2>the white shirt cops,</v>

5336
02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:38.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5337
02:14:38.701 --> 02:14:42.240
<v Speaker 2>those are the guys that are older cops that had been the force a long time and</v>

5338
02:14:42.241 --> 02:14:43.800
<v Speaker 2>they get jaded and they get it.</v>

5339
02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:45.150
<v Speaker 2>They've seen the worst of humanity.</v>

5340
02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:46.500
<v Speaker 2>You get entitled to,</v>

5341
02:14:46.530 --> 02:14:46.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5342
02:14:46.831 --> 02:14:47.530
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

5343
02:14:47.530 --> 02:14:49.890
<v Speaker 2>they get cocky and they think that they can get away with some shit.</v>

5344
02:14:49.891 --> 02:14:50.100
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5345
02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:52.080
<v Speaker 2>that's what enabled him to pull the trigger and put,</v>

5346
02:14:52.110 --> 02:14:52.950
<v Speaker 2>they've also dealt with,</v>

5347
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:54.750
<v Speaker 2>they've also dealt with scum day in and day out,</v>

5348
02:14:54.751 --> 02:14:55.260
<v Speaker 2>like you said.</v>

5349
02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:57.420
<v Speaker 2>So they see somebody on their face screaming at them,</v>

5350
02:14:57.421 --> 02:14:58.650
<v Speaker 2>which that should not be happening.</v>

5351
02:14:58.651 --> 02:15:00.150
<v Speaker 2>But they see that and they go,</v>

5352
02:15:00.151 --> 02:15:00.511
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5353
02:15:00.511 --> 02:15:02.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm now identifying us scum right now.</v>

5354
02:15:02.190 --> 02:15:04.050
<v Speaker 2>But we got to when the police over,</v>

5355
02:15:04.110 --> 02:15:05.550
<v Speaker 2>if this thing's gonna work at all.</v>

5356
02:15:05.551 --> 02:15:06.990
<v Speaker 2>And that concerns me,</v>

5357
02:15:06.991 --> 02:15:07.824
<v Speaker 2>that's an uphill battle.</v>

5358
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:08.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5359
02:15:08.101 --> 02:15:08.934
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

5360
02:15:09.130 --> 02:15:09.961
<v Speaker 2>Like I said before,</v>

5361
02:15:09.961 --> 02:15:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I think the cops are gonna figure it out eventually that it's all a pile of</v>

5362
02:15:12.601 --> 02:15:14.190
<v Speaker 2>horse shit once things start sliding.</v>

5363
02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

5364
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5365
02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I hope you talked about people that are willing to commit atrocities,</v>

5366
02:15:17.581 --> 02:15:17.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5367
02:15:17.781 --> 02:15:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Cause they've been desensitized.</v>

5368
02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Like they've got enough,</v>

5369
02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:24.360
<v Speaker 2>they've got enough nonlethal arsenal right now to fuck up a lot of people and</v>

5370
02:15:24.361 --> 02:15:25.950
<v Speaker 2>still feel like they're not being lethal.</v>

5371
02:15:25.951 --> 02:15:26.790
<v Speaker 2>They're just being okay.</v>

5372
02:15:26.791 --> 02:15:27.990
<v Speaker 2>They're just following orders.</v>

5373
02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:30.300
<v Speaker 2>They're just worried about their paycheck as well,</v>

5374
02:15:30.301 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5375
02:15:30.630 --> 02:15:31.590
<v Speaker 2>and that that will be said.</v>

5376
02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 2>But pepper sprays one thing.</v>

5377
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:34.470
<v Speaker 2>They've got the sonic weapons,</v>

5378
02:15:34.770 --> 02:15:39.060
<v Speaker 2>they've got fucking rubber bullets like you look at at at revolts and revolution</v>

5379
02:15:39.061 --> 02:15:39.751
<v Speaker 2>throughout history.</v>

5380
02:15:39.751 --> 02:15:42.930
<v Speaker 2>They never had the weaponry that they have right now to use against their own</v>

5381
02:15:42.931 --> 02:15:43.560
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

5382
02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:44.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what scares the shit out of me.</v>

5383
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Well that they could flip on a ray gun and it will microwave.</v>

5384
02:15:47.341 --> 02:15:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Your intestines are so freaky,</v>

5385
02:15:50.671 --> 02:15:51.060
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's video footage,</v>

5390
02:15:55.170 --> 02:15:57.540
<v Speaker 2>there's video footage from a news reporter taking a,</v>

5391
02:15:57.700 --> 02:15:57.911
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

5392
02:15:57.911 --> 02:16:01.110
<v Speaker 2>a a microwave beam weapon from like 10 years ago.</v>

5393
02:16:01.111 --> 02:16:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Google it right now and he stands in front of it and was like,</v>

5394
02:16:03.181 --> 02:16:03.331
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

5395

<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

5398
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:03.961
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>

5399
02:16:03.961 --> 02:16:04.410
<v Speaker 2>And the guy goes,</v>

5400
02:16:04.410 --> 02:16:04.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh god,</v>

5401
02:16:04.921 --> 02:16:06.930
<v Speaker 2>instantly steps off the pad.</v>

5402
02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.160
<v Speaker 2>This was from years ago.</v>

5403
02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:11.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically like putting a Mike Rabbit and a microwave.</v>

5404
02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5405
02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:12.630
<v Speaker 2>except it's directional.</v>

5406
02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:12.781
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5407
02:16:12.781 --> 02:16:13.530
<v Speaker 2>it's pinpointed.</v>

5408
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:15.660
<v Speaker 2>They could point it at you or they could arch it out and beam and say,</v>

5409
02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:16.553
<v Speaker 2>here's the switch.</v>

5410
02:16:16.590 --> 02:16:17.381
<v Speaker 2>Just cooks people.</v>

5411
02:16:17.381 --> 02:16:20.730
<v Speaker 2>You instantly feel like your intestines are on fire is the way this news</v>

5412
02:16:20.731 --> 02:16:24.790
<v Speaker 2>reporter who stood in front of it years ago describe it to wearing chain mail,</v>

5413
02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:26.800
<v Speaker 2>male [inaudible] suits.</v>

5414
02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:28.133
<v Speaker 2>Metal does.</v>

5415
02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Cause like if you put can of soda in the microwave,</v>

5416
02:16:31.271 --> 02:16:32.110
<v Speaker 2>it will fucking explode.</v>

5417
02:16:32.111 --> 02:16:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5418
02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:33.460
<v Speaker 2>But you can't wear masks.</v>

5419
02:16:33.490 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 2>You can't wear gas masks.</v>

5420
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:37.210
<v Speaker 2>You can't have sticks anymore for your sign because that's a weapon.</v>

5421
02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:38.650
<v Speaker 2>You can't have anything anymore.</v>

5422
02:16:38.651 --> 02:16:40.720
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to quell that shit right away.</v>

5423
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:41.860
<v Speaker 2>You should really watch that video.</v>

5424
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:43.623
<v Speaker 2>That's a weapon.</v>

5425
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

5426
02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:45.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5427
02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:48.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that I watched on TV the other day where they were talking about</v>

5428
02:16:48.131 --> 02:16:49.790
<v Speaker 2>sonic weapons and what they're,</v>

5429
02:16:49.810 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 2>what they're able to do now with sound,</v>

5430
02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.870
<v Speaker 2>they can cause permanent deafness that can cause permanent blindness.</v>

5431
02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen blind you with sound?</v>

5432
02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:01.540
<v Speaker 2>You imagine that there's a video of that and use,</v>

5433
02:17:01.541 --> 02:17:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in Detroit,</v>

5434
02:17:02.511 --> 02:17:04.480
<v Speaker 2>it to the Detroit or Pittsburgh where they roll out.</v>

5435
02:17:04.481 --> 02:17:05.920
<v Speaker 2>There was a small unit protest.</v>

5436
02:17:05.950 --> 02:17:07.710
<v Speaker 2>It's online and it literally announces,</v>

5437
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:08.561
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to say Detroit,</v>

5438
02:17:08.561 --> 02:17:09.251
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong on this,</v>

5439
02:17:09.251 --> 02:17:10.031
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just gonna fucking say it.</v>

5440
02:17:10.031 --> 02:17:11.050
<v Speaker 2>The truck rolls out and goes,</v>

5441
02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:15.940
<v Speaker 2>our tongue should the city of Detroit from these giant booming speakers on a big</v>

5442
02:17:15.941 --> 02:17:18.940
<v Speaker 2>black monolithic looking car with riot police in front of it,</v>

5443
02:17:18.941 --> 02:17:22.360
<v Speaker 2>bashing their shields with batons to create sound.</v>

5444
02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:22.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5445
02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.801
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is like,</v>

5446
02:17:23.801 --> 02:17:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll turn,</v>

5447
02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't we are going to employ thank you.</v>

5448
02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Talking about the sonic weapons they used in Vancouver at the Olympics now</v>

5449
02:17:30.111 --> 02:17:30.791
<v Speaker 2>that's what it was.</v>

5450
02:17:30.791 --> 02:17:31.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

5451
02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah cause I remembered that.</v>

5452
02:17:32.501 --> 02:17:33.221
<v Speaker 2>I just looked it up,</v>

5453
02:17:33.221 --> 02:17:34.960
<v Speaker 2>but they were threatening to use things like that.</v>

5454
02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:35.793
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was at what?</v>

5455
02:17:36.330 --> 02:17:36.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5456
02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:37.480
<v Speaker 2>they used it.</v>

5457
02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5458
02:17:37.690 --> 02:17:37.931
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>

5459
02:17:37.931 --> 02:17:39.520
<v Speaker 2>they use that at the Olympics for sure.</v>

5460
02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:39.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5461
02:17:39.850 --> 02:17:41.890
<v Speaker 2>and that was again years ago and this was,</v>

5462
02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:44.560
<v Speaker 2>this was for a nonviolent protest.</v>

5463
02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:46.750
<v Speaker 2>They're calling it an acoustical device.</v>

5464
02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:47.561
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

5465
02:17:47.561 --> 02:17:48.550
<v Speaker 2>ain't no harmonica.</v>

5466
02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:50.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking sound weapon.</v>

5467
02:17:50.031 --> 02:17:52.420
<v Speaker 2>This is a high fidelity dispersal unit.</v>

5468
02:17:52.650 --> 02:17:55.800
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to make you deaf if you don't get the fuck out of this area.</v>

5469
02:17:55.810 --> 02:18:00.100
<v Speaker 2>They blasted some Somali pirates with it on this thing that I was watching the</v>

5470
02:18:00.101 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

5471
02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:03.280
<v Speaker 2>the u s government used it to keep up a Somali pirates.</v>

5472
02:18:03.550 --> 02:18:06.240
<v Speaker 2>They were coming near this boat and they just turn this thing on him at</v>

5473
02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:13.510
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and they just fucking blows their brains out and they have to swim</v>

5474
02:18:13.511 --> 02:18:13.870
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

5475
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 2>They should have new shit where it's like in the next 10 minutes,</v>

5476
02:18:15.851 --> 02:18:18.010
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have this thing that's going to break your iPhone.</v>

5477
02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:18.933
<v Speaker 2>I personally,</v>

5478
02:18:19.150 --> 02:18:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I personally like it the way the fucking Russians handle it.</v>

5479
02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:24.010
<v Speaker 2>The Russians go after Somali pilots.</v>

5480
02:18:24.011 --> 02:18:27.550
<v Speaker 2>They fucking pump missiles into their boats and they build them up and they</v>

5481
02:18:27.551 --> 02:18:28.600
<v Speaker 2>shoot him in the fucking head.</v>

5482
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to do it.</v>

5483
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:30.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5484
02:18:30.071 --> 02:18:30.311
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

5485
02:18:30.311 --> 02:18:31.210
<v Speaker 2>these sonic weapons,</v>

5486
02:18:31.211 --> 02:18:31.570
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5487
02:18:31.570 --> 02:18:31.931
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

5488
02:18:31.931 --> 02:18:33.100
<v Speaker 2>this is some lame shit,</v>

5489
02:18:33.150 --> 02:18:35.920
<v Speaker 2>but that's going to be turned on you to send regular phone message.</v>

5490
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5493
02:18:37.881 --> 02:18:38.110
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>

5494
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:39.190
<v Speaker 2>that's a real concern.</v>

5495
02:18:39.191 --> 02:18:39.431
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5496
02:18:39.431 --> 02:18:39.631
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

5497
02:18:39.631 --> 02:18:40.660
<v Speaker 2>when technology,</v>

5498

02:18:44.441 --> 02:18:45.700
<v Speaker 2>when it becomes viable,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5504

<v Speaker 2>when it becomes something that people could make money developing,</v>

5505
02:18:48.821 --> 02:18:49.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5506
02:18:49.141 --> 02:18:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and these weapons companies,</v>

5507
02:18:51.101 --> 02:18:52.450
<v Speaker 2>they're going to start turning it on people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5528
02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.291
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5529
02:19:13.291 --> 02:19:16.590
<v Speaker 2>the oppressive force and what they're going to see is what worries about me.</v>

5530
02:19:16.630 --> 02:19:18.310
<v Speaker 2>What worries me about this is that the imagery,</v>

5531
02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:20.290
<v Speaker 2>like when they shoot people in protests,</v>

5532
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:20.680
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5533
02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:22.960
<v Speaker 2>and the Arab spring and you see people just getting fucking Sean,</v>

5534
02:19:22.961 --> 02:19:23.794
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

5535
02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:24.820
<v Speaker 2>holy shit man,</v>

5536
02:19:24.850 --> 02:19:25.661
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked up.</v>

5537
02:19:25.661 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 2>And we know got intervene and you get world support and you get out of the</v>

5538
02:19:27.771 --> 02:19:27.981
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

5539
02:19:27.981 --> 02:19:32.120
<v Speaker 2>But if they use sonic weapons and people are angry and protesting finally,</v>

5540
02:19:32.121 --> 02:19:33.200
<v Speaker 2>which it may have to get to,</v>

5541
02:19:33.201 --> 02:19:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I sure fucking hope it doesn't.</v>

5542
02:19:34.430 --> 02:19:36.830
<v Speaker 2>But even if they have an agent provocateur spark a crowd,</v>

5543
02:19:36.831 --> 02:19:37.161
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say,</v>

5544
02:19:37.161 --> 02:19:37.670
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

5545
02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:39.080
<v Speaker 2>these guys got out of hand.</v>

5546
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:42.080
<v Speaker 2>This protest is violent and angry and we didn't even kill them.</v>

5547
02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.970
<v Speaker 2>We just microwave their insights for a little bit.</v>

5548
02:19:43.971 --> 02:19:44.750
<v Speaker 2>They won't say that.</v>

5549
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:46.100
<v Speaker 2>They'll say we use a sonic weapon.</v>

5550
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:47.450
<v Speaker 2>And so people at home would be like,</v>

5551
02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:48.081
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5552
02:19:48.081 --> 02:19:49.790
<v Speaker 2>they're being very humane to those violent people.</v>

5553
02:19:49.791 --> 02:19:51.170
<v Speaker 2>So this isn't nearly as jarring.</v>

5554
02:19:51.171 --> 02:19:54.050
<v Speaker 2>If they were shooting on 10 people went deaf,</v>

5555
02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:56.270
<v Speaker 2>it was only 10 and they wouldn't listen.</v>

5556
02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5557
02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

5558
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.880
<v Speaker 2>they should.</v>

5559
02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

5560
02:19:58.310 --> 02:19:58.911
<v Speaker 2>I had this argument,</v>

5561
02:19:58.911 --> 02:19:59.271
<v Speaker 2>my parents,</v>

5562
02:19:59.271 --> 02:19:59.601
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

5563
02:19:59.601 --> 02:19:59.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5564
02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:01.400
<v Speaker 2>if the police told you to get out,</v>

5565
02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to be there.</v>

5566
02:20:03.330 --> 02:20:05.160
<v Speaker 2>What they told you to leave it?</v>

5567
02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't explain the concept of protesting to my parents.</v>

5568
02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:11.210
<v Speaker 2>It gets to a certain point,</v>

5569
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:14.480
<v Speaker 2>it gets to a boiling point where what happens,</v>

5570
02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:16.130
<v Speaker 2>because it's growing it right now.</v>

5571
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:18.950
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that every day at Occupy Wall Street in New York,</v>

5572
02:20:18.951 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a bigger and bigger crowd every day.</v>

5573
02:20:21.141 --> 02:20:24.380
<v Speaker 2>People are coming from all over the world to participate in it.</v>

5574
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:25.730
<v Speaker 2>My friend Jamie Kilstein,</v>

5575
02:20:25.731 --> 02:20:27.920
<v Speaker 2>he's doing their fucking Melbourne,</v>

5576
02:20:27.921 --> 02:20:28.754
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

5577
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:30.620
<v Speaker 2>They're doing occupy Melbourne,</v>

5578
02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:31.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5579
02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:33.890
<v Speaker 2>and this is like 10 people fucking hippies.</v>

5580
02:20:35.010 --> 02:20:35.843
<v Speaker 2>They're out there.</v>

5581
02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:37.520
<v Speaker 2>10 MPs in Australia might,</v>

5582
02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.870
<v Speaker 2>but they're talking to bankers might know they're a,</v>

5583
02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:41.121
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5584
02:20:41.121 --> 02:20:41.631
<v Speaker 2>they're out there.</v>

5585
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:42.260
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's,</v>

5586
02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:44.570
<v Speaker 2>it's giant fucking Ganti.</v>

5587
02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:46.100
<v Speaker 2>It's beyond gigantic.</v>

5588
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:47.840
<v Speaker 2>So what does it do?</v>

5589
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.321
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

5590
02:20:48.321 --> 02:20:48.720
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

5591
02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:49.760
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it,</v>

5592
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:50.330
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

5593
02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:53.300
<v Speaker 2>do you extrapolate on constantly,</v>

5594
02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:53.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5595
02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:55.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a million ways this thing can go,</v>

5596
02:20:55.281 --> 02:20:56.720
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'm so fascinated by it.</v>

5597
02:20:56.721 --> 02:21:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are living in a chapter of a future history book or we're living at</v>

5598
02:21:00.501 --> 02:21:01.610
<v Speaker 2>the end of our society.</v>

5599
02:21:01.650 --> 02:21:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't know.</v>

5600
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe both.</v>

5601
02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe both.</v>

5602
02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5603
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is new world order shit.</v>

5604
02:21:06.381 --> 02:21:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is when the crowd gets completely beat down and that's it.</v>

5605
02:21:08.901 --> 02:21:09.561
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you can do.</v>

5606
02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:10.850
<v Speaker 2>We just be slaves to the system.</v>

5607
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Did you see Ron Paul at the Republican debate?</v>

5608
02:21:12.890 --> 02:21:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5609
02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Ron Paul had this one brilliant thing that he said that everybody says that</v>

5610
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:18.080
<v Speaker 2>really pays attention to human history.</v>

5611
02:21:18.081 --> 02:21:18.471
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

5612
02:21:18.471 --> 02:21:22.730
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly how every single empire has fallen.</v>

5613
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:27.620
<v Speaker 2>They try to spread themselves out too thin and eventually it all comes crumbling</v>

5614
02:21:27.621 --> 02:21:28.070
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

5615
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5616
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.960
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

5617
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:30.920
<v Speaker 2>We have a blueprint.</v>

5618
02:21:30.921 --> 02:21:31.551
<v Speaker 2>We've seen this.</v>

5619
02:21:31.551 --> 02:21:35.420
<v Speaker 2>We have the knowledge to connect all the dots as to what's happening right now</v>

5620
02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:38.500
<v Speaker 2>and yet we're just repeating history but with slightly different tools and it's</v>

5621
02:21:38.501 --> 02:21:39.470
<v Speaker 2>slightly different volumes.</v>

5622
02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:39.920
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

5623
02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:43.640
<v Speaker 2>It's been ratcheted up and we've survived a lot of that history.</v>

5624
02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:45.860
<v Speaker 2>But who knows what atrocities could line,</v>

5625
02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:46.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5626
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.940
<v Speaker 2>lie around the corner.</v>

5627
02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:48.980
<v Speaker 2>But I even looking at it like I'm doing all right,</v>

5628
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I've got a good job,</v>

5629
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I've got great friends,</v>

5630
02:21:51.291 --> 02:21:52.190
<v Speaker 2>like I'm doing great.</v>

5631
02:21:52.191 --> 02:21:55.310
<v Speaker 2>And I see I'm really concerned for the director of this country,</v>

5632
02:21:55.311 --> 02:21:58.640
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'm trying to educate myself and be a little more outspoken about</v>

5633
02:21:58.641 --> 02:21:58.701
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

5634
02:21:58.701 --> 02:22:01.430
<v Speaker 2>But I'm really concerned to the point where I've had the discussion of,</v>

5635
02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:01.671
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

5636
02:22:01.671 --> 02:22:02.270
<v Speaker 2>well where the fuck,</v>

5637
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:03.350
<v Speaker 2>where's our exit strategy?</v>

5638
02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:04.693
<v Speaker 2>What is it right now?</v>

5639
02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:08.660
<v Speaker 2>If the shit really hits the fan tomorrow and they declare martial law and the</v>

5640
02:22:08.661 --> 02:22:09.680
<v Speaker 2>streets lockdown,</v>

5641
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:10.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5642
02:22:10.161 --> 02:22:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the riot police are coming into the marines going to come in and fight.</v>

5643
02:22:12.231 --> 02:22:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to wake up tomorrow morning,</v>

5644
02:22:13.281 --> 02:22:14.150
<v Speaker 2>my dollars worth nothing.</v>

5645
02:22:14.151 --> 02:22:15.680
<v Speaker 2>And there's a war zone outside my window.</v>

5646
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>

5647
02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:17.001
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

5648
02:22:17.001 --> 02:22:19.220
<v Speaker 2>we're potentially two to three years away from that.</v>

5649
02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe more.</v>

5650
02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:21.133
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what that's,</v>

5651
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:23.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe it could happen tomorrow.</v>

5652
02:22:23.841 --> 02:22:24.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5653
02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:26.220
<v Speaker 2>and that the notion that it could happen,</v>

5654
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:26.971
<v Speaker 1>not that I think it will,</v>

5655
02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:28.110
<v Speaker 1>but the notion that it could,</v>

5656
02:22:28.290 --> 02:22:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I would feel that in my lifetime in this country.</v>

5657
02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And I feel it right now and I've been researching,</v>

5658
02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:34.200
<v Speaker 1>do I go to Finland,</v>

5659
02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland?</v>

5660
02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:35.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5661
02:22:35.161 --> 02:22:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Japan was my exit strategy for a little while there.</v>

5662
02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:38.101
<v Speaker 1>I love Japan,</v>

5663
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but that countries had some fucking hard times right now.</v>

5664
02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.000
<v Speaker 1>And you wouldn't go to Canada?</v>

5665
02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I would go right to Vancouver.</v>

5666
02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver is a shit.</v>

5667
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to Vancouver off is it?</v>

5668
02:22:48.210 --> 02:22:49.350

02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:55.170
<v Speaker 1>well there re a mass Borys comedy scene.</v>

5677
02:22:58.531 --> 02:22:58.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5678
02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:01.410
<v Speaker 1>a really diverse community.</v>

5679
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I all sorts of different there.</v>

5680
02:23:02.521 --> 02:23:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Now I should got to be there.</v>

5681
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I almost moved there in 1984 when Bush won again,</v>

5682
02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:08.701
<v Speaker 1>not an 84,</v>

5683
02:23:08.701 --> 02:23:10.860
<v Speaker 1>rather 2004 when Bush won again in 2004.</v>

5684
02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I just sat back and especially because I was paying attention to the whole</v>

5685
02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Diebold voting thing.</v>

5686
02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5687
02:23:15.370 --> 02:23:16.203
<v Speaker 1>You know the whole,</v>

5688
02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:17.041
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5689
02:23:17.041 --> 02:23:18.030
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

5690
02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I watched the hacking democracy documentary and I'm like,</v>

5691
02:23:20.821 --> 02:23:21.271
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>

5692
02:23:21.271 --> 02:23:21.901
<v Speaker 1>they stole it.</v>

5693
02:23:21.901 --> 02:23:22.734
<v Speaker 1>This is not about,</v>

5694
02:23:22.890 --> 02:23:23.910
<v Speaker 1>this is not real anymore.</v>

5695
02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Stover testifying under oath that he wrote code that allowed them to rig an</v>

5696
02:23:28.141 --> 02:23:32.640
<v Speaker 1>election and we showed how we can be done in Dene did it and showed how this,</v>

5697
02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:33.391
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

5698
02:23:33.391 --> 02:23:36.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a third party option in the software that allows a third party other</v>

5699
02:23:36.781 --> 02:23:38.760
<v Speaker 1>than the voter other than the PR person reading the vote.</v>

5700
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:40.020
<v Speaker 1>A second person,</v>

5701
02:23:40.050 --> 02:23:43.560
<v Speaker 1>another person comes in and inserts data and changes the data and they showed</v>

5702
02:23:43.561 --> 02:23:44.394
<v Speaker 1>how it can be done.</v>

5703
02:23:44.430 --> 02:23:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

5704
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean this has been massive contributors to the Republican Party.</v>

5705
02:23:48.810 --> 02:23:52.320
<v Speaker 1>The idea that some company can contribute to the Republican Party and then make</v>

5706
02:23:52.321 --> 02:23:55.680
<v Speaker 1>a machine that decides whether Republicans or Democrats win elections.</v>

5707
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Is it madness?</v>

5708
02:23:56.910 --> 02:23:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Absolute fucking man.</v>

5709
02:23:58.041 --> 02:23:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It's called hedging your bets.</v>

5710
02:23:59.310 --> 02:24:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I got furious man.</v>

5711
02:24:00.361 --> 02:24:00.691
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

5712
02:24:00.691 --> 02:24:02.630
<v Speaker 1>there was a period of time over a couple of weeks.</v>

5713
02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of Candida.</v>

5714
02:24:03.991 --> 02:24:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I love going up there and I don't like the cold though.</v>

5715
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:06.691
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

5716
02:24:06.691 --> 02:24:06.871
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5717
02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Montreal would be the shit,</v>

5718
02:24:07.861 --> 02:24:08.730
<v Speaker 1>but the winters are brutal.</v>

5719
02:24:08.731 --> 02:24:09.181
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

5720
02:24:09.181 --> 02:24:10.080
<v Speaker 1>where else could I live?</v>

5721
02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5722
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5723
02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:11.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have that thought.</v>

5724
02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:13.081
<v Speaker 1>I still do.</v>

5725
02:24:13.081 --> 02:24:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I still go back and forth.</v>

5726
02:24:14.071 --> 02:24:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I have my friend Bobby lives up.</v>

5727
02:24:15.161 --> 02:24:15.511
<v Speaker 1>So what's it,</v>

5728
02:24:15.511 --> 02:24:16.650
<v Speaker 1>what's going to be the pin drop?</v>

5729
02:24:16.690 --> 02:24:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you imagine what the candles,</v>

5730
02:24:18.211 --> 02:24:18.751
<v Speaker 1>I get older.</v>

5731
02:24:18.751 --> 02:24:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It might just because as I get older I just decide enough is enough of this</v>

5732
02:24:21.871 --> 02:24:22.291
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

5733
02:24:22.291 --> 02:24:23.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to live in this country.</v>

5734
02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:23.941
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5735
02:24:23.941 --> 02:24:24.450
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

5736
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:28.800
<v Speaker 1>we are eventually becoming a global society.</v>

5737
02:24:28.830 --> 02:24:29.100
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

5738
02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:32.820
<v Speaker 1>the connectivity that we all enjoy right now because of the Internet lets people</v>

5739
02:24:32.821 --> 02:24:35.110
<v Speaker 1>realize that communities like my,</v>

5740
02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:35.973
<v Speaker 1>my message board,</v>

5741
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I have a massive message board and in this community is a mass as a message</v>

5742
02:24:39.601 --> 02:24:41.430
<v Speaker 1>board of really cool people from everywhere.</v>

5743
02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:41.611
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

5744
02:24:41.611 --> 02:24:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I have people from fucking Saudi Arabia.</v>

5745
02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I have people from foreign countries,</v>

5746
02:24:45.211 --> 02:24:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I have Asian countries,</v>

5747
02:24:46.291 --> 02:24:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I have people from Canada,</v>

5748
02:24:47.731 --> 02:24:49.260
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fucking people from Canada,</v>

5749
02:24:49.261 --> 02:24:52.440
<v Speaker 1>people from Switzerland and Sweden all over the fucking world.</v>

5750
02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:56.970
<v Speaker 1>And it leads me to believe that this idea that a fucking line in the dirt can</v>

5751
02:24:56.971 --> 02:24:58.290
<v Speaker 1>dictate where you're from.</v>

5752
02:24:58.520 --> 02:24:58.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5753
02:24:58.761 --> 02:24:58.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5754
02:24:58.920 --> 02:24:59.001
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5755
02:24:59.001 --> 02:24:59.161
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5756
02:24:59.161 --> 02:25:01.440
<v Speaker 1>It should be likeminded people.</v>

5757
02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It should be cool people,</v>

5758
02:25:02.431 --> 02:25:03.870
<v Speaker 1>like minded people find them.</v>

5759
02:25:03.871 --> 02:25:04.980
<v Speaker 1>And if you find a spot,</v>

5760
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.341
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5761
02:25:05.341 --> 02:25:06.540
<v Speaker 1>it's across the dirt line.</v>

5762
02:25:06.541 --> 02:25:07.470
<v Speaker 1>It's no good anymore.</v>

5763
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5764
02:25:07.741 --> 02:25:08.401
<v Speaker 1>But it's awesome.</v>

5765
02:25:08.401 --> 02:25:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's fucking Costa Rica or where,</v>

5766
02:25:10.171 --> 02:25:11.580
<v Speaker 1>where are the fuck it is?</v>

5767
02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:14.900
<v Speaker 1>If you find a place that you think that you could live a safer,</v>

5768
02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:15.450
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>

5769
02:25:15.450 --> 02:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>friendlier life than what you're here in the,</v>

5770
02:25:18.091 --> 02:25:19.500
<v Speaker 1>in the center of the Shit Storm.</v>

5771
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5772
02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:20.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5773
02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I love the idea of America.</v>

5774
02:25:22.171 --> 02:25:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I love the idea.</v>

5775
02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:24.160
<v Speaker 1>It all,</v>

5776
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea that,</v>

5777
02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:25.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5778
02:25:25.541 --> 02:25:29.050
<v Speaker 2>we saved the world from the Russians and we saved the world from the Nazis and</v>

5779
02:25:29.051 --> 02:25:29.770
<v Speaker 2>that we're,</v>

5780
02:25:29.770 --> 02:25:30.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5781
02:25:30.101 --> 02:25:30.311
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5782
02:25:30.311 --> 02:25:30.611
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5783
02:25:30.611 --> 02:25:32.110
<v Speaker 2>the noblest and most creative.</v>

5784
02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:32.891
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea,</v>

5785
02:25:32.891 --> 02:25:35.980
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see it in practice and it scares me.</v>

5786
02:25:35.981 --> 02:25:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have been to a fucking car game.</v>

5787
02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:39.173
<v Speaker 2>It's not a game.</v>

5788
02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:39.740
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5789
02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:41.130
<v Speaker 2>it scares me to think that I'm,</v>

5790
02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:42.820
<v Speaker 2>that I'm a rube,</v>

5791
02:25:43.090 --> 02:25:43.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5792
02:25:43.391 --> 02:25:47.140
<v Speaker 2>that I'm locked into this stupid fucking system and if it gets any worse,</v>

5793
02:25:47.141 --> 02:25:47.974
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5794
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>

5795
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:51.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it falls apart around it is the catalyst,</v>

5796
02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:52.090
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5797
02:25:52.090 --> 02:25:53.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I've been thinking because you know,</v>

5798
02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:57.340
<v Speaker 2>people had chances to get out of countries that became locked down and war</v>

5799
02:25:57.341 --> 02:25:58.300
<v Speaker 2>started and then it was like,</v>

5800
02:25:58.301 --> 02:25:58.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5801
02:25:58.451 --> 02:25:59.320
<v Speaker 2>you ain't going anywhere.</v>

5802
02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:00.220
<v Speaker 2>They had,</v>

5803
02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:01.000
<v Speaker 2>they had signs.</v>

5804
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:01.630
<v Speaker 2>They had,</v>

5805
02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:02.800
<v Speaker 2>they had news reports coming out.</v>

5806
02:26:02.801 --> 02:26:03.401
<v Speaker 2>They had all that shit.</v>

5807
02:26:03.401 --> 02:26:04.660
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the answer net though.</v>

5808
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:05.770
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the Internet.</v>

5809
02:26:05.771 --> 02:26:06.290
<v Speaker 2>They didn't.</v>

5810
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:07.270
<v Speaker 2>It was a different world.</v>

5811
02:26:07.350 --> 02:26:11.680
<v Speaker 2>A world that we're living in is a very strange world and I don't know what</v>

5812
02:26:11.681 --> 02:26:13.570
<v Speaker 2>happens when it all falls apart.</v>

5813
02:26:13.810 --> 02:26:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5814
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:17.650
<v Speaker 2>It was someone going to try to reclaim power.</v>

5815
02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:18.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5816
02:26:18.041 --> 02:26:19.990
<v Speaker 2>is there going to be an actual physical war?</v>

5817
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to be tanks in the streets?</v>

5818
02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>And who are those soldiers?</v>

5819
02:26:22.721 --> 02:26:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Those soldiers are going to actually go after their brothers and sisters and</v>

5820
02:26:25.271 --> 02:26:26.290
<v Speaker 2>cousins and neighbors.</v>

5821
02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:28.300
<v Speaker 2>How can,</v>

5822
02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:29.133
<v Speaker 2>how can they,</v>

5823
02:26:29.170 --> 02:26:29.651
<v Speaker 2>how can they,</v>

5824
02:26:29.651 --> 02:26:30.520
<v Speaker 2>is that possible?</v>

5825
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean they could be sold a message that it's not their brothers and sisters and</v>

5826
02:26:33.961 --> 02:26:34.610
<v Speaker 2>neighbors,</v>

5827
02:26:34.610 --> 02:26:35.580
<v Speaker 2>that it's insurgents,</v>

5828
02:26:35.650 --> 02:26:38.170
<v Speaker 2>that they're terrorists and that would be the agent provocateur.</v>

5829
02:26:38.171 --> 02:26:41.640
<v Speaker 2>So we need a certain population associate pass and make this whole fucking prime</v>

5830
02:26:41.650 --> 02:26:42.483
<v Speaker 2>work for the man.</v>

5831
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:44.410
<v Speaker 2>We're going to become Mexicans won't be going on.</v>

5832
02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:45.253
<v Speaker 2>You were saying,</v>

5833
02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:46.640
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that the agent provocateur,</v>

5834
02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:47.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5835
02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.270
<v Speaker 2>we will be the Canadian Mexicans,</v>

5836
02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:49.740
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5837
02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:50.270
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

5838
02:26:50.270 --> 02:26:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Mexican versions of Canada.</v>

5839
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:52.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5840
02:26:52.541 --> 02:26:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather live in a cold climate.</v>

5841
02:26:53.861 --> 02:26:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I might even live in Alaska.</v>

5842
02:26:54.941 --> 02:26:57.010
<v Speaker 2>I might even live in Alaska better than this show.</v>

5843
02:26:57.011 --> 02:26:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen this fish with the transparent head?</v>

5844
02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen this photo yet?</v>

5845
02:27:01.450 --> 02:27:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5846
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:03.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like a real deep underwater fish.</v>

5847
02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:07.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a fish and they have it on youtube or there's photos it's on from national</v>

5848
02:27:07.721 --> 02:27:08.261
<v Speaker 2>geographic,</v>

5849
02:27:08.261 --> 02:27:11.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's actual fish that you can just see right into its brain and,</v>

5850
02:27:12.010 --> 02:27:15.670
<v Speaker 2>and like you could see its organs and the name of it.</v>

5851
02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5852
02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:17.223
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

5853
02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:20.080
<v Speaker 2>they call it a large Pacific,</v>

5854
02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:22.511
<v Speaker 2>B a.</v>

02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Borrowell borrow I,</v>

5863
02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:28.690
<v Speaker 2>this is a video from a few years ago.</v>

5864
02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:31.820
<v Speaker 2>This was like 2009 I just saw it the other day.</v>

5865
02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:34.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fish from Sega semen for the Dreamcast.</v>

5866
02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5867
02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:35.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

5868
02:27:35.290 --> 02:27:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Like that fit fucking alien world.</v>

5869
02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:37.870
<v Speaker 2>That ocean,</v>

5870
02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I always see a real deep water shit like the planet earth,</v>

5871
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:42.490
<v Speaker 2>deep water addition,</v>

5872
02:27:42.491 --> 02:27:43.420
<v Speaker 2>anything on deep water.</v>

5873
02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I see the life that exists on this planet and it makes me realize how uncreative</v>

5874
02:27:48.161 --> 02:27:50.800
<v Speaker 2>human beings are at conceiving what alien life forms could be.</v>

5875
02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:52.000
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5876
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like this fish glows in the dark.</v>

5877
02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:54.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5878
02:27:54.101 --> 02:27:57.880
<v Speaker 2>You probably didn't think of this fish only exist in the infrared spectrum.</v>

5879
02:27:58.570 --> 02:28:00.190
<v Speaker 2>An Angler fish develop.</v>

5880
02:28:00.370 --> 02:28:01.870
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did that fish develop?</v>

5881
02:28:01.871 --> 02:28:04.630
<v Speaker 2>It has a fishing rod and as efficient rod and allure,</v>

5882
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:09.260
<v Speaker 2>it dangles a little lore and as the thing comes closed or fucking giant mall</v>

5883
02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.930
<v Speaker 2>opens up and sucks the fishing,</v>

5884
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:13.180
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing because it was created by some,</v>

5885
02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:15.160
<v Speaker 2>it was created by some alien point and clicks.</v>

5886
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.701
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5887
02:28:15.701 --> 02:28:17.260
<v Speaker 2>We are just their simulator and he's like,</v>

5888
02:28:17.261 --> 02:28:17.861
<v Speaker 2>let's try this.</v>

5889
02:28:17.861 --> 02:28:20.500
<v Speaker 2>A fish with a fucking lure on its head and see where that goes.</v>

5890
02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:22.460
<v Speaker 2>There's this who's a chess master</v>

5891
02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:26.630
<v Speaker 1>and he's a brilliant guy who plays blindfolded chess against like multiple</v>

5892
02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:27.464
<v Speaker 1>opponents.</v>

5893
02:28:27.470 --> 02:28:30.590
<v Speaker 1>It's Australian guy and he's also a creationist.</v>

5894
02:28:30.591 --> 02:28:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a really fascinating thing to see because he's obviously a super,</v>

5895
02:28:33.651 --> 02:28:37.370
<v Speaker 1>super brilliant guy and so many posted this a interview with this guy where he</v>

5896
02:28:37.371 --> 02:28:39.890
<v Speaker 1>was talking about how there's a,</v>

5897
02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:43.490
<v Speaker 1>what science doesn't account for with evolution doesn't account for it.</v>

5898
02:28:43.491 --> 02:28:45.770
<v Speaker 1>How does carbon molecule become a person?</v>

5899
02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:46.060
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5900
02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's just the,</v>

5901
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:48.290
<v Speaker 1>and their idea.</v>

5902
02:28:48.291 --> 02:28:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like this idea of the soul and all these different,</v>

5903
02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:51.791
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

5904
02:28:51.791 --> 02:28:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the complexity is too hard for them to grasp,</v>

5905
02:28:54.411 --> 02:28:55.400
<v Speaker 1>so it must be magic,</v>

5906
02:28:55.430 --> 02:28:55.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5907
02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.950
<v Speaker 1>It gets to some weird in due time,</v>

5908
02:28:57.951 --> 02:29:01.340
<v Speaker 1>science will help us perceive what we have to label as magic right now.</v>

5909
02:29:01.341 --> 02:29:02.174
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>

5910
02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:02.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

5911
02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:03.321
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

5912
02:29:03.321 --> 02:29:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that's the question we're not supposed to ever answer.</v>

5913
02:29:05.461 --> 02:29:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe we'll get to a certain point where we realized,</v>

5914
02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:08.541
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

5915
02:29:08.541 --> 02:29:12.440
<v Speaker 1>there is some sort of an inner code that's in escapable that that permeates the</v>

5916
02:29:12.441 --> 02:29:13.310
<v Speaker 1>entire universe.</v>

5917
02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:13.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5918
02:29:13.461 --> 02:29:15.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's string theory or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

5919
02:29:15.681 --> 02:29:16.040
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

5920
02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:19.130
<v Speaker 1>they find some frequency at the center of all that,</v>

5921
02:29:19.131 --> 02:29:19.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5922
02:29:19.371 --> 02:29:23.510
<v Speaker 1>accepts love and rejects negativity or video and that contact signal.</v>

5923
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:25.363
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5924
02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:26.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5925
02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:27.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5926
02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:27.321
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5927
02:29:27.321 --> 02:29:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It'd be different than that.</v>

5928
02:29:28.221 --> 02:29:28.870
<v Speaker 1>They heard the signal,</v>

5929
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:29.151
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

5930
02:29:29.151 --> 02:29:30.260
<v Speaker 1>and then the blind dude was like,</v>

5931
02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:30.531
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5932
02:29:30.531 --> 02:29:31.251
<v Speaker 1>I hear video.</v>

5933
02:29:31.251 --> 02:29:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And then they put it up to a monitor and it was Hitler and,</v>

5934
02:29:33.311 --> 02:29:33.601
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

5935
02:29:33.601 --> 02:29:34.011
<v Speaker 1>there's more.</v>

5936
02:29:34.011 --> 02:29:35.270
<v Speaker 1>This is interlaced information.</v>

5937
02:29:35.290 --> 02:29:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And they had the blueprints on how to build the travel thing.</v>

5938
02:29:37.131 --> 02:29:38.180
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly like that.</v>

5939
02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.340
<v Speaker 1>That was a fascinating movie.</v>

5940
02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't book was way better.</v>

5941
02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:40.940
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

5942
02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I never read the book was a way better.</v>

5943
02:29:42.291 --> 02:29:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it again was a bad motherfucker,</v>

5944
02:29:43.850 --> 02:29:44.540
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

5945

<v Speaker 1>Massive pothead for those of you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just a age son.</v>

02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about g on the Conan O'brien show,</v>

5954
02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:00.050
<v Speaker 1>which is cool by the way,</v>

5955
02:30:00.051 --> 02:30:04.790
<v Speaker 1>that that not only as the California association backed up medical marijuana,</v>

5956
02:30:04.910 --> 02:30:06.980
<v Speaker 1>but Dr Jay was Ancona and being asked,</v>

5957
02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:09.130
<v Speaker 1>do you backup medical marijuana?</v>

5958
02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:10.371
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

5959
02:30:10.371 --> 02:30:10.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5960
02:30:10.521 --> 02:30:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of slack from Joe Rogan about this.</v>

5961
02:30:12.861 --> 02:30:17.861
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why is because he started talking on his crazy CNN show about how</v>

5962
02:30:20.481 --> 02:30:25.481
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is much stronger than it was back in the day and how there's dangerous</v>

5963
02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:28.460
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal symptoms.</v>

5964
02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:29.241
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

5965
02:30:29.241 --> 02:30:30.140
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

5966
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Did he clarify that it might be cycled purely psychological?</v>

5967
02:30:32.910 --> 02:30:34.050
<v Speaker 1>This is always,</v>

5968
02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:34.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5969
02:30:34.910 --> 02:30:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how your body works,</v>

5970
02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:38.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure that if we'd got ya,</v>

5971
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:40.520
<v Speaker 1>it's cause we'd got there first.</v>

5972
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5973
02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it wasn't we'd that you got addicted to,</v>

5974
02:30:42.951 --> 02:30:47.400
<v Speaker 1>it could have been cheated or scratch tickets or Internet porn whenever plugs it</v>

5975
02:30:47.401 --> 02:30:47.940
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

5976
02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5977
02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And maybe for some people there's,</v>

5978
02:30:49.911 --> 02:30:54.650
<v Speaker 1>there's people that have extreme physical issues with all sorts of,</v>

5979
02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:54.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5980
02:30:54.890 --> 02:30:56.120
<v Speaker 1>altered states of consciousness.</v>

5981
02:30:56.270 --> 02:30:59.390
<v Speaker 1>There's people that literally must drink coffee all day long.</v>

5982
02:30:59.391 --> 02:31:00.920
<v Speaker 1>They must smoke cigarettes all day long.</v>

5983
02:31:00.921 --> 02:31:03.320
<v Speaker 1>They are constantly trying to change whatever state.</v>

5984
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And it could be an imbalance.</v>

5985
02:31:05.001 --> 02:31:06.530
<v Speaker 1>It could be some sort of an issue that they have.</v>

5986
02:31:06.570 --> 02:31:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I have witnessed it and many times with alcohol,</v>

5987
02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I know a certain people with drugs.</v>

5988
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:12.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5989
02:31:12.081 --> 02:31:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to Ron Bennington,</v>

5990
02:31:13.881 --> 02:31:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to Ron and Fez and,</v>

5991
02:31:15.741 --> 02:31:15.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5992
02:31:15.891 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Ron is a guy who's a in the program and he apparently he had</v>

5993
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.300
<v Speaker 5>a appendix and they wanted to give him pain killer pills and he was terrified</v>

5994
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:26.370
<v Speaker 5>and he's pretty sure he's got as addictions under control,</v>

5995
02:31:26.430 --> 02:31:27.780
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't want to take the chance.</v>

5996
02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:28.320
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5997
02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:28.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5998
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:32.730
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why is because he had a friend and this friend I believe you</v>

5999
02:31:32.731 --> 02:31:35.700
<v Speaker 5>said had been sober for 10 fucking years,</v>

6000
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:40.290
<v Speaker 5>had been working as a counselor in a place helping people stay sober,</v>

6001
02:31:40.350 --> 02:31:43.590
<v Speaker 5>stayed up in the Poconos so that he didn't have to go back around the same</v>

6002
02:31:43.591 --> 02:31:44.381
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood and be around.</v>

6003
02:31:44.381 --> 02:31:45.910
<v Speaker 5>This was working it as hard as you could.</v>

6004
02:31:45.911 --> 02:31:46.744
<v Speaker 5>It's there for 10 years,</v>

6005
02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:48.370
<v Speaker 5>gets it in some sort of an accident.</v>

6006
02:31:48.371 --> 02:31:49.111
<v Speaker 5>It has a back problem,</v>

6007
02:31:49.111 --> 02:31:49.441
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

6008
02:31:49.441 --> 02:31:50.430
<v Speaker 5>They put them on some pills,</v>

6009
02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:50.881
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>

6010
02:31:50.881 --> 02:31:51.571
<v Speaker 5>He's a junkie gun.</v>

6011
02:31:51.571 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6012
02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:52.651
<v Speaker 5>There's some people,</v>

6013
02:31:52.651 --> 02:31:52.861
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

6014
02:31:52.861 --> 02:31:53.640
<v Speaker 5>there's some people in,</v>

6015
02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:54.480
<v Speaker 5>there's no doubt about it.</v>

6016
02:31:54.481 --> 02:31:55.800
<v Speaker 5>And I would never discount that.</v>

6017
02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:57.330
<v Speaker 5>I would never discount that possibility.</v>

6018
02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:59.400
<v Speaker 5>But what they discount,</v>

6019
02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:01.470
<v Speaker 5>and this is my issue with all these doctor drew types,</v>

6020
02:32:01.471 --> 02:32:02.820
<v Speaker 5>is that they always have this sort of,</v>

6021
02:32:02.821 --> 02:32:03.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6022
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:04.680
<v Speaker 5>an I love doctor true by the way.</v>

6023
02:32:04.681 --> 02:32:05.580
<v Speaker 5>He's a really good guy.</v>

6024
02:32:05.610 --> 02:32:05.821
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6025
02:32:05.821 --> 02:32:06.241
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy.</v>

6026
02:32:06.241 --> 02:32:06.751
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy.</v>

6027
02:32:06.751 --> 02:32:07.830
<v Speaker 5>I really love him as a person.</v>

6028
02:32:07.831 --> 02:32:08.640
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

6029
02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:09.690
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing wrong with that guy.</v>

6030
02:32:09.691 --> 02:32:10.710
<v Speaker 5>He gets silly sometimes,</v>

6031
02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:11.820
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

6032
02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:14.820
<v Speaker 5>they discount the positive benefits of it.</v>

6033
02:32:14.821 --> 02:32:17.010
<v Speaker 5>And they make it as if it's a goof.</v>

6034
02:32:17.130 --> 02:32:18.780
<v Speaker 5>They make it like they go like,</v>

6035
02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:19.311
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

6036
02:32:19.311 --> 02:32:19.771
<v Speaker 5>I listen.</v>

6037
02:32:19.771 --> 02:32:22.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to stop you from smoking pot if you want a small pot,</v>

6038
02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:25.950
<v Speaker 5>forget about all the medical uses because the medical uses are many and they're</v>

6039
02:32:25.951 --> 02:32:27.390
<v Speaker 5>very varied in the very real,</v>

6040
02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:32.930
<v Speaker 5>the actual benefits of it for the human race are substantial,</v>

6041
02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:33.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6042
02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:37.020
<v Speaker 5>They're huge and they're not something you should just dismiss and diminish</v>

6043
02:32:37.170 --> 02:32:41.730
<v Speaker 5>because popular opinion is laced with the propaganda from 19 fucking thirties</v>

6044
02:32:41.731 --> 02:32:45.510
<v Speaker 5>and it has just in intwined itself into our culture to the point where people</v>

6045
02:32:45.511 --> 02:32:49.830
<v Speaker 5>believe all sorts of bullshit and nonsense about what is really an amazing</v>

6046
02:32:49.831 --> 02:32:50.970
<v Speaker 5>beneficial plant.</v>

6047
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.390
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6048
02:32:51.390 --> 02:32:53.760
<v Speaker 5>and maybe you can handle it and maybe you don't like it,</v>

6049
02:32:53.761 --> 02:32:55.650
<v Speaker 5>but to tell me that this thing,</v>

6050
02:32:55.651 --> 02:32:57.810
<v Speaker 5>this turbo charger for the imagination,</v>

6051
02:32:57.960 --> 02:33:00.960
<v Speaker 5>this thing that makes you more sensitive and makes you more loving and makes you</v>

6052
02:33:00.961 --> 02:33:01.711
<v Speaker 5>more friendly,</v>

6053
02:33:01.711 --> 02:33:02.820
<v Speaker 5>it makes food taste better,</v>

6054
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:03.511
<v Speaker 5>make sex,</v>

6055
02:33:03.511 --> 02:33:04.230
<v Speaker 5>tastes better.</v>

6056
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:05.520
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't harm you in any way.</v>

6057
02:33:05.521 --> 02:33:06.331
<v Speaker 5>You wake up in the morning,</v>

6058
02:33:06.331 --> 02:33:07.350
<v Speaker 5>you fucking feel great.</v>

6059
02:33:07.351 --> 02:33:08.840
<v Speaker 5>You don't feel hung over you.</v>

6060
02:33:08.850 --> 02:33:11.730
<v Speaker 5>You're telling me that this thing that I take in that does this is bad.</v>

6061
02:33:11.970 --> 02:33:14.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you it could fix the fucking world.</v>

6062
02:33:14.940 --> 02:33:16.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you what changes consciousness.</v>

6063
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:17.461
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you.</v>

6064
02:33:17.461 --> 02:33:18.480
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking tool,</v>

6065
02:33:18.481 --> 02:33:19.020
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

6066
02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:22.930
<v Speaker 5>It's a tool like a hammer or a fucking jackhammer or or or or,</v>

6067
02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.270
<v Speaker 5>or a laser beam.</v>

6068
02:33:24.271 --> 02:33:28.830
<v Speaker 5>It's anything I'll do you think he fundamentally think that he needs what the</v>

6069
02:33:28.831 --> 02:33:30.450
<v Speaker 5>world needs is a showman.</v>

6070
02:33:30.450 --> 02:33:31.320
<v Speaker 5>They need Sharman.</v>

6071
02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:35.040
<v Speaker 5>They need people who have experienced altered states of consciousness and not</v>

6072
02:33:35.041 --> 02:33:36.510
<v Speaker 5>only know how to navigate them,</v>

6073
02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:39.750
<v Speaker 5>can talk other people through them and do it on a professional level.</v>

6074
02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:43.080
<v Speaker 5>What they've done for thousands and thousands of years in the rain forest,</v>

6075
02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:45.810
<v Speaker 5>we need to apply not just with marijuana,</v>

6076
02:33:45.811 --> 02:33:49.050
<v Speaker 5>but all the different tools of consciousness including alcohol,</v>

6077
02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:52.080
<v Speaker 5>should have places with a teach you how to drink alcohol.</v>

6078
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:53.700
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy alcohol.</v>

6079
02:33:53.701 --> 02:33:54.331
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

6080
02:33:54.331 --> 02:33:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I like having a shot or two with my friends.</v>

6081
02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:57.390
<v Speaker 5>It makes me loose.</v>

6082
02:33:57.540 --> 02:33:58.650
<v Speaker 5>It makes me silly.</v>

6083
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:59.121
<v Speaker 5>I get,</v>

6084
02:33:59.121 --> 02:33:59.231
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6085
02:33:59.231 --> 02:34:01.230
<v Speaker 5>I start enjoying things a little bit more.</v>

6086
02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:02.130
<v Speaker 5>I want to dance.</v>

6087
02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:03.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's bad,</v>

6088
02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:06.690
<v Speaker 5>but I think there would be benefit so many fucking people.</v>

6089
02:34:06.691 --> 02:34:11.040
<v Speaker 5>If when you're 19 or 20 they took you to a fucking class where some smart,</v>

6090
02:34:11.041 --> 02:34:14.910
<v Speaker 5>interesting person taught you about drinking and give you some fucking things to</v>

6091
02:34:14.911 --> 02:34:15.660
<v Speaker 5>think about.</v>

6092
02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:16.710
<v Speaker 5>Here's what you need to think about.</v>

6093
02:34:16.850 --> 02:34:17.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6094
02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:18.490
<v Speaker 5>why don't you write down,</v>

6095
02:34:18.610 --> 02:34:19.210
<v Speaker 5>how about this?</v>

6096
02:34:19.210 --> 02:34:19.481
<v Speaker 5>You're a,</v>

6097
02:34:19.481 --> 02:34:20.350
<v Speaker 5>you're a new drinker.</v>

6098
02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:21.490
<v Speaker 5>Write down your iPhone.</v>

6099
02:34:21.491 --> 02:34:23.140
<v Speaker 5>Every time you have a drink is that hard?</v>

6100
02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Send yourself a text message.</v>

6101
02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:28.240
<v Speaker 5>Send a friend a text message every time you have a drink and he has to send you</v>

6102
02:34:28.241 --> 02:34:31.660
<v Speaker 5>a text message every time he has a drink so that you get like six,</v>

6103
02:34:31.661 --> 02:34:33.070
<v Speaker 5>seven drinks in from this guy.</v>

6104
02:34:33.310 --> 02:34:34.300
<v Speaker 5>You can call him up and go,</v>

6105
02:34:34.301 --> 02:34:34.631
<v Speaker 5>hey bro,</v>

6106
02:34:34.631 --> 02:34:35.530
<v Speaker 5>you should stop drinking.</v>

6107
02:34:35.770 --> 02:34:39.220
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] you texted me 45 minutes ago and you've had nine drinks.</v>

6108
02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:40.181
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck are you doing?</v>

6109
02:34:40.181 --> 02:34:40.811
<v Speaker 5>Who's watching you?</v>

6110
02:34:40.811 --> 02:34:40.991
<v Speaker 5>Who's,</v>

6111
02:34:40.991 --> 02:34:41.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6112
02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:41.951
<v Speaker 5>who's looking out for you?</v>

6113
02:34:41.951 --> 02:34:42.790
<v Speaker 5>Who's driving you home?</v>

6114
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.300
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6115
02:34:43.300 --> 02:34:44.050
<v Speaker 5>that's not a bad idea.</v>

6116
02:34:44.050 --> 02:34:44.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6117
02:34:44.201 --> 02:34:46.430
<v Speaker 4>you're teaching social responsibility with what's available.</v>

6118
02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Teach.</v>

6119
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:48.400
<v Speaker 4>It's its social responsibility,</v>

6120
02:34:48.401 --> 02:34:50.080
<v Speaker 4>but it's also shamanism.</v>

6121
02:34:50.270 --> 02:34:50.801
<v Speaker 4>The got it.</v>

6122
02:34:50.801 --> 02:34:53.330
<v Speaker 4>But the idea of beating disagrees with it.</v>

6123
02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:53.441
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6124
02:34:53.441 --> 02:34:53.571
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6125
02:34:53.571 --> 02:34:53.710
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

6126
02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:54.310
<v Speaker 4>He does it.</v>

6127
02:34:54.310 --> 02:34:58.430
<v Speaker 4>We actually had yesterday that we went through all the entire stuff that Dr drew</v>

6128
02:34:58.431 --> 02:35:00.880
<v Speaker 4>has said about marijuana all in a row.</v>

6129
02:35:00.881 --> 02:35:02.390
<v Speaker 4>And we ended up with a white,</v>

6130
02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:03.460
<v Speaker 4>he said on Conan,</v>

6131
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:04.271
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

6132
02:35:04.271 --> 02:35:08.350
<v Speaker 4>he's actually saying that that one of the biggest things right now is that</v>

6133
02:35:08.351 --> 02:35:10.150
<v Speaker 4>there's people that get addicted to marijuana.</v>

6134
02:35:10.151 --> 02:35:12.700
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana is addictive to people and that,</v>

6135
02:35:12.730 --> 02:35:14.620
<v Speaker 4>and then if you look at physically though,</v>

6136
02:35:14.621 --> 02:35:15.040
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

6137
02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:15.821
<v Speaker 4>it's addictive.</v>

6138
02:35:15.821 --> 02:35:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Like jerking lofts addictive,</v>

6139
02:35:17.470 --> 02:35:17.801
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6140
02:35:17.801 --> 02:35:18.340
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

6141
02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:22.030
<v Speaker 4>one of the biggest things right now that's filling a hospital room or hospitals</v>

6142
02:35:22.031 --> 02:35:23.140
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like that is people,</v>

6143
02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:23.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6144
02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:26.290
<v Speaker 4>freaking out on marijuana and stuff like that and that you have,</v>

6145
02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:27.183
<v Speaker 4>one of the things,</v>

6146
02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:31.220
<v Speaker 4>the hospital room people having panic attacks and going to hospitals is,</v>

6147
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:33.900
<v Speaker 4>but it's big and they want to say in that,</v>

6148
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:34.743
<v Speaker 4>cause that I'd happen to him,</v>

6149
02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:38.320
<v Speaker 4>he got pull over to the side of the road and call an ambulance.</v>

6150
02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:39.011
<v Speaker 4>But that's not true.</v>

6151
02:35:39.011 --> 02:35:40.210
<v Speaker 4>That's 100% not true.</v>

6152
02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6153
02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:41.501
<v Speaker 4>here's actually,</v>

6154
02:35:41.501 --> 02:35:42.670
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't high at all when it happened,</v>

6155
02:35:42.730 --> 02:35:44.110
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>

6156
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:46.750
<v Speaker 4>it drew has to say this could happen.</v>

6157
02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:47.591
<v Speaker 4>It has to do as a,</v>

6158
02:35:47.591 --> 02:35:48.424
<v Speaker 4>as a physician.</v>

6159
02:35:48.660 --> 02:35:49.070
<v Speaker 4>What he,</v>

6160
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:52.220
<v Speaker 4>what he's saying that that's one of his biggest things that he treats his,</v>

6161
02:35:52.221 --> 02:35:54.430
<v Speaker 4>his medical marijuana Dixon.</v>

6162
02:35:54.431 --> 02:35:59.170
<v Speaker 4>So what he was saying is that it is addictive too because people do get addicted</v>

6163
02:35:59.171 --> 02:36:00.850
<v Speaker 4>because he has to deal with it all the time.</v>

6164
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Now he's saying he's for medical marijuana.</v>

6165
02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:04.691
<v Speaker 4>He says that,</v>

6166
02:36:04.691 --> 02:36:07.030
<v Speaker 4>that especially now that after this thing,</v>

6167
02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:07.840
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

6168
02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:08.680
<v Speaker 4>but to Joe's point there,</v>

6169
02:36:08.681 --> 02:36:10.220
<v Speaker 4>it is addictive though.</v>

6170
02:36:10.270 --> 02:36:11.590
<v Speaker 4>If there was a showman,</v>

6171
02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:14.920
<v Speaker 4>whether it's yourself or doctor drew or the fucking Internet that said,</v>

6172
02:36:14.921 --> 02:36:15.370
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

6173
02:36:15.370 --> 02:36:16.690
<v Speaker 4>this can be addictive.</v>

6174
02:36:16.691 --> 02:36:17.441
<v Speaker 4>Here's what happens.</v>

6175
02:36:17.441 --> 02:36:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Instead of it's either going to be reefer madness or it's the greatest thing</v>

6176
02:36:19.901 --> 02:36:20.051
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

6177
02:36:20.051 --> 02:36:20.231
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6178
02:36:20.231 --> 02:36:21.180
<v Speaker 4>you need to balance the approach.</v>

6179
02:36:21.181 --> 02:36:21.971
<v Speaker 4>You need to educate people.</v>

6180
02:36:21.971 --> 02:36:26.971
<v Speaker 4>I think we all know somebody that spends over $40 a day on marijuana probably.</v>

6181
02:36:27.341 --> 02:36:27.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6182
02:36:27.470 --> 02:36:31.980
<v Speaker 4>I know a few people that fucking just go to the store and just fucking spend a</v>

6183
02:36:31.981 --> 02:36:33.570
<v Speaker 4>shitload of money every single day.</v>

6184
02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:34.810
<v Speaker 5>Smokes that money.</v>

6185
02:36:34.930 --> 02:36:36.490
<v Speaker 5>This is misses the current study.</v>

6186
02:36:36.491 --> 02:36:40.390
<v Speaker 5>The current study believe they believe that 10% of recreational users will</v>

6187
02:36:40.391 --> 02:36:43.750
<v Speaker 5>develop problems severe enough to impair their work and relationships.</v>

6188
02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:45.010
<v Speaker 5>Very simple.</v>

6189
02:36:45.130 --> 02:36:48.940
<v Speaker 5>Take the money that they would make from taxes,</v>

6190
02:36:48.970 --> 02:36:50.470
<v Speaker 5>from marijuana if it was legal.</v>

6191
02:36:50.471 --> 02:36:51.220
<v Speaker 5>I've always said,</v>

6192
02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:52.750
<v Speaker 5>if you want to have marijuana illegal,</v>

6193
02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:53.620
<v Speaker 5>just how about this?</v>

6194
02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:55.270
<v Speaker 5>You want to give people an incentive,</v>

6195
02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:59.410
<v Speaker 5>make it tax it higher than everything else tat give it a tax like Dee did to</v>

6196
02:36:59.411 --> 02:37:00.280
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes or alcohol,</v>

6197
02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:00.520
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6198
02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:04.900
<v Speaker 5>To give it a attacks and then take a portion of that and use it for treatment</v>

6199
02:37:04.901 --> 02:37:09.901
<v Speaker 5>centers for these 10% that have wacky fucking genes or whatever it is,</v>

6200
02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:10.490
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6201
02:37:10.490 --> 02:37:11.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

6202
02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.250
<v Speaker 5>but for most of us,</v>

6203
02:37:12.251 --> 02:37:13.690
<v Speaker 5>it's not physically addictive,</v>

6204
02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:16.310
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people like to escape man,</v>

6205
02:37:16.311 --> 02:37:19.790
<v Speaker 5>and they like this escape with video games and if they don't escape with video</v>

6206
02:37:19.791 --> 02:37:20.001
<v Speaker 5>games,</v>

6207
02:37:20.001 --> 02:37:20.870
<v Speaker 5>they like the escape with weed.</v>

6208
02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:24.620
<v Speaker 5>I had been addicted to things before that aren't addictive like video games.</v>

6209
02:37:24.770 --> 02:37:26.030
<v Speaker 5>I've been addicted to playing pool.</v>

6210
02:37:26.031 --> 02:37:27.260
<v Speaker 5>I've been addicted to working out.</v>

6211
02:37:27.261 --> 02:37:31.250
<v Speaker 5>I've been addicted to several things in my life that were impulses,</v>

6212
02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:32.060
<v Speaker 5>masturbation,</v>

6213
02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:34.820
<v Speaker 5>I've had moments in my life special and as a young man were,</v>

6214
02:37:34.821 --> 02:37:35.091
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6215
02:37:35.091 --> 02:37:35.811
<v Speaker 5>you'd masturbate.</v>

6216
02:37:35.811 --> 02:37:37.010
<v Speaker 5>Like how many of you ever done that?</v>

6217
02:37:37.011 --> 02:37:37.371
<v Speaker 5>Like master,</v>

6218
02:37:37.371 --> 02:37:38.120
<v Speaker 5>when you don't even Horny,</v>

6219
02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:40.460
<v Speaker 5>meanwhile you're beaten off like for the third or fourth time in the day.</v>

6220
02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:41.750
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

6221
02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:47.390
<v Speaker 5>There's a difference I think between when you have a fucked up life and you,</v>

6222
02:37:47.420 --> 02:37:50.990
<v Speaker 5>you don't have discipline and you don't have like,</v>

6223
02:37:51.390 --> 02:37:52.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6224
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:54.680
<v Speaker 5>the ability to be objective about your body,</v>

6225
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:56.840
<v Speaker 5>you'd be able to ability to be objective about your mind.</v>

6226
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:58.940
<v Speaker 5>How much organization have you done?</v>

6227
02:37:58.941 --> 02:37:59.990
<v Speaker 5>Do you do meditation?</v>

6228
02:37:59.991 --> 02:38:02.420
<v Speaker 5>Do you do any self reflecting time?</v>

6229
02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:06.030
<v Speaker 5>Will you sit down and look at your whole life as a whole?</v>

6230
02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:06.381
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6231
02:38:06.381 --> 02:38:06.980
<v Speaker 5>if you don't,</v>

6232
02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:11.090
<v Speaker 5>then sometimes you get washed up in some crazy wave of momentum and then you</v>

6233
02:38:11.091 --> 02:38:12.230
<v Speaker 5>become obsessive with things.</v>

6234
02:38:12.231 --> 02:38:13.064
<v Speaker 5>At least me,</v>

6235
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:14.300
<v Speaker 5>I find myself,</v>

6236
02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:14.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6237
02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:18.470
<v Speaker 5>my most vulnerable when the rest of my life is out of order and chaotic when the</v>

6238
02:38:18.471 --> 02:38:19.820
<v Speaker 5>rest of my life is like a bunch of shit.</v>

6239
02:38:19.821 --> 02:38:21.680
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not dealing with fucking bills.</v>

6240
02:38:21.681 --> 02:38:22.514
<v Speaker 5>I'm not paying and all that.</v>

6241
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:24.860
<v Speaker 5>That's when I'll find myself beating off three times a day.</v>

6242
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:28.190
<v Speaker 5>That's when I find myself can't walk away from the computer because I want to</v>

6243
02:38:28.191 --> 02:38:29.630
<v Speaker 5>fucking play video games online.</v>

6244
02:38:29.631 --> 02:38:32.240
<v Speaker 5>All all you smoke more during those periods though or no,</v>

6245
02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:33.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't do any of that anymore.</v>

6246
02:38:33.850 --> 02:38:37.610
<v Speaker 5>And all this was back before I even smoked weed and smoke weed anymore.</v>

6247
02:38:37.850 --> 02:38:38.121
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6248
02:38:38.121 --> 02:38:38.954

6249
02:38:39.050 --> 02:38:40.760
<v Speaker 5>stopped so that can have guns and those guns.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I want to keep my guns.</v>

6253
02:38:41.961 --> 02:38:42.794

6262
02:38:53.841 --> 02:38:54.710
<v Speaker 5>when I pulled over,</v>

<v Speaker 2>She showed them a picture.</v>

6334
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:35.050
<v Speaker 2>They showed a picture of her a yesterday where she looks like a skeleton like</v>

6335
02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:39.600
<v Speaker 2>and she just looks like whatever magic she was using for the last 20 years.</v>

6336
02:40:40.410 --> 02:40:41.243
<v Speaker 2>They finally caught up.</v>

6337

<v Speaker 2>This is going to take more Mona but fuck it.</v>

6338

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to catch this sexy style</v>

6339
02:40:49.550 --> 02:40:51.690
<v Speaker 2>like Charlie Sheen's penis.</v>

6340
02:40:51.691 --> 02:40:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

6341
02:40:51.930 --> 02:40:54.630
<v Speaker 2>if you look at him and you can't blame Ashton crashed and ran,</v>

6342
02:40:55.020 --> 02:40:57.540
<v Speaker 2>you can't blame Ashton for going out and getting some on the side.</v>

6343
02:40:57.541 --> 02:40:57.990
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

6344
02:40:57.990 --> 02:41:00.000
<v Speaker 2>do you think that's had an open relationship though?</v>

6345
02:41:00.010 --> 02:41:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Like I heard it.</v>

6346
02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:01.111
<v Speaker 2>That's totally allowed,</v>

6347
02:41:01.111 --> 02:41:03.450
<v Speaker 2>but he just picked women that were being vocal about it and it was like,</v>

6348
02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

6349
02:41:03.690 --> 02:41:04.350
<v Speaker 2>can't do this anymore.</v>

6350
02:41:04.350 --> 02:41:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

6351
02:41:04.580 --> 02:41:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6352
02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:06.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6353
02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:07.880
<v Speaker 1>let me see how I can phrase this.</v>

6354
02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:08.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6355
02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend and this friend may or may not have worked on the movie Gi Jane</v>

6356
02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:14.780
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and uh,</v>

6357
02:41:14.781 --> 02:41:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you know that movie to me more than it.</v>

6358
02:41:17.150 --> 02:41:19.370
<v Speaker 1>This friend who may or may not have worked on this,</v>

6359
02:41:19.371 --> 02:41:21.830
<v Speaker 1>may or may not have had to me grab his cock one night,</v>

6360
02:41:21.980 --> 02:41:22.813
<v Speaker 1>ted Danson.</v>

6361
02:41:23.270 --> 02:41:23.890
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6362
02:41:23.890 --> 02:41:24.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6363
02:41:24.001 --> 02:41:24.834
<v Speaker 1>good try.</v>

6364
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So if that was possible,</v>

6365
02:41:27.141 --> 02:41:28.250
<v Speaker 1>if that was real,</v>

6366
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:29.623
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

6367
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that might very well way street.</v>

6368
02:41:31.580 --> 02:41:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably together in Gi Jane.</v>

6369
02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:34.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6370
02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:34.510
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6371
02:41:34.510 --> 02:41:35.540
<v Speaker 1>But Bruce Willis,</v>

6372
02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:37.313
<v Speaker 1>that's probably,</v>

6373
02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:39.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that roll that way.</v>

6374

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be in a relationship.</v>

6400
02:42:13.401 --> 02:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

6405
02:42:17.781 --> 02:42:18.070
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

6406
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:19.780
<v Speaker 1>we have a buddy Ari Shaffir who,</v>

6407
02:42:19.781 --> 02:42:20.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6408
02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:25.040
<v Speaker 1>was in an open marriage and his wife would go on dates and then come home and</v>

6409
02:42:25.041 --> 02:42:27.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about how guys fucked her and stuff.</v>

6410
02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:29.560
<v Speaker 1>He should really do material on that.</v>

6411
02:42:29.610 --> 02:42:30.411
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't he do material?</v>

6412
02:42:30.411 --> 02:42:30.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6413
02:42:30.561 --> 02:42:31.281

02:42:31.281 --> 02:42:31.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6415
02:42:31.890 --> 02:42:32.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

6416
02:42:32.211 --> 02:42:32.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe he doesn't want it.</v>

6417
02:42:32.810 --> 02:42:33.643
<v Speaker 2>The world.</v>

6418
02:42:36.410 --> 02:42:37.430
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about Ted Danson.</v>

02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6420

6422
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:41.210

6423
02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:42.513
<v Speaker 2>They were the thing.</v>

6424

<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

6425
02:42:44.221 --> 02:42:44.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6426
02:42:44.461 --> 02:42:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to ask him about that.</v>

6427
02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say no.</v>

6428
02:42:47.010 --> 02:42:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I already said too much as it is.</v>

6429
02:42:48.450 --> 02:42:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he said it before.</v>

6430
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6431
02:42:49.610 --> 02:42:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6433
02:42:50.130 --> 02:42:50.341
<v Speaker 1>Before.</v>

6434
02:42:50.341 --> 02:42:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have said if you hadn't said it,</v>

6435
02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:52.081
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

6436
02:42:52.081 --> 02:42:53.340
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy or he's crazy,</v>

6437
02:42:53.341 --> 02:42:53.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6438
02:42:53.641 --> 02:42:55.380
<v Speaker 1>or ours wild motherfucker though.</v>

6439
02:42:55.381 --> 02:42:55.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6440
02:42:55.741 --> 02:42:55.971
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

6441
02:42:55.971 --> 02:42:56.804
<v Speaker 1>he will,</v>

6442
02:42:57.090 --> 02:42:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6443
02:42:57.570 --> 02:42:59.100
<v Speaker 2>what makes you say it's too hard though?</v>

6444
02:42:59.101 --> 02:42:59.934
<v Speaker 2>Just out of curiosity.</v>

6445
02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:00.541
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6446
02:43:00.541 --> 02:43:01.374
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

6447
02:43:02.930 --> 02:43:03.640
<v Speaker 2>for men,</v>

6448
02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

6449
02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:05.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a look,</v>

6450
02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:06.040
<v Speaker 1>legitimately.</v>

6451
02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe that that's how human beings existed a long time ago.</v>

6452
02:43:10.571 --> 02:43:12.400
<v Speaker 1>That that's the mushroom orgies.</v>

6453
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.851
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6454
02:43:12.851 --> 02:43:13.840
<v Speaker 5>the idea of,</v>

6455
02:43:13.841 --> 02:43:14.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6456
02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:14.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6457
02:43:14.501 --> 02:43:17.140
<v Speaker 5>these orgiastic groups of,</v>

6458
02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:17.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6459
02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:22.120
<v Speaker 5>free sex monkeys that existed millions of years ago.</v>

6460
02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.301
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6461
02:43:22.301 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 5>Mckenna had that whole thing that he believed that,</v>

6462
02:43:25.260 --> 02:43:25.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6463
02:43:25.511 --> 02:43:27.100
<v Speaker 5>and it really,</v>

6464
02:43:27.101 --> 02:43:27.934
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6465
02:43:28.270 --> 02:43:32.440
<v Speaker 5>the idea behind it is that at one point in time mushrooms were a huge part of</v>

6466
02:43:32.441 --> 02:43:35.230
<v Speaker 5>human diets and they were part of all these rituals and people would get</v>

6467
02:43:35.231 --> 02:43:38.380
<v Speaker 5>together and eat them and they would have these orgies and have all this parties</v>

6468
02:43:38.381 --> 02:43:39.214
<v Speaker 5>and have a good time.</v>

6469
02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:41.740
<v Speaker 5>And that slowly but surely the climate change,</v>

6470
02:43:41.741 --> 02:43:45.730
<v Speaker 5>the mushrooms became more and more rare and they were hoarded by the elites and</v>

6471
02:43:45.731 --> 02:43:48.010
<v Speaker 5>then they were also kept from other people.</v>

6472
02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:52.840
<v Speaker 5>And then the sort of this orgiastic communal society that we had this</v>

6473
02:43:52.841 --> 02:43:54.250
<v Speaker 5>matriarchal society by the way,</v>

6474
02:43:54.251 --> 02:43:56.510
<v Speaker 5>that worship the mother and we're shipping the mother earth and you know,</v>

6475
02:43:56.540 --> 02:43:59.560
<v Speaker 5>which mushrooms sort of tend to like put you in tune with that frequency.</v>

6476
02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:02.950
<v Speaker 5>That all dissolved as a climate change.</v>

6477
02:44:02.951 --> 02:44:05.920
<v Speaker 5>And he actually documents it down to them taking mushrooms and putting them in</v>

6478
02:44:05.921 --> 02:44:09.030
<v Speaker 5>honey and that the honey became psychoactive as well because honey,</v>

6479
02:44:09.031 --> 02:44:12.400
<v Speaker 5>when it ferments becomes mead and then you have a completely polar opposite</v>

6480
02:44:12.401 --> 02:44:12.861
<v Speaker 5>society.</v>

6481
02:44:12.861 --> 02:44:14.470
<v Speaker 5>You have an alcohol based society,</v>

6482
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6483
02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:17.140
<v Speaker 5>inflates the ego,</v>

6484
02:44:17.710 --> 02:44:22.000
<v Speaker 5>diminishes objectivity and self awareness or diminishes the feelings of,</v>

6485
02:44:22.210 --> 02:44:23.043
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6486
02:44:23.050 --> 02:44:23.890

6487
02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:26.000
