1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I could keep it in check for three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>and we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for doing this.</v>

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a big fan of your work for a </v>

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>long time and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you bring up some really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects and we were talking right </v>

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.091
<v Speaker 1>before the podcast about social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how weird it is that you got lumped </v>

9
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.641
<v Speaker 1>in with the outright for a comment </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something along the lines of that</v>

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>you find what was the exact quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>something along the highly intelligent </v>

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>people seem to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not saying they're good people.</v>

12
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

13
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.491
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorant to the outright equate them </v>

14
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>the skinheads and the Neo Nazis carrying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Tiki torches.</v>

16
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 2>But when I was referring strictly to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>outright from its origin in internet </v>

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 2>discussion groups and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

18
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know some of them,</v>

19
00:00:55.651 --> 00:01:00.651
<v Speaker 2>some of them are former students and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are highly intelligent and </v>

20
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 2>highly read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

21
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

22
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what people often think </v>
<v Speaker 2>of when they think of the alt right.</v>

23
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I was referring to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly,</v>

24
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 2>there are people in tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some people in universities is </v>

25
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 2>stay under cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

26
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 2>made some remarks on how to starve that </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

28
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 2>not how to feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

29
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>so many people jumped on it as if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were endorsing the alt right.</v>

30
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>It was the exact quote you were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically saying something along the </v>

31
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>lines of there's a lot of intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are involved in this.</v>

32
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't so much that it was also that </v>

33
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 2>because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the various taboos in mainstream </v>

35
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 2>intellectual culture because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness,</v>

36
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of not discussable,</v>

37
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 2>but then when people in the outright </v>
<v Speaker 2>discover them,</v>

38
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:45.891
<v Speaker 2>they feel tremendously empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we are now privy to the truth that </v>

39
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 2>the establishment can't handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't handle the truth.</v>

40
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And since it was never discussed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>

41
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 2>there are no counterarguments to some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most toxic interpretations.</v>

42
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 2>And so the outright can run with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>never having been in a forum where these</v>

43
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 2>things that are debated and criticized </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put it into context,</v>

44
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 2>they take like one fact and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw the most extreme conclusions.</v>

45
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 2>If these things were debated in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place,</v>

46
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 2>then you'd realize that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions are not warranted.</v>

47
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

48
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean an example is there are average </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences between men and women and a </v>

49
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 2>lot of psychological traits now if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

50
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's often quite taboo in </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual circles for I think bizarre</v>

51
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:28.791
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to get people who think that </v>

52
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 2>somehow women's rights depend on men and</v>
<v Speaker 2>women being indistinguishable.</v>

53
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bad equation in the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

54
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you come across the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that men and women on average are,</v>

55
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.090
<v Speaker 2>are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also come across the fact that men </v>

56
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 2>and women overlap in a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>traits that whatever trait you name,</v>

57
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 2>that men on average are better at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>women or vice versa.</v>

58
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of women who are better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than a lot of men or vice versa,</v>

59
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 2>and so you can't really judge an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual from the average of,</v>

60
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

61
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sex.</v>

62
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though there are some traits where </v>

63
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.251
<v Speaker 2>men score a little better than women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there some traits were women score a </v>

64
00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>little better than men and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the complete picture.</v>

65
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is that if the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject is out of bounds,</v>

66
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 2>you never get to present the complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

67
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>And some people run away with all men </v>
<v Speaker 2>and women are totally different.</v>

68
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>What are your thoughts on how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject got out of bounds?</v>

69
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very confusing to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain subjects like the differences </v>

70
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>between genders are so taboo when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem so obvious.</v>

71
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:31.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just could go to a mall and just </v>

72
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:31.850
<v Speaker 1>look at the way the men dress and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>women dress and you go,</v>

73
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some obvious distinctions here.</v>

74
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a history to it because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

75
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of khaki,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe theories and the 19th century,</v>

76
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:45.241
<v Speaker 2>and in a lot of the 20th century that </v>
<v Speaker 2>men were intellectual and women were not</v>

77
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:50.371
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women were governed by their emotions </v>

78
00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:52.121
<v Speaker 2>and their women thought too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would take blood away from their </v>

79
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.871
<v Speaker 2>ovaries and their womb and they wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be fertile and then they'd be all </v>

80
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:55.871
<v Speaker 2>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really like crazy stuff.</v>

81
00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And as a reaction to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the seventies when the second wave of</v>

82
00:04:00.201 --> 00:04:05.201
<v Speaker 2>feminism became prominent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became almost an article of faith </v>

83
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:06.350
<v Speaker 2>that there were no differences between </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women.</v>

84
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you say that there are </v>

85
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>differences between men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sending women back to the,</v>

86
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 2>to the kitchen in the nursery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a total non sequitur because </v>

87
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.960
<v Speaker 2>fairness is not the same as sameness.</v>

88
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.960
<v Speaker 2>So obviously women should have equal </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights to men,</v>

89
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.820
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they're exact copies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>men or have a distinctive profile as men</v>

90
00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:28.520
<v Speaker 2>have a distinct profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's just a mistake to,</v>

91
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to conflate the issue of women's rights </v>

92
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 2>with men and women being identical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the way it kind of shook out </v>

93
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.720
<v Speaker 2>and it became kind of an article of </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith in a,</v>

94
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.320
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some feminist,</v>

95
00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:45.770
<v Speaker 2>some kind of left liberal circles that </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women have to be identical.</v>

96
00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:47.870
<v Speaker 2>And if they aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you're a trader you to,</v>

97
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.160
<v Speaker 2>to a women's equality.</v>

98
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the articles of faith are always </v>

99
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous,</v>

100
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.091
<v Speaker 1>especially in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's articles of fairness are always </v>

101
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:57.091
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

102
00:04:57.091 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>fair being fair to each other and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair is also recognizing differences.</v>

103
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.960
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not assuming that any differences a </v>

104
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.181
<v Speaker 2>deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really doing an honest </v>

105
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>comparison of the differences between </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women,</v>

106
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.230
<v Speaker 2>men wouldn't come out looking so good.</v>

107
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

108
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole bit about that in my act </v>

109
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>when we're looking at the reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this though.</v>

110
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.520
<v Speaker 1>What was strange to me was how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people seemed like they wanted to jump </v>

111
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.481
<v Speaker 1>on board and criticize you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of it is almost like </v>

112
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>to take away some of the potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of themselves,</v>

113
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:35.491
<v Speaker 1>like it's instant claiming of the moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>high ground virtue signaling and it's </v>

114
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:40.231
<v Speaker 1>just very disappointing when you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this from intellectuals and college </v>

115
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>professors and it should know better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

116
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be fair,</v>

117
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I did not get into much trouble from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

118
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my peers and among the professors and </v>

119
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Grad students and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a couple of trolls who,</v>

120
00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:50.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

121
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 2>who ran with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by and large,</v>

122
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream reaction was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is almost a sign of a,</v>

123
00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:57.480
<v Speaker 2>as a New York Times put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that social is made</v>

124
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.540
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:01.480
<v Speaker 1>That was the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of the title of the article and</v>

126
00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:01.870
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

127
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was by and large,</v>

128
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I came out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

130
00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:10.981
<v Speaker 2>But it was a real indication of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>these mobs of outrage can corrupt any </v>

131
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:11.920
<v Speaker 2>kind of intelligence</v>

132
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.960
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle discussions,</v>

134
00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:19.881
<v Speaker 1>the discussions that involve nuanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated issues that are there.</v>

135
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.210
<v Speaker 1>They're complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They require a long dis sort of </v>

136
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.110
<v Speaker 1>description of the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>

137
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll a very complex sort of take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these various differences between men </v>

138
00:06:35.221 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>and women and the alt right and the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political director.</v>

139
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.590
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are long discussions.</v>

140
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean these aren't something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can smash into a very short sound </v>

141
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.790
<v Speaker 1>soundbite and completely cover your take</v>
<v Speaker 1>on things</v>

142
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>hold the more reason that they shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be taboo because if you can't discuss </v>

143
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>them then the only interpretation you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have as the simplistic one.</v>

144
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:59.451
<v Speaker 2>If you could bring them out in the open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can start to have that </v>

145
00:06:59.451 --> 00:06:59.451
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

146
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that this is turning around.</v>

147
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that what's happened is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage culture,</v>

148
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.950
<v Speaker 1>the outrage culture has become almost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>parody of itself has gotten so </v>

149
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.311
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous that people will sort of shy </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from outrage seemingly like the </v>

150
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:18.041
<v Speaker 1>same reason why people are terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the differences between </v>

151
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:24.281
<v Speaker 1>men and women is because they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be grouped into the people that </v>

152
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:28.410
<v Speaker 1>literally are legitimately rather were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist in the,</v>

153
00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:29.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 1>the 19 hundreds and the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people that did have these </v>

155
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.511
<v Speaker 1>terrible ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we're trying to go so far away </v>

156
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>from that that we've become a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and I'm hoping things,</v>

157
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping it's a swing and they'll just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of bounce back towards the middle </v>

158
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

159
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

160
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 2>there is some hope that that would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie medium is new,</v>

161
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Speaker 2>there'll be these excesses and it takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile for the system to kind of re re </v>

162
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 2>equilibrate to have an immune response </v>
<v Speaker 2>that damps down the worst of it.</v>

163
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on the Internet a long time </v>

164
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.501
<v Speaker 2>and in the eighties when it was mainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>academics and computer scientists who </v>

165
00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 2>are on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are these discussion groups.</v>

166
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:11.501
<v Speaker 2>This was before the worldwide web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was all text and there's this </v>

167
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 2>concept of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of flaming.</v>

168
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the word is all days.</v>

169
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came from the,</v>

170
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:22.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an award given a jokey award </v>

171
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>called it the flaming asshole award.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

172
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

173
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

174
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

175
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 2>the worst insult or in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual discussions.</v>

176
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:31.270
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

177
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

178
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 2>the trophy was supposedly his bestest </v>
<v Speaker 2>cork,</v>

179
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 2>but from the flaming asshole award there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the,</v>

180
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

181
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>the flame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adjective flame wars,</v>

182
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.040
<v Speaker 2>the verb to flame dam down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As people became aware of flaming as a </v>

183
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon in the discussion groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

184
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:55.481
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not turn this into a flame war or </v>

185
00:08:55.481 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 2>in flames.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when people realized that this was a</v>

186
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

187
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.550
<v Speaker 3>then they could push back against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let's hope that that happens with </v>

188
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.550
<v Speaker 3>this social media again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

189
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.111
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a sport in like the late </v>

190
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:06.111
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early two thousands.</v>

191
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 3>It was essentially like an online </v>
<v Speaker 3>support.</v>

192
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Like someone would say something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you'd go,</v>

193
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how do I attack this?</v>

194
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.520
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was more fun than anything.</v>

195
00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:20.521
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like there was very few </v>
<v Speaker 3>people relatively speaking,</v>

196
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:26.091
<v Speaker 3>involved in discussion groups back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like the mass amount of </v>

197
00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:30.201
<v Speaker 3>people that are on social media now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly like everyone is in some </v>

198
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:34.251
<v Speaker 3>form of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or most people are in some form of </v>

199
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:34.251
<v Speaker 3>social media now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas back then,</v>

200
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 3>the number of people that were on </v>
<v Speaker 3>message boards was so small.</v>

201
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So smell.</v>

202
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.040
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're right there.</v>

203
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.060
<v Speaker 3>There is an art form of ritual insults </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Shakespeare and you know,</v>

204
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 3>African American snapping a there when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people realize that this is a sport that</v>

205
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 3>no one gets hurt.</v>

206
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like martial arts,</v>

208
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.690
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is that when it goes out </v>

209
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 3>of control and it really does attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's reputations and then you've got</v>

210
00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:02.061
<v Speaker 3>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a thing in comedy called roast </v>

211
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:02.061
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

212
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:02.061
<v Speaker 3>Roasting another example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

213
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Roast battle is this,</v>

214
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:09.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this great show that they do at the </v>

215
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 3>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every Tuesday we're,</v>

216
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 3>comedians will prepare insults against </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

217
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.210
<v Speaker 3>But my friend Brian Moses who hosts it </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of everything,</v>

218
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.770
<v Speaker 3>they always hug it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

219
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always like,</v>

220
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a joke,</v>

221
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 3>writing exercise and a fun joke writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>show and no one really,</v>

222
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 3>no one means any of this and not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

223
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.930
<v Speaker 3>It hugs me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a,</v>

224
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 3>like a professional boxing or ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting yourself.</v>

225
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 3>So whatever you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are rules,</v>

226
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 3>there's an arena and when you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

227
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't plot revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes people can misunderstand </v>

228
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.741
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that famous press roast where a </v>

229
00:10:48.741 --> 00:10:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Obama had some fun at the expense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump when he was still just a a,</v>

230
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:57.070
<v Speaker 3>a reality show and you could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>famously the camera zoomed in on trump </v>

231
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 3>and he was not abused at jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at his expense.</v>

232
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a theory that one of the reasons</v>

233
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 3>that he plotted his presidential run was</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

234
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 3>was to get revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

235
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that Obama said</v>
<v Speaker 3>during that roast,</v>

236
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:13.071
<v Speaker 3>and here's one of the things that I am </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you'll never be president of the </v>

237
00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 3>United States and crazy and cheered on </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

238
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:19.431
<v Speaker 3>We could have turned out very </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently if he hadn't made that one </v>

239
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:19.431
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing,</v>

240
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:19.431
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

241
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:23.871
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he had been thinking about </v>

242
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:23.871
<v Speaker 3>being president for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time,</v>

243
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 3>but that might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might have been the straw that broke the</v>

244
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 3>camel's back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Barack,</v>

245
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:33.021
<v Speaker 3>what have you done when you see social </v>
<v Speaker 3>media today,</v>

246
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:40.131
<v Speaker 3>like as a psychologist and you see this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that people do when they can </v>

247
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 3>behave anonymously in the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>social cues,</v>

248
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.330
<v Speaker 3>not in front of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

249
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 3>not seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the cruel things hurt each other.</v>

250
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.220
<v Speaker 3>How does that make you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that this is just an </v>

251
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.220
<v Speaker 3>unnatural</v>

252
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>way of communicating?</v>

253
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something.</v>

254
00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 2>The anonymity is certainly a natural and</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed face to face contact.</v>

255
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.210
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the big discoveries </v>
<v Speaker 2>of psychology from over the last couple </v>

256
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.360
<v Speaker 2>of decades is that we're moral animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that we have reputations.</v>

257
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

258
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 2>going back to Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his famous book,</v>

259
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 2>the selfish gene where he posed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

260
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.980
<v Speaker 2>how could niceness in generosity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperation evolve given that in </v>

261
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian competition you'd expect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most aggressive,</v>

262
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:31.081
<v Speaker 2>the most selfish to predominate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's an answer to that question </v>

263
00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 2>in Docklands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked it out back in 1976 based on work</v>

264
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 2>of other biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

265
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 2>if there is reciprocity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

266
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:41.911
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the nice things that you did </v>

267
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 2>to me and I feel compelled to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

268
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to repay them.</v>

269
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.870
<v Speaker 2>And conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do something that harms me and I </v>

270
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.860
<v Speaker 2>threatened revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people can kind of settle into </v>

271
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.920
<v Speaker 2>cooperation because we really are better</v>
<v Speaker 2>off if we extend favorites to each other</v>

272
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.070
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.630
<v Speaker 2>do a lot of good to the other in </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to a fairly minor inconvenience</v>

274
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:02.200
<v Speaker 2>to the self.</v>

275
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.060
<v Speaker 2>If everyone does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is better off.</v>

276
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's only stable though if </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a memory for what everyone </v>

277
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.161
<v Speaker 2>else did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore that sets up a pressure to </v>

278
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:16.890
<v Speaker 2>cultivate your reputation as someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is trustworthy and will reciprocate at,</v>

279
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 2>but without the reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without the memory of who did what.</v>

280
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:26.791
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how generous and trustworthy someone</v>

281
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.870
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing can unravel when you get</v>

282
00:13:28.871 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 2>back to what people think of as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian competition.</v>

283
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Namely nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>red in tooth and claw.</v>

284
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Just a bloody battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So reputation is really,</v>

285
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:41.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a matter of kind of ego or</v>
<v Speaker 2>burnishing your credentials,</v>

286
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 2>that's really what makes all </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperation,</v>

287
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:49.171
<v Speaker 2>niceness kindness a possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you have an arena in which </v>

288
00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

289
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.080
<v Speaker 2>first of all you don't have face to face</v>
<v Speaker 2>contact so you don't have the kind of </v>

290
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.320
<v Speaker 2>evolved responses that we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to getting along a namely it's a,</v>

291
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:02.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal to a insult someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

292
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.840
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their face.</v>

293
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Some people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

294
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to do it very carefully.</v>

295
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.360
<v Speaker 2>You take that away and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:13.410
<v Speaker 2>typing a bunch of characters at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>keyboard and especially if the person </v>

297
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.561
<v Speaker 2>doing the typing has a handle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just anonymous then that kind of </v>

298
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:20.730
<v Speaker 2>eliminate some of the constraints on </v>
<v Speaker 2>civility and generosity and then </v>

299
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 2>maintaining a reputation as a credible </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperator.</v>

300
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I also feel that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a selfishness and being nice and</v>

301
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>being generous because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

302
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>the way I describe what I think it feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

303
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.930
<v Speaker 1>it feels good to be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be bold.</v>

304
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It feels good to be generous when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>give someone a nice tip at a restaurant </v>

305
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and they get happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that feels good.</v>

306
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Like it's good for you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a one way street.</v>

307
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

308
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.870
<v Speaker 2>kind of a benign selfishness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

309
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 2>it's the kind that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's not,</v>

310
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

311
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:56.711
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the irony is said it can't just really </v>

312
00:14:56.711 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 2>be calculated if it's really that I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>do exactly as much.</v>

313
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 2>That gets me gratitude and recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

314
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people see through that.</v>

315
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

316
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

317
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 2>the paradox is that it's kind of got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be sincere for it to be credible to </v>

318
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.301
<v Speaker 2>someone else for the most effective way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to prove to someone else that you're a </v>

319
00:15:13.301 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 2>nice guy is to actually be a nice guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're just calculating,</v>

320
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 2>if you're just doing the bare minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with.</v>

321
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Then since we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty good.</v>

322
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.910
<v Speaker 2>We're all pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intuitive psychologists were always kind</v>

323
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he really mean it?</v>

324
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Is he just kind of kissing up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he trying to get,</v>

325
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curry favors and we see through that.</v>

326
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the person who actually isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that calculation,</v>

327
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 2>but we really admire and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

328
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why we admire,</v>

329
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:41.120
<v Speaker 2>like look at this completely altruistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

330
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

331
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 2>it's clearly remarket the marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have reputations,</v>

332
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 2>kind of selects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can select for true niceness.</v>

333
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

334
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 2>You've got enough information and enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions.</v>

335
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a crude analogy.</v>

336
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the business world,</v>

337
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

338
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you can have cutthroat fly by night </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses.</v>

339
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:05.561
<v Speaker 2>They just try to squeeze everything out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the customers and then take off the </v>

340
00:16:05.561 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cheating is discovered,</v>

341
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't last very long.</v>

342
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:12.941
<v Speaker 2>They don't actually make a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's often the companies that will take </v>

343
00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 2>back the product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no questions asked,</v>

344
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:18.641
<v Speaker 2>even if they lose a little bit of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they earned the loyalty of their </v>

345
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:18.641
<v Speaker 2>customers.</v>

346
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Those are the companies that often do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best and stick around the longest.</v>

347
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of an analogy to the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>being honorable,</v>

348
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 2>even if you have little losses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

349
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I did a little bit more for him than he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did for me,</v>

350
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 2>but over the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes you desirable as </v>

351
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 2>someone who other people want to hang </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with.</v>

352
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 2>If the reputations can spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

353
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:40.901
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about how cherished true </v>

354
00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:44.090
<v Speaker 2>generosity and kindness out cherished </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

355
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 2>like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing thing.</v>

356
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Like you see people that are truly kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>and truly generous and we've,</v>

357
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.490
<v Speaker 2>we value that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of amazing.</v>

358
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:57.460
<v Speaker 2>There aren't more of them because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a virtue that we admire and you,</v>

359
00:16:57.461 --> 00:17:00.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone does behave in that manner,</v>

360
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:05.231
<v Speaker 2>like people gravitate towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a real trait that is </v>

361
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:06.860
<v Speaker 2>attractive to people.</v>

362
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.610
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>

363
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a misunderstanding of the </v>

364
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.310
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary explanation of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

365
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 2>of appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of altruism and generosity.</v>

366
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I had a misunderstanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

367
00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:23.331
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the message that Dawkins conveyed in </v>

368
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:25.481
<v Speaker 2>that book that it predicts that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all just kind of calculating a favorite </v>

369
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:28.620
<v Speaker 2>traders that we do just enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

370
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 2>get a favor in return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we don't think someone could help</v>

371
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 2>us in return,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we just cut them off.</v>

372
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Kind of a cynical view of generosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's actually the reason that that's</v>

373
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 2>not true is that as soon as the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>begins,</v>

374
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of get to higher and higher </v>

375
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:45.010
<v Speaker 2>levels of eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People psyching each other out,</v>

376
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 2>seeing through them because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have a choice between who I'm going</v>

377
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>to hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's calling to be friend,</v>

378
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 2>there's one person who's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly for what,</v>

379
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will help him in the long run.</v>

380
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:01.190
<v Speaker 2>There's someone else who's really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>generous and he's really going to help </v>

381
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.521
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said he's not going to keep a </v>

382
00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:04.521
<v Speaker 2>long memory of who did what for whom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

383
00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pick the second guy and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to actually be better off for</v>

384
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:10.640
<v Speaker 2>being the better person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that you can take that to an extreme</v>

385
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 2>and it means that we're all infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>generous,</v>

386
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:18.231
<v Speaker 2>which of course we're not a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's kind of a tradeoff in </v>

387
00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 2>equilibrium between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.931
<v Speaker 2>not being a total sucker or not giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much away that you just harm yourself</v>

389
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 2>in the long run and being the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who is generous and honest enough</v>

390
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 2>that other people want to affiliate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

391
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is that all of us are </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably mixtures.</v>

392
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not cutthroat sociopath's.</v>

393
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Most of us have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of us are a nora.</v>

394
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.150
<v Speaker 2>We are totally a sane self sacrificing </v>
<v Speaker 2>saints.</v>

395
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.180
<v Speaker 2>We're somewhere in between and different</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are at different points in that </v>

396
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.180
<v Speaker 2>continuum.</v>

397
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.080
<v Speaker 1>When you look at social media and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this,</v>

398
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

399
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nastiness that's so common,</v>

400
00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously in some ways it's got to </v>

401
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.100
<v Speaker 1>be connected to the ability to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous.</v>

402
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.700
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like I've thought of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more lately that this </v>

403
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 1>negativity is as probably a temporary </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

404
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people are realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't an unnatural way of </v>

405
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.231
<v Speaker 1>communicating and that it's so relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really relatively recent in human </v>

406
00:19:21.231 --> 00:19:23.160
<v Speaker 1>history and such a small window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 19,</v>

407
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:28.161
<v Speaker 1>94 is essentially when people started </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting online and here we are in 2018 </v>

408
00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and you're seeing people switching to </v>
<v Speaker 1>flip phones,</v>

409
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.470
<v Speaker 1>deleting their facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common thing and almost a </v>

410
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.191
<v Speaker 1>chic thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people were talking about it on a </v>

411
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:40.191
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Man.</v>

412
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:40.191
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

413
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I just get email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I check it once a day and that's it.</v>

414
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

415
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're there.</v>

416
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Whenever there's a new technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation,</v>

417
00:19:46.301 --> 00:19:51.301
<v Speaker 2>it takes society awhile to adjust to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say people got online in 1994 with </v>

418
00:19:51.741 --> 00:19:53.560
<v Speaker 2>social media or even more recent than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

419
00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:58.561
<v Speaker 2>It's more probably like smartphones </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to become ubiquitous around </v>

420
00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:00.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe 2011 and facebook took off in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two thousands,</v>

421
00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right and similar things </v>

422
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 2>happened in when other media were </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced.</v>

423
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.640
<v Speaker 2>There was a big panic when television </v>
<v Speaker 2>came in that families would never talk </v>

424
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.960
<v Speaker 2>to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd all be staring at the screen like</v>

425
00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:18.961
<v Speaker 2>zombies and you'd never have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation over the dinner table ever </v>

426
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:18.961
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even before that,</v>

427
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:20.680
<v Speaker 2>when telephones were invented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

428
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>families who'd never a sit down together</v>

429
00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:28.711
<v Speaker 2>because the phone constantly be ringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in attention spans would be disrupted </v>

430
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:32.821
<v Speaker 2>because the phone could ring anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there similar conversation about </v>

431
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:32.860
<v Speaker 2>books?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually there was,</v>

432
00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:33.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about writing,</v>

433
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.070
<v Speaker 2>going back to the ancient Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

434
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:36.970
<v Speaker 2>who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

435
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when writing was considered to be kind </v>

436
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

437
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:46.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>degenerate and decadent because you </v>

438
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.870
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

439
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.190
<v Speaker 2>you'd let your memory go to pot to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how are people to cultivate their </v>

440
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.681
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could just write things down and </v>

441
00:20:52.681 --> 00:20:52.681
<v Speaker 2>look at them.</v>

442
00:20:52.681 --> 00:20:52.681
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that interesting?</v>

443
00:20:52.681 --> 00:20:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think we were always looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dismiss some new fantastic </v>

444
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 1>technology?</v>

445
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.440
<v Speaker 2>It's partly because we don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>it yet.</v>

446
00:21:00.441 --> 00:21:05.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's new and also a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustments that you were just talking </v>

447
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:05.441
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you can't really predict them </v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand.</v>

449
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of what happens in a society is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there like hundreds of little </v>

450
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.811
<v Speaker 2>adjustments that people make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Spend too much time on facebook or </v>

451
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:20.690
<v Speaker 2>email and leave this platform for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform where if you were starting from</v>

452
00:21:20.691 --> 00:21:23.780
<v Speaker 2>scratch and asked to kind of imagine how</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to play out,</v>

453
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.210
<v Speaker 2>you can't really anticipate these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

454
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like thousands of adjustments that </v>

455
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.881
<v Speaker 2>people make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They happen when they happen with </v>

456
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:34.990
<v Speaker 2>billions of people making decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

457
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.420
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just deduce them beforehand,</v>

458
00:21:38.421 --> 00:21:40.730
<v Speaker 2>like a logical proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we just don't know.</v>

459
00:21:40.731 --> 00:21:45.731
<v Speaker 2>We know what the threat is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what society's </v>

460
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:45.731
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

461
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe whether this a fascinating time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to social media and just </v>

462
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.370
<v Speaker 1>human interaction because this is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

463
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And because it's uncharted territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

464
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people have so many concerns </v>

465
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.890
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

466
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.890
<v Speaker 1>where's this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's this going?</v>

467
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.660
<v Speaker 1>What's it gonna do to our children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We walked down the street and everyone's</v>

468
00:22:00.661 --> 00:22:03.610
<v Speaker 1>just staring at their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really is I,</v>

469
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I've said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that imagine if there was a drug that </v>

470
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.590
<v Speaker 1>came along that this drug made you only </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the drug.</v>

471
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

472
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you were likely more likely to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>car accidents because this drug,</v>

473
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to sleep late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause more anxiety and,</v>

474
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.730
<v Speaker 1>and soak up immense amounts of your time</v>
<v Speaker 1>with very little reward for it.</v>

475
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 1>You would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

476
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>What kind of crazy drugs this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's robbing people of their lives.</v>

477
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cell phones,</v>

478
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.310
<v Speaker 1>that's social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it does give you something.</v>

479
00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:37.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you use it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time I try to spend on </v>

480
00:22:37.311 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to spend or most of the time on,</v>

481
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:40.890
<v Speaker 1>on my phone I try to spend off social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

482
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but reading things like tried to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles and I try to,</v>

483
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I try to in some way justify like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

484
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing something productive on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

485
00:22:49.081 --> 00:22:52.980
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of ways I'm just addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>checking that thing.</v>

486
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

487
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to develop habits of self </v>

488
00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.370
<v Speaker 2>control and balancing life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a student,</v>

489
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.380
<v Speaker 2>so I teach at Harvard and what time of </v>
<v Speaker 2>freshmen came into my office beginning </v>

490
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.320
<v Speaker 2>of the semester,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she looked at the shelf of books that</v>

491
00:23:06.321 --> 00:23:07.160
<v Speaker 2>she really said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

492
00:23:07.161 --> 00:23:12.161
<v Speaker 2>professor pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you find time to write so many </v>

493
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:12.161
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she looks at my office and sees</v>

494
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:14.240
<v Speaker 2>all the books on my shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

495
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:19.241
<v Speaker 2>Professor Pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you have time to read so many </v>

496
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:19.241
<v Speaker 2>books?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she paused for a second.</v>

497
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:20.750
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you're not on facebook,</v>

498
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but this got to be some good that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of those communities as well </v>

499
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 2>throughout the baby with the bathwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undoubtedly.</v>

500
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

501
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I confess I'm on twitter.</v>

502
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes look at my twitter feed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned really interesting stuff from </v>

503
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:38.940
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also say,</v>

504
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.000
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

505
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.750
<v Speaker 2>get back to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back to reading,</v>

506
00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:43.780
<v Speaker 2>go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See some friends,</v>

507
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 2>spent some time with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>

508
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 2>with your family.</v>

509
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will go down twitter hall.</v>

510
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I went down to twitter whole yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these Mont New Mayan Ruins that </v>

511
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.651
<v Speaker 3>they found in Guatemala who amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy thousands of structures swallowed </v>

512
00:23:56.651 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 3>up by time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're just now realizing like,</v>

513
00:23:58.311 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a city.</v>

514
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 3>So that stuff's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

515
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely man.</v>

516
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a question of are all finding the </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance between getting the advantages </v>

517
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:09.220
<v Speaker 3>or disadvantages?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

518
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.430
<v Speaker 3>it's just so new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

519
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.880
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see all so much negativity </v>

520
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.440
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a big problem with anonymous</v>

521
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 3>accounts in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it in facebook,</v>

522
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.780
<v Speaker 3>in facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there seems to be repercussions.</v>

523
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're Tom Smith and Tom Smith </v>
<v Speaker 3>writes something horrible,</v>

524
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 3>like Tom Smith could get fired from his </v>
<v Speaker 3>job for it.</v>

525
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:35.531
<v Speaker 3>We've seen that people will write </v>
<v Speaker 3>something racist or sexist or whatever </v>

526
00:24:35.531 --> 00:24:39.310
<v Speaker 3>and we'll see them get fired from their </v>
<v Speaker 3>job because of something that they put </v>

527
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.310
<v Speaker 3>on facebook.</v>

528
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Because your profile represents the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual you.</v>

529
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

530
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's benefit to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

531
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:45.920
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some.</v>

532
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean the problem is that can also be </v>
<v Speaker 3>outraged.</v>

533
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:52.841
<v Speaker 3>Bob's where someone will post something </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's taken out of context and made </v>

534
00:24:52.841 --> 00:24:53.630
<v Speaker 3>me realize what they've entered as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>

535
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Like the woman who went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took that trip to Africa Qa,</v>

536
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:03.050
<v Speaker 3>kind of a self effacing comment about </v>
<v Speaker 3>racism and people thought it was racist,</v>

537
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.820
<v Speaker 3>but she was actually making fun of </v>
<v Speaker 3>races.</v>

538
00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:08.180
<v Speaker 3>I think she was drunk and she was being </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

539
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 3>I just thought she was being funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Kummete look,</v>

540
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comic and I have a lot of comedian</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends that are not racist,</v>

541
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.480
<v Speaker 3>but they will say hilarious racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

542
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's funny.</v>

543
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not because they're racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

544
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 3>What was her name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justine Sacco.</v>

545
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was the uh,</v>

546
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I hope I don't get aids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lol.</v>

547
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.840
<v Speaker 3>That's what she wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She woke up 12 hours later after a Xanex</v>

548
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:34.190
<v Speaker 3>and wine hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

549
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 3>And her life was a living hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

550
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she still to this day is,</v>

551
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:43.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jamie knows her name is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

552
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.340
<v Speaker 3>It ironically she meant it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She herself was not racist and she </v>

553
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.661
<v Speaker 3>become controversial after that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like the PR person for </v>

554
00:25:52.661 --> 00:25:56.111
<v Speaker 3>draftkings or fanduel or stuff when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were going through some issues a couple </v>

555
00:25:56.111 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 3>of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Draft kings is an online gambling thing.</v>

556
00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:00.860
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gambling on sports and stuff like that.</v>

557
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

558
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:07.390
<v Speaker 3>we look for people to also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about this before </v>

559
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.420
<v Speaker 3>without getting into details about who </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about,</v>

560
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:13.421
<v Speaker 3>but there are certain people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very flawed individuals that looked to </v>

561
00:26:13.421 --> 00:26:18.251
<v Speaker 3>find people and attack them to take away</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the spotlight on their own </v>

562
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:20.510
<v Speaker 3>flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

563
00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:23.990
<v Speaker 3>This is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a big part of virtue signaling,</v>

564
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:25.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a big part of,</v>

565
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:28.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going after people and outrage mobs,</v>

566
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 3>as long as the mob is attacking someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

567
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 3>they're not attacking you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

568
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

569
00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:34.460
<v Speaker 3>And there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

570
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.600
<v Speaker 3>it is a interesting question over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>history is how do,</v>

571
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.900
<v Speaker 3>how do some of these things called </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily extraordinary popular </v>

572
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 3>delusions and the madness</v>

573
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.280
<v Speaker 2>of crowds to Tulip Bulb Mania in Holland</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 17th century.</v>

574
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

575
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

576
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.840
<v Speaker 2>this kind of bubble where people started</v>
<v Speaker 2>to outbid each other on tulip bulbs and </v>

577
00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.210
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

578
00:26:59.211 --> 00:27:04.211
<v Speaker 2>the price of a single tulip bulb went </v>
<v Speaker 2>like through the roof and then it's </v>

579
00:27:04.211 --> 00:27:07.291
<v Speaker 2>suddenly crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People lost fortunes because everyone </v>

580
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 2>was expecting everyone else to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>bidding up the price,</v>

581
00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.510
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

582
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 2>the tulip bulbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tulip Bulb mania,</v>

583
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they're also witch hunts where </v>

584
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.150
<v Speaker 2>when a woman would be accused of sinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ship or causing a crop failure or </v>

585
00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 2>making someone's child gets sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the pogroms in Europe where Jews</v>

586
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:30.141
<v Speaker 2>were accused of poisoning the wells are </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing Christian voice to make </v>

587
00:27:30.141 --> 00:27:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Mozzarella their blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the lynchings in the,</v>

588
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American south where African Americans </v>

589
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.471
<v Speaker 2>were accused of raping a woman and I are</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on just a rumor spreading and </v>

590
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 2>they'd be tortured and hanged.</v>

591
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 2>There's the McCarthy era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

592
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

593
00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the daycare,</v>

594
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:52.071
<v Speaker 2>satanic ritual abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amenia of the 19 eighties were these </v>

595
00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:56.960
<v Speaker 2>daycare workers were accused basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>by coaching kids to embellish these </v>

596
00:27:58.171 --> 00:28:03.171
<v Speaker 2>fantastic stories of how they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually molested and tortured and </v>

597
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:06.090
<v Speaker 2>forced to take part in satanic rituals </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean all totally nonsense.</v>

598
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:11.270
<v Speaker 2>And people went to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So initially the question is how do </v>

599
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.781
<v Speaker 2>people kind of lose their collective </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds in every once in awhile in </v>

600
00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 2>history?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a part of the answer is if you start</v>

601
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:23.151
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of vicious circle of denouncing </v>

602
00:28:23.151 --> 00:28:26.271
<v Speaker 2>people and then denouncing people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't denounce people denouncing people </v>

603
00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 2>who call the whistle on a and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people denouncing people,</v>

604
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.440
<v Speaker 2>then you can get a kind of circle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>terror where no one wants.</v>

605
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is so afraid of being denounced</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they wanted to announce first </v>

606
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Stalinist Soviet Union as another </v>
<v Speaker 2>example at Mao's,</v>

607
00:28:41.671 --> 00:28:42.180
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

608
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's somehow some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways in which dictators could</v>

609
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

610
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:49.560
<v Speaker 2>enforce their power by turning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizens against each other.</v>

611
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.680
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's denouncing everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of fear that they'll be announced </v>

612
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.410
<v Speaker 2>first that's going on right now in North</v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>

613
00:28:55.411 --> 00:28:56.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

614
00:28:56.521 --> 00:28:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

615
00:28:56.971 --> 00:29:01.971
<v Speaker 2>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this thing where they each </v>

616
00:29:01.971 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>have to report on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when people are together,</v>

617
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.520
<v Speaker 2>they report on each other for different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that they did that were </v>

618
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:07.840
<v Speaker 2>violations of whatever code that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>

619
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so governments know how to explain </v>

620
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.381
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't just governments that can </v>

621
00:29:15.381 --> 00:29:15.381
<v Speaker 2>happen spontaneously too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird human trait,</v>

622
00:29:15.381 --> 00:29:15.690
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

623
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:20.691
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of a kind of a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>trait and a kind of dynamic when you </v>

624
00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:21.750
<v Speaker 2>have a kind of a network of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

625
00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:26.751
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they all are kind of trapped and no </v>

626
00:29:26.751 --> 00:29:29.691
<v Speaker 2>one can be the first person to escape </v>
<v Speaker 2>from this vicious circle because they </v>

627
00:29:29.691 --> 00:29:31.130
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be the one who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>denounced it,</v>

628
00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:35.190
<v Speaker 2>imprisoned and tortured or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The consequences may be a,</v>

629
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.620
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think,</v>

630
00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:40.320
<v Speaker 2>if you think at all about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you think this is all headed?</v>

631
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially</v>

632
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 1>in terms of social media and.</v>

633
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to tell,</v>

634
00:29:45.421 --> 00:29:46.340
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

635
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.390
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been such a growing recognition </v>

636
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.041
<v Speaker 2>of the problem that we will mount a </v>
<v Speaker 2>response that it'll just seem ridiculous</v>

637
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.700
<v Speaker 2>of the outrage mob once it's recognized </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are outraged mobs and virtual</v>

638
00:29:59.701 --> 00:30:03.390
<v Speaker 2>signaling fanatics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once we have a label for them.</v>

639
00:30:03.391 --> 00:30:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Once we know that it's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

640
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.150
<v Speaker 2>it'll seem so ridiculous that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be less tempted to do it.</v>

641
00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the optimistic of a outcome.</v>

642
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just such a flaw in there.</v>

643
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a real issue in writing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the issues,</v>

644
00:30:18.241 --> 00:30:23.241
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're writing about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject where there's a lot of people </v>

645
00:30:23.241 --> 00:30:25.110
<v Speaker 1>involved or perhaps an even an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

646
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.330
<v Speaker 1>is that you're the only one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

647
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that person,</v>

648
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.580
<v Speaker 1>they would be able to say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

649
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.170
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to say something and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will go,</v>

650
00:30:34.171 --> 00:30:35.820
<v Speaker 1>well that's not exactly how I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

651
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:40.821
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at it this way and the </v>

652
00:30:40.821 --> 00:30:40.821
<v Speaker 1>other person would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

653
00:30:40.821 --> 00:30:42.180
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your take on it was,</v>

654
00:30:42.181 --> 00:30:47.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would go back and forth and </v>

655
00:30:47.181 --> 00:30:49.271
<v Speaker 1>exchange information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully come to some sort of an </v>

656
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:49.271
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what's going on in each</v>
<v Speaker 1>person's mind.</v>

657
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you can define someone in a </v>

658
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.691
<v Speaker 1>tweet or a facebook post or a blog post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can define someone without them </v>

659
00:30:57.961 --> 00:31:00.300
<v Speaker 1>having any ability to respond in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

660
00:31:00.301 --> 00:31:05.301
<v Speaker 1>So you have this whole uninterrupted </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunk where you could talk about,</v>

661
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>

662
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.300
<v Speaker 1>some celebrity or some politician or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and you can define them and </v>

663
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.741
<v Speaker 1>some really horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty way and they just have to sit </v>

664
00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Speaker 1>there and read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it is just your thoughts.</v>

665
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:22.730
<v Speaker 1>But that's not an accurate method of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating ideas with a person.</v>

666
00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just your one uninterrupted take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

667
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

668
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.630
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my second to last book,</v>

669
00:31:30.631 --> 00:31:33.600
<v Speaker 2>the one just before my current book </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment now,</v>

670
00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:35.430
<v Speaker 2>but the previous book was called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of style.</v>

671
00:31:35.431 --> 00:31:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It was a writing manual way began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Began.</v>

672
00:31:37.951 --> 00:31:38.910
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

673
00:31:38.911 --> 00:31:43.911
<v Speaker 2>why is so much writing so bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come there's so much writing where </v>

674
00:31:43.911 --> 00:31:45.210
<v Speaker 2>you just can't understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is talking about.</v>

675
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.600
<v Speaker 2>And I mentioned some theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people think that it's academics </v>

676
00:31:50.911 --> 00:31:54.360
<v Speaker 2>and intellectuals trying to show off how</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound they are.</v>

677
00:31:54.361 --> 00:31:58.050
<v Speaker 2>My how incomprehensible they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if people could understand it,</v>

678
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.140
<v Speaker 2>it can't be that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up right.</v>

679
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.860
<v Speaker 2>The stuff that no one will understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that nothing.</v>

680
00:32:01.861 --> 00:32:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one theory and you know,</v>

681
00:32:04.081 --> 00:32:08.330
<v Speaker 2>there might be some truth to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the main theory is that</v>

682
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.710
<v Speaker 2>that writing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you just as you described it,</v>

683
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a one way channel of communication.</v>

684
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:13.910
<v Speaker 2>It's very unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

685
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.470
<v Speaker 2>when we speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I were having a conversation,</v>

686
00:32:16.471 --> 00:32:21.471
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at each other in the eye </v>
<v Speaker 2>and our eyebrows go up and they get </v>

687
00:32:21.471 --> 00:32:23.520
<v Speaker 2>needed and if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I start to become too obscure,</v>

688
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:24.860
<v Speaker 2>you're going to give me a quizzical </v>
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>

689
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Terrified expression on their face where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can interact and say,</v>

690
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell was that?</v>

691
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.350
<v Speaker 2>When you're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have none of that.</v>

692
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.390
<v Speaker 2>And so I think part of the skill in </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing what I least,</v>

693
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.400
<v Speaker 2>what I argue in the of style is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a kind of enough of an intuitive </v>

694
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.711
<v Speaker 2>psychologists that you can try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anticipate what your reader knows and </v>

695
00:32:47.711 --> 00:32:51.201
<v Speaker 2>what your reader doesn't know and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have no way of determining </v>

696
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:55.421
<v Speaker 2>that as you're writing because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there tapping away whoever </v>

697
00:32:55.421 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 2>was going to read what you write there.</v>

698
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.840
<v Speaker 2>You never get to meet them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be,</v>

699
00:32:57.841 --> 00:33:02.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years from now they might be </v>

700
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:02.841
<v Speaker 2>halfway across the world and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way and so,</v>

701
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:06.620
<v Speaker 2>and there's another kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological problem that we all have.</v>

702
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just part of being human called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>curse of knowledge.</v>

703
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Namely when you know something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

704
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 2>really hard to imagine what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to know it.</v>

705
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.720
<v Speaker 2>You just assume that everyone knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

706
00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.410
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

707
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:22.310
<v Speaker 2>your understanding is everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding and so you right away,</v>

708
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>

709
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

710
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.970
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

711
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.680
<v Speaker 2>And it never occurs to you that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reader doesn't know your abbreviations </v>

712
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 2>or your jargon or can't visualize what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're describing.</v>

713
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.990
<v Speaker 2>It's so clear to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the writer and a lot of bad writing </v>

714
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.741
<v Speaker 2>comes from the curse of knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a writer not getting into the heads </v>

715
00:33:41.741 --> 00:33:45.970
<v Speaker 2>of his reader and a lot of the cure is </v>
<v Speaker 2>either to at least at least know that </v>

716
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:52.271
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem and think of what can I </v>
<v Speaker 2>read it would be reasonably expected to </v>

717
00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 2>know because we're not even that good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

718
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of us remind readers,</v>

719
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:59.770
<v Speaker 2>just showing someone a draft of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've written and you're often </v>

720
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 2>surprised at how often they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

721
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what we should force people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do at twitter.</v>

722
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should have like a team of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you send your tweet to a </v>

723
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.660
<v Speaker 2>circle of confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

724
00:34:12.661 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

725
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:14.300
<v Speaker 2>that's the way it works in publishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

726
00:34:14.301 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an editor in academia,</v>

727
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:18.320
<v Speaker 2>you got peer review before it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>published.</v>

728
00:34:18.321 --> 00:34:20.440
<v Speaker 2>They send it out to other people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you and they,</v>

729
00:34:20.441 --> 00:34:25.441
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they write a little review and you've </v>

730
00:34:25.441 --> 00:34:25.441
<v Speaker 2>got to modify it if it doesn't make any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

731
00:34:25.441 --> 00:34:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Justine Sacco had sent that to a team</v>

732
00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:28.380
<v Speaker 2>of confidence they would went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

733
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 2>don't write that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

734
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm drunk.</v>

735
00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll call you from Africa.</v>

736
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

737
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:40.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the big themes in my new book </v>

738
00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:41.250
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

739
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.510
<v Speaker 2>how is it that we're simultaneously in </v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways getting smarter but also seem </v>

740
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 2>to be getting stupider society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think part of it is that none of us</v>

741
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 2>is individually are that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

742
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:59.650
<v Speaker 2>we all and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cognitive psychologists have shown </v>

743
00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.130
<v Speaker 2>that humans have all kinds of biases and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fallacies.</v>

744
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.480
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

745
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.970
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we rezoned from stereotypes.</v>

746
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.320
<v Speaker 2>We assess risk by how easy it is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine something.</v>

747
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

748
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're afraid of getting on a plane </v>

749
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.770
<v Speaker 2>because it's very easy to imagine a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane crashing and plane crashes,</v>

750
00:35:15.771 --> 00:35:20.771
<v Speaker 2>make the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't worry about texting while </v>

751
00:35:20.771 --> 00:35:23.291
<v Speaker 2>driving because there's never a headline</v>
<v Speaker 2>on page one of the hundred people who </v>

752
00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:27.551
<v Speaker 2>died in the past week because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>texted while driving a certainly a lot </v>

753
00:35:27.551 --> 00:35:27.980
<v Speaker 2>of fallacies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

754
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.820
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

755
00:35:28.821 --> 00:35:30.530
<v Speaker 2>as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done some amazing things.</v>

756
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we discovered those Mayan,</v>

757
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.210
<v Speaker 2>a buried city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

758
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science is amazing and because </v>

759
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.540
<v Speaker 2>democracies are amazing and it's because</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of us solves a problem all by </v>

760
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:45.921
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're part of our kind of collective </v>

761
00:35:45.921 --> 00:35:48.051
<v Speaker 2>brain that works by rules where all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the excesses of one person get kind of </v>

762
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 2>balanced out by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

763
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 2>by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you have a,</v>

764
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like a checks and balances in a </v>

765
00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 2>democracy where instead of having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme leader who just runs the country</v>

766
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:05.001
<v Speaker 2>the way he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a worry about the legislature </v>

767
00:36:05.001 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 2>and the courts and the judges and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

768
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 2>and in an impeachment and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in science,</v>

769
00:36:08.851 --> 00:36:13.851
<v Speaker 2>instead of having one genius announcing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the world works,</v>

770
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:18.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she has to subject themselves to </v>

771
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:19.860
<v Speaker 2>peer review and get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let other sciences criticize.</v>

772
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize him or her.</v>

773
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.120
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

774
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 2>whenever you get people acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligently,</v>

775
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:31.701
<v Speaker 2>it's often because they belong to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions with rules that are </v>

776
00:36:31.701 --> 00:36:35.040
<v Speaker 2>designed to make up for the idiocies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>any individual person.</v>

777
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

778
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.700
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

779
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree with that.</v>

780
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:42.460
<v Speaker 1>That makes so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also felt that there,</v>

781
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:47.360
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>

782
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:52.610
<v Speaker 1>we have difficulties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people have difficulties in </v>

783
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:52.610
<v Speaker 1>this life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their social difficulties,</v>

784
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:53.180
<v Speaker 1>economic difficulties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

785
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 1>in terms of survival difficulties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

786
00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:00.740
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier to get by today than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever been in human history.</v>

787
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.560
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder if human beings have a need</v>
<v Speaker 1>for adversity and complexity and problem</v>

788
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:14.001
<v Speaker 1>solving and all these things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

789
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.130
<v Speaker 1>They're less present today than ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

790
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I think things are just almost too </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

791
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 1>We've made it to ease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've nerf the world and in doing so,</v>

792
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:29.091
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to just kind of be double </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded and drift through and follow the </v>

793
00:37:29.091 --> 00:37:33.681
<v Speaker 1>herd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The herd is so big and there's so many </v>

794
00:37:33.681 --> 00:37:36.411
<v Speaker 1>people in the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just do what most people are </v>

795
00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:40.461
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where what most of the people are </v>

796
00:37:40.461 --> 00:37:40.461
<v Speaker 1>wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the things.</v>

797
00:37:40.461 --> 00:37:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people say you'll survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll survive and you'll find some </v>

798
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.230
<v Speaker 1>other dimwitted person to breed with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll make dimwitted children.</v>

799
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.380
<v Speaker 1>And I'm being dead serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain,</v>

800
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.010
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with this massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>pack of humans,</v>

801
00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:56.520
<v Speaker 1>300 plus million on a continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just.</v>

802
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:01.610
<v Speaker 1>There's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always said like if you have a </v>

803
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:05.121
<v Speaker 1>group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're being very generous and you </v>

804
00:38:05.121 --> 00:38:07.611
<v Speaker 1>have 100 people in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds that one of those </v>

805
00:38:07.611 --> 00:38:07.611
<v Speaker 1>people is a moron?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hundred percent.</v>

806
00:38:07.611 --> 00:38:12.381
<v Speaker 1>That one is going to be a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That leaves you with $3 million morons </v>

807
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:16.311
<v Speaker 1>in the United States of America if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being really kind and 3 million </v>

808
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:16.311
<v Speaker 1>geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

809
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

810
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 1>probably I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an optimist.</v>

811
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I would like to thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with probably 6 million genius.</v>

812
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

813
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:30.530
<v Speaker 2>my book is often described as a book on </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimism enlightenment now because I </v>

814
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:35.141
<v Speaker 2>have 75 graphs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of it showed the world </v>

815
00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:38.531
<v Speaker 2>getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including what some people think of the </v>

816
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:40.501
<v Speaker 2>most incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A graph in the book on a phenomenon </v>

817
00:38:40.501 --> 00:38:41.830
<v Speaker 2>called the flynn effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>

818
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know most people do not.</v>

819
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Iq scores have been rising for most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last hundred years,</v>

820
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.620
<v Speaker 2>but three points a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this I know,</v>

821
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:53.080
<v Speaker 2>it seems totally unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

822
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:58.081
<v Speaker 2>they discovered it with Flynn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A philosopher discovered it when he </v>

823
00:38:58.081 --> 00:39:01.231
<v Speaker 2>realized that the people who make Iq </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests had to keep re norming the tests </v>

824
00:39:01.231 --> 00:39:04.870
<v Speaker 2>to keep a 100 as the average because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>average kept creeping up and it was like</v>

825
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:08.080
<v Speaker 2>110 where we keep that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what most people score.</v>

826
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:13.290
<v Speaker 2>We say that the average is 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to adjust the scale downward and </v>

827
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:13.290
<v Speaker 2>flint realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

828
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.611
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep doing this over and over </v>

829
00:39:17.611 --> 00:39:17.611
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

830
00:39:17.611 --> 00:39:17.611
<v Speaker 2>That must mean the population's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter now,</v>

831
00:39:17.611 --> 00:39:22.220
<v Speaker 2>not biologically smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that people's brainpower has </v>

832
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.611
<v Speaker 2>somehow magically been increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although probably a little bit of that </v>

833
00:39:26.611 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 2>through better nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better sanitation and health care and so</v>

834
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:30.250
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of it is just that,</v>

835
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:35.251
<v Speaker 2>a lot that ideas that used to be kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated and restricted to </v>

836
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.790
<v Speaker 2>professors and scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>statisticians kind of trickle down to </v>

837
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 2>the population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we things like,</v>

838
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a placebo effect or trade off or cost </v>

839
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 2>benefit analysis or win win situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things that actually came from</v>

840
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:59.220
<v Speaker 2>pretty fancy schmancy theory originally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they kind of are loose stone the </v>

841
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:02.320
<v Speaker 2>whole population and they become part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's conventional wisdom.</v>

842
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to think more and more in </v>

843
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 2>abstract ways just to deal with things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a subway map or a smartphone.</v>

844
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching TV is,</v>

845
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.190
<v Speaker 2>it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you turn on your TV would be on,</v>

846
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.900
<v Speaker 2>now you got to kind of program that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody thing.</v>

847
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:22.350
<v Speaker 2>So the demands of life have become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated and ideas spread more </v>

848
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 2>quickly and so we are quite literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting smarter up to a point,</v>

849
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 2>things that can't go on forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

850
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 2>And the flynn effect is starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>level off,</v>

851
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 2>but there has been this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

852
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this drift upward in intelligence.</v>

853
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's surprising at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at the amount of </v>

854
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.770
<v Speaker 1>information that people are subject to </v>
<v Speaker 1>today and just the sheer raw data,</v>

855
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of the data is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense and twitter and that.</v>

856
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 1>What is the quote that we produce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More content in two days.</v>

857
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.790
<v Speaker 1>The entire human history every two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy like that.</v>

858
00:40:57.791 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds,</v>

859
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.980
<v Speaker 1>it sounds plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of it is like,</v>

860
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 1>lol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went to the mall,</v>

861
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of nonsense in there.</v>

862
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 1>But the sheer amount of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

863
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:15.570
<v Speaker 1>like those newly discovered Mayan Ruins </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Guatemala and things along those </v>

864
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:15.670
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

865
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.760
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

866
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:21.780
<v Speaker 1>there was some interesting new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information on the history of human </v>

867
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:28.351
<v Speaker 1>beings because they found some new teeth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some throwback the date of modern </v>

868
00:41:28.571 --> 00:41:33.571
<v Speaker 1>humans and they keep moving that back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the point is we're constantly </v>

869
00:41:33.571 --> 00:41:36.050
<v Speaker 1>getting more information and more data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more things to think about.</v>

870
00:41:36.051 --> 00:41:41.051
<v Speaker 1>And I've just got to assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of information that comes to a </v>

871
00:41:41.051 --> 00:41:44.741
<v Speaker 1>person in 2018 is just vastly larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the amount that came to them in </v>

872
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 1>1978.</v>

873
00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

874
00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.950
<v Speaker 2>And there are as idiotic as a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>public debate is today.</v>

875
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of idiocy in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

876
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

877
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:55.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:41:55.461 --> 00:42:00.461
<v Speaker 2>as recently as the 19 sixties is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie on the first interracial </v>

879
00:42:00.461 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 2>couple in Virginia where there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>court,</v>

880
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 2>a judge who said God didn't mean for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist intermarry that's why he put </v>

881
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 2>black people in Africa and yellow people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Asia and white people in Europe.</v>

882
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 2>So the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judge,</v>

883
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.810
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The judge said this in his decision </v>

884
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:19.810
<v Speaker 2>eventually overturned loving versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia.</v>

885
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

886
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.260
<v Speaker 2>no one would make that stupid an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument today,</v>

887
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 2>even even people that we think of as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as kind of racist,</v>

888
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:30.440
<v Speaker 2>they'd be embarrassed and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>too stupid and people on the,</v>

889
00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 2>on the left made some pretty stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments as well.</v>

890
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Castro sent all of the gay people </v>

891
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.621
<v Speaker 2>to concentration camps in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had Susan Sontag respected leftwing </v>

892
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.220
<v Speaker 2>intellectual who's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

893
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:43.910
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you got to forgive them because a Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>America was such a sexualized culture </v>

895
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 2>and they were prostitutes.</v>

896
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 2>It was decadence that of course it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of an overreaction.</v>

897
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Now today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone on the,</v>

898
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:58.760
<v Speaker 2>on the left or the right would say it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay to send gay people to concentration</v>

899
00:42:58.761 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 2>camps because they were a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes in Havana.</v>

900
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.850
<v Speaker 2>But that's the kind of idiotic statement</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we kind of forget that people used </v>

901
00:43:07.071 --> 00:43:10.220
<v Speaker 2>to make in the past too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's way reassuring ourselves.</v>

902
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Whenever we see a debate getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemingly getting stupider and stupider.</v>

903
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 2>You got to remember there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupidity in the past too.</v>

904
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a massive amount.</v>

905
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right that the,</v>

906
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to tell day by day,</v>

907
00:43:24.171 --> 00:43:29.171
<v Speaker 2>especially when your attention is </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated by the worst things that </v>

908
00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:29.300
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

909
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 2>this a big theme of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

910
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.440
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment now that your picture of </v>

911
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:35.440
<v Speaker 2>the world when it's.</v>

912
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Because the human mind really is driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>by anecdotes and images and stories and </v>

913
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 2>that's what the news gives us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at trends,</v>

914
00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:47.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he follow the trend lines and not the </v>

915
00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.991
<v Speaker 2>headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that a lot of things really are </v>

916
00:43:49.991 --> 00:43:49.991
<v Speaker 2>getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

917
00:43:49.991 --> 00:43:51.650
<v Speaker 2>gradually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that accumulates over time.</v>

918
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things with the flow of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

919
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 2>we are actually getting more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We meaning Americans,</v>

920
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:03.791
<v Speaker 2>but also worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is this trend of getting more </v>

921
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:03.791
<v Speaker 2>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more tolerant,</v>

922
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 2>more progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:10.061
<v Speaker 2>hard to tell day by day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you think that in the 19 </v>

924
00:44:10.061 --> 00:44:11.990
<v Speaker 2>sixties there was a debate over whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be racial segregation,</v>

925
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:17.020
<v Speaker 2>whether African Americans should drink </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a different water fountains or stay </v>

926
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 2>in different motels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's debate over whether women should</v>

927
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 2>be allowed in the workplace that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

928
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:22.550
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen to all the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

929
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:23.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

930
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're all working,</v>

931
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.280
<v Speaker 2>debate over whether gay people should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to be teachers.</v>

932
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've kind of forgotten these </v>

933
00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:33.730
<v Speaker 2>because the progressive</v>

934
00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.250
<v Speaker 3>side kind of one and the debate has </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved on and that happens worldwide as </v>

935
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as information flows,</v>

936
00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 3>as people start to meet each other as </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas proliferate,</v>

937
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:48.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is this gradual trend toward more </v>

938
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 3>tolerance even in parts of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it seems to be totally absent.</v>

939
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Like in a lot of the Islamic world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which world survey show this is the </v>

940
00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:01.401
<v Speaker 3>least progressive part of the world in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of attitudes towards women </v>

941
00:45:01.401 --> 00:45:02.940
<v Speaker 3>attitudes towards gays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attitudes toward child rearing.</v>

942
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:08.150
<v Speaker 3>But even the Islamic world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a drift in the liberal </v>

943
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just thought two weeks ago when Saudi</v>

944
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 3>Arabia allowed women to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

945
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.640
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of modest form of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of Hilarious,</v>

946
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.140
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

947
00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 3>the progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>

948
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.150
<v Speaker 3>But it shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

949
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 3>they just could not live in this absurd </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation forever.</v>

950
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.680
<v Speaker 3>The world really did drag them kicking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and screaming out of the Middle Ages in </v>

951
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:27.680
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this way,</v>

952
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of tends to happen over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the long run.</v>

953
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

954
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm an optimist and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

955
00:45:33.181 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Look at all these trends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll,</v>

956
00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:39.501
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll like the book then 75 or 75 </v>

957
00:45:39.501 --> 00:45:39.501
<v Speaker 3>optimistic graphs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

958
00:45:39.501 --> 00:45:39.501
<v Speaker 3>excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

959
00:45:39.501 --> 00:45:44.241
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you look at just the </v>

960
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:44.241
<v Speaker 3>overall human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

961
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:48.291
<v Speaker 3>one of the best indications of that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>go and look at media representations of </v>

962
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:51.660
<v Speaker 3>life from the 19 fifties and sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch movies,</v>

963
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Speaker 3>especially from the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just see how people behave.</v>

964
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

965
00:45:56.161 --> 00:46:01.161
<v Speaker 3>you're getting sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a timestamp of human interaction from </v>

966
00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:06.171
<v Speaker 3>1950.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously an artistic </v>

967
00:46:06.171 --> 00:46:06.171
<v Speaker 3>representation of a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't have that time,</v>

968
00:46:06.171 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 3>but you get a sense of how people </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it was okay to behave.</v>

969
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:11.490
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of smacking women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

970
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:12.610
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

971
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Really common in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

972
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 3>And children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember the scene where you know,</v>

973
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.440
<v Speaker 3>junior would misbehave and mom would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

974
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 3>wait till your father gets home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then dad comes home and he pulls the</v>

975
00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:25.230
<v Speaker 3>belt out of his pants so he could use it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a weapon.</v>

976
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:30.110
<v Speaker 3>So buckle would really hurt the child </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the child would tie up a,</v>

977
00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 3>a pillow on his behind and it'd be stars</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go off into the corner.</v>

978
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Now you'd call social services and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>take the child away or something.</v>

979
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

980
00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:45.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think this idea of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragged kicking and screaming into this </v>

981
00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Speaker 3>new age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're all doing that and I think</v>

982
00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing that in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of our culture today.</v>

983
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:57.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the things that's </v>

984
00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.581
<v Speaker 3>happening with this meat too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Movement is it all this mass public </v>

985
00:46:58.581 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 3>shaming of sexual harassers and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>assaults and all this different thing.</v>

986
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like forcing human beings to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reassess the way they interact with each</v>

987
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:11.241
<v Speaker 3>other and like this really radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very quick sort of a movement over just </v>

988
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 3>a short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a giant impact on culture?</v>

989
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like a lot of social changes,</v>

990
00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:19.470
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens really quickly,</v>

991
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 3>probably mixes some good things and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so good things,</v>

992
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:23.240
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

993
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.280
<v Speaker 3>and it's really good that men no longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a license to just expose themselves</v>

994
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:29.240
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or</v>

995
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.740
<v Speaker 2>harass a woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who worked for them and treat them these</v>

996
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.770
<v Speaker 2>crude and ugly waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

997
00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.510
<v Speaker 2>when there is also a legitimate concern </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

998
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't really believe all </v>

999
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:45.900
<v Speaker 2>accusers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1000
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:46.410
<v Speaker 2>we kind of learned that through history </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1001
00:47:46.411 --> 00:47:46.940
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1002
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>witch hunts and lynchings and a pogroms </v>

1003
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.300
<v Speaker 2>and there's got to be proportionality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all infractions are,</v>

1004
00:47:54.301 --> 00:47:55.210
<v Speaker 2>are the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1005
00:47:55.211 --> 00:48:00.211
<v Speaker 2>the punishment should fit the crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we haven't quite settled in how to </v>

1006
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:03.661
<v Speaker 2>balance the very necessary corrective to</v>
<v Speaker 2>two men harassing women with a kind of </v>

1007
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 2>rule of law and standards of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of justice.</v>

1008
00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

1009
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.160
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is one of my theories is,</v>

1010
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1011
00:48:13.001 --> 00:48:18.001
<v Speaker 1>our brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our capacity and our understanding is </v>

1012
00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:19.510
<v Speaker 1>relative to what's necessary at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1013
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I use is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dunbar's number.</v>

1014
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Dunbar's number is this idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could only have these intimate </v>

1015
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.451
<v Speaker 1>relationships with 150 or so people or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of intimacy of understanding </v>

1016
00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:35.410
<v Speaker 1>who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing their name,</v>

1017
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:40.440
<v Speaker 1>knowing things about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as our circle of people that we </v>

1018
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:45.271
<v Speaker 1>interact with grows and expands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's going to expand as </v>

1019
00:48:45.271 --> 00:48:49.201
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about the amount of </v>

1020
00:48:49.201 --> 00:48:50.941
<v Speaker 1>information that people can hold in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their brain and what people are used to </v>

1021
00:48:50.941 --> 00:48:55.080
<v Speaker 1>knowing about this is a radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>different world in 2018 than it was in </v>

1022
00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 1>1960.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of things that you were aware</v>

1023
00:48:58.121 --> 00:49:03.121
<v Speaker 1>of in 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by virtue of not having social </v>

1024
00:49:03.121 --> 00:49:03.121
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet,</v>

1025
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different ways that you could </v>

1026
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:08.950
<v Speaker 1>get information from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so different.</v>

1027
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

1028
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.380
<v Speaker 1>how many times more information you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

1029
00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:19.381
<v Speaker 1>but it must be much more much more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over an incredibly small period of time.</v>

1030
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.810
<v Speaker 1>When you think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:49:21.811 --> 00:49:26.811
<v Speaker 1>the relative time span that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been here a few hundred thousand </v>

1032
00:49:26.811 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 1>years or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this is.</v>

1033
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we're changing and I wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to be like if this </v>

1034
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.740
<v Speaker 1>continues to grow and continues to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of our life.</v>

1035
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to adapt our abilities,</v>

1036
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:48.370
<v Speaker 2>well we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to change the neuro,</v>

1037
00:49:48.381 --> 00:49:50.180
<v Speaker 2>biological structure of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:49:50.181 --> 00:49:54.230
<v Speaker 2>very much because even though we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned through our lives,</v>

1039
00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.660
<v Speaker 2>there are limits as to what our brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain can do.</v>

1040
00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:01.930
<v Speaker 2>But what I think happens is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth between our brains and </v>

1041
00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:06.461
<v Speaker 2>the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the technology adjusts to take into </v>

1042
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:06.830
<v Speaker 2>account how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how our brains work.</v>

1043
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:07.950
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1044
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:11.750
<v Speaker 2>the restriction of can't know or feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1045
00:50:11.751 --> 00:50:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 100,</v>

1046
00:50:12.561 --> 00:50:17.561
<v Speaker 2>150 people in kind of helps define the </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of top,</v>

1047
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.010
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rank friends in a social network.</v>

1048
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're visual creatures,</v>

1049
00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:24.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1050
00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:25.700
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're primates.</v>

1051
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.340
<v Speaker 2>We get a lot of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to our eyeballs.</v>

1052
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology has changed so much since the</v>

1053
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:38.200
<v Speaker 2>eighties and seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I first learned to program a </v>

1054
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.811
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just all text and a or use a </v>

1055
00:50:40.811 --> 00:50:40.811
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

1056
00:50:40.811 --> 00:50:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're just 80 characters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aligned and you had the letters of the </v>

1057
00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:48.341
<v Speaker 2>alphabet and that's all there was and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon became clear that a,</v>

1058
00:50:49.031 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 2>that's not a very efficient way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ideas into a brain.</v>

1059
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:56.450
<v Speaker 2>It's really laborious and tiring and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have graphic user user interfaces.</v>

1060
00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean the apple was the first to </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercialize it,</v>

1061
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:01.910
<v Speaker 2>but it had been developed beforehand at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Xerox,</v>

1062
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:07.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's really exotic at first when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw a screen with these windows and </v>

1063
00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.860
<v Speaker 2>pointers and icons and a mouse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers don't work that way.</v>

1064
00:51:09.861 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Naturally you took a huge amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still does.</v>

1065
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Takes a huge amount of programming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a computer to pretend that there's a</v>

1066
00:51:16.071 --> 00:51:21.071
<v Speaker 2>sheet of paper up on the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that because we're visual creatures,</v>

1067
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 2>the technology adapted so that we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel comfortable using it.</v>

1068
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.240
<v Speaker 2>So some of it is how much do we adjust </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the technology and how much is the </v>

1069
00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.240
<v Speaker 2>technology forced to adjust to us.</v>

1070
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking in terms of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability of the human mind and when </v>

1071
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you read about the modern human brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was an article that was </v>

1072
00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 1>published recently that was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read a map,</v>

1073
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:51.851
<v Speaker 1>the timeline of the modern human brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they were pointing to about </v>

1074
00:51:51.851 --> 00:51:56.621
<v Speaker 1>35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago now and see if we can find </v>

1075
00:51:56.621 --> 00:52:00.671
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure out what exactly they </v>

1076
00:52:00.671 --> 00:52:03.071
<v Speaker 1>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but essentially they were saying that </v>

1077
00:52:03.071 --> 00:52:04.721
<v Speaker 1>the human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern human brain was far more </v>

1078
00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:05.550
<v Speaker 1>recent or interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1079
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Well I would have guessed a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>older than that,</v>

1081
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:11.960
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the tens of thousands of years.</v>

1082
00:52:11.961 --> 00:52:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.790
<v Speaker 1>So with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big mysteries,</v>

1084
00:52:14.791 --> 00:52:18.300
<v Speaker 1>right is the doubling of the human brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>size over a period of what it was like 2</v>

1085
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.300
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This something had happened to cause </v>

1086
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.931
<v Speaker 1>that some change in our environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some changing our behavior and our what </v>

1087
00:52:26.931 --> 00:52:27.990
<v Speaker 1>has been a bigger change in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>

1088
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Like what has been a bigger change and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the access to information that people </v>

1089
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:35.961
<v Speaker 1>have today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm wondering if like we're not </v>

1090
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:38.691
<v Speaker 1>experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about these rises </v>

1091
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:38.691
<v Speaker 1>steady rise of Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's not just the internet,</v>

1092
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:43.660
<v Speaker 1>it's education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cumulative data that people just </v>

1093
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.090
<v Speaker 1>keep piling onto and more people learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>more things and people get wiser and you</v>

1094
00:52:45.091 --> 00:52:45.400
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1095
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the way we interface with information is</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than it's ever been before.</v>

1096
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.760
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder about the capacity and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities of the human mind.</v>

1097
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:57.750
<v Speaker 1>If it's happening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a very gradual thing.</v>

1098
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:01.680
<v Speaker 1>This 10 percent tick or 10 point tick </v>
<v Speaker 1>per,</v>

1099
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:04.670
<v Speaker 1>per decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is going to lead you,</v>

1100
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.720
<v Speaker 1>you extrapolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go 100 years from now,</v>

1101
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:07.760
<v Speaker 1>200 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

1102
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.030
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to be looking at?</v>

1103
00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.270
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that what happened over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last few tens of thousands of years,</v>

1104
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:18.550
<v Speaker 2>it is not going to be replicated anytime</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon because that was driven by </v>

1105
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian natural selection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just meant that smarter people had</v>

1106
00:53:21.581 --> 00:53:26.581
<v Speaker 2>more surviving babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a process that as a speed limit </v>

1107
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:28.020
<v Speaker 2>measured in generations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1108
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:29.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1109
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:34.140
<v Speaker 2>it may not be that coping in a modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>society makes you have more babies.</v>

1110
00:53:34.141 --> 00:53:36.470
<v Speaker 2>And maybe the other way round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1111
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 2>as you're more educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have fewer children.</v>

1112
00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think a lot of the,</v>

1113
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:46.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a certain amount of </v>

1114
00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:47.100
<v Speaker 2>plasticity of what you can master in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own lifetime,</v>

1115
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.040
<v Speaker 2>especially if you start in childhood a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to,</v>

1116
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these skills become second </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

1117
00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 2>How to look things up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>

1118
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to use these devices efficiently.</v>

1119
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.670
<v Speaker 2>And then that will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1120
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 2>can reach limits that only so many hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the day.</v>

1121
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.850
<v Speaker 2>And there was only so many neurons in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>

1122
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:11.270
<v Speaker 2>But in conjunction with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technology becomes more human </v>

1123
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:15.351
<v Speaker 2>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are new ways of getting </v>

1124
00:54:15.351 --> 00:54:15.351
<v Speaker 2>information into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1125
00:54:15.351 --> 00:54:18.480
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've gone from just lines of characters</v>

1126
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 2>to graphic user interfaces and video </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1127
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.780
<v Speaker 2>and more like creative data graphics </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you see moving colored graphs as a</v>

1128
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Speaker 2>way of getting a bunch of variables into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human head more efficiently.</v>

1129
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:35.690
<v Speaker 2>And virtual reality might be the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>step where we bought three d </v>

1130
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:37.020
<v Speaker 2>environments that we can explore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1131
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:41.730
<v Speaker 2>and that may be a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting our puny brains to experience</v>

1132
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.470
<v Speaker 2>more information.</v>

1133
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to bring that up to you next</v>

1134
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that concerns </v>

1135
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.930
<v Speaker 1>me the most is how good virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is now,</v>

1136
00:54:50.931 --> 00:54:55.100
<v Speaker 1>but how relatively crude it is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to the potential.</v>

1137
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:59.630
<v Speaker 1>And have you experienced it at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you used like an htc vive or any of</v>

1138
00:54:59.631 --> 00:55:00.000
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1139
00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I've used more kind of lower tech kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>

1140
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google cardboard and uh,</v>

1141
00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.460
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still pretty interesting,</v>

1142
00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but the vibe will freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one of the things,</v>

1143
00:55:10.941 --> 00:55:12.980
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used,</v>

1144
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several years ago,</v>

1145
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:20.291
<v Speaker 1>his version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my friend Duncan trussell had </v>

1146
00:55:20.291 --> 00:55:20.660
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three years ago that I used and I</v>

1147
00:55:20.661 --> 00:55:25.661
<v Speaker 1>was blown away by that where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater and there's a whale swims up </v>

1148
00:55:25.661 --> 00:55:29.711
<v Speaker 1>to you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems so real and it's get </v>

1149
00:55:29.711 --> 00:55:29.900
<v Speaker 1>nauseous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1150
00:55:29.901 --> 00:55:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1151
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:31.810
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1152
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.770
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously fake.</v>

1153
00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm looking at it and I can make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction quickly.</v>

1154
00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see a movie and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie there's like fake dogs or </v>

1155
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.910
<v Speaker 1>something like that or fake monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1156
00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fake thing.</v>

1157
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:50.080
<v Speaker 1>It's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good fake and I'm,</v>

1158
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can recognize it as a fake,</v>

1159
00:55:51.621 --> 00:55:52.280
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1160
00:55:52.281 --> 00:55:53.780
<v Speaker 1>what is this going to be like in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

1161
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:59.080
<v Speaker 1>What is it gonna be like in 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be and how much better is </v>

1162
00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.621
<v Speaker 1>the interface going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really concerned that there's going </v>

1163
00:56:02.621 --> 00:56:05.120
<v Speaker 1>to be a just a giant section of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>population that completely checks out of</v>

1164
00:56:05.121 --> 00:56:08.690
<v Speaker 1>the regular world and lives in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange fantasy land.</v>

1165
00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time they just consumed food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and water and figure out a way to feed </v>

1166
00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.150
<v Speaker 1>themselves and spend most of their time </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked into a helmet,</v>

1167
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:22.280
<v Speaker 1>living in some fantastic artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that people have created.</v>

1168
00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1169
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.650
<v Speaker 2>although just putting things into </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1170
00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:31.850
<v Speaker 2>there were that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fears when television became </v>

1171
00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:35.251
<v Speaker 2>popular even before that with movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the question of what kind of </v>

1172
00:56:35.251 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 2>balance people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will find.</v>

1173
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly it's going to be more of exactly</v>

1174
00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 2>what you describe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1175
00:56:39.311 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 2>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do like reality to,</v>

1176
00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1177
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1178
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:48.870
<v Speaker 2>in huge numbers go to the national parks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just seeing a picture book isn't the</v>

1179
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:51.970
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people care whether,</v>

1180
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they buy a work of art,</v>

1181
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:55.620
<v Speaker 2>they care whether it's real or fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1182
00:56:55.621 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one part of the human mind that,</v>

1183
00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:01.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as we're seduced by just sensual</v>

1184
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.210
<v Speaker 2>sensory experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also,</v>

1185
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.580
<v Speaker 2>we have a sense of reality and we value </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1186
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.030
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 2>we don't like being fooled too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1188
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is what balance we find </v>

1189
00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.021
<v Speaker 2>between the desire for authentic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and the pleasure of these </v>

1190
00:57:19.021 --> 00:57:20.350
<v Speaker 2>cheap artificial ones.</v>

1191
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:25.790
<v Speaker 1>When you chose to write a book about </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment and you chose to write a </v>

1192
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:29.001
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the showing all these positive graphs </v>

1193
00:57:29.001 --> 00:57:30.720
<v Speaker 1>and all these trends that seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic.</v>

1194
00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing that obviously you feel this</v>

1195
00:57:36.991 --> 00:57:41.991
<v Speaker 1>way and this is the data and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>your interpretation of where we're </v>

1196
00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:45.861
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But are you also kind of like </v>

1197
00:57:45.861 --> 00:57:49.940
<v Speaker 1>encouraging people in a way to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more rose colored view of the world and </v>

1198
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.830
<v Speaker 1>just understand that</v>

1199
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 2>not so much rose colored but a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>description.</v>

1200
00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have a kind of problem solving </v>

1201
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.960
<v Speaker 2>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely,</v>

1202
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 2>we have solved problems in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least we've,</v>

1203
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:08.310
<v Speaker 2>we've reduced them and that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>emboldens us to say,</v>

1204
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.060
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problems we have now and think,</v>

1205
00:58:10.061 --> 00:58:15.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can handle those two if we decide to </v>

1206
00:58:15.061 --> 00:58:17.470
<v Speaker 2>do now what our ancestors did in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past that led in the right directions.</v>

1207
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.570
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I credit this to the,</v>

1208
00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 2>a mindset of the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely that with reason and science and </v>

1209
00:58:25.511 --> 00:58:30.511
<v Speaker 2>a concern for human welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can gradually make people better off </v>

1210
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:34.280
<v Speaker 2>and as long as we maintain that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of,</v>

1211
00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of living,</v>

1212
00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we,</v>

1213
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.180
<v Speaker 2>then there's a reasonable hope that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can solve the problems facing us.</v>

1214
00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:41.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>

1215
00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic escalator.</v>

1216
00:58:42.881 --> 00:58:44.100
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1217
00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a arc of history or dialectic or any </v>

1218
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 2>mystical stuff that just makes us better</v>
<v Speaker 2>and better.</v>

1219
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a recognizing problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how the world works and </v>

1220
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.060
<v Speaker 2>doing our best to solve them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

1221
00:58:58.061 --> 00:59:03.061
<v Speaker 2>that was the message and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have had progress contrary to the </v>

1222
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:07.141
<v Speaker 2>impressions you get from the headlines </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that this is not a crazy </v>

1223
00:59:07.141 --> 00:59:08.500
<v Speaker 2>idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic pipe dream.</v>

1224
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 2>It's happened and some more of it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1225
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I was going with this is </v>

1226
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.950
<v Speaker 1>that why do we have this desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the negative?</v>

1227
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Ian Edwards has this bit about</v>

1228
00:59:20.461 --> 00:59:25.461
<v Speaker 1>the news about renaming it to the bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>news and he goes on this whole rant </v>

1229
00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:26.950
<v Speaker 1>about the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out,</v>

1230
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.870
<v Speaker 1>but he's right and it is a thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

1231
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Is it because we have this concern like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to recognize danger and we want </v>

1232
00:59:35.351 --> 00:59:38.120
<v Speaker 1>to know what's happening so that we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're safe.</v>

1233
00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:42.680
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is we're dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of 7 billion people with 7 billion</v>

1234
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1235
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:49.181
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna be able to see negative </v>

1236
00:59:49.181 --> 00:59:50.060
<v Speaker 1>stuff all day long if you so choose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

1237
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:54.230
<v Speaker 1>If you so choose to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 1>negativity and it gives you this bizarre</v>

1238
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:57.890
<v Speaker 1>portrait of the world that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just this horrible place,</v>

1239
00:59:57.891 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 1>and the bill Hicks used to have a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about CNN,</v>

1240
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.280
<v Speaker 1>about watching CNN and it'd be death </v>
<v Speaker 1>aids,</v>

1241
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.400
<v Speaker 1>pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go outside</v>

1242
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Chirp and where's all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening?</v>

1243
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1244
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:12.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great examples.</v>

1245
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>We concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is our desire to concentrate only </v>

1246
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>on the negative or mostly on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative?</v>

1247
01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a phenomenon in psychology </v>

1248
01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.401
<v Speaker 2>called the negativity bias that bad is </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically stronger than good.</v>

1249
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So we dragged that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We dread losses more than we enjoy gains</v>

1250
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and criticism hurts much more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>praise makes you feel better.</v>

1251
01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're our,</v>

1252
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:37.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1253
01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:40.930
<v Speaker 2>our minds are attracted to possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1254
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:44.530
<v Speaker 2>of death and danger and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because we are really,</v>

1255
01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.030
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are vulnerable.</v>

1256
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:48.610
<v Speaker 2>There are many more things that could go</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong then could go right.</v>

1257
01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of a implication of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>law of entropy.</v>

1258
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tiny fraction of the way the </v>

1259
01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.731
<v Speaker 2>world could work that works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>works out well for you in an awful lot </v>

1260
01:00:59.731 --> 01:01:02.491
<v Speaker 2>of ways that things can go wrong and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>our minds are attuned to things that </v>

1261
01:01:02.491 --> 01:01:06.991
<v Speaker 2>could go wrong and that kind of opens up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a market for experts to remind us of </v>

1262
01:01:06.991 --> 01:01:09.790
<v Speaker 2>things that can go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we may have forgotten and so the the</v>

1263
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.990
<v Speaker 2>news tends to gravitate to the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are actually studies that show</v>

1264
01:01:13.991 --> 01:01:18.991
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You give editors a two different </v>

1265
01:01:18.991 --> 01:01:22.620
<v Speaker 2>framings of an event and optimistic one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a pessimistic when they pick the </v>

1266
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.800
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic one and that's a trend </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually increased.</v>

1267
01:01:23.801 --> 01:01:28.801
<v Speaker 2>I have a graph in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the 75 graphs that shows a an </v>

1268
01:01:28.801 --> 01:01:31.510
<v Speaker 2>automatic analysis of the tone of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

1269
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.200
<v Speaker 2>That is how often are there positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>words like improve better?</v>

1270
01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:38.050
<v Speaker 2>How often do their negative words like </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis disaster,</v>

1271
01:01:38.051 --> 01:01:43.051
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The news has been getting more and more </v>

1272
01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:43.051
<v Speaker 2>negative for about 70 years.</v>

1273
01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Is it uniform on both sides?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1274
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:44.680
<v Speaker 1>and left.</v>

1275
01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 2>A good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer.</v>

1276
01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I suspect it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

1277
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were there fluctuations,</v>

1278
01:01:52.181 --> 01:01:54.680
<v Speaker 2>there are ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but overall the trend has been downward.</v>

1279
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>So partly it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>

1280
01:01:56.151 --> 01:02:01.151
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other graphs in the book show </v>

1281
01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:01.151
<v Speaker 2>that in reality the world is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>been getting better.</v>

1282
01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:05.831
<v Speaker 2>There are fewer deaths from war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fewer homicides were making some</v>

1283
01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:11.201
<v Speaker 2>progress in a pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's less poverty than there used to </v>

1284
01:02:11.201 --> 01:02:12.020
<v Speaker 2>be more education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1285
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 2>but the news has been getting more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more morose.</v>

1286
01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is also that there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an ethic of journalism that to </v>

1287
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>be responsible as point out what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1288
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>One editor said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good good news isn't news.</v>

1289
01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:29.811
<v Speaker 2>It's advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also because of the timescale </v>

1290
01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 2>that it's very easy to destroy something</v>
<v Speaker 2>really quickly.</v>

1291
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something blows up and uh,</v>

1292
01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:39.270
<v Speaker 2>that's news improvements tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>gradual day by day and there's never a </v>

1293
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Thursday in March in which something </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens that is,</v>

1294
01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:42.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1295
01:02:42.521 --> 01:02:44.580
<v Speaker 2>as Max Roser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an economist Paul pointed out,</v>

1296
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 2>newspapers could run the headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 38,000</v>

1297
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 2>people escaped from extreme poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

1298
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.700
<v Speaker 2>every day for the last 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they never ran that headline even </v>

1299
01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:00.411
<v Speaker 2>once because there was never a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular day in which the hundred and </v>

1300
01:03:00.411 --> 01:03:02.100
<v Speaker 2>38,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were different than 138,000</v>

1301
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>people the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

1302
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the good things kind of creep </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on us and they're never reported in </v>

1303
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:12.741
<v Speaker 2>headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas it's easy to blow something up </v>

1304
01:03:12.741 --> 01:03:12.741
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does happen on a Thursday.</v>

1305
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:17.870
<v Speaker 2>So you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very positive view of the future of </v>

1306
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.870
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1307
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:18.860
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1308
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:19.230
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1309
01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:20.160
<v Speaker 2>the great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1310
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Swedish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1311
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.900
<v Speaker 2>a dot Ted Takstar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hans Rosling put it when he was asked,</v>

1312
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.070
<v Speaker 2>are you an optimist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1313
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:27.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an optimist.</v>

1314
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:32.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very serious possible list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens in the future?</v>

1315
01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:37.800
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what we do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are real threats and dangers.</v>

1316
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a possibility of nuclear war.</v>

1317
01:03:40.351 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a possibility of catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change.</v>

1318
01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 2>So we can't sit back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1319
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:48.660
<v Speaker 2>things have gotten better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's let them continue.</v>

1320
01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:52.050
<v Speaker 2>By sheer inertia or momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna happen,</v>

1321
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.900
<v Speaker 2>but what it does indicate is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1322
01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:58.710
<v Speaker 2>we face crises in the past and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have made things better.</v>

1323
01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Let's figure out how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>crises.</v>

1324
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:00.900
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1325
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:06.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way of looking at it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be realistic about it because the </v>

1326
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:08.970
<v Speaker 1>possibility of positive things is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1327
01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also there's a reason why we find </v>

1328
01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>those ruins in Guatemala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are there anymore.</v>

1329
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean thriving culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of structures,</v>

1330
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>and now it's a jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened?</v>

1331
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1332
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 2>it's wise to remember that that can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1333
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Didn't become Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1334
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a difference between </v>

1335
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:38.070
<v Speaker 2>modern all modern societies and all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that did collapse.</v>

1336
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Namely that after the enlightenment we </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed a kind of a scientific network</v>

1337
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:51.050
<v Speaker 2>and community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We develop the habit of free speech and </v>

1338
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:55.251
<v Speaker 2>open debate and accumulation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information in written in an electronic </v>

1339
01:04:55.471 --> 01:04:56.580
<v Speaker 2>records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1340
01:04:56.581 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 2>it is not the same now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that we're out of danger</v>

1341
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>because we've created new dangers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1342
01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nuclear war,</v>

1343
01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:07.070
<v Speaker 2>like climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is a,</v>

1344
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are mechanisms in place that if we</v>

1345
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:13.680
<v Speaker 2>concentrate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we are determined to keep doing it,</v>

1346
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:17.160
<v Speaker 2>then there's a reasonable expectation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>success again,</v>

1347
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:19.360
<v Speaker 2>but not automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to decide to make.</v>

1348
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.500
<v Speaker 2>We've got to make those choices.</v>

1349
01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1350
01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1351
01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of the human race is so </v>

1352
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.101
<v Speaker 1>weird in terms of the rise and fall of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these civilizations and cultures that </v>

1353
01:05:31.171 --> 01:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>were always a least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am always looking at like what,</v>

1354
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:39.950
<v Speaker 1>how long is this going to last?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how long has this one particular </v>

1355
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>nation going to keep it together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at how many different</v>

1356
01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.730
<v Speaker 1>countries have been around that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how many,</v>

1357
01:05:44.731 --> 01:05:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant culture is Rome for instance.</v>

1358
01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Like just now it's just Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just normal,</v>

1359
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a normal European country.</v>

1360
01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It used to be this conquering nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

1361
01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.200
<v Speaker 1>how long can we keep this thing up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts on the future of,</v>

1362
01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>of just even the idea of nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like our bout our boundaries </v>

1363
01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and our borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we have a online,</v>

1364
01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:15.180
<v Speaker 1>this ability to communicate with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the place,</v>

1365
01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to lessen the necessary </v>

1366
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.460
<v Speaker 1>or the need rather for for borders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1367
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>for these walls that we're now literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>and figuratively talking about putting </v>

1368
01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:29.220
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1369
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I think there's going to be a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

1370
01:06:32.501 --> 01:06:37.501
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting thing about nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>states now is that there is a sense in </v>

1371
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.660
<v Speaker 2>which they're treated as immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whereas as you mentioned for most </v>

1372
01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 2>of history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were conquering.</v>

1373
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:49.051
<v Speaker 2>Emperors and a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nations were wiped off the map and </v>

1374
01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:54.700
<v Speaker 2>engulfed and conquered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're now you look at a map of the </v>

1375
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:54.700
<v Speaker 2>world and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1376
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 2>it's actually not that different from </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was 70 years ago.</v>

1377
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are colonies that achieved </v>

1378
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.661
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some big states like Soviet </v>

1379
01:07:03.661 --> 01:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Union that broke fragmented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the borders in between the ribs,</v>

1380
01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:10.791
<v Speaker 2>Soviet republics are now borders between</v>
<v Speaker 2>nation states and no nation has gone out</v>

1381
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>of existence through conquest since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1382
01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.640
<v Speaker 2>since 1945,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least internationally recognized </v>

1383
01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 2>state by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the UN.</v>

1384
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:21.970
<v Speaker 2>So there's this norm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the borders are often,</v>

1385
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1386
01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Then they were arbitrary lines drawn a </v>
<v Speaker 2>map.</v>

1387
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.060
<v Speaker 2>But one of the reasons that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1388
01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:33.070
<v Speaker 2>this is counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wars have gone down and deaths and </v>

1389
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.241
<v Speaker 2>wars have gone down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that borders are now treated as </v>

1390
01:07:36.241 --> 01:07:37.570
<v Speaker 2>sacrosanct by the kind of international </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

1391
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Not One hundred percent of the time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had Russia annexing Crimea,</v>

1392
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:46.420
<v Speaker 2>but those are exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by and large unlike say in the past,</v>

1393
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:50.770
<v Speaker 2>in the 19th century where the US had an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpaid debt from Mexico,</v>

1394
01:07:50.771 --> 01:07:51.980
<v Speaker 2>so it conquered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1395
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Texas and Colorado and Nevada and </v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

1396
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't happen anymore.</v>

1397
01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And so the board has kind of been </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfathered in and that's one of the </v>

1398
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:02.700
<v Speaker 2>reasons why the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1399
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1400
01:08:03.101 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 2>the world has been more stable in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

1401
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:05.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the map.</v>

1402
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you mentioned,</v>

1403
01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:12.481
<v Speaker 2>there's another sense in which we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this global community that transcends </v>

1404
01:08:12.481 --> 01:08:12.940
<v Speaker 2>borders.</v>

1405
01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 2>We have things like the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the United Nations,</v>

1406
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.700
<v Speaker 2>we have a trade agreements like Nafta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which try to get simultaneously the </v>

1407
01:08:22.581 --> 01:08:27.500
<v Speaker 2>grandfathered borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this extra layer of cooperation that</v>

1408
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.300
<v Speaker 2>transcends the borders and we need them </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more despite the fact that our,</v>

1409
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:36.230
<v Speaker 2>our current president is pushing back </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the global community,</v>

1410
01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:40.490
<v Speaker 2>but because there are problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>global that my migration,</v>

1411
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 2>terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate pollution,</v>

1412
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>rogue states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that people,</v>

1413
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:50.260
<v Speaker 2>even if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you grew up in France and you </v>

1414
01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.231
<v Speaker 2>consider yourself a French citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be able to spend a summer </v>

1415
01:08:53.231 --> 01:08:53.231
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1416
01:08:53.231 --> 01:08:53.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1417
01:08:53.231 --> 01:08:58.230
<v Speaker 2>in Italy or in England or in Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's where there's a good job and </v>

1418
01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:03.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a desire among people to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to move to wherever the opportunities </v>

1419
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:07.091
<v Speaker 2>are best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's going to be some kind of </v>

1420
01:09:07.091 --> 01:09:07.091
<v Speaker 2>compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1421
01:09:07.091 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 2>between keeping the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1422
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:12.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nation state borders just so you </v>

1423
01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:12.740
<v Speaker 2>don't have constant wars of conquest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>border disputes,</v>

1424
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.820
<v Speaker 2>but allowing the world and allowing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people of the world to take advantage of</v>

1425
01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:18.080
<v Speaker 2>a true global community.</v>

1426
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's one of the things </v>

1427
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that people were most upset about brexit</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that this is a,</v>

1428
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:30.190
<v Speaker 1>even though they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that were pro brexit felt </v>

1429
01:09:30.190 --> 01:09:33.371
<v Speaker 1>like this was in the interest of the UK </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the interest of England to be </v>

1430
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:38.531
<v Speaker 1>separate from all this because they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing better and because they didn't </v>

1431
01:09:38.531 --> 01:09:41.360
<v Speaker 1>want all the negative possibilities from</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other places coming into their</v>

1432
01:09:41.361 --> 01:09:43.960
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1433
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:49.300
<v Speaker 1>what I think that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they didn't like about it was the </v>

1434
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:53.891
<v Speaker 1>idea that this is a regressive move and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the progressive move is that we </v>

1435
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:59.771
<v Speaker 1>would all move towards this idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>global community of this entire world </v>

1436
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:05.210
<v Speaker 1>being free and connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1437
01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.590
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1438
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:10.340
<v Speaker 1>some of the problems that Paris has with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immigration.</v>

1439
01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:12.780
<v Speaker 1>We showed some of the videos of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1440
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:17.860
<v Speaker 1>these immigrants that are just littered </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the street and taking this </v>

1441
01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:17.860
<v Speaker 1>place apart.</v>

1442
01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.230
<v Speaker 1>And we're looking at it going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1443
01:10:18.231 --> 01:10:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a real tragedy.</v>

1444
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>But what it represents is a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that really don't have anything.</v>

1445
01:10:25.791 --> 01:10:30.791
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real tragedy is that these people </v>

1446
01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:32.501
<v Speaker 1>live like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real tragedy is not that they've </v>

1447
01:10:32.501 --> 01:10:34.991
<v Speaker 1>done it to Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real tragedy is that these people </v>

1448
01:10:34.991 --> 01:10:37.661
<v Speaker 1>exist at all and that they moved to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris looking for a better life and now </v>

1449
01:10:37.661 --> 01:10:39.740
<v Speaker 1>they're stuck in the situation where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know there's not a lot of sanitation and</v>

1450
01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:44.150
<v Speaker 1>the garbage is all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're literally everywhere and it's.</v>

1451
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we ever will have a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there isn't a place where you can </v>

1452
01:10:50.991 --> 01:10:55.991
<v Speaker 1>go and ship a factory and pay people a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar an hour because they don't need a</v>

1453
01:10:56.090 --> 01:11:01.090
<v Speaker 1>dollar an hour because it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in Los Angeles or just like </v>

1454
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:05.111
<v Speaker 1>living in Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would never be able to pay </v>

1455
01:11:05.111 --> 01:11:05.540
<v Speaker 1>someone a dollar an hour because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much opportunity.</v>

1456
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.780
<v Speaker 1>The world has caught up and surpassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1457
01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a number of really complicated </v>

1458
01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 2>issues that they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mobility is in general a good thing</v>

1459
01:11:16.891 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 2>in countries do well when they welcomed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indian immigrants,</v>

1460
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:22.410
<v Speaker 2>but not on the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Not too many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too fast.</v>

1462
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Faster than they can be assimilated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated into the new country.</v>

1463
01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 2>So it just opening the doors probably is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a good idea.</v>

1464
01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:36.570
<v Speaker 2>No country really does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but building the wall is a terrible idea</v>

1465
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:38.570
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course the,</v>

1466
01:11:38.571 --> 01:11:39.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1467
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:42.590
<v Speaker 2>the best way to prevent a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of,</v>

1468
01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 2>of migration is to make life better in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the countries of origin because that is </v>

1469
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:51.770
<v Speaker 2>happening slowly and unevenly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's been noted that even United </v>

1470
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:53.760
<v Speaker 2>States and Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people are going,</v>

1471
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:59.270
<v Speaker 2>or the same number of people are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reverse migration from the US back </v>

1472
01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 2>to Mexico now that the economy of Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much my own parents when 25 years.</v>

1473
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1474
01:12:03.631 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 2>My parents live in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1475
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:05.770
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1476
01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is a,</v>

1477
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.150
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1478
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:14.930
<v Speaker 2>a harder to detect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a huge improvement in the </v>

1479
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 2>standard of living in what used to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the third world,</v>

1480
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:17.510
<v Speaker 2>the developing world where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1481
01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the cutoff for extreme </v>

1482
01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:23.760
<v Speaker 2>poverty kind of defined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defined somewhat arbitrarily is a dollar</v>

1483
01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:26.280
<v Speaker 2>90 per person per day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the bare,</v>

1484
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:27.960
<v Speaker 2>bare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bare minimum to feed,</v>

1485
01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:29.760
<v Speaker 2>feed your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1486
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:35.290
<v Speaker 2>it's down now from a 50 percent a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades ago to 10 percent now,</v>

1487
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 2>and the United Nations have set the goal</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bringing it to zero by the year 20,</v>

1488
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what street,</v>

1489
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.660
<v Speaker 2>what is causing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's causing the change?</v>

1490
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.520
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1491
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:49.550
<v Speaker 2>globalization that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even though that's kind of a </v>

1492
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:50.800
<v Speaker 2>villain in many people's eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you have a,</v>

1493
01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:56.170
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge global market than a and the </v>

1494
01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:56.170
<v Speaker 2>introduction of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

1495
01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>factories and industrialization in </v>
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

1496
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:02.010
<v Speaker 2>in India and Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the conditions are grim,</v>

1497
01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 2>but the conditions being a peasant in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rice patties was even grimmer.</v>

1498
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.820
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a people integrated with </v>

1499
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 2>the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling their products on a world stage,</v>

1500
01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:12.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can get richer.</v>

1501
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.080
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of also better policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have governments that are no longer a</v>

1502
01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:24.740
<v Speaker 2>communist or like really heavy handed </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of socialism where everything is </v>

1503
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:29.930
<v Speaker 2>defined by the bureaucrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need 50 licenses to do anything </v>

1504
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:33.891
<v Speaker 2>and you have a little bit more economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility that tends to make the </v>

1505
01:13:33.891 --> 01:13:38.300
<v Speaker 2>country's richer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that you could do away </v>

1506
01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.920
<v Speaker 2>with regulations on workplace safety </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1507
01:13:39.921 --> 01:13:40.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1508
01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 2>environment and as countries get richer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be more protective of their</v>

1509
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:47.150
<v Speaker 2>workers and the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1510
01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:53.280
<v Speaker 2>And leaders that think of their mandate </v>
<v Speaker 2>as how do I get my country to be richer?</v>

1511
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 2>And the most dramatic case was China </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1512
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1513
01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Mao had these harebrained schemes have </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge collective farms and people </v>

1514
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.090
<v Speaker 2>smelting iron in their backyards and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1515
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.960
<v Speaker 2>anything that occurred to him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the night,</v>

1516
01:14:06.961 --> 01:14:11.961
<v Speaker 2>he would force on hundreds of millions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people and it cost these massive </v>

1517
01:14:11.961 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 2>famines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Deng,</v>

1518
01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Deng Xiaoping took over and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting Richard Good,</v>

1519
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

1520
01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 2>black cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white cat,</v>

1521
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 2>as long as it catches mice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good cat.</v>

1522
01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.320
<v Speaker 2>So much more pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more concerned with the welfare of </v>

1523
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.581
<v Speaker 2>their citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have leaders who have that </v>

1524
01:14:29.581 --> 01:14:30.250
<v Speaker 2>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the country can,</v>

1525
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:35.310
<v Speaker 2>can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get wealthier and their citizens better </v>

1526
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.310
<v Speaker 2>off</v>

1527
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:36.300
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But are you concerned?</v>

1528
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1529
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you that it is probably is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why these people are </v>

1530
01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:47.300
<v Speaker 1>experiencing this greater quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is because of globalization because</v>

1531
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:52.320
<v Speaker 1>these factories moving in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're living lives that are very </v>

1532
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.540
<v Speaker 1>different and maybe perhaps it's by our </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards that their lives are better.</v>

1533
01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>That may be if these indigenous people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were living this sort of subsistence </v>

1534
01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:03.510
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle that even though on paper they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be existing in extreme poverty,</v>

1535
01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>but if they're perhaps like living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the jungle or somewhere along those </v>

1536
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:12.861
<v Speaker 1>lines where you have access to all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resources that even though </v>

1537
01:15:12.861 --> 01:15:14.820
<v Speaker 1>they'd be living in extreme poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be living maybe,</v>

1538
01:15:14.821 --> 01:15:19.821
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even a better life by just </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating the fish and eating the plants </v>

1539
01:15:19.821 --> 01:15:22.740
<v Speaker 1>and hunting and fishing and doing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had normally done for thousands and</v>

1540
01:15:22.741 --> 01:15:26.310
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years rather than making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar an hour and a Nike factory.</v>

1541
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's certainly true that indigenous </v>

1542
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 2>peoples who are living in a hunter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>horticultural lifestyles,</v>

1543
01:15:34.851 --> 01:15:38.240
<v Speaker 2>that there are real crimes in displacing</v>
<v Speaker 2>them often.</v>

1544
01:15:38.241 --> 01:15:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Not so much by factories but by miners </v>
<v Speaker 2>and loggers.</v>

1545
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:43.470
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1546
01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:46.850
<v Speaker 2>there are a very tiny fraction of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's population,</v>

1547
01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.230
<v Speaker 2>tragically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1548
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:51.950
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of poor people or more</v>
<v Speaker 2>are peasants,</v>

1549
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:53.840
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1550
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.430
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not horticulturalists.</v>

1551
01:15:55.431 --> 01:15:56.840
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1552
01:15:56.841 --> 01:16:01.841
<v Speaker 2>they are kind of agricultural laborers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for them just based on their own </v>

1553
01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.860
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1554
01:16:03.861 --> 01:16:06.380
<v Speaker 2>often the factory life is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an improvement.</v>

1555
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.560
<v Speaker 2>It's an improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just because they're not a kind of </v>

1556
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.500
<v Speaker 2>in the fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee deep in muck a pulling up seedlings</v>

1557
01:16:14.501 --> 01:16:17.960
<v Speaker 2>and getting bitten by disease carrying a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs.</v>

1558
01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.270
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1559
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:20.850
<v Speaker 2>for women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1560
01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 2>being able to move from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a village to a city often means </v>

1561
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.910
<v Speaker 2>liberation that they can start a </v>
<v Speaker 2>business and the kids to school,</v>

1562
01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:34.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be out from under the thumbs of their </v>

1563
01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.080
<v Speaker 2>husbands and the husband's family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of can be a liberation just</v>

1564
01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:40.130
<v Speaker 2>just as what our aunts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ancestors did when they left the </v>

1565
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.970
<v Speaker 2>farms for cities a hundred and 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1566
01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.960
<v Speaker 2>So not to say there isn't exploitation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1567
01:16:44.961 --> 01:16:47.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cruelty which ought to be opposed.</v>

1568
01:16:47.661 --> 01:16:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of native peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>

1569
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal,</v>

1570
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>displacements.</v>

1571
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.520
<v Speaker 2>But on the whole globalization has led </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this escape from grinding poverty for</v>

1572
01:16:59.570 --> 01:17:01.190
<v Speaker 2>literally hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1573
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 1>So even when they moved these factories </v>
<v Speaker 1>into these places in charge or pay them </v>

1574
01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:07.190
<v Speaker 1>a dollar an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

1575
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>it still a dollar an hour than</v>

1576
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 3>they would've gotten if the factory had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been there.</v>

1577
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 3>In many cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1578
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.500
<v Speaker 3>Which exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1579
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.740
<v Speaker 3>we look at our and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1580
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.700
<v Speaker 3>my grandparents worked in a clothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>factory and uh,</v>

1581
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:26.070
<v Speaker 3>when they emigrated from Poland to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada and it often is a route to upward</v>

1582
01:17:26.961 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 3>mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1583
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:33.671
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for us to accept that or even </v>

1584
01:17:33.671 --> 01:17:33.671
<v Speaker 3>think about it that way because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1585
01:17:33.671 --> 01:17:33.671
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1586
01:17:33.671 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 3>How come they don't have to pay these </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexican folks minimum wage just like </v>

1587
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 3>they do in America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1588
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:42.821
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't they have the same sort of </v>

1589
01:17:42.821 --> 01:17:42.821
<v Speaker 3>setup we do here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just seems cruel.</v>

1590
01:17:42.821 --> 01:17:44.240
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't impair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt there is cruelty.</v>

1591
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.760
<v Speaker 3>But the relevant</v>

1592
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Harrison is not so much a difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between working in a factory there and </v>

1593
01:17:51.001 --> 01:17:52.430
<v Speaker 2>working in an office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1594
01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.000
<v Speaker 2>in Berkeley or Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the difference between working in a</v>

1595
01:17:57.001 --> 01:17:57.450
<v Speaker 2>factory</v>

1596
01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.040
<v Speaker 3>there and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1597
01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:01.150
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and laboring in the fields there.</v>

1598
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.970
<v Speaker 3>And the people are often given that </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>

1599
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:09.030
<v Speaker 3>They line up to the factory jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you anticipate a time where there is </v>

1600
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:13.321
<v Speaker 3>no third world and there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a massive economic disparity.</v>

1601
01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:15.650
<v Speaker 2>It's conceivable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1602
01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a ways off,</v>

1603
01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:20.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's happened in huge parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1604
01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:25.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we forget that places like South Korea </v>

1605
01:18:25.461 --> 01:18:25.461
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1606
01:18:25.461 --> 01:18:27.090
<v Speaker 2>this rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a upper middle class society,</v>

1607
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so long ago.</v>

1608
01:18:28.921 --> 01:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>That was the third world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1609
01:18:30.511 --> 01:18:31.680
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hungry.</v>

1610
01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.950
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1611
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:33.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1612
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:35.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the children died young.</v>

1613
01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.970
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them living in squalor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1614
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>and that was true in certainly in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of parts of places,</v>

1615
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.740
<v Speaker 2>parts of China now that are pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle class that we're a squalid not so</v>

1616
01:18:46.741 --> 01:18:48.690
<v Speaker 2>long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Singapore.</v>

1617
01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1618
01:18:50.081 --> 01:18:52.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an anecdote in the book of enlightenment</v>

1619
01:18:52.171 --> 01:18:57.171
<v Speaker 2>now with my ex mother in law who grew up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Singapore and she remembers a </v>

1620
01:18:57.171 --> 01:19:00.840
<v Speaker 2>childhood meal in which her family split</v>
<v Speaker 2>one egg for ways.</v>

1621
01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I was back in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1622
01:19:02.611 --> 01:19:07.611
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore is now one of the world's </v>

1623
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:08.310
<v Speaker 2>richest countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it can happen.</v>

1624
01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:11.730
<v Speaker 2>It is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most remote,</v>

1625
01:19:11.731 --> 01:19:16.731
<v Speaker 2>poorest parts of the world are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the hardest to bring up to middle </v>

1626
01:19:16.731 --> 01:19:16.731
<v Speaker 2>class standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1627
01:19:16.731 --> 01:19:17.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congo like Haiti,</v>

1628
01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.820
<v Speaker 2>like Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but large parts of the world.</v>

1629
01:19:20.821 --> 01:19:23.070
<v Speaker 2>There's been a huge increase in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard of living.</v>

1630
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talked recently about the dangers of</v>

1631
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:33.910
<v Speaker 3>overly politically correct thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 3>or just politically correct thinking of </v>

1632
01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.860
<v Speaker 3>have a sort of a rebound effect where </v>
<v Speaker 3>political correct thinking is actually </v>

1633
01:19:40.941 --> 01:19:42.990
<v Speaker 3>causing more extremism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1634
01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 3>more and more radical thinking in new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of response to that,</v>

1635
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:52.320
<v Speaker 3>like an overcorrection at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the top of our conversation we</v>

1636
01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 2>talked about the possibility of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sex differences as being kind of </v>

1637
01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.100
<v Speaker 2>taboo from polite company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a lot.</v>

1638
01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll give another example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is kind of connects to our </v>

1639
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.730
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a lot of academia.</v>

1640
01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>There's just capitalism is just a dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>word or something now called the Neo </v>

1641
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.780
<v Speaker 2>liberalism and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1642
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:13.560
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain percentage.</v>

1643
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large percentage of academics are </v>

1644
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:20.811
<v Speaker 2>actually Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably about 15 percent in the social </v>

1645
01:20:20.811 --> 01:20:20.811
<v Speaker 2>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1646
01:20:20.811 --> 01:20:24.980
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say the obvious fact that capitalism </v>

1647
01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:26.380
<v Speaker 2>is better than communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1648
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:27.450
<v Speaker 2>that's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1649
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:32.451
<v Speaker 2>just compared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would rather live in South Korea or </v>

1650
01:20:32.451 --> 01:20:33.330
<v Speaker 2>North Korea would rather live in the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>East Germany or West Germany,</v>

1651
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:38.810
<v Speaker 2>a I'd rather live now in Venezuela or in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chile and it's just obvious that </v>

1652
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.120
<v Speaker 2>capitalism makes people a richer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>freer and better off in pretty much </v>

1653
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:45.810
<v Speaker 2>every way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1654
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:46.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>

1655
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.920
<v Speaker 2>That's almost unmentionable in academia </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1656
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:55.130
<v Speaker 2>but he say it by itself and suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>people discover it for the first time.</v>

1657
01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Then you can get the extreme right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that any amount of regulation </v>

1658
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:03.990
<v Speaker 2>is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any amount of social spending is bad.</v>

1659
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:09.200
<v Speaker 2>We need the most extreme form of almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>an arco capitalism like radical </v>

1660
01:21:09.721 --> 01:21:14.721
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because I argue that if you </v>

1661
01:21:14.721 --> 01:21:19.341
<v Speaker 2>never have a discussion of the relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantages and disadvantages of </v>

1662
01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:23.241
<v Speaker 2>different economic systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never hear the arguments for why </v>

1663
01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:27.020
<v Speaker 2>some mixture of a free market with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation of things that have to be </v>

1664
01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:29.370
<v Speaker 2>regulated because the market won't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of them,</v>

1665
01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.220
<v Speaker 2>like pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the market just won't put up,</v>

1666
01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.910
<v Speaker 2>put a price on the atmosphere because no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one owns the atmosphere.</v>

1667
01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:41.210
<v Speaker 2>And so having a combination of a free </v>
<v Speaker 2>market with environmental regulations </v>

1668
01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 2>gives you the best of both worlds.</v>

1669
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social spending for the elderly,</v>

1670
01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.310
<v Speaker 2>for children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sick,</v>

1671
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:52.340
<v Speaker 2>for the unlucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bath not incompatible with a free </v>

1672
01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:56.151
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact some of the countries who </v>

1673
01:21:56.151 --> 01:21:58.131
<v Speaker 2>have the strongest social safety nets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also one of the ones with the most </v>

1674
01:21:58.131 --> 01:22:01.101
<v Speaker 2>economic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that argument that I've just given </v>

1675
01:22:01.101 --> 01:22:04.431
<v Speaker 2>you right now just doesn't take place </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's just such a commitment </v>

1676
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.560
<v Speaker 2>to the idea that capitalism is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Opening up the possibility that someone </v>

1677
01:22:09.751 --> 01:22:14.751
<v Speaker 2>discovers hate capitalism isn't so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they reap to the strongest possible</v>

1678
01:22:14.791 --> 01:22:15.900
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1679
01:22:15.901 --> 01:22:20.100
<v Speaker 2>if as soon as you have social security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to be like Venezuela,</v>

1680
01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or or,</v>

1681
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:22.560
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1682
01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:27.561
<v Speaker 2>or our carbon pricing and the rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of organizing society with just the </v>

1683
01:22:27.561 --> 01:22:30.480
<v Speaker 2>right balance of free markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regulation.</v>

1684
01:22:30.481 --> 01:22:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Social spending is just something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get discussed out in the open.</v>

1685
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:38.310
<v Speaker 2>You get these polarized extremes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's the argument that what's the</v>

1686
01:22:38.311 --> 01:22:40.770
<v Speaker 2>origin of that thought process in </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia?</v>

1687
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Like why has capitalism and demonized </v>
<v Speaker 2>and socialism being been praised despite</v>

1688
01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:49.680
<v Speaker 2>all the evidence that especially Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism or Marxism is just,</v>

1689
01:22:49.681 --> 01:22:54.681
<v Speaker 2>it's never been shown to be effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been shown to be very </v>

1690
01:22:54.681 --> 01:22:54.681
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1691
01:22:54.681 --> 01:22:58.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One theory from Thomas Sowell,</v>

1692
01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:03.250
<v Speaker 2>an economist at the hoover institution </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that intellectuals tend to like </v>

1693
01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:07.790
<v Speaker 2>systems that where you can articulate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory and a bunch of verbal </v>

1694
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:11.110
<v Speaker 2>propositions and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government kind of implements them.</v>

1695
01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Whereas there are certain phenomena in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1696
01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:19.130
<v Speaker 2>in social life like market economies </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the intelligence is distributed </v>

1697
01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:23.761
<v Speaker 2>across millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one actually knows how to make the </v>

1698
01:23:23.761 --> 01:23:25.780
<v Speaker 2>system work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people make things look for buyers.</v>

1699
01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:28.780
<v Speaker 2>They set the price where people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will buy them,</v>

1700
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:33.730
<v Speaker 2>and then over the entire society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things kind of work out,</v>

1701
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.880
<v Speaker 2>but no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually no single individual has the </v>

1702
01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.330
<v Speaker 2>theory as to how that ought to work.</v>

1703
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>language is another example.</v>

1704
01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no committee that designed the </v>

1705
01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:48.991
<v Speaker 2>English language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no theory of how the English </v>

1706
01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:50.080
<v Speaker 2>language ought to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like hundreds of millions of people</v>

1707
01:23:50.081 --> 01:23:55.081
<v Speaker 2>just talking and they invent new slang </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they slur and they emphasize and </v>

1708
01:23:55.331 --> 01:24:00.331
<v Speaker 2>they borrow from other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the language changes and it works </v>

1709
01:24:00.331 --> 01:24:04.951
<v Speaker 2>pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we are speaking in English and no </v>

1710
01:24:04.951 --> 01:24:05.700
<v Speaker 2>committee ever designed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So according to souls theory and he,</v>

1711
01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I think he was influenced by a High Eq </v>
<v Speaker 2>Friedrich Hayek,</v>

1712
01:24:08.891 --> 01:24:13.891
<v Speaker 2>the Austrian economist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that systems of distributed intelligence</v>

1713
01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:18.930
<v Speaker 2>where no one genius ever designed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but millions of people cooperating,</v>

1714
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 2>give rise to a collective intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of run against the grain or the way</v>

1715
01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:26.290
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals often think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all intellectuals,</v>

1716
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:31.291
<v Speaker 2>because of course you could do what high</v>
<v Speaker 2>console did and realized there is this </v>

1717
01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:36.031
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon of collective intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if your first impulse is what's the </v>

1718
01:24:36.031 --> 01:24:37.040
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1719
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:39.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the set of principles,</v>

1720
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to gravitate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>planned,</v>

1721
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:46.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper plan systems and the a little bit </v>

1722
01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:47.620
<v Speaker 2>oblivious to distributed systems,</v>

1723
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:53.970
<v Speaker 1>but in academia for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things in terms of a,</v>

1724
01:24:55.690 --> 01:25:00.690
<v Speaker 1>from a social standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things is a distribution of </v>

1725
01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:03.811
<v Speaker 1>wealth is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a common subject that keeps getting </v>

1726
01:25:03.811 --> 01:25:07.471
<v Speaker 1>brought up and class structures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a time if everything</v>

1727
01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:14.371
<v Speaker 1>works out correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we continue to evolve our culture </v>

1728
01:25:14.371 --> 01:25:18.180
<v Speaker 1>where we will no longer have classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll know and we'll be able to </v>

1729
01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.350
<v Speaker 1>distribute wealth completely equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the board,</v>

1730
01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:25.450
<v Speaker 1>but it sort of denying the motivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings have to succeed.</v>

1731
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:30.830
<v Speaker 1>It's designing the denying this desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have to stand out and to </v>

1732
01:25:32.651 --> 01:25:34.670
<v Speaker 1>overachieve or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1733
01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:37.210
<v Speaker 1>to be an outlier in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

1734
01:25:37.211 --> 01:25:41.350
<v Speaker 1>which is just a natural part of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and also competition.</v>

1735
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:46.360
<v Speaker 1>That competition is fueled by reward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>without competition,</v>

1736
01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't have iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have most of the technological</v>

1737
01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:54.991
<v Speaker 1>innovation that we have that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>funded by these companies have done it </v>

1738
01:25:54.991 --> 01:25:56.460
<v Speaker 1>in order to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1739
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.710
<v Speaker 1>there's to be some sort of a reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they pushed all these things.</v>

1740
01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>It's so ironic when someone is talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how capitalism sucks</v>

1741
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.460
<v Speaker 2>on an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1742
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:11.470
<v Speaker 2>didn't Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is one of the more bizarre ironies </v>

1743
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 2>is unexposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you put your finger on another </v>

1744
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I discussed this in my book,</v>

1745
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:21.431
<v Speaker 2>the blank slate when I also discussed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of the politics of gender that </v>

1746
01:26:21.431 --> 01:26:25.360
<v Speaker 2>part of it is there's a history to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was an idea sometimes called </v>

1747
01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.300
<v Speaker 2>social darwinism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

1748
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:28.280
<v Speaker 2>it had nothing to do with Darwin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ironically,</v>

1749
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:33.490
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that the only way society's</v>
<v Speaker 2>progresses through ruthless cutthroat </v>

1750
01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:37.230
<v Speaker 2>competition and poor people are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragging the species down and you know,</v>

1751
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:40.490
<v Speaker 2>screw them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we were were were bleeding hearts</v>

1752
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.980
<v Speaker 2>than will retard the progress of </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1753
01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>And we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1754
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 2>just everyone against everyone else for </v>
<v Speaker 2>two to advance.</v>

1755
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Now you know that that's really not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good way to organize a society.</v>

1756
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:56.201
<v Speaker 2>But there's such a reaction against that</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 20th century that you got the </v>

1757
01:26:56.201 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 2>opposite extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are all blank slates.</v>

1758
01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:03.410
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all start off a identical and that,</v>

1759
01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of competition is bad.</v>

1760
01:27:05.691 --> 01:27:10.691
<v Speaker 2>You need kind of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benevolent government to distribute </v>

1761
01:27:10.691 --> 01:27:11.120
<v Speaker 2>everything in the fairest possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

1762
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality is,</v>

1763
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.970
<v Speaker 2>is something in between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are a,</v>

1764
01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.040
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be an equality in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair system simply because some people </v>

1765
01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.271
<v Speaker 2>really are smarter than others and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have more discipline and more </v>

1766
01:27:25.271 --> 01:27:28.331
<v Speaker 2>self control and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's good to harness that so that </v>

1767
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:33.610
<v Speaker 2>our competitive impulses have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people burning the midnight oil and </v>

1768
01:27:34.941 --> 01:27:39.941
<v Speaker 2>racking their brains to how to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>things better off because they </v>

1769
01:27:39.941 --> 01:27:42.950
<v Speaker 2>anticipate some rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to sap all incentives,</v>

1770
01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.380
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union.</v>

1771
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:51.430
<v Speaker 2>You also don't want a central committee </v>
<v Speaker 2>to decide that everyone has to have the </v>

1772
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:56.870
<v Speaker 2>same amount and parcel out every reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that just gives too much power </v>

1773
01:27:57.321 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 2>to a government.</v>

1774
01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:01.440
<v Speaker 2>But it also doesn't mean that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite extreme where the,</v>

1775
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:02.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor people die,</v>

1776
01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 2>then it's their own fault because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lazy and stupid.</v>

1777
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:06.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just not true.</v>

1778
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not humane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we need to do is find the right</v>

1779
01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:15.011
<v Speaker 2>balance between competition and freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes everyone better off and </v>

1780
01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:20.930
<v Speaker 2>recognition that just be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are going to be people who are not</v>

1781
01:28:20.931 --> 01:28:23.640
<v Speaker 2>as smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't deserve to starve a,</v>

1782
01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:26.900
<v Speaker 2>there are people who are just going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be unlucky because a lot of wealth isn't</v>

1783
01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:31.901
<v Speaker 2>distributed by a talent and hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of luck that goes into</v>

1784
01:28:32.061 --> 01:28:34.340
<v Speaker 2>it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we may want to kind of,</v>

1785
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:39.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sand down some of the sharp edges of </v>

1786
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.390
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it,</v>

1787
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:40.400
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to be either or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

1788
01:28:40.401 --> 01:28:43.460
<v Speaker 2>if you make one position taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it makes things either or.</v>

1789
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:48.910
<v Speaker 2>But how bizarre is it that these kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of rational conversations about this </v>

1790
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:52.631
<v Speaker 2>very important subject is taboo in </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual circles and it's not good </v>

1791
01:28:53.271 --> 01:28:54.980
<v Speaker 2>academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that happen?</v>

1792
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1793
01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:00.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some of it is a reaction to the </v>

1794
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:00.740
<v Speaker 2>excesses of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it,</v>

1795
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:05.381
<v Speaker 2>because people do tend to form a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual tribes the same way you </v>

1796
01:29:05.381 --> 01:29:06.300
<v Speaker 2>have sports teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1797
01:29:06.301 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 2>and you root for your team and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you're a sports fan,</v>

1798
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:14.990
<v Speaker 2>when you acquire information isn't to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become better and better informed in </v>

1799
01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:20.451
<v Speaker 2>some objective way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to kind of enhance the fan </v>

1800
01:29:20.451 --> 01:29:23.121
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to find out what's great about </v>

1801
01:29:23.121 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 2>your team and what's awful about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other team.</v>

1802
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's a human habit that we bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>to intellectual debates where and,</v>

1803
01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:34.540
<v Speaker 2>and academia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>academics or are susceptible to it as </v>

1804
01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:34.540
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

1805
01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they take steps to recognize it </v>

1806
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.050
<v Speaker 2>and avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1807
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you root for the left team and if you're</v>

1808
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:45.051
<v Speaker 2>on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much in the universities but in </v>

1809
01:29:45.051 --> 01:29:45.930
<v Speaker 2>the think tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you root for the right team and you tend</v>

1810
01:29:45.931 --> 01:29:49.800
<v Speaker 2>to discount evidence that goes against </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ideology.</v>

1811
01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:52.980
<v Speaker 2>You kind of filter out the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are a little bit embarrassing.</v>

1812
01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1813
01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:00.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people then a adopt certain opinions is </v>

1814
01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:04.701
<v Speaker 2>almost loyalty badges and this is true </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a lot of controversies that people </v>

1815
01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:07.890
<v Speaker 2>often think are due to scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>illiteracy,</v>

1816
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.610
<v Speaker 2>like climate change where you ask a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of scientists,</v>

1817
01:30:11.611 --> 01:30:15.570
<v Speaker 2>why do people deny the obvious facts of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of manmade climate change.</v>

1818
01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1819
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 2>people just don't get enough information</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need better outreach and I think</v>

1820
01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:22.470
<v Speaker 2>we do need better outreach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in fact,</v>

1821
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:25.020
<v Speaker 2>and I talk about this and enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and enlightenment now,</v>

1822
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:29.790
<v Speaker 2>if you actually do surveys of how well </v>
<v Speaker 2>people understand climate science is not</v>

1823
01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Speaker 2>virtually no correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledgement of human made,</v>

1824
01:30:33.481 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 2>climate change and sophistication in </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate science.</v>

1825
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:40.170
<v Speaker 2>So you get people who do believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>human made climate change,</v>

1826
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.740
<v Speaker 2>which I think is an incontrovertible </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact at this point,</v>

1827
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:45.840
<v Speaker 2>but they don't really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1828
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:46.980
<v Speaker 2>they may even think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1829
01:30:46.981 --> 01:30:51.981
<v Speaker 2>it's caused by a hole in the ozone layer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can fix it by cleaning up toxic </v>

1830
01:30:51.981 --> 01:30:54.780
<v Speaker 2>waste dumps me like crazy beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're still on.</v>

1831
01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:56.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would consider the right,</v>

1832
01:30:56.140 --> 01:31:00.000
<v Speaker 2>the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that in some politicized</v>

1833
01:31:00.001 --> 01:31:02.580
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people don't,</v>

1834
01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:07.640
<v Speaker 2>don't so much care about the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They care about what belief will earn </v>

1835
01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:08.220
<v Speaker 2>them esteem in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their peer group.</v>

1836
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1837
01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:14.230
<v Speaker 2>This is human psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really bad when it comes to </v>

1838
01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:18.590
<v Speaker 2>arriving at the best understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth collectively and what we need </v>

1839
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:23.540
<v Speaker 2>both in the left wing academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>departments and the right wing think </v>

1840
01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:24.210
<v Speaker 2>tanks is kind of recognition.</v>

1841
01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.090
<v Speaker 2>We're probably all wrong about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1842
01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:32.150
<v Speaker 2>especially if we talk to each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and act like kind of litigators like </v>

1843
01:31:32.191 --> 01:31:37.191
<v Speaker 2>lawyers who mouth the best possible case</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our side to prosecuted against the </v>

1844
01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:42.171
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just not a good way of arriving </v>

1845
01:31:42.171 --> 01:31:44.481
<v Speaker 2>at the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to kind of check the </v>

1846
01:31:44.481 --> 01:31:47.451
<v Speaker 2>tendencies in yourself to just want more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more evidence for your belief and </v>

1847
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:51.630
<v Speaker 2>force yourself to be enforced other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to be as open minded as possible.</v>

1848
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very fascinating to me.</v>

1849
01:31:54.010 --> 01:31:54.930
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1850
01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.930
<v Speaker 2>these sort of mindsets that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1851
01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 2>that you on the left</v>

1852
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.980
<v Speaker 1>and on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are certain subjects that </v>

1853
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:04.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you support that subject,</v>

1854
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you are automatically thought of as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>left winger.</v>

1855
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Have you support this subject?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're already automatically thought of </v>

1856
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>as a rule if you were on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably think,</v>

1857
01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:14.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way,</v>

1858
01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.160
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone says to me that they think </v>

1859
01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:22.531
<v Speaker 1>that climate change is probably an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overblown thing and it's a cycle that </v>

1860
01:32:22.531 --> 01:32:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the world has been going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

1861
01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a right winger and you'd be </v>

1862
01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:29.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1863
01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Almost always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

1864
01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:29.800
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think,</v>

1865
01:32:29.801 --> 01:32:34.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all gay people should be allowed to get </v>

1866
01:32:34.801 --> 01:32:34.801
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1867
01:32:34.801 --> 01:32:34.801
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably left winger.</v>

1868
01:32:34.801 --> 01:32:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably true 10 years ago.</v>

1869
01:32:36.081 --> 01:32:39.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually less true now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what these amazing changes.</v>

1870
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:44.350
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes there can be these changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just catch us all by surprise and </v>

1871
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:45.140
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was like,</v>

1872
01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:49.340
<v Speaker 2>even people on the left had misgivings </v>
<v Speaker 2>about climate change.</v>

1873
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I've ever been gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1874
01:32:50.931 --> 01:32:54.350
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties it was still something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people on the left,</v>

1875
01:32:54.351 --> 01:32:56.390
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of had let him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not go that far.</v>

1876
01:32:56.391 --> 01:32:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should have civil unions or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1877
01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:03.880
<v Speaker 2>now the whole of the country is flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you.</v>

1878
01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.620
<v Speaker 2>But in general so these changes can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

1879
01:33:06.621 --> 01:33:11.621
<v Speaker 2>but you're right that a lot of opinions </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just loyalty badges to a coalition </v>

1880
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:14.750
<v Speaker 2>and they can sometimes change in very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange ways.</v>

1881
01:33:14.751 --> 01:33:19.751
<v Speaker 2>So we've seen it in the last year or so </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a Donald Trump who is in many ways </v>

1882
01:33:22.011 --> 01:33:25.670
<v Speaker 2>that pretty radical right winger in </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>

1883
01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:26.870
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

1884
01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:31.930
<v Speaker 2>What do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your opinion of Russia now for </v>

1885
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:32.150
<v Speaker 2>decades?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're on the right,</v>

1886
01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.150
<v Speaker 2>you mistrusted Russia and if you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left there,</v>

1887
01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:37.070
<v Speaker 2>you know they weren't so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they misunderstood.</v>

1888
01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Now it's totally flipped and opinions on</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you trust Russia just because of</v>

1889
01:33:43.161 --> 01:33:45.020
<v Speaker 2>the influence of Donald trump have </v>
<v Speaker 2>shifted.</v>

1890
01:33:45.021 --> 01:33:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So the people on the right are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic to Russia.</v>

1891
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Something that would have been almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>unthinkable even 10 years ago.</v>

1892
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Free Trade is another example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of a right wing cars and </v>

1893
01:33:56.950 --> 01:34:00.710
<v Speaker 2>then trump managed to flip it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it shows is where I'm going with</v>

1894
01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:04.010
<v Speaker 2>this and this is something that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I've changed my mind.</v>

1895
01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I used to think they were these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies,</v>

1896
01:34:05.751 --> 01:34:10.751
<v Speaker 2>kind of like religious catechisms where </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the beliefs that follow from </v>

1897
01:34:11.571 --> 01:34:14.600
<v Speaker 2>one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of us just rot tribalism.</v>

1898
01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:15.500
<v Speaker 2>It just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1899
01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.160
<v Speaker 2>in sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the players,</v>

1900
01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.400
<v Speaker 2>your churn through the tip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rosters with free agency and you </v>

1901
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:23.450
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to be a guy.</v>

1902
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:25.250
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that he's on the other team now.</v>

1903
01:34:25.251 --> 01:34:30.251
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Jerry Seinfeld once said you </v>

1904
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:33.040
<v Speaker 2>rooting for clothing and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens with political ideologies as </v>

1905
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.250
<v Speaker 2>well to I think to everyone's shock.</v>

1906
01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the tribalism thing is very,</v>

1907
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:42.210
<v Speaker 1>very confusing to me because you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it like it's such an obvious pattern</v>

1908
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and that when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it plays out,</v>

1909
01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:45.780
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1910
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:51.090
<v Speaker 1>the global warming thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having a conversation with a guy </v>

1911
01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:51.340
<v Speaker 1>in my Jujitsu class and I'll never </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget this.</v>

1912
01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1913
01:34:52.851 --> 01:34:53.920
<v Speaker 1>it's been a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cycle,</v>

1914
01:34:54.190 --> 01:34:59.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a cycle of global warming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change has always been a cycle </v>

1915
01:34:59.190 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 1>and you know the people that say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1916
01:35:01.071 --> 01:35:01.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1917
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:06.431
<v Speaker 1>what will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much have you studied other </v>

1918
01:35:06.431 --> 01:35:06.431
<v Speaker 1>scientists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1919
01:35:06.431 --> 01:35:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot about global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot about climate change,</v>

1920
01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:14.060
<v Speaker 1>but I know what I've read and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me to be a very complex issue and I'm</v>

1921
01:35:14.061 --> 01:35:18.430
<v Speaker 1>talking to this 25 year old guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the military who's telling me this.</v>

1922
01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have an education?</v>

1923
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1924
01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1925
01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you just automatically like </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that this is a more talking about</v>

1926
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.520
<v Speaker 1>the very temperature of the planet earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's complex and what is causing it?</v>

1927
01:35:31.971 --> 01:35:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Is it a carbon monoxide thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a what?</v>

1928
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Why do you just automatically subscribed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this and it's because that's how his </v>

1929
01:35:40.821 --> 01:35:45.821
<v Speaker 1>tribe communicates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how his tribe and that it gives </v>

1930
01:35:45.821 --> 01:35:49.661
<v Speaker 1>people comfort to be in these weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>little groups where everybody has group </v>

1931
01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:49.661
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1932
01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a a,</v>

1933
01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.160
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this phenomenon in </v>

1934
01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:56.770
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment now because it's a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>that argues for,</v>

1935
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:57.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1936
01:35:57.930 --> 01:36:00.400
<v Speaker 2>the importance of reason and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1937
01:36:00.401 --> 01:36:05.401
<v Speaker 2>and how there has been progress thanks </v>
<v Speaker 2>to application of reason and a natural </v>

1938
01:36:05.401 --> 01:36:07.230
<v Speaker 2>pushback is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1939
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:09.340
<v Speaker 2>you look at things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't seem so reasonable.</v>

1940
01:36:09.341 --> 01:36:10.870
<v Speaker 2>It's as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you,</v>

1941
01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:14.830
<v Speaker 2>what's going on that were gay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We seem to be getting less reasonable.</v>

1942
01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And I think the answer is there's reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>can work in,</v>

1943
01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:23.370
<v Speaker 2>for different goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here I'm using the ideas of a Yale </v>

1944
01:36:23.370 --> 01:36:26.670
<v Speaker 2>scholar named Dan Dan Daniel Kahan where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows there's a perverse way in which</v>

1945
01:36:26.951 --> 01:36:29.980
<v Speaker 2>there's actually is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality to that kind of belief.</v>

1946
01:36:30.010 --> 01:36:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Namely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you vote,</v>

1947
01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.680
<v Speaker 2>what are the chances that your vote's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really gonna swing reelection pretty </v>

1948
01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:38.170
<v Speaker 2>close to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

1949
01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:41.710
<v Speaker 2>when you express an opinion in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your peer group,</v>

1950
01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:43.900
<v Speaker 2>the people you work with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your family,</v>

1951
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:49.080
<v Speaker 2>what are the chances that holding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong opinion will lead you to be kind </v>

1952
01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.490
<v Speaker 2>of condemned and ostracized and treated </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a real weirdo?</v>

1953
01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:52.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>

1954
01:36:53.290 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everyone thinks what opinion is going</v>

1955
01:36:56.981 --> 01:37:00.340
<v Speaker 2>to help my esteem and the people I care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1956
01:37:00.850 --> 01:37:05.850
<v Speaker 2>they can latch onto all kinds of beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they've become kind of identity </v>

1957
01:37:05.891 --> 01:37:07.960
<v Speaker 2>badges for their tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1958
01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:11.260
<v Speaker 2>this is rational in terms of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in.</v>

1959
01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not so rational for the planet as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole.</v>

1960
01:37:13.481 --> 01:37:17.710
<v Speaker 2>If people just subscribed to beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on tribal loyalty instead of truth</v>

1961
01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:23.580
<v Speaker 2>and the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we align beliefs more with truth </v>

1962
01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:28.291
<v Speaker 2>and less with tribal loyalty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not hopeless because there are </v>

1963
01:37:28.291 --> 01:37:29.140
<v Speaker 2>a lot of beliefs that people used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that are,</v>

1964
01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.300
<v Speaker 2>that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been overturned.</v>

1965
01:37:31.301 --> 01:37:34.880
<v Speaker 2>People don't believe in Unicorns anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>or alchemy and fueled.</v>

1966
01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:39.010
<v Speaker 2>People believe in astrology and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of scientific issues are.</v>

1967
01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:41.350
<v Speaker 2>There's no controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Antibiotics work?</v>

1968
01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no,</v>

1969
01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whether you're in the </v>

1970
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:47.400
<v Speaker 2>right or the left.</v>

1971
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.940
<v Speaker 2>So part of the challenge is how do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get more and more of our beliefs to be,</v>

1972
01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:54.530
<v Speaker 2>to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have our social norms be such that if </v>

1973
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:55.120
<v Speaker 2>you believe something just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on the writer on the left,</v>

1974
01:37:55.290 --> 01:38:00.290
<v Speaker 2>then you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you should be doing is looking </v>

1975
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 2>at the best possible study with an open </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

1976
01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:06.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what a cool person does and only </v>
<v Speaker 2>an idiot just parrots the the right wing</v>

1977
01:38:06.751 --> 01:38:09.120
<v Speaker 2>lined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of social change we need</v>

1978
01:38:09.121 --> 01:38:10.400
<v Speaker 2>to aim for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan,</v>

1979
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:15.410
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost a shaming of that kind of </v>

1980
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:17.811
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the desire that people have to </v>

1981
01:38:17.811 --> 01:38:19.610
<v Speaker 2>subscribe to a predetermined pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and behaving because it's.</v>

1982
01:38:19.611 --> 01:38:21.990
<v Speaker 2>It's comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's comforting that you know,</v>

1983
01:38:21.991 --> 01:38:26.991
<v Speaker 2>and it also like they know that other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on their group will also think </v>

1984
01:38:26.991 --> 01:38:28.350
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're in the right.</v>

1985
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.630
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about you see about </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wingers,</v>

1986
01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:35.640
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this Kyle Kuklinski </v>

1987
01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.460
<v Speaker 2>secular talk podcast where he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this,</v>

1988
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:41.490
<v Speaker 2>these Christians who were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

1989
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.110
<v Speaker 2>and when you are on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must have a belief in God.</v>

1990
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.960
<v Speaker 2>You just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they were talking about trump,</v>

1991
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:52.470
<v Speaker 2>they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the man that existed</v>

1992
01:38:52.471 --> 01:38:55.050
<v Speaker 2>before he accepted Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1993
01:38:55.051 --> 01:38:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the guy was literally saying,</v>

1994
01:38:56.941 --> 01:38:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1995
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:03.920
<v Speaker 2>how about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I've accepted Jesus Christ into </v>

1996
01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 2>my life and that once you accept Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ,</v>

1997
01:39:04.050 --> 01:39:06.740
<v Speaker 2>like you are now a believer in Christ </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're for,</v>

1998
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:09.360
<v Speaker 2>you're forgiven for all of your past </v>
<v Speaker 2>sins.</v>

1999
01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is on the right.</v>

2000
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:16.950
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant percentage of the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on the right that subscribed to</v>

2001
01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I a religious Christian mindset.</v>

2002
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:25.490
<v Speaker 2>It is fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to our current </v>

2003
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:28.311
<v Speaker 2>president who by any standards is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the least Christian leader that we've </v>

2004
01:39:28.891 --> 01:39:30.840
<v Speaker 2>ever had passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He accepted Jesus.</v>

2005
01:39:31.710 --> 01:39:32.940
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2006
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:33.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's still,</v>

2007
01:39:33.730 --> 01:39:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christian virtues include things </v>

2008
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:39.510
<v Speaker 2>like modesty for the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2009
01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:43.930
<v Speaker 2>A temperance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chivalry Gentlemen leanness and this guy</v>

2010
01:39:43.931 --> 01:39:48.931
<v Speaker 2>is lewd and vainglorious and arrogant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and contemptuous for for losers,</v>

2011
01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but which shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2012
01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:55.680
<v Speaker 2>kind of going back to our discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just amazing how much loyalty </v>

2013
01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.810
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have to do with the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>content of the beliefs.</v>

2014
01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:03.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just whoever's on on my side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course he promised a lot of perks</v>

2015
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.900
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the religious right,</v>

2016
01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:11.901
<v Speaker 2>like the repeal of the amendment that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax exempt organizations can't engage in</v>

2017
01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:15.360
<v Speaker 2>politics and lobbying the so called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson amendment,</v>

2018
01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:18.960
<v Speaker 2>which meant that if you're a church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't pay taxes,</v>

2019
01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:20.910
<v Speaker 2>you can't be politically active.</v>

2020
01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like that and he promised to</v>

2021
01:40:22.561 --> 01:40:27.561
<v Speaker 2>repeal that amendment and so he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>their loyalty and so it was just raw </v>

2022
01:40:27.561 --> 01:40:30.330
<v Speaker 2>political muscle kind of overcame </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian virtue.</v>

2023
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.520
<v Speaker 2>So bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bizarre.</v>

2024
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2025
01:40:33.541 --> 01:40:36.330
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to watch just these </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns,</v>

2026
01:40:36.331 --> 01:40:41.331
<v Speaker 2>these tribal ideological patterns when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see these groups that have this sort</v>

2027
01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:46.280
<v Speaker 2>of one mindset and this very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is I can flip another example.</v>

2028
01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 2>People forget this is so take </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist them,</v>

2029
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:51.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of quintessential,</v>

2030
01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left green cars.</v>

2031
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Not so long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the other way around is actually </v>

2032
01:40:58.680 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 2>considered to be a cause of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2033
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are,</v>

2034
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:03.040
<v Speaker 2>if you're a left wing activist in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

2035
01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:04.270
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2036
01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:09.420
<v Speaker 2>the only people concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment are rich people who liked </v>

2037
01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:12.691
<v Speaker 2>the view from their country estates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want them to be spoiled by </v>

2038
01:41:12.691 --> 01:41:13.960
<v Speaker 2>being cut down for apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for poor people,</v>

2039
01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they're,</v>

2040
01:41:15.511 --> 01:41:20.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>duck hunters who want to be able to go </v>

2041
01:41:20.511 --> 01:41:20.800
<v Speaker 2>and hunt ducks and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're really socially concerned,</v>

2042
01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.920
<v Speaker 2>you should care about Vietnam and racism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and poverty and it's just a luxury to </v>

2043
01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:26.460
<v Speaker 2>worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2044
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:31.510
<v Speaker 2>trees and flowers and ducks that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>flipped and then environmentalist and </v>

2045
01:41:31.511 --> 01:41:33.220
<v Speaker 2>became a leftwing cause.</v>

2046
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:34.630
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2047
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:37.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these connections between your coalition</v>

2048
01:41:37.901 --> 01:41:41.650
<v Speaker 2>and your beliefs aren't set in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2049
01:41:41.651 --> 01:41:46.390
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forming of the political parties.</v>

2050
01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:51.930
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Democrats were very different and </v>

2051
01:41:51.930 --> 01:41:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Republicans are more like Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2052
01:41:51.930 --> 01:41:53.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting with Abraham Lincoln,</v>

2053
01:41:53.231 --> 01:41:55.240
<v Speaker 2>the first republican president and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were the,</v>

2054
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2055
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:57.610
<v Speaker 2>of course they were the party against </v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery.</v>

2056
01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.220
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in my lifetime,</v>

2057
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:02.800
<v Speaker 2>through the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the south,</v>

2058
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:07.370
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats were the right wing racist</v>
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>

2059
01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had George Wallace,</v>

2060
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 2>the governor of Alabama who said </v>
<v Speaker 2>segregation now,</v>

2061
01:42:11.771 --> 01:42:13.840
<v Speaker 2>segregation forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a democrat.</v>

2062
01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:16.000
<v Speaker 2>He formed his own party in [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>68.</v>

2063
01:42:16.290 --> 01:42:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Then back in [inaudible] 72,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ran for the Democratic nomination.</v>

2064
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:24.280
<v Speaker 2>And the southern Democrats were they the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the right wingers.</v>

2065
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:28.000
<v Speaker 2>And it was often the northeast </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans who were the liberals.</v>

2066
01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:30.130
<v Speaker 2>That's still partly true in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts.</v>

2067
01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.080
<v Speaker 2>We had a little bit of a remnant of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2068
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.320
<v Speaker 2>We've had some liberal Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>governors.</v>

2069
01:42:35.321 --> 01:42:40.321
<v Speaker 2>We have one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Baker was a Republican and he's </v>

2070
01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:41.440
<v Speaker 2>pretty moderate middle of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2071
01:42:41.441 --> 01:42:46.441
<v Speaker 2>William Weld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was then the libertarian vice </v>

2072
01:42:46.441 --> 01:42:46.690
<v Speaker 2>presidential candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a republican even,</v>

2073
01:42:46.691 --> 01:42:48.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when Mitt Romney was our governor,</v>

2074
01:42:49.150 --> 01:42:51.940
<v Speaker 2>he was not particularly conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a republican.</v>

2075
01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:54.670
<v Speaker 2>So there's the remnants of that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts.</v>

2076
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:59.790
<v Speaker 2>They used to be a little bit of that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York where they were liberal </v>

2077
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2078
01:42:59.790 --> 01:43:01.690
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a case where it's flipped and now</v>

2079
01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.270
<v Speaker 2>democratic was left of center </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>

2080
01:43:04.271 --> 01:43:04.870
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of center.</v>

2081
01:43:05.110 --> 01:43:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen some of that also with some </v>

2082
01:43:10.110 --> 01:43:10.480
<v Speaker 2>rub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans have tried to disingenuously</v>

2083
01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:14.620
<v Speaker 2>connect the Democratic Party with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>KKK because of the past.</v>

2084
01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was true.</v>

2085
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:17.680
<v Speaker 2>That was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2086
01:43:17.681 --> 01:43:19.640
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>present that,</v>

2087
01:43:20.250 --> 01:43:25.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the party of the support of the </v>

2088
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.250
<v Speaker 2>KKK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2089
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.250
<v Speaker 2>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2090
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:27.250
<v Speaker 2>that means that all the time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the end.</v>

2091
01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different people.</v>

2092
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

2093
01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:35.240
<v Speaker 2>it's just fascinating to me to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>these groups of people and uh,</v>

2094
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about um,</v>

2095
01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:39.610
<v Speaker 2>political parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right versus the left.</v>

2096
01:43:39.611 --> 01:43:44.611
<v Speaker 2>It's always weird to me that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>these two sides and that people sort of </v>

2097
01:43:44.611 --> 01:43:49.420
<v Speaker 2>like take comfort and in choosing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>group that they identify with these</v>

2098
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.420
<v Speaker 1>issues where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2099
01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I identify as a right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I identify as a left identify as this,</v>

2100
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:03.190
<v Speaker 1>that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are very rigid in their </v>

2101
01:44:03.190 --> 01:44:05.480
<v Speaker 1>structure and they don't allow for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance thinking and they don't allow for</v>

2102
01:44:05.690 --> 01:44:09.620
<v Speaker 1>being objective about issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And considering the other side,</v>

2103
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:14.800
<v Speaker 1>considering other people's points of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view and the way they're looking at </v>

2104
01:44:14.901 --> 01:44:17.750
<v Speaker 1>things and thinking of maybe there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some common ground</v>

2105
01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

2106
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:23.630
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like mit now has the subtitle,</v>

2107
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:28.020
<v Speaker 2>the case for reasons science humanism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and progress.</v>

2108
01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a chapter on reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a chapter on and I have a chapter </v>

2109
01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:33.810
<v Speaker 2>on humanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the chapter on reason,</v>

2110
01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:39.170
<v Speaker 2>I asked the question why does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand it appears that we're </v>

2111
01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:42.801
<v Speaker 2>getting smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the flynn effect of rising Iq </v>

2112
01:44:42.801 --> 01:44:45.321
<v Speaker 2>scores and there are a lot of areas in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life where what you see just much more </v>

2113
01:44:45.321 --> 01:44:46.410
<v Speaker 2>intelligence being applied in just a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

2114
01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So just for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2115
01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:50.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving in evidence based medicine,</v>

2116
01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:55.400
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what your doctor does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just based on kind of superstition </v>

2117
01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:56.220
<v Speaker 2>and tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now people are saying,</v>

2118
01:44:56.221 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2119
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:59.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do a randomized controlled trial,</v>

2120
01:44:59.401 --> 01:45:00.780
<v Speaker 2>see what works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't.</v>

2121
01:45:01.290 --> 01:45:04.290
<v Speaker 2>So is getting smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at policing,</v>

2122
01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:08.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons that the crime rate </v>
<v Speaker 2>has gone down so much,</v>

2123
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:10.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another positive development that I,</v>

2124
01:45:10.611 --> 01:45:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I talk about that people aren't aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that policing has gotten smarter.</v>

2125
01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:16.830
<v Speaker 2>They everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in New York,</v>

2126
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:19.500
<v Speaker 2>they would gather data as to where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>homicides were,</v>

2127
01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:22.650
<v Speaker 2>which neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which blocks and which neighborhoods and</v>

2128
01:45:22.651 --> 01:45:24.540
<v Speaker 2>they would concentrate the police </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces,</v>

2129
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:29.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that day and to prevent things from </v>

2130
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:30.690
<v Speaker 2>getting out of control with cycles of </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenge.</v>

2131
01:45:30.970 --> 01:45:35.970
<v Speaker 2>You at sports know moneyball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you've got kind of smarter teams </v>

2132
01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:36.540
<v Speaker 2>that can beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reached Richard Teams.</v>

2133
01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:40.560
<v Speaker 2>You look at policy and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidenced based policy.</v>

2134
01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.980
<v Speaker 2>So all these areas where it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country's getting smarter,</v>

2135
01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 2>but then there are all these areas we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at Kennedy's getting lots of </v>

2136
01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:51.351
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter and a lot of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I argue cases where people were issues </v>

2137
01:45:52.021 --> 01:45:56.190
<v Speaker 2>get politicized and then people just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their own coalition.</v>

2138
01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:01.700
<v Speaker 2>And the ideal would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an ideal that's in least </v>

2139
01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.810
<v Speaker 2>preached in science and to some extent </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>

2140
01:46:03.811 --> 01:46:05.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not leftwing science and writing</v>

2141
01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:06.150
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

2142
01:46:06.450 --> 01:46:11.450
<v Speaker 2>It's what are the data?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did the data say if you haven't </v>

2143
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.450
<v Speaker 2>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do an experiment.</v>

2144
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Let's see who's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's wrong,</v>

2145
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and either side might be embarrassed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the case of these great </v>

2146
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:20.870
<v Speaker 2>political and economic issues we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be better off if we thought like </v>

2147
01:46:20.911 --> 01:46:24.090
<v Speaker 2>scientists kept an open mind and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2148
01:46:24.091 --> 01:46:29.091
<v Speaker 2>what works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a minimum wage lead to a higher </v>

2149
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:30.870
<v Speaker 2>unemployment because labor becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>

2150
01:46:31.110 --> 01:46:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2151
01:46:32.061 --> 01:46:33.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beats me if I know.</v>

2152
01:46:33.421 --> 01:46:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's let look at areas that have tried </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2153
01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.170
<v Speaker 2>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2154
01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.790
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does too much welfare.</v>

2155
01:46:38.791 --> 01:46:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Make people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2156
01:46:39.931 --> 01:46:41.250
<v Speaker 2>unambitious and Lacey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2157
01:46:41.251 --> 01:46:41.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2158
01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't figure this out from my arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair,</v>

2159
01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.410
<v Speaker 2>but let's look at different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compare.</v>

2160
01:46:46.411 --> 01:46:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Different countries compare different </v>
<v Speaker 2>states and cities issue after issue.</v>

2161
01:46:50.371 --> 01:46:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to be much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic and open to evidence,</v>

2162
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:57.220
<v Speaker 1>but when you do deal with these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like you were talking about,</v>

2163
01:46:57.221 --> 01:47:01.270
<v Speaker 1>the difference between genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you deal with the actual raw data,</v>

2164
01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:06.540
<v Speaker 1>that raw data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it gets very problematic for </v>

2165
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.860
<v Speaker 1>people that hold these ideas very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigidly in their mind.</v>

2166
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:14.310
<v Speaker 1>And they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to accept certain facts </v>

2167
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:17.281
<v Speaker 1>and Statistics and they come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why these things are either </v>

2168
01:47:17.281 --> 01:47:20.920
<v Speaker 1>inaccurate or biased or racist or sexist</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what have you.</v>

2169
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2170
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:23.450
<v Speaker 2>that's really true because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2171
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I think evolution didn't make us into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive scientists so much as a tool </v>

2172
01:47:29.781 --> 01:47:32.600
<v Speaker 2>intuitive lawyers and preachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2173
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:37.750
<v Speaker 2>the natural tendency is to amass the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest possible case for your own </v>

2174
01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:42.050
<v Speaker 2>side and to a boast that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2175
01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:47.100
<v Speaker 2>you are the side of virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who disagree with you are </v>

2176
01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:47.100
<v Speaker 2>idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2177
01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:47.750
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2178
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:48.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

2179
01:47:48.930 --> 01:47:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we got to push back against that </v>

2180
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.930
<v Speaker 2>tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2181
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I argued with enlightenment now.</v>

2182
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2183
01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I try to recognize that in my own mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes up.</v>

2184
01:47:58.491 --> 01:48:02.510
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so incredibly common that tribalism</v>

2185
01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that we see on the right and the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see it.</v>

2186
01:48:05.841 --> 01:48:10.841
<v Speaker 1>Men versus women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We oftentimes see it even in gay versus </v>

2187
01:48:10.841 --> 01:48:10.841
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2188
01:48:10.841 --> 01:48:15.251
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very bizarre but incredibly </v>

2189
01:48:15.251 --> 01:48:17.000
<v Speaker 1>common aspect of being a human being.</v>

2190
01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:20.410
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started out as a,</v>

2191
01:48:20.490 --> 01:48:23.760
<v Speaker 2>as a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a clinical psychologist.</v>

2192
01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't see patients but on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive scientists,</v>

2193
01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:30.711
<v Speaker 2>so I'm interested in how the mind works </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so a lot of my ideas on which way </v>

2194
01:48:31.261 --> 01:48:36.261
<v Speaker 2>we're going to keep going in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction are influenced by a kind of a </v>

2195
01:48:36.261 --> 01:48:41.121
<v Speaker 2>recognition of what makes us tick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the pitfalls in having a human </v>

2196
01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:42.840
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

2197
01:48:42.841 --> 01:48:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take credit for this.</v>

2198
01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:46.530
<v Speaker 2>This goes back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2199
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:48.220
<v Speaker 2>the American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2200
01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:53.300
<v Speaker 2>founders and framers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison and Jefferson and Adams and </v>

2201
01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were arguing,</v>

2202
01:48:55.381 --> 01:49:00.381
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how should we set up this new new </v>

2203
01:49:00.381 --> 01:49:00.381
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new government?</v>

2204
01:49:00.381 --> 01:49:03.800
<v Speaker 2>They will kind of intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists and they would point it </v>

2205
01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:03.800
<v Speaker 2>out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2206
01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:08.151
<v Speaker 2>if you just empower a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get drunk with his own </v>

2207
01:49:08.151 --> 01:49:10.320
<v Speaker 2>power and he's going to be diluted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do we do about that?</v>

2208
01:49:10.321 --> 01:49:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Because we do need some kind of leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2209
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 2>you've got these checks and balances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do,</v>

2210
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:16.250
<v Speaker 2>what makes people better off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2211
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:21.390
<v Speaker 2>if they can exchange things and each one</v>
<v Speaker 2>produces something they're good at and </v>

2212
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:24.120
<v Speaker 2>trades it with something that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else produces.</v>

2213
01:49:24.330 --> 01:49:29.330
<v Speaker 2>How do we set up a country where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes advantage of people's tendency to </v>

2214
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:33.381
<v Speaker 2>treat things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the connection between politics and </v>

2215
01:49:33.381 --> 01:49:34.020
<v Speaker 2>psychology was has been there for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2216
01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2217
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2218
01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the subject enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very loaded subject because it </v>

2219
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:41.040
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2220
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.911
<v Speaker 1>and especially in the world of Weirdos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cult leaders,</v>

2221
01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte Tins and people that are sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of promoting this idea,</v>

2222
01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.400
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you can achieve this sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of zen state of bliss,</v>

2223
01:49:59.511 --> 01:50:01.400
<v Speaker 1>of being above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of being,</v>

2224
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise to the point of being a sage.</v>

2225
01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:08.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird concept,</v>

2226
01:50:08.481 --> 01:50:09.810
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In today's Day and age,</v>

2227
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:10.410
<v Speaker 1>my</v>

2228
01:50:10.410 --> 01:50:15.410
<v Speaker 2>editor actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a little nervous about my choice </v>

2229
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.960
<v Speaker 2>of title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through a bunch of titles for it.</v>

2230
01:50:15.961 --> 01:50:17.430
<v Speaker 2>As I was writing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2231
01:50:17.431 --> 01:50:22.431
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think people are going to </v>

2232
01:50:22.431 --> 01:50:23.451
<v Speaker 2>confuse it with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason that meaning for </v>

2233
01:50:25.081 --> 01:50:27.870
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other meeting that I had in mind was</v>

2234
01:50:27.871 --> 01:50:32.871
<v Speaker 2>the movement in the 18th century to </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply reason to human betterment.</v>

2235
01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:40.370
<v Speaker 2>The ideas of of hume and Adam Smith and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the American founders like Jefferson and</v>

2236
01:50:42.181 --> 01:50:47.181
<v Speaker 2>Madison and John Locke and Thomas Hobbes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the 17th and 18th century,</v>

2237
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.710
<v Speaker 2>and we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2238
01:50:49.711 --> 01:50:54.711
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some people are confused and they </v>

2239
01:50:54.711 --> 01:50:56.451
<v Speaker 2>think this is a path toward my book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a path towards spiritual </v>

2240
01:50:56.451 --> 01:50:56.451
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2241
01:50:56.451 --> 01:50:58.560
<v Speaker 2>let them buy the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might enjoy it anyway,</v>

2242
01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:04.070
<v Speaker 2>but I went to the dictionary to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>which of the two meetings was listed </v>

2243
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:05.490
<v Speaker 2>first and most of the dictionary is </v>
<v Speaker 2>listed.</v>

2244
01:51:05.491 --> 01:51:10.491
<v Speaker 2>The sense that I had in mind first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely the movement in the 18th century </v>

2245
01:51:10.491 --> 01:51:11.520
<v Speaker 2>toward greater reason is the spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction,</v>

2246
01:51:11.521 --> 01:51:16.521
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiritual enlightenment is the one that </v>

2247
01:51:16.521 --> 01:51:16.521
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2248
01:51:16.521 --> 01:51:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's to be perfectly honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what the book is about.</v>

2249
01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2250
01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:20.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people think it has made it.</v>

2251
01:51:20.281 --> 01:51:22.820
<v Speaker 2>They'll buy the book by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you meditate?</v>

2252
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:24.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2253
01:51:24.181 --> 01:51:24.990
<v Speaker 2>but I think I should.</v>

2254
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:29.930
<v Speaker 2>But you're such a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you,</v>

2255
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.230
<v Speaker 2>why would there be anything that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do that you don't do it?</v>

2256
01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:37.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good question because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not clearly,</v>

2257
01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad.</v>

2258
01:51:40.051 --> 01:51:42.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of like a practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2259
01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2260
01:51:44.671 --> 01:51:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did,</v>

2261
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a,</v>

2262
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2263
01:51:47.650 --> 01:51:51.580
<v Speaker 2>in Davos the week before last and was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a panel with a maturity cow.</v>

2264
01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:56.720
<v Speaker 2>The French Buddhist monk who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I see eye to eye with an a lot of </v>

2265
01:51:56.850 --> 01:52:01.850
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the forward to the French </v>

2266
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.850
<v Speaker 2>translation to the better angels of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature and he had it.</v>

2267
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:04.440
<v Speaker 2>He had me in the whole room meditating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

2268
01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:09.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I liked it and I probably should </v>

2269
01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:09.680
<v Speaker 2>do some orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a benefit to it for now.</v>

2270
01:52:10.410 --> 01:52:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any practices that you do do</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to sorta like keep your,</v>

2271
01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:16.200
<v Speaker 2>your mind clean?</v>

2272
01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Like do you exercise regularly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely exercise regularly and I'm </v>

2273

<v Speaker 2>I like exercise my,</v>

2274
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:26.610
<v Speaker 2>where the scenery goes by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't,</v>

2275
01:52:26.670 --> 01:52:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I tend not to hang around in gyms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like jogging,</v>

2276
01:52:29.251 --> 01:52:30.600
<v Speaker 2>cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>aerobic than a um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>for a cognitive function,</v>

2282
01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:48.200
<v Speaker 2>a high intensity aerobic exercise that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to think that,</v>

2283
01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:50.310
<v Speaker 2>and I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2284
01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:55.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of step back and exert some </v>

2285
01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:58.691
<v Speaker 2>discipline on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So social media email more,</v>

<v Speaker 2>philosopher and we have a lot in common </v>

2289
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.460
<v Speaker 2>and it'd be kind of wasting life if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get to,</v>

2290
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:11.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2291
01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:16.751
<v Speaker 2>enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy time with her and she feels the </v>

2292
01:53:16.751 --> 01:53:16.751
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

2293
01:53:16.751 --> 01:53:17.780
<v Speaker 2>She's also a workaholic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we both are conscious of,</v>

2294
01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:18.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2295
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:19.880
<v Speaker 2>let's get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for a walk.</v>

2296
01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2297
01:53:21.210 --> 01:53:21.730
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>

2298
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:23.060
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see some friends.</v>

2299
01:53:23.061 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Let's be close to our families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a goal when you're writing a</v>

2300
01:53:27.711 --> 01:53:31.820
<v Speaker 2>book like this or is it just you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an interesting subject and just</v>

2301
01:53:31.821 --> 01:53:36.821
<v Speaker 2>sort of follow it through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always begin a book when I have,</v>

2302
01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:41.000
<v Speaker 2>when I come across some really deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting,</v>

2303
01:53:41.001 --> 01:53:46.001
<v Speaker 2>interesting idea that I think has not </v>
<v Speaker 2>been made public enough.</v>

2304
01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the case of,</v>

2305
01:53:49.610 --> 01:53:50.360
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2306
01:53:50.361 --> 01:53:54.350
<v Speaker 2>the better angels of our nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the fact that all these measures,</v>

2307
01:53:54.351 --> 01:53:58.820
<v Speaker 2>violence has been in historical decline </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is like a mind blowing fact.</v>

2308
01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And I came across it by various </v>
<v Speaker 2>historians,</v>

2309
01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:07.451
<v Speaker 2>political scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists that have sent me their </v>

2310
01:54:07.451 --> 01:54:09.611
<v Speaker 2>data and I was of sitting on all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>graphs showing the we're getting less </v>

2311
01:54:09.611 --> 01:54:10.160
<v Speaker 2>violent and know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know about it.</v>

2312
01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:15.580
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had an important story to </v>

2313
01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:16.790
<v Speaker 2>tell and I had a big intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>

2314
01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Namely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I am,</v>

2315
01:54:17.631 --> 01:54:18.690
<v Speaker 2>a psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2316
01:54:18.691 --> 01:54:23.691
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think I understand how the </v>

2317
01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:23.691
<v Speaker 2>mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a big puzzle.</v>

2318
01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Why were our ancestors so violent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how come more or less violent?</v>

2319
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:29.870
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of the same animals that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a couple of hundred years ago.</v>

2320
01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:32.480
<v Speaker 2>And likewise with the new book with </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment now,</v>

2321
01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.960
<v Speaker 2>then I discovered that there was even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more good news that if you look at other</v>

2322
01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:40.670
<v Speaker 2>measures of human wellbeing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>

2323
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.320
<v Speaker 2>like illiteracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2324
01:54:42.330 --> 01:54:44.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of work hours,</v>

2325
01:54:45.010 --> 01:54:46.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like disease,</v>

2326
01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:50.630
<v Speaker 2>a graph after graph looks like we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>made improvements,</v>

2327
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:52.580
<v Speaker 2>car safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane safety,</v>

2328
01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.800
<v Speaker 2>workplace safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pedestrian safety,</v>

2329
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:57.890
<v Speaker 2>death by fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death by drowning.</v>

2330
01:54:58.090 --> 01:55:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of them are going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was a story that I thought I</v>

2331
01:55:02.391 --> 01:55:04.620
<v Speaker 2>was excited by it because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2332
01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:05.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2333
01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.720
<v Speaker 2>I knew that when people came across it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would find it interesting and it </v>

2334
01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:11.750
<v Speaker 2>was again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intellectual challenge.</v>

2335
01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 2>How do you explain it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I attributed it to the enlightenment</v>

2336
01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:17.540
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you encounter much resistance to this</v>

2337
01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.210
<v Speaker 2>narrative from bloom people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2338
01:55:20.211 --> 01:55:21.260
<v Speaker 2>you bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:22.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are things that,</v>

2340
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:27.260
<v Speaker 2>that go wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the opioid epidemic that's wrong</v>

2341
01:55:27.261 --> 01:55:29.900
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's their big threats.</v>

2342
01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:32.810
<v Speaker 2>There's always a possibility of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

2343
01:55:32.811 --> 01:55:36.350
<v Speaker 2>And we've got to be really careful not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do anything stupid and to,</v>

2344
01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:41.030
<v Speaker 2>in fact try to world walk the world back</v>
<v Speaker 2>from nuclear weapons in the future.</v>

2345
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:42.960
<v Speaker 2>And climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2346
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:45.660
<v Speaker 2>and then there's some people who just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't believe it.</v>

2347
01:55:45.690 --> 01:55:46.080
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2348
01:55:46.081 --> 01:55:48.510
<v Speaker 2>what about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The terrorist attack yesterday?</v>

2349
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 2>And I just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2350
01:55:49.741 --> 01:55:50.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism,</v>

2351
01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:56.180
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of jerking us around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists by doing an eensy weensy bit </v>

2352
01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 2>of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gets a huge amount of publicity.</v>

2353
01:55:58.350 --> 01:56:03.350
<v Speaker 2>So let's not let ourselves get jerked </v>
<v Speaker 2>around by terrorists and rampage </v>

2354
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.350
<v Speaker 2>shooters.</v>

2355
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Not give them so much publicity </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on where the deaths really </v>

2356
01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:08.850
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in car accidents,</v>

2357
01:56:08.851 --> 01:56:12.150
<v Speaker 2>like in ordinary homicides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in opioid deaths.</v>

2358
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the numbers and not get </v>
<v Speaker 2>fooled by the headlines.</v>

2359
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.240
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do get resistance.</v>

2360
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:23.270
<v Speaker 2>We have obviously we have a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction to any mass tragedy like a,</v>

2361
01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:26.010
<v Speaker 2>a mass shooting or something along those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>

2362
01:56:26.011 --> 01:56:29.190
<v Speaker 2>but that this is a natural thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2363
01:56:29.191 --> 01:56:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Because this just seems so strange that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it could occur.</v>

2364
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural thing to have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction to this horrible tragedy,</v>

2365
01:56:36.421 --> 01:56:38.970
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have a reaction to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2366
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.850
<v Speaker 2>how many thousands of people die every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day because of obesity.</v>

2367
01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2368
01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Or even if we concentrate on violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we forget about,</v>

2369
01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:50.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who shoots his wife because he,</v>

2370
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:56.050
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks she's been flirting too much </v>

2371
01:56:56.050 --> 01:56:58.581
<v Speaker 2>or the two guys who have a fight in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar over who gets to use the pool table </v>

2372
01:56:58.581 --> 01:57:00.810
<v Speaker 2>next and one of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is lying dead on the floor.</v>

2373
01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are,</v>

2374
01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:04.820
<v Speaker 2>there are far more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2375
01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:08.880
<v Speaker 2>murders of that kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there are terrorists killings every</v>

2376
01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:11.250
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are something like 25 of those,</v>

2377
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:16.270
<v Speaker 2>those homicides and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like a sandy hill massacred day </v>

2378
01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:17.610
<v Speaker 2>after day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after day after day.</v>

2379
01:57:17.670 --> 01:57:20.160
<v Speaker 2>And they don't make the headlines </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they occur,</v>

2380
01:57:20.370 --> 01:57:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit by bit here and there.</v>

2381
01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:27.530
<v Speaker 2>But it's still incredibly confusing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people when someone does do something </v>

2382
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:27.530
<v Speaker 2>like the vegas shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

2383
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:32.390
<v Speaker 2>what is this like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a discussion of that just </v>

2384
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:35.181
<v Speaker 2>because it is such a puzzle and because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it attracts so much attention and a lot </v>

2385
01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:38.610
<v Speaker 2>of it is just the notoriety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are often,</v>

2386
01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:43.820
<v Speaker 2>not always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're often kind of nobody's and </v>

2387
01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:46.761
<v Speaker 2>their life has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going down the toilet and they're </v>

2388
01:57:46.761 --> 01:57:46.830
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2389
01:57:46.831 --> 01:57:49.230
<v Speaker 2>how can I do something that makes my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life meaningful,</v>

2390
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:50.730
<v Speaker 2>go out in a blaze of glory?</v>

2391
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:53.070
<v Speaker 2>And so they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the.</v>

2392
01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:54.210
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would ask you this question.</v>

2393
01:57:54.211 --> 01:57:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you want to become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2394
01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 2>not you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're already famous,</v>

2395
01:57:57.390 --> 01:58:02.390
<v Speaker 2>but if I say to a typical person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the one thing you can do that's </v>

2396
01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:05.430
<v Speaker 2>guaranteed to make you famous by </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow?</v>

2397
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:07.650
<v Speaker 2>The answer is kill a bunch of innocent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2398
01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2399
01:58:09.331 --> 01:58:10.100
<v Speaker 2>that's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2400
01:58:10.101 --> 01:58:15.101
<v Speaker 2>a perverse fact about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for people where fame and meaning</v>

2401
01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 2>and mattering are more important than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything including life itself,</v>

2402
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.690
<v Speaker 2>we've kind of given this perverse </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to become a somebody,</v>

2403
01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:29.760
<v Speaker 2>but because we just give them wall to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall news coverage.</v>

2404
01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:32.730
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has there been an uptick in,</v>

2405
01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:38.180
<v Speaker 2>in mass shootings and these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedies along with social media and </v>

2406
01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.550
<v Speaker 2>more media in general?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably a sum.</v>

2407
01:58:42.551 --> 01:58:46.190
<v Speaker 2>And they do tend to be occurring in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in cycles there.</v>

2408
01:58:46.190 --> 01:58:48.090
<v Speaker 2>There's a copycat phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:58:48.370 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Until people get a little bit bored and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it kind of dies down again.</v>

2410
01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:55.390
<v Speaker 2>So there is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there is a suggested policy.</v>

2411
01:58:55.710 --> 01:59:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually signed onto this from some </v>

2412
01:59:00.710 --> 01:59:02.880
<v Speaker 2>criminologists that the news media </v>
<v Speaker 2>should not publish the names or the </v>

2413
01:59:03.371 --> 01:59:06.790
<v Speaker 2>faces of mass killers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2414
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:08.080
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2415
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:10.570
<v Speaker 2>what's news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be newsworthy that had happened,</v>

2416
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.690
<v Speaker 2>but the particular name of the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>

2417
01:59:12.730 --> 01:59:15.940
<v Speaker 2>why is that newsworthy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it gets clicks.</v>

2418
01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:17.190
<v Speaker 2>It gets click.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2419
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:20.620
<v Speaker 2>There's so many articles that you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>today that you,</v>

2420
01:59:20.621 --> 01:59:24.640
<v Speaker 2>you look at the title of the article and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has very little to do with the actual</v>

2421
01:59:24.641 --> 01:59:29.641
<v Speaker 2>article itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just because they come up mean this </v>

2422
01:59:29.641 --> 01:59:30.100
<v Speaker 2>salacious headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

2423
01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:33.220
<v Speaker 2>they're so attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like today especially,</v>

2424
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.380
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing less and less people </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the Washington Post,</v>

2425
01:59:38.381 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the La Times,</v>

2426
01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:41.500
<v Speaker 2>they're struggling.</v>

2427
01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:46.360
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways they keep up is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving people what they want.</v>

2428
01:59:46.361 --> 01:59:47.680
<v Speaker 2>If it bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it leads.</v>

2429
01:59:47.681 --> 01:59:52.681
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is this crazy asshole that shot 58 </v>

2430
01:59:52.681 --> 01:59:52.681
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2431
01:59:52.681 --> 01:59:53.590
<v Speaker 2>let's find out what's going on in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2432
01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:55.960
<v Speaker 2>It was his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was this who says brother,</v>

2433
01:59:56.050 --> 01:59:58.750
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is according to this,</v>

2434
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:59.940
<v Speaker 2>this movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2435
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a case that's not so innocent.</v>

2436
02:00:01.691 --> 02:00:06.691
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the kind of click bait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't believe what happened to </v>

2437
02:00:06.691 --> 02:00:10.280
<v Speaker 2>the 19 seventies actress so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the picture of her in her seventies </v>

2438
02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:13.990
<v Speaker 2>if you know that kind of click bait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is click bait that does real </v>

2439
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:13.990
<v Speaker 2>harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are other,</v>

2440
02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:16.600
<v Speaker 2>you do have to balance it against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

2441
02:00:16.630 --> 02:00:18.730
<v Speaker 2>freedom of the press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want there to be,</v>

2442
02:00:18.731 --> 02:00:23.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments to tell newspapers where </v>

2443
02:00:23.731 --> 02:00:23.731
<v Speaker 2>they can publish.</v>

2444
02:00:23.731 --> 02:00:26.730
<v Speaker 2>But there have been some precedents </v>
<v Speaker 2>where press has voluntarily impose some </v>

2445
02:00:26.730 --> 02:00:29.620
<v Speaker 2>standards that do nothing to abrogate </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of the press.</v>

2446
02:00:29.621 --> 02:00:32.110
<v Speaker 2>But to make people better off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you an example from sports.</v>

2447
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

2448
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.000
<v Speaker 2>the TV networks adopted a policy of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>filming a fans that run onto the field,</v>

2449
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:43.660
<v Speaker 2>people stopped running onto the field </v>
<v Speaker 2>because why do they do it?</v>

2450
02:00:43.661 --> 02:00:44.380
<v Speaker 2>So they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2451
02:00:44.381 --> 02:00:47.740
<v Speaker 2>hi mom to be broadcast to 300 million TV</v>
<v Speaker 2>sets.</v>

2452
02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada had a policy of no longer </v>

2453
02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:56.200
<v Speaker 2>publishing the names of juvenile killers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2454
02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:01.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a voluntary restraint and it </v>

2455
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:01.770
<v Speaker 2>was socially responsible and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something to be said for,</v>

2456
02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:05.950
<v Speaker 2>for not giving rampage killers the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience that they seek.</v>

2457
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2458
02:01:08.231 --> 02:01:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that makes a lot of sense in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of,</v>

2459
02:01:11.771 --> 02:01:12.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2460
02:01:12.701 --> 02:01:17.310
<v Speaker 2>the greater good of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a newspaper guy and your,</v>

2461
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your business is just to sell </v>

2462
02:01:22.450 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2463
02:01:22.450 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>you're a bottom line person.</v>

2464
02:01:22.450 --> 02:01:27.120
<v Speaker 2>That the whole thing is just to include,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase the amount of revenue that </v>

2465
02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>comes into your institution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2466
02:01:27.371 --> 02:01:27.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2467
02:01:27.851 --> 02:01:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and not go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2468
02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Especially today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2469
02:01:30.911 --> 02:01:35.911
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists especially in a mainstream </v>

2470
02:01:35.911 --> 02:01:39.710
<v Speaker 2>forums like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the major networks and CNN and the today</v>

2471
02:01:39.711 --> 02:01:42.780
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still have a huge readership and,</v>

2472
02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>and they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

2473
02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:46.340
<v Speaker 2>they have to look at themselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mirror.</v>

2474
02:01:46.341 --> 02:01:48.140
<v Speaker 2>They do have journalistic codes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics.</v>

2475
02:01:48.141 --> 02:01:53.141
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguishes them from the fake news </v>

2476
02:01:53.141 --> 02:01:54.380
<v Speaker 2>and the rumor mills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2477
02:01:54.381 --> 02:01:57.560
<v Speaker 2>and that will always attract a large </v>
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>

2478
02:01:57.561 --> 02:02:02.561
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be able to trust what you </v>

2479
02:02:02.561 --> 02:02:02.561
<v Speaker 2>can read and so they've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2480
02:02:02.561 --> 02:02:06.490
<v Speaker 2>balance that against raw bottom line </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they lose their integrity </v>

2481
02:02:06.490 --> 02:02:08.600
<v Speaker 2>than that's not so good for the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>line in the long run either.</v>

2482
02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's room for new media </v>

2483
02:02:15.751 --> 02:02:20.751
<v Speaker 1>today in terms of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we obviously have these </v>

2484
02:02:20.751 --> 02:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>established places like the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>Times and like the Washington Post,</v>

2485
02:02:22.921 --> 02:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2486
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>these like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well respected,</v>

2487
02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>longstanding traditional venue that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder if that's really the right way to</v>

2488
02:02:35.101 --> 02:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>do it anymore.</v>

2489
02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been a simultaneous with the </v>

2490
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:43.080
<v Speaker 2>kind of bottom feeders and the clickbait</v>
<v Speaker 2>factories,</v>

2491
02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:46.960
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of really good new </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic magazines.</v>

2492
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:52.300
<v Speaker 2>No vocs and medium and Pacific Standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Nautilus and Colette and Ian and uh,</v>

2493
02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:55.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are others.</v>

2494
02:02:55.231 --> 02:02:56.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2495
02:02:56.311 --> 02:03:01.311
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a couple of decades earlier slate a </v>

2496
02:03:01.311 --> 02:03:01.410
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are really,</v>

2497
02:03:01.411 --> 02:03:06.411
<v Speaker 2>really good and you often can read </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you're not going to find </v>

2498
02:03:06.411 --> 02:03:09.110
<v Speaker 2>necessarily in the legacy papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're responsible and they have </v>

2499
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:09.210
<v Speaker 2>fact checkers and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2500
02:03:09.211 --> 02:03:14.211
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not clickbait factories and so </v>

2501
02:03:14.211 --> 02:03:14.211
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

2502
02:03:14.211 --> 02:03:18.651
<v Speaker 2>almost inequality in an intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>media where there's a lot of real crap </v>

2503
02:03:18.651 --> 02:03:21.740
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a room at the top for,</v>

2504
02:03:21.741 --> 02:03:26.741
<v Speaker 2>for new voices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at a guy like the </v>

2505
02:03:26.741 --> 02:03:26.741
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

2506
02:03:26.741 --> 02:03:28.430
<v Speaker 1>the United States who loves to use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>term fake news,</v>

2507
02:03:28.431 --> 02:03:33.431
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the weirder times ever is </v>

2508
02:03:33.431 --> 02:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>his attacks on the media and it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be very similar to like the way he </v>

2509
02:03:38.601 --> 02:03:43.601
<v Speaker 1>reacted to Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking him during that speech,</v>

2510
02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>like the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they criticize him and critique </v>

2511
02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:52.091
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his response is to completely attacked </v>

2512
02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:54.440
<v Speaker 1>them and just say that they're useless </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fake and it's.</v>

2513
02:03:55.200 --> 02:04:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird time for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for news when it comes to that and for </v>

2514
02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:00.740
<v Speaker 1>journalism.</v>

2515
02:04:00.970 --> 02:04:01.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2516
02:04:01.691 --> 02:04:06.691
<v Speaker 2>It is a very disturbing phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is a phenomenon of fake </v>

2517
02:04:06.691 --> 02:04:10.171
<v Speaker 2>news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fake news is not the same thing as </v>

2518
02:04:10.171 --> 02:04:10.300
<v Speaker 2>coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That criticizes the precedent.</v>

2519
02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2520
02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>An example of a real lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension of the,</v>

2521
02:04:14.921 --> 02:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>of how democracy works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mainly if you're the president,</v>

2522
02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be,</v>

2523
02:04:20.951 --> 02:04:22.510
<v Speaker 2>should be criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2524
02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:27.540
<v Speaker 2>How democracy works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a supreme divine leader </v>

2525
02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:31.930
<v Speaker 2>that we consider it infallible and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this event and that we bow down in front</v>

2526
02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:33.400
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything he says goes,</v>

2527
02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:38.880
<v Speaker 2>he's temporarily kind of a steward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's temporarily overseeing the </v>

2528
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.480
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2529
02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:42.120
<v Speaker 2>he screws up and if he says something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true,</v>

2530
02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:47.180
<v Speaker 2>the people have the right to criticism </v>
<v Speaker 2>or criticized him and they better be </v>

2531
02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:47.610
<v Speaker 2>that criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we're going to get a,</v>

2532
02:04:47.611 --> 02:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tyrant or a desk bought and,</v>

2533
02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking any criticism and,</v>

2534
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:57.750
<v Speaker 2>and labeling it fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a real funnel problem.</v>

2535
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Fake news is a genuinely anti democratic</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse and it's really disturbing.</v>

2536
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It is disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also disturbing his attacks on the </v>

2537
02:05:07.930 --> 02:05:10.700
<v Speaker 1>different intelligence agencies tax on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement.</v>

2538
02:05:10.701 --> 02:05:12.080
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real weird.</v>

2539
02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real weird that you know it.</v>

2540
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:18.260
<v Speaker 1>If you boil it all down and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it like,</v>

2541
02:05:18.261 --> 02:05:18.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

2542
02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2543
02:05:19.131 --> 02:05:20.840
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone that's after him,</v>

2544
02:05:20.841 --> 02:05:23.030
<v Speaker 1>anyone that's attacking him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing him,</v>

2545
02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people get demeaned and he uses </v>

2546
02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.971
<v Speaker 1>his influence and his power to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut down all of these criticisms </v>

2547
02:05:30.971 --> 02:05:33.140
<v Speaker 1>without any seemingly without any </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern,</v>

2548
02:05:33.141 --> 02:05:38.141
<v Speaker 1>for the longterm consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminishing the impact of these media.</v>

2549
02:05:38.421 --> 02:05:38.550
<v Speaker 1>A</v>

2550
02:05:39.970 --> 02:05:40.950
<v Speaker 2>really important point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2551
02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big theme of enlightenment now</v>

2552
02:05:43.721 --> 02:05:48.721
<v Speaker 2>is what makes progress possible is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the institutions that are </v>

2553
02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:54.340
<v Speaker 2>smarter than any of the flawed </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals that make it make it up,</v>

2554
02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:57.370
<v Speaker 2>that we recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We humans are,</v>

2555
02:05:57.540 --> 02:05:58.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2556
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:59.090
<v Speaker 2>what kind of smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor,</v>

2557
02:05:59.091 --> 02:06:02.650
<v Speaker 2>not that smart and we all like to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're good and decent and wise,</v>

2558
02:06:02.651 --> 02:06:06.120
<v Speaker 2>but no one of us in particular is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and decent and yes,</v>

2559
02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:11.520
<v Speaker 2>but we can set up rules and institutions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make the society as a whole better </v>

2560
02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.540
<v Speaker 2>than any of the individuals that make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2561
02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:16.360
<v Speaker 2>And democratic government is the prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2562
02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:21.420
<v Speaker 2>And the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between a democracy and </v>

2563
02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:24.420
<v Speaker 2>as a cultive personality like Mao in </v>
<v Speaker 2>China or Stalin in Russia,</v>

2564
02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Hitler in Germany or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2565
02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Mugabe in Zimbabwe now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2566
02:06:31.781 --> 02:06:33.790
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the Kim's in North Korea,</v>

2567
02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:39.120
<v Speaker 2>is that we don't worship a supreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader who kind of embodies the virtue </v>

2568
02:06:39.701 --> 02:06:40.480
<v Speaker 2>of the people.</v>

2569
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:44.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to get away from the ideas.</v>

2570
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:47.200
<v Speaker 2>You got to procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got some rules,</v>

2571
02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:48.100
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2572
02:06:48.110 --> 02:06:53.110
<v Speaker 2>you have to have someone making </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions but you kind of reign it in </v>

2573
02:06:53.110 --> 02:06:54.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's not about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the whole system.</v>

2574
02:06:55.510 --> 02:07:00.510
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that we've now got a leader</v>
<v Speaker 2>who just doesn't really seem to </v>

2575
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:03.661
<v Speaker 2>understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seems to think that it's all about </v>

2576
02:07:03.661 --> 02:07:03.661
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that if you just,</v>

2577
02:07:03.661 --> 02:07:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I alone consultant,</v>

2578
02:07:05.110 --> 02:07:06.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust me,</v>

2579
02:07:06.131 --> 02:07:07.450
<v Speaker 2>let me do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2580
02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:08.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2581
02:07:08.531 --> 02:07:09.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2582
02:07:09.310 --> 02:07:11.920
<v Speaker 2>all these rules and regulations are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep state,</v>

2583
02:07:11.921 --> 02:07:13.780
<v Speaker 2>the administrative state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2584
02:07:13.930 --> 02:07:16.270
<v Speaker 2>thank God for the deep state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The administrative state.</v>

2585
02:07:16.271 --> 02:07:20.350
<v Speaker 2>It prevents some desk bought from </v>
<v Speaker 2>foisting is cracked brain schemes on the</v>

2586
02:07:20.351 --> 02:07:25.351
<v Speaker 2>whole population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do need rules and bureaucrats and </v>

2587
02:07:25.351 --> 02:07:27.730
<v Speaker 2>checks and balances as an oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The can criticize the leader.</v>

2588
02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:31.200
<v Speaker 2>As a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at all this is,</v>

2589
02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:33.880
<v Speaker 2>is this a fascinating study to you or is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it terrifying?</v>

2590
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I guess?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess some of each.</v>

2591
02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather not be as fascinated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2592
02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:44.980
<v Speaker 2>because ultimately you really don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>human psychology to be determining the </v>

2593
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:46.720
<v Speaker 2>fate of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of want,</v>

2594
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:49.270
<v Speaker 2>or at least you want one product of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human psychology,</v>

2595
02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:54.300
<v Speaker 2>namely what we collectively irrationally</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree upon to be embodied in a set of </v>

2596
02:07:54.881 --> 02:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>rules and procedures and so it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2597
02:07:57.730 --> 02:07:58.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>

2598
02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:03.790
<v Speaker 1>There's also a way of behaving that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>deem presidential and Barack Obama,</v>

2599
02:08:03.791 --> 02:08:05.890
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied that better than anybody.</v>

2600
02:08:05.891 --> 02:08:10.891
<v Speaker 1>He was very composed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most composed leaders </v>

2601
02:08:10.891 --> 02:08:12.220
<v Speaker 1>ever in terms of leaders in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

2602
02:08:12.221 --> 02:08:16.690
<v Speaker 1>like the way he would communicate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he would respond to criticism.</v>

2603
02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:22.020
<v Speaker 1>He just had a very sort of composed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher level of his ability to </v>

2604
02:08:25.541 --> 02:08:27.310
<v Speaker 1>communicate is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

2605
02:08:28.090 --> 02:08:29.950
<v Speaker 1>it was very clean in a way.</v>

2606
02:08:30.630 --> 02:08:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2607
02:08:31.491 --> 02:08:36.491
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a kind of a dignity and state </v>

2608
02:08:36.491 --> 02:08:40.191
<v Speaker 2>street and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and decorum and statesman and there's a </v>

2609
02:08:40.191 --> 02:08:43.701
<v Speaker 2>reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't just that it makes you feel </v>

2610
02:08:43.701 --> 02:08:43.701
<v Speaker 2>good when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it actually is making a statement,</v>

2611
02:08:43.701 --> 02:08:46.050
<v Speaker 2>namely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't about me.</v>

2612
02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm occupying this office not to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to prove what a big shot I am,</v>

2613
02:08:52.381 --> 02:08:53.760
<v Speaker 2>what a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a,</v>

2614
02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:54.730
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2615
02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:56.550
<v Speaker 2>a glorious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Noble,</v>

2616
02:08:56.551 --> 02:09:00.210
<v Speaker 2>divine figure I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've got this big responsibility.</v>

2617
02:09:00.211 --> 02:09:05.211
<v Speaker 2>I've got power to kill hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people or to make them </v>

2618
02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:07.640
<v Speaker 2>better off or worse off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2619
02:09:07.650 --> 02:09:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I take that seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2620
02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:14.540
<v Speaker 2>it's not about me feeling really </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowered is about me kind of serving </v>

2621
02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:19.431
<v Speaker 2>the people that elected me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of self restraint and </v>

2622
02:09:19.431 --> 02:09:22.650
<v Speaker 2>respect for the office is a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaffirming that principle of democracy.</v>

2623
02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>What also concerns me is that the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in charge is.</v>

2624
02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:33.080
<v Speaker 1>This is how a lot of the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country views the nation itself.</v>

2625
02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Like and if you have a person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured and objective and well thought </v>

2626
02:09:39.151 --> 02:09:44.151
<v Speaker 1>out and well spoken and that when when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would hear especially Obama </v>

2627
02:09:44.241 --> 02:09:46.710
<v Speaker 1>speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with them or disagree with him,</v>

2628
02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:51.920
<v Speaker 1>everything was very clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way he maybe I use the word </v>

2629
02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>clean too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

2630
02:09:53.490 --> 02:09:58.490
<v Speaker 1>it was eloquent in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was smarter than most people.</v>

2631
02:09:59.011 --> 02:10:04.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more more articulate than most </v>

2632
02:10:04.011 --> 02:10:04.011
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2633
02:10:04.011 --> 02:10:08.000
<v Speaker 1>tho those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the sentences were formed were </v>

2634
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.880
<v Speaker 1>impressive in the intellectual capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the person that's delivering those </v>

2635
02:10:13.081 --> 02:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>words and so that made us feel better </v>
<v Speaker 1>about who we were as a country.</v>

2636
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:20.880
<v Speaker 1>We're being led by this very wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart person.</v>

2637
02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Whether you agree with his policies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2638
02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying that this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an exceptional human.</v>

2639
02:10:28.090 --> 02:10:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2640
02:10:29.770 --> 02:10:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a greater reason behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2641
02:10:31.931 --> 02:10:34.670
<v Speaker 2>To United States has the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>

2642
02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:40.420
<v Speaker 2>It's the richest country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States does matters to the </v>

2643
02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:43.751
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world and to reassure the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world that we're not just a </v>

2644
02:10:43.751 --> 02:10:47.180
<v Speaker 2>bunch of cowboys who are going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's makes us the most powerful,</v>

2645
02:10:47.181 --> 02:10:49.610
<v Speaker 2>but we really think about our role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>

2646
02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:53.330
<v Speaker 2>We don't do rash things that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>really be bad for the world.</v>

2647
02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:58.720
<v Speaker 2>That gets conveyed symbolically in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that a leader comports himself or </v>

2648
02:10:59.690 --> 02:11:00.200
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>

2649
02:11:00.810 --> 02:11:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I think of when I</v>

2650
02:11:02.951 --> 02:11:07.951
<v Speaker 1>see this whole thing going down and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see also this a reaction to this </v>

2651
02:11:07.951 --> 02:11:12.751
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the giant women's March being </v>

2652
02:11:12.751 --> 02:11:12.751
<v Speaker 1>called the women's March all day and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a woman's march,</v>

2653
02:11:12.751 --> 02:11:14.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a march against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

2654
02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a big part of what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>

2655
02:11:16.121 --> 02:11:19.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea is that he is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>against women in their eyes,</v>

2656
02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>whether it's correct or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that this March is to shorter sort </v>

2657
02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>of show solidarity that they disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the way things are going and I </v>

2658
02:11:28.541 --> 02:11:33.400
<v Speaker 1>wonder if having a guy like this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>power is going to,</v>

2659
02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:36.100
<v Speaker 1>as we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of swing effect,</v>

2660
02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>gonna re reignite more people to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically active and more people to do</v>

2661
02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:46.150
<v Speaker 1>recognize the things that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2662
02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:51.300
<v Speaker 1>like the calling the media fake news or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the attacks on the intelligence </v>

2663
02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:52.040
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these,</v>

2664
02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>these various things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that people deem to be </v>

2665
02:11:57.190 --> 02:12:00.961
<v Speaker 1>racist is things that people deem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile or or silly that he says and </v>

2666
02:12:02.951 --> 02:12:07.060
<v Speaker 1>that there'll be some sort of a powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction in response to that.</v>

2667
02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:08.540
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

2668
02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:13.580
<v Speaker 2>That is the hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too soon to tell because there are </v>

2669
02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>two possibilities and one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's sort of shattered.</v>

2670
02:12:16.451 --> 02:12:21.451
<v Speaker 2>Some norms created a precedent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means their successors could be even </v>

2671
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:25.750
<v Speaker 2>worse because norms can be fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you just don't do.</v>

2672
02:12:25.810 --> 02:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>If you're president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now you can do them.</v>

2673
02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the pessimistic view of the </v>

2674
02:12:32.770 --> 02:12:32.770
<v Speaker 2>optimistic view is that the country will</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2675
02:12:32.770 --> 02:12:34.240
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what we've been through.</v>

2676
02:12:34.241 --> 02:12:35.850
<v Speaker 2>We try that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get we,</v>

2677
02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:36.480
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2678
02:12:36.481 --> 02:12:38.160
<v Speaker 2>we tried crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get back to sane.</v>

2679
02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:38.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2680
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:40.900
<v Speaker 2>so those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the two possibilities.</v>

2681
02:12:41.210 --> 02:12:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out of time.</v>

2682
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2685
02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:49.630
<v Speaker 1>No reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science,</v>

2686

<v Speaker 1>humanism and progress.</v>
