<v Speaker 3>mast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We love you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

49
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came in and just dropped a bomb right</v>

50
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the greatest.</v>

51
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greatest.</v>

52
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>What we need is a food emancipation</v>
<v Speaker 1>proclamation.</v>

53
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>We need a food emancipation proclamation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to free the food system from the</v>

54
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:20.481
<v Speaker 1>enslavement of bureaucratic orthodoxy</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that consenting adults,</v>

55
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:27.591
<v Speaker 1>and I'm choosing my words very carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>here so that consenting adults could</v>

56
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:32.781
<v Speaker 1>make a voluntary choice of food choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type that they want from the source</v>

57
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.671
<v Speaker 1>that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we allowed however many in our</v>

58
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:46.071
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5% 10% 20% whoever didn't come,</v>

59
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>whoever wanted to opt out of government</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned orthodoxy and say,</v>

60
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something better out here?</v>

61
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Can I choose something different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody who wanted to opt out of the</v>

62
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>of the current industrial government</v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodoxy could do so,</v>

63
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>voluntary consenting adults here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know we're talking about the right</v>

64
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>of private contract.</v>

65
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>If I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to come to your farm</v>

66
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no extortion here,</v>

67
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily look around,</v>

68
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>smell around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask around and I want what you're</v>

69
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>producing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be able to get it.</v>

70
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>When the government gets between my lips</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my throat,</v>

71
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I call that an invasion of privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

72
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I do also believe that we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>legalize all drugs,</v>

73
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the government that can tell you</v>

74
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't smoke dope can also tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't drink raw milk or,</v>

75
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

76
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>or refuse to vaccinate your children or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>go down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that the orthodoxy is so</v>

78
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:01.351
<v Speaker 1>convoluted now that it's perfectly safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fine to feed your kids.</v>

79
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain dew count Chocula cheerios and</v>

80
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:11.041
<v Speaker 1>pop tarts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not homemade charcuterie,</v>

81
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>pickles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raw milk and backyard butcher chickens.</v>

82
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Not Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely crazy.</v>

83
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And if we would free up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I travel a lot.</v>

84
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I talked to thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmers.</v>

85
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I just talked to 200 farmers up in San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jose this weekend.</v>

86
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the limiting factor?</v>

87
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Why is local food cheap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is our kind of food,</v>

88
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more expensive,</v>

89
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has to be.</v>

90
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Why are we perceived as elitist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't it more available?</v>

91
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so hard to find integrity</v>
<v Speaker 1>food?</v>

92
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>This is the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we would free up those of us in</v>

93
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:55.381
<v Speaker 1>the system that are ready to access our</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors with quiche and noodles and</v>

94
00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>charcuterie and you know a name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your name,</v>

95
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>it to free us up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

96
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it would completely invert the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>food system in a year.</v>

97
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird about like bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>o'reilly or the Big Bang theory or any</v>

98
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 2>of those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they have this perfect opportunity at</v>

99
00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:22.091
<v Speaker 2>any moment to blow people's minds by</v>
<v Speaker 2>just making 180 degree turn just turning</v>

100
00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:27.770
<v Speaker 2>in some complete opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if bill had me direct an episode</v>

101
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 2>of Big Bang theory with no notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

102
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.540
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a lot of active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'd have to write it to you</v>

103
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.030
<v Speaker 2>couldn't know I can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

104
00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 2>if I have creative liberties with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>script,</v>

105
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get as many gay teens is.</v>

106
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I want God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be so fun.</v>

107
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 2>That'd be so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If like they had to do that at once a</v>

108
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to let underground artists edit</v>

109
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:51.080
<v Speaker 2>and direct their shows just to see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would turn into.</v>

110
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Why that would be a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Fun.</v>

111
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be fun for you,</v>

112
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 2>but just low stakes shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcoms,</v>

113
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 2>you know it's not low stakes because</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if it was your show and then</v>

114
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 2>some fucking dj doug pound comes along</v>

<v Speaker 2>Seven 18 it's going to be awesome.</v>

121
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>They wake up and it's all a dream</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

122
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the caveat.</v>

123
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Blossom becomes a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all start eating babies.</v>

124
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Baby Salad every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll just use like rubber baby</v>

125
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 2>dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>

126
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 2>But if bill o'reilly came out for one</v>
<v Speaker 2>show in drag</v>

127
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 2>and just it's like this is who I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really explain it.</v>

128
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Same Guy and he's the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

129
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 2>this is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how I've changed deal with it.</v>

130
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 2>That would be as big as Geeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be as big as Jesus.</v>

131
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.350
<v Speaker 2>That is how Jesus will come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be below right now.</v>

132
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Wilamena we'll Amena o'reilly and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts slowly beginning of a</v>

133
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>transformation to the female gender.</v>

134
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 2>That would be incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just tells you like the reason why he</v>

136
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 2>was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just she was scared,</v>

137
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 2>scared all the time that people find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he identifies with being a woman</v>

138
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 2>and that's where all the hate came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the homophobia,</v>

139
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:09.100
<v Speaker 2>all the Jesus' love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that craziness that was,</v>

140
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 2>he was into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really just,</v>

141
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be a woman and then he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts putting pictures of his news,</v>

142
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 2>surgical crusty below or ile pussy up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and people just,</v>

143
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>it causes waves of suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's what's crazy.</v>

144
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>People still spot him out at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dress like a man and he looks</v>

145
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 2>perfectly normal and they realize it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a fucking scam.</v>

146
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Like everything else he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not really becoming a woman.</v>

147
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bullshit artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be one of the salvage.</v>

148
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what happens is you realize</v>

149
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 2>someone's blackmailing him.</v>

150
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 2>You realize somebody has something worse</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that and they're like,</v>

151
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:42.974
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it goes in and tide goes out.</v>

158
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:04.301
