<v Speaker 1>literally about to go crazy.</v>

22
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About two to half.</v>

23
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just the bubbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

24
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>we think it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here we are and this wonderful </v>

25
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>office park in the valley in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine.</v>

26
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's birds chirping,</v>

27
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>so the whole world hasn't gone crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true,</v>

28
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>but there's spots that are going fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

29
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Yale has gone crazy and pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

30
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>The students did my whole show up at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week on my new podcast.</v>

31
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Which way can I do an episode on Josh </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jumps?</v>

32
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cozy called Hashtag.</v>

33
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>We'd have people live if you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like down with the hip social </v>

34
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get with it.</v>

35
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I do hashtags or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only use like in jest,</v>

36
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is sort of tongue in cheek.</v>

37
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It's also a cool way of like if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have searched for you,</v>

38
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a bazillion way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people lives podcasts,</v>

39
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>but there's only one that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start with a Hashtag.</v>

40
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So you put it in a Hashtag and as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prison will be the first to come up.</v>

41
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I use it for the UFC only like Hashtag </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC 91 93.</v>

42
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>If I'm talking about like an event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

43
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hashtags are interesting because if </v>

44
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.001
<v Speaker 1>you ever go to Hashtags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever go to like Hashtag black </v>

45
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.001
<v Speaker 1>twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.001
<v Speaker 1>I never do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

47
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made.</v>

48
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>That's where he spends 23 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you know how sometimes sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need to go to them because they </v>

50
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>come to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you say something?</v>

51
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Then you get taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can end up by some blog and </v>

52
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all over the weekend,</v>

53
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been getting all these tweets just </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the blue about what fascism is.</v>

54
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

55
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Who are these people and why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting at me?</v>

56
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that I said anything </v>

57
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>about fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.221
<v Speaker 1>it's because breitbart picked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I did on a segment on </v>

59
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:22.221
<v Speaker 1>huffpost live last week and write </v>
<v Speaker 1>something up about it,</v>

60
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>about how apparently I implied that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump was a fascist,</v>

61
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>which actually didn't mean because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that he is,</v>

62
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden I'm in the Hashtag </v>

63
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>like I'm part of the Hashtag about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism without even choosing it.</v>

64
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I believe that most people who use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>term fascist or fascism don't really </v>

65
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>exactly know what the term meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're totally right,</v>

66
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:45.141
<v Speaker 1>so let's help them out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find the official definition of </v>

67
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>fascism because I think most people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wrong.</v>

68
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Fascism means and authoritarian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalistic,</v>

69
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>right wing system of government and </v>
<v Speaker 1>social organization,</v>

70
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>so people use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other definitions of of course,</v>

71
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>but extreme right wing authoritarian.</v>

72
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>People use that for a lot of like non </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascist reason.</v>

73
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.570
<v Speaker 1>That's true and I probably used it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sloppily myself in the context in which </v>

74
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>bright pub was picking me up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a point if,</v>

75
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>if I do come across as saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is a fascist,</v>

76
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but all the people who were tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>back at me with saying,</v>

77
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>fascism isn't right when you idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's left wing and slept way.</v>

78
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Socialism is the real fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand the meaning of the </v>

79
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.271
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just responded with an with a link </v>

80
00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:32.491
<v Speaker 1>to the Oxford dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also includes the wood right wing </v>

81
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:32.491
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

82
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly considered right when we.</v>

83
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:38.611
<v Speaker 1>When people are using it in the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing circles now or about left wing </v>

84
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>circles because they're using it and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian context because that is,</v>

85
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that's applicable because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what is going on in like really </v>

86
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>extreme social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leftwing type organizations or groups is</v>

87
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:57.391
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to control behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to mitigate </v>

88
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:01.021
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't criticize these concepts </v>

89
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>because these concepts are supported by </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice.</v>

90
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got an interesting study on that,</v>

91
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted that I brought for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before I get to it,</v>

92
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:12.271
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to forget what I was just </v>

93
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:13.771
<v Speaker 1>thinking when you were talking about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are in the valley village </v>

94
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:13.771
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chirp,</v>

95
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Chirp,</v>

96
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Chirp,</v>

98
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Betty Jo.</v>

99
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practiced that all day.</v>

100
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It was not a little one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear it again.</v>

101
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put that as my ringtone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it too.</v>

102
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.330
<v Speaker 1>It will never hear your phone put up </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

103
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really loud.</v>

104
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So I was in Beirut briefly a few months </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and he was standing on the rooftop </v>

105
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 1>of this swanky hotel looking out over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mediterranean and looking at </v>

106
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>evidence the houses and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just like an idyllic,</v>

107
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>beautiful part of the world in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its natural beauty and I could </v>

108
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>practically swim from here to the Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands,</v>

109
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

110
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.440
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

111
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>The refugees and I had just been in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek in Athens as well,</v>

112
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>which is like geographically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically Italy,</v>

113
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Greece at the same as these fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of North Africa and Israel and </v>

114
00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Palestine and been Lebanon and not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mention Syria.</v>

115
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 1>And I was like just struck by how </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable we are a fucking things up as </v>

116
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>paypal because the actual geography is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

117
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Like those waves at the same waves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones on the Italian Riviera.</v>

118
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 1>But the Italian Riviera is the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Riviera and this shit hole is this </v>

119
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>shithole through no difference of </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate or some old.</v>

120
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>The booties are still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The booties are the same,</v>

121
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 1>but religion and politics just has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>endless capacity to,</v>

122
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>to screw things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could call it religion or politics,</v>

123
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:52.171
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's human beings trying to achieve </v>

124
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>power and you could do it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever modality you choose,</v>

125
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:59.341
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is it's just people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to control other people and </v>

126
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:03.821
<v Speaker 1>trying to gain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's in particular tribes </v>

127
00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>trying to control other tribes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and religion make you much more</v>

128
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It make it much easier to be tribal,</v>

129
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 1>much easier to not be an individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

130
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't the argument against that.</v>

131
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.100
<v Speaker 1>What we were just talking about one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of social justice warriors and </v>

132
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>people calling people fascist mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

133
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:19.390
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

134
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you're in a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are on the extreme left or the </v>

135
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 1>extreme right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a tribe.</v>

136
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>You know when you talk to right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

137
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:31.751
<v Speaker 1>they're almost incapable of not bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up liberals or the liberals think they </v>

138
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>don't just bring up their own concepts </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own thoughts.</v>

139
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>They'll immediately disparage liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

140
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Like immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

142
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you're a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe in this and this and that.</v>

144
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So you're a liberal and then like </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately like downplay your ideas.</v>

145
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

146
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.630
<v Speaker 1>That's politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's religion as is.</v>

147
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And social justice worries will do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

148
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 1>They'll do the same thing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my,</v>

149
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

150
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.460
<v Speaker 1>the first time I came to your attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>was with that interview with.</v>

151
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So he parked the cancel Kobe activist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

152
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And convincing still one of my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you just broke it down to her,</v>

153
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so fucking unbelievable.</v>

154
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And you could tell she was just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastated that you even had the balls </v>

155
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>to question her to people that hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't seen it,</v>

156
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>that she wanted to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the Kolbe a report canceled because</v>

157
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>apparently it was racist and I did an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview with her on huffpost live.</v>

158
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nice for people who don't even </v>

159
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>know the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kobe plays a character.</v>

160
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 1>He plays an extreme left wing kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>goofy character,</v>

161
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme right wing,</v>

162
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>kind of goofy character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that context of that character,</v>

163
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.470
<v Speaker 1>he made a joke about racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a joke about racism and in that </v>

164
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>it was a funny joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what the joke was?</v>

165
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

166
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It was Dan Snyder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

167
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.930
<v Speaker 1>who's the head of the Redskins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Who was saying that he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that he didn't have to change </v>

169
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>the name of the redskins because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

170
00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:02.411
<v Speaker 1>He was going to set up a charity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>native American and causes and Stephen </v>

171
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Colbert and his right wing persona said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes he'd been accused of </v>

172
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>doing jokes that could be considered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be offensive about Asian people,</v>

173
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 1>so in return he was going to set up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ching Chung Dingdong Foundation for </v>

174
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity towards orientals or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever or whatever,</v>

175
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and she found that offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

176
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe she really did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she found it.</v>

177
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a green light for her to attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to use hashtag activism and to get </v>

178
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>them get some publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one story that's making the </v>

179
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.521
<v Speaker 1>rounds today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Kansas City University professor who </v>

180
00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:39.760
<v Speaker 1>in a class I'm about racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a discussion about racism and </v>

181
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:45.041
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She used the word nigger and in using </v>

182
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 1>the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these students are trying to get her</v>

183
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 1>fired and she's been removed of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>duties right now.</v>

184
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>She's been temporarily suspended under </v>
<v Speaker 1>review or whatever their processes,</v>

185
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>but in just saying</v>

186
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not saying someone is like,</v>

187
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.651
<v Speaker 2>this is a word that people have issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's discuss words that people have </v>

188
00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 2>issues with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the origins of these words?</v>

189
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Why are they problematic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

190
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can be done about this?</v>

191
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly what the context of</v>

192
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 2>her classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>

193
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the context wasn't.</v>

194
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's go around accusing black people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have being absolutely not.</v>

195
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is the same kind of thing.</v>

196
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe anyone in that class was</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually hurt by that.</v>

197
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of found the green light and </v>

198
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 2>they attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Don't we learn what to be offended by </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

200
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible that that someone felt </v>

201
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.940
<v Speaker 2>like an initial kind of reaction of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

202
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I just heard that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

203
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:42.411
<v Speaker 2>I've been told that that word is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unacceptable under all </v>

204
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:45.411
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've been told that I'm allowed to </v>

205
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:45.411
<v Speaker 2>be offended.</v>

206
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:45.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

207
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 2>And in in date ought to be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

208
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.620
<v Speaker 2>And so like I was amazed by the power of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that word when I first came to the </v>

209
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.350
<v Speaker 2>states because they're only here is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>

210
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.690
<v Speaker 2>do we have this demoss would the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>would like that phrase?</v>

211
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

212
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd never heard that until I came</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the site.</v>

213
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:07.551
<v Speaker 2>So in Australia it was completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable to ever to ever use the </v>

214
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 2>word nigger against somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just never do that.</v>

215
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I was taught since the earliest days </v>
<v Speaker 2>that racism is terrible,</v>

216
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 2>but you could talk about it in polite </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

217
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

218
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:21.591
<v Speaker 2>If it came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be able to discuss the existence </v>

219
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:21.591
<v Speaker 2>of the word and nobody would ever say </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word,</v>

220
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 2>but you guys have racism towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>aborigines.</v>

221
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty real over there.</v>

222
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Speaker 2>This is towards black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

223
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

224
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 2>But there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a much,</v>

225
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:36.231
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much bigger awareness of the kind of </v>

226
00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:40.851
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of the original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of what happened when Australia was </v>

227
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 2>settled than there is here towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>native Americans.</v>

228
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:47.781
<v Speaker 2>I sort of regard native Americans as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being the people who've really been </v>

229
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:47.781
<v Speaker 2>screwed in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not to,</v>

230
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 2>not that it should be a competition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like who's you know,</v>

231
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.490
<v Speaker 2>who's suffering was worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I'll put my slavery genocide </v>

232
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.520
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

233
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I always hate it when,</v>

234
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.190
<v Speaker 2>when we get into those games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

235
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 2>nobody even talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Australia,</v>

236
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 2>if you go to an award ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

237
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:09.051
<v Speaker 2>if you're at the grammys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single presenter will come up and </v>

238
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.421
<v Speaker 2>they will begin by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to start by acknowledging the </v>

239
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.480
<v Speaker 2>traditional owners of this land that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a windy people,</v>

240
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

241
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

242
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 2>they'll at least give a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically correct nod to the fact that</v>

243
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 2>we occupied the country and basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped out an entire people.</v>

244
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see aboriginal flags flying on </v>

245
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Parliament House alongside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australian flag.</v>

246
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.840
<v Speaker 2>What the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the night of </v>

247
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:32.840
<v Speaker 2>American flag is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still even have a flag.</v>

248
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

249
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.350
<v Speaker 2>if they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

250
00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:36.220
<v Speaker 2>noted aborigines back then symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

251
00:11:36.221 --> 00:11:41.221
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they certainly had symbols that were </v>

252
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>indicative of different tribes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>different regions.</v>

253
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.430
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

254
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they had flags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong.</v>

255
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean aboriginals didn't have </v>

256
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:49.300
<v Speaker 2>flags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aboriginals didn't even have metal,</v>

257
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:49.300
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

258
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

259
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were at the time when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>British settled Australia and I always </v>

260
00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 2>get accused when I say things like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been politically correct,</v>

261
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors of imposing onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional societies.</v>

262
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.350
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea of human civilization as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being better if it's like industrialized</v>

263
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 2>than if it's not industrialized.</v>

264
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 2>And because I'm like a white man who </v>
<v Speaker 2>liked,</v>

265
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.500
<v Speaker 2>totally thinks that like the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 2>century is better than the fucking 15th </v>

266
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me back up because it is better.</v>

267
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

268
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have computers and the Internet,</v>

269
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.990
<v Speaker 2>we have books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of things that are better </v>

270
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 2>than like flint knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just having said that,</v>

271
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:24.850
<v Speaker 2>you're such a wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you such a white man,</v>

272
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

273
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.290
<v Speaker 2>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about like the,</v>

274
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 2>the traditional anthropological </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of human evolution going from</v>

275
00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

276
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:38.551
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the discovery of fire and farming and </v>

277
00:12:38.551 --> 00:12:41.341
<v Speaker 2>then up through the bronze age and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>INA agents on average and he's when the,</v>

278
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.420
<v Speaker 2>when the British settled Australia were </v>
<v Speaker 2>the least advanced civilization in the </v>

279
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.201
<v Speaker 2>world by far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're talking a mosque and again,</v>

280
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I like the politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pardon me?</v>

281
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 2>It has to keep qualifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had been around for over 100,000</v>

282
00:12:57.491 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were doing something successful.</v>

283
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>Like it's only been 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

284
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's rabbits are doing a good job.</v>

285
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Did you just compare aboriginal </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australians to rabbits?</v>

286
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Did it in that context?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

288
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I like you for that because I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogies and I like being able to </v>

289
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.800
<v Speaker 2>accept analogies without thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person is saying that the two things</v>

290
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:20.590
<v Speaker 2>are the same in every respect because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always get pulled up.</v>

291
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:25.591
<v Speaker 2>Like I made a Hitler analogy the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day about I was talking to who was at </v>

292
00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Donny Deutsch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that guy?</v>

293
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

294
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.880
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how he likes trump </v>

295
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:32.880
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

296
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 2>and I might some parallel where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

297
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was simply saying that like,</v>

298
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's popular,</v>

299
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 2>he's touching a vein.</v>

300
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

301
00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:44.161
<v Speaker 2>but is that the only reason to respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody hit let's touch the vein as </v>

302
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:44.161
<v Speaker 2>well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

303
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 2>he got all outraged on the air at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that I would like say Hitler.</v>

304
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

305
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>

306
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

307
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that trump is the same as</v>

308
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you idiot.</v>

309
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:58.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>criterion by which you were judging his </v>

310
00:13:58.381 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 2>success is floored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was using an analogy to do so.</v>

311
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should be,</v>

312
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 2>he should be ashamed because he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the exact thing.</v>

313
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:09.751
<v Speaker 2>We're accusing the extreme left up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saw a green light and he went after </v>

314
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:09.751
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

315
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:14.041
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does he really think I'm a Nazi </v>

316
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:14.041
<v Speaker 2>sympathizer or that I'm like shitting on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

317
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:14.041
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I was like,</v>

318
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:18.121
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother was in the concentration </v>

319
00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:18.121
<v Speaker 2>camps and I pull a juke out on me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I just moved right up.</v>

320
00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donny.</v>

321
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.950
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>area aborigines didn't,</v>

322
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 2>didn't have like metal and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

323
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were extremely primitive so </v>

324
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.381
<v Speaker 2>far removed from what we consider to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced civilization that Australia </v>

325
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 2>felt it was okay to actually take their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and adopt them.</v>

326
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.740
<v Speaker 2>And this was recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was in like the fifties,</v>

327
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you know,</v>

328
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:47.101
<v Speaker 2>until 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>69 aborigines were classified in </v>

329
00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Australia as foreigner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

330
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want</v>

331
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.200
<v Speaker 1>not flora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been a couple of floral </v>

332
00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 1>aborigines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

333
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.240
<v Speaker 1>they were mostly like in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>category as Kangaroos now you couldn't </v>

334
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:04.240
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't kill him.</v>

335
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.730
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean they weren't officially </v>

336
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.370
<v Speaker 1>classified as full and it's just that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't classified as human,</v>

337
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>like they weren't considered to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the.</v>

338
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 1>So like you can't kill a chimp either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a recent thing.</v>

340
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 1>But it's come a long way in the past 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years now.</v>

341
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a general consensus </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

342
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>that we really fucked them over a hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>so kids are fucking babies no matter.</v>

343
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean no matter how not to defend it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was at the same time that Jim </v>

344
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.670
<v Speaker 1>crow was going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

345
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we were in a lightened </v>

346
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:40.720
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

347
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>our forefathers were enlightened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties about rice.</v>

348
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>

349
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 1>everybody was pretty fucked up back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

350
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very difficult for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand in 2015 what it was like in </v>

351
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 1>1950 [inaudible] I think we assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have known better.</v>

352
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:56.381
<v Speaker 1>They should have been like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 100 years before them they were </v>

353
00:15:56.381 --> 00:15:56.690
<v Speaker 1>cowboys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's they.</v>

354
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 1>They had horses riding trains and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

355
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 1>And 100 years before that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even have fucking trains,</v>

356
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 100 years before that mean you're,</v>

357
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 1>you're in the dark ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

358
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're 1,514</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

359
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.480
<v Speaker 1>a few hundred years removed from gingiss</v>
<v Speaker 1>con.</v>

360
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.680
<v Speaker 1>It's fast and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember whether I've spoken to </v>

361
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.621
<v Speaker 1>you about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was when I was in grace on the </v>

362
00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:20.621
<v Speaker 1>trip and I was just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

363
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I was standing at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:27.371
<v Speaker 1>the Acropolis in Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was expecting to be wowed like Altura </v>

365
00:16:27.371 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 1>PSA by all the Shia age of this thing.</v>

366
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the birthplace of Western </v>

367
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead what I thought was,</v>

368
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd actually just been back to New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand because my grandma died.</v>

369
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 1>She was one day shy of her 100th </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday.</v>

370
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost made it 99 and 364 days.</v>

371
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So she was just born premature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would've had that mean when you were</v>

372
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:50.510
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So arbitrary.</v>

373
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I think labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

374
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take her from like the,</v>

375
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the third trimester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

376
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 1>She made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She made it from the quickening.</v>

377
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She made it from the yes soul made it </v>

378
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I was struck by at the </v>

379
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Acropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Parthenon was not like how old human</v>

380
00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:11.750
<v Speaker 1>civilization was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like my grandma,</v>

381
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>her lifetime is a manageable period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in my brain.</v>

382
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I can think about that in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to me about something that</v>

383
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:20.930
<v Speaker 1>happened 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

384
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:25.931
<v Speaker 1>it's just meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you talk about the size of the </v>

385
00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:27.791
<v Speaker 1>cosmos or a light year or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't like I might be able to </v>

386
00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:27.920
<v Speaker 1>understand it intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just washes off in my head.</v>

387
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the lifetime of my grandmother,</v>

388
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:32.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a manageable span of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine.</v>

389
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.080
<v Speaker 1>A hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

390
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.160
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This acropolis at the dawn of Western </v>

391
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.750
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before humans had even invented anything</v>

392
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:46.751
<v Speaker 1>that we would recognize as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized in terms of laws and </v>

393
00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 1>procedures and technologies that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 of my grandma's.</v>

394
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

395
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.900
<v Speaker 2>How about this one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

396
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 2>it's 40 140,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>users.</v>

397
00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:01.251
<v Speaker 2>40 of my grandma's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was 20 of my grandma's a nuclear </v>

398
00:18:01.251 --> 00:18:05.421
<v Speaker 2>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandma was born during the </v>

399
00:18:05.421 --> 00:18:07.281
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] campaign and World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler wasn't even a name that her </v>

400
00:18:07.281 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 2>parents knew when she was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The depression hadn't happened.</v>

401
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 2>The bomb hadn't been invented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone computers.</v>

402
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.860
<v Speaker 2>How faster things going pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how recently was it over the span </v>

403
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:23.550
<v Speaker 2>of geological time that we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys,</v>

404
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 2>effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys,</v>

405
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.000
<v Speaker 3>they believe to 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

406
00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in this form,</v>

407
00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.580
<v Speaker 3>they're bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it changes depending upon the fossil</v>

408
00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:35.350
<v Speaker 3>record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they add new evidence,</v>

409
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.350
<v Speaker 3>like they just found a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like within the last couple of weeks,</v>

410
00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:42.310
<v Speaker 3>they've recognized a new subspecies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings and ancient subspecies.</v>

411
00:18:42.311 --> 00:18:44.470
<v Speaker 3>They found a giant tooth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're.</v>

412
00:18:44.471 --> 00:18:49.471
<v Speaker 3>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're finding fossil records that </v>

413
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:53.100
<v Speaker 3>pretty much pretty much coincide with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the established belief that people are </v>

414
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.540
<v Speaker 3>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus years in this form.</v>

415
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Like you could take a person from </v>
<v Speaker 3>200,000</v>

416
00:18:57.401 --> 00:19:02.401
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd probably be considerably smaller </v>

417
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:04.261
<v Speaker 3>than us because they didn't get a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>food and you'd put them in a movie </v>

418
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:04.261
<v Speaker 3>theater and they would look just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were.</v>

419
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:05.710
<v Speaker 3>I maybe was teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

420
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.060
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kept your mouth shut,</v>

421
00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we showered them,</v>

422
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.630
<v Speaker 3>trimmed whatever fucking weird hair they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

423
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably just very strangely </v>

424
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

425
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.810
<v Speaker 3>obviously in the fossil record we're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting too much.</v>

426
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare they find skin and hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're just kind of guessing what </v>

427
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.070
<v Speaker 3>they looked like on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they believe that about 200,000</v>

428
00:19:24.071 --> 00:19:26.980
<v Speaker 3>years in this form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give or take 100,000</v>

429
00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:28.720
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty recent.</v>

430
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 3>More than what we have than take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

431
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really good.</v>

432
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Give and take</v>

433
00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.000
<v Speaker 2>what's most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's most sort of frightening to me is</v>

434
00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:41.320
<v Speaker 2>how recently technology has become as </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful as it is,</v>

435
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 2>especially nukes and superimposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that was invented within the </v>

436
00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:48.910
<v Speaker 2>lifetime of my dad.</v>

437
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Think about what we just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that.</v>

438
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.090
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call it 300,000</v>

439
00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.520
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>3,000</v>

440
00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:56.900
<v Speaker 3>of your grandma's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

441
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.790
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're monkeys.</v>

442
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just 3000.</v>

443
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Like a good size of theater show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

444
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Like you go to the Chicago theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's 3,700</v>

445
00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:12.341
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good spot to look at those </v>

446
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:15.311
<v Speaker 3>people in that audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get a full Chicago theater of </v>

447
00:20:15.311 --> 00:20:15.311
<v Speaker 3>3,700</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

448
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.540
<v Speaker 3>if every one of them lived birth to </v>
<v Speaker 3>death to stop and think about that.</v>

449
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.190
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

450
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.450
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

451
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.790
<v Speaker 3>That's 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years</v>

452
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.670
<v Speaker 2>and you don't even need to go that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you didn't even take it that far </v>

453
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.701
<v Speaker 2>before the kinds of lives that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>will live living and the kinds of </v>

454
00:20:37.701 --> 00:20:41.481
<v Speaker 2>concerns that they had to concern </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves with was so parochial and </v>

455
00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:45.291
<v Speaker 2>they knew so little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even just back to the Middle </v>

456
00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about having 50 of my.</v>

457
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

458
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Five</v>

459
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 1>of my grandmother's get us back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle Ages.</v>

460
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Five of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

461
00:20:55.090 --> 00:21:00.090
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get us back to before we had before the </v>

462
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Parthenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

463
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are hairless apes who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>just now,</v>

464
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.710
<v Speaker 1>just for right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tap into to have discovered the </v>

465
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Adam amazing technology than the theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is really free.</v>

466
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

467
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I love that was freaking me out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's monkeys.</v>

468
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go back to like,</v>

469
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.800
<v Speaker 1>we're basically fucking like the scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2001 when they're around the </v>

470
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:22.000
<v Speaker 1>monolith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're talking about.</v>

471
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about say how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

472
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 1>how many people do you fit in a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>stadium?</v>

473
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:26.640
<v Speaker 1>One hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50,000,</v>

474
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 and football stage.</v>

475
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:29.530
<v Speaker 1>And like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

476
00:21:29.531 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 1>the place that we did in Australia for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC I believe is 70,000</v>

477
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was an enormous.</v>

478
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Was that the MCG that was at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a hod,</v>

479
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.820
<v Speaker 1>they've started sponsoring everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>since I left.</v>

480
00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:44.540
<v Speaker 1>So I don't even know what that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>now because I don't know,</v>

481
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 1>the big airline back then was in Sydney </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Melbourne.</v>

482
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably be the,</v>

483
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:50.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cricket ground rent formally.</v>

484
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 1>The probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a retractable roof.</v>

485
00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

486
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It was the site of the biggest UFC ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was 70,000</v>

487
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 1>people and that's an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous place.</v>

488
00:21:57.971 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 1>But they have football places like Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a football fan.</v>

489
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.310
<v Speaker 1>What's the biggest spot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

490
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the exact biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio stadium in Columbus for the </v>

491
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 1>buckeyes plays like a 110.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can fit in there and fill out eight</v>

492
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:10.490
<v Speaker 1>officially thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that like when it's filled?</v>

493
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I must be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super loud.</v>

494
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.710
<v Speaker 1>A I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they have the sound going into,</v>

495
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of bounce off each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other being in it.</v>

496
00:22:17.351 --> 00:22:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an insane.</v>

497
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.900
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to be with the colosseum was </v>

498
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:23.900
<v Speaker 1>like ingrown and half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half white,</v>

499
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.601
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's crazy people are drunk as shit </v>

500
00:22:27.601 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Speaker 1>yelling at each other and there's fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over up into huge stadiums that are </v>

501
00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 1>like a hundred hundred and 10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say 100,000</v>

502
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 1>stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

503
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big place,</v>

504
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.690
<v Speaker 1>but if you do use your analogy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>

505
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 10 million years.</v>

506
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were we 10 million years ago?</v>

507
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 1>We were rodents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

508
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.140
<v Speaker 1>when did the dinosaurs die at 75 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

509
00:22:53.141 --> 00:22:58.141
<v Speaker 1>Apparently we were a type of almost like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shrew looking road and that's what we </v>

510
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:00.520
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the current.</v>

511
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what really makes evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>deniers angry,</v>

512
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are just shitty little </v>

513
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.000
<v Speaker 1>rats telling me that I was at Ohio state</v>
<v Speaker 1>football game filled paypal a go.</v>

514
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing is that the science </v>

515
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:24.331
<v Speaker 1>deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolution denies other ones who are </v>

516
00:23:24.331 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 1>more monkey like than the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in science.</v>

517
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:29.461
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an old bill Hicks bit is he </v>

518
00:23:29.461 --> 00:23:29.710
<v Speaker 1>just do think about people being </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninvolved,</v>

519
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 1>the people that don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution or the most looked the most </v>

520
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 1>unevolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

521
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

522
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

523
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.240
<v Speaker 1>it's too hard for us to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

524
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:45.241
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not science deniers and we're </v>

525
00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>looking at the age of your grandma 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and we're just going back a</v>

526
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.530
<v Speaker 3>few grandmas and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

527
00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been amazed by that though because </v>

528
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.090
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although you know,</v>

529
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.701
<v Speaker 2>when else I had this feeling was Richard</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins has this cool analogy where he </v>

530
00:23:58.321 --> 00:24:01.710
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine he's talking about how evolution</v>

531
00:24:01.711 --> 00:24:06.711
<v Speaker 2>denies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep wanting to say climate deniers </v>

532
00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:06.711
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denies we'll.</v>

533
00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.680
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about how there were these </v>
<v Speaker 2>gaps in the fossil record.</v>

534
00:24:07.681 --> 00:24:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how like,</v>

535
00:24:09.061 --> 00:24:14.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to the species that were </v>

536
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:15.681
<v Speaker 2>interim species in between the species </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we find Richard Dawkins tries to </v>

537
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:20.361
<v Speaker 2>make the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole concept of a species is </v>

538
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:23.910
<v Speaker 2>something that we sort of retroactively </v>
<v Speaker 2>superimposed onto things because lots of</v>

539
00:24:23.911 --> 00:24:26.190
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the vast majority of animals die</v>

540
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.060
<v Speaker 2>out and don't manage to succeed in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

541
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.540
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of mutations fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he says,</v>

542
00:24:33.541 --> 00:24:38.541
<v Speaker 2>imagine getting a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine getting a picture book like a </v>

543
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:41.870
<v Speaker 2>high school year book and it's got your </v>
<v Speaker 2>photo in it on the last page and the </v>

544
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.051
<v Speaker 2>page before that is your mother's photo </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the page before that is her mother's </v>

545
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:45.630
<v Speaker 2>photo in the page before that is her </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother's photo.</v>

546
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you go back and back and back and </v>

547
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.521
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way back to the first dawn of </v>

548
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:54.390
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of millions of years ago.</v>

549
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.460
<v Speaker 2>And each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each page is going to be,</v>

550
00:24:59.461 --> 00:25:01.470
<v Speaker 2>is going to basically look like the page</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

551
00:25:01.471 --> 00:25:05.580
<v Speaker 2>It isn't going to be a point at which </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the shrew becomes a monkey.</v>

552
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

553
00:25:06.811 --> 00:25:09.180
<v Speaker 2>some amphibious creature becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrew.</v>

554
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Every child looks like it's parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you flipped through the pages of </v>

555
00:25:14.701 --> 00:25:16.140
<v Speaker 2>this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a thick book.</v>

556
00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:19.200
<v Speaker 2>The overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those little cartoon figures</v>

557
00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:21.270
<v Speaker 2>that you could draw and it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's moving on the page.</v>

558
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.670
<v Speaker 2>You just stopped morphing back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

559
00:25:23.671 --> 00:25:24.210
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

560
00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:26.190
<v Speaker 2>back until eventually you're a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>

561
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

562
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your great,</v>

563
00:25:30.421 --> 00:25:30.840
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

564
00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:32.940
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grandma is just adding enough grades.</v>

565
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what people don't understand.</v>

566
00:25:35.881 --> 00:25:37.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just has to be a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

567
00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:37.980
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

568
00:25:37.981 --> 00:25:39.060
<v Speaker 2>really big book.</v>

569
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our concept of time is just,</v>

570
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 3>it's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look at it this way.</v>

571
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Look at the changes that a person takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the period of their life.</v>

572
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 3>Look at a person from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

573
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 3>think about a child and then turn that </v>
<v Speaker 3>child in your grandma before she died.</v>

574
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a very different physical looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as age sets in.</v>

575
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:57.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

576
00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.730
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of changes that go on</v>

577
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the growth of animals,</v>

578
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 3>death of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of plants and things along those lines.</v>

579
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:12.790
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of growth and death </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all sorts of changing and while </v>

580
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.290
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at it in a static form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd,</v>

581
00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:15.830
<v Speaker 3>if you go outside and look at those </v>
<v Speaker 3>trees,</v>

582
00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:20.831
<v Speaker 3>they look exactly the same as they'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked yesterday and it takes a long </v>

583
00:26:20.831 --> 00:26:20.831
<v Speaker 3>time before you recognize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

584
00:26:20.831 --> 00:26:21.830
<v Speaker 3>this fucking things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing,</v>

585
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.270
<v Speaker 2>feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that myself kind of for the </v>

586
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:27.270
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my birthday yesterday,</v>

587
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.980
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten to that age where,</v>

588
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care about.</v>

589
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I booked this trip,</v>

590
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that it was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>

591
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.910
<v Speaker 2>How old he is today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>38.</v>

592
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.830
<v Speaker 2>That's when you start denying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 48.</v>

593
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.850
<v Speaker 2>So really start denying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denying what getting older and attention</v>

594
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>to has not</v>

595
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.080
<v Speaker 1>even important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I'm concentrating on the present.</v>

596
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I live in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joshua,</v>

597
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 1>he just sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a comforting bullshit as well.</v>

598
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.450
<v Speaker 1>When you get to be like 78,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

599
00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

600
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to not parasail </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're 78.</v>

601
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

602
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the most of it is true </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

603
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:07.200
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 1>age is on the inside because I can feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that now at this age I just have to do a</v>

605
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:15.040
<v Speaker 1>ship more work and not to feel crappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 20,</v>

606
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 1>22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just everything is great.</v>

607
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Your body is just automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning exactly as it should now.</v>

608
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Like my ankle will just occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

609
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't happen when I was 22.</v>

610
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually remember the first time in my</v>

611
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:31.260
<v Speaker 1>life when I was getting out of a car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I got out of the car seat I went.</v>

612
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was that just grunt as I </v>

613
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.800
<v Speaker 1>was getting up and you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>just a very small like just to get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a car seat.</v>

615
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.580
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

616
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>like you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a big deal.</v>

617
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:50.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a young teenager never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never just leaps out of the cost seat </v>

618
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.240
<v Speaker 1>was an old person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gets out of the car seat going.</v>

619
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might notice when I,</v>

620
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 1>for the first time,</v>

621
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:58.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm old,</v>

622
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to exercise into my thirties and I </v>

623
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.671
<v Speaker 3>see other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nature is trying to kill you and in </v>

624
00:28:06.671 --> 00:28:09.980
<v Speaker 3>nature would like you to give in to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same decay that you see in animals and </v>

625
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.200
<v Speaker 3>the forest and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would like you to just accept the </v>

626
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.111
<v Speaker 3>natural process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but us in our clever little minds have </v>

627
00:28:17.111 --> 00:28:20.441
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to mitigate that process</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least slightly with exercise and </v>

628
00:28:20.441 --> 00:28:22.790
<v Speaker 3>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proper rest and supplementation,</v>

629
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:28.150
<v Speaker 3>hormone supplementation and going to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors and new inventions and cryo </v>

630
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.960
<v Speaker 3>therapy and all this crazy shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people figured out how to just put the </v>

631
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.150
<v Speaker 3>brakes on this fucking have it </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitable demise.</v>

632
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I know we're living way too long for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

633
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Nature loves us up until we're in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>late teens,</v>

634
00:28:39.201 --> 00:28:40.430
<v Speaker 1>early twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

635
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:45.350
<v Speaker 1>but by now I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been coming sperm for decades.</v>

636
00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Nature's like you must have had kids by </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

637
00:28:47.301 --> 00:28:49.510
<v Speaker 1>right to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much information.</v>

638
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can figure out that.</v>

639
00:28:51.741 --> 00:28:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I've probably been able to come since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a teenager.</v>

640
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe gone tantric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be one of those dudes to come </v>

641
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.090
<v Speaker 1>inside them and re re,</v>
<v Speaker 1>re vigorous there.</v>

642
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they.</v>

643
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Can you actually consistently orgasm </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a long period of time without </v>

644
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:06.730
<v Speaker 1>coming?</v>

645
00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.800
<v Speaker 3>The problem with all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure I'm going to get tweets </v>

646
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.561
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is everyone who practices it is a </v>

647
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:13.561
<v Speaker 3>fucking lunatic so</v>

648
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:16.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't know because you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually tested it out.</v>

649
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you talk to them,</v>

650
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you,</v>

651
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.020
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely come inside.</v>

652
00:29:21.021 --> 00:29:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I come internally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absorb,</v>

653
00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I reabsorb and the energy that I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>

654
00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:30.341
<v Speaker 1>it's so much more amazing than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy that you would get from an </v>

655
00:29:30.341 --> 00:29:33.340
<v Speaker 1>external orgasm and then they just get </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really into talking to you about </v>

656
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:33.340
<v Speaker 1>tantric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Annoying.</v>

657
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they do it,</v>

658
00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:40.211
<v Speaker 1>but is it by contracting that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the muscle is topped with a paid his </v>

659
00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:43.781
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting between your bowls and </v>

660
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:45.480
<v Speaker 1>yet know there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a particular muscle there which </v>

661
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 1>apparently if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you learn to build it up,</v>

662
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>like be doing exercises throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

663
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.160
<v Speaker 1>then it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will compress and it will push </v>

664
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.160
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

665
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the,</v>

666
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.670
<v Speaker 1>that tube is called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really medically today,</v>

667
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 1>the decor.</v>

668
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a mail key goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

669
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that Russian lady </v>

670
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.991
<v Speaker 1>that can pick up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she can carry like 32 kilograms </v>

671
00:30:06.991 --> 00:30:07.370
<v Speaker 1>for the pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be more than that.</v>

672
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 1>More than 70 pounds I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't checked.</v>

673
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has this ability to like,</v>

674
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I guess they put like a ball and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>attach a string to a ball at the end of </v>

675
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.161
<v Speaker 1>the string is a weight and she puts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball inside of her pussy and just locks </v>

676
00:30:23.161 --> 00:30:28.140
<v Speaker 1>down on that motherfucker and then can </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally lift up like 70 pounds of </v>

677
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.140
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impressive.</v>

678
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

679
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I've stood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've stood at one end of a strip club </v>

680
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and had a in Bangkok,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a tie stripper five dots from the </v>

681
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:44.371
<v Speaker 1>other side of the room out of her pussy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pop a balloon that I was holding it </v>

682
00:30:44.371 --> 00:30:44.371
<v Speaker 1>in my head.</v>

683
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was,</v>

684
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 1>she could find those things with such </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim.</v>

685
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I was so stupid because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have gotten taken an eye out,</v>

686
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of speed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speed,</v>

687
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.300
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like uh,</v>

688
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:00.270
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She must have been a good 10 meters,</v>

689
00:31:00.271 --> 00:31:02.400
<v Speaker 1>so maybe 30 feet away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

690
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.440
<v Speaker 1>She's firing him across the room fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to be able to pop a balloon with </v>

691
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:07.440
<v Speaker 1>accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with accuracy.</v>

692
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.530
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now how is she doing this?</v>

693
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And she have like her elbows to the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her knees and she's got her like her </v>

694
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:13.630
<v Speaker 1>pussy up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

695
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:18.631
<v Speaker 1>she was standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to picture exactly what </v>

696
00:31:18.631 --> 00:31:18.631
<v Speaker 1>position she was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GSG was sort of kneel,</v>

697
00:31:18.631 --> 00:31:20.200
<v Speaker 1>kneeling and standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kneeling.</v>

698
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

699
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:21.350
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

700
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.110
<v Speaker 1>not kneeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bent.</v>

701
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:28.111
<v Speaker 1>Knees bent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standing Upright and with the thrust of </v>

702
00:31:28.111 --> 00:31:28.840
<v Speaker 1>the hips for shooting out what?</v>

703
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Bent knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standing up or facing you?</v>

704
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Facing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

705
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.700
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even seem like that's like </v>

706
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:38.800
<v Speaker 1>shooting a gun in the air when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing at the ground.</v>

707
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did she do that?</v>

708
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 1>She might've had a hands on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be honest,</v>

709
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:50.431
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't focused on her fucking </v>

710
00:31:50.431 --> 00:31:51.751
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was focused on whether or not she was </v>

711
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:51.751
<v Speaker 1>going to take my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my eyes closed most of the time.</v>

712
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she had her hands on the ground now </v>

713
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.551
<v Speaker 1>it makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's like a table table sitting </v>

714
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:56.551
<v Speaker 1>upright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

715
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 1>How's she getting the air to launch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

716
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what's confusing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so many things that she was doing</v>

717
00:32:02.981 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all kinds of tricks.</v>

718
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.480
<v Speaker 1>They will concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were pink.</v>

719
00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It started out with ping pong balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 1>all the classic things.</v>

721
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Also razorblades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

722
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing what people will do if </v>

723
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.731
<v Speaker 1>you're confronted with a town filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with drunk tourists who have already </v>

724
00:32:20.731 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 1>seen everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've seen more.</v>

725
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Thai kickboxing fights were 16 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid's a fucking Shinde each other in the</v>

726
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:31.501
<v Speaker 1>head until they go unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've seen legalized prostitution </v>

727
00:32:31.501 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladyboys everywhere.</v>

728
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:37.771
<v Speaker 1>Everything is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking scooters with 37 people </v>

729
00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:38.930
<v Speaker 1>piled on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do they got to do?</v>

730
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Do they have to adapt to its evolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adapt or die.</v>

731
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to adapt.</v>

732
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

733
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 1>how to stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

734
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:51.050
<v Speaker 1>you got to shoot a dart out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy,</v>

735
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:52.550
<v Speaker 1>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just tips his head.</v>

736
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

737
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

738
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you want to make the argument that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are malleable.</v>

739
00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.260
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the best arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like put that.</v>

740
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

741
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.340
<v Speaker 2>not to mention like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been to shows there where </v>

742
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the finale to one show where </v>

743
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.981
<v Speaker 2>it was like they were about how many do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to Thailand?</v>

744
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Thailand is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to say that Thailand is sort of </v>

745
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:17.890
<v Speaker 2>our Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're Australian,</v>

746
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.520
<v Speaker 2>it's nearby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cheap.</v>

747
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:20.610
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

748
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 2>they were great beaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far is the flight?</v>

749
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything's sort of far from for</v>
<v Speaker 2>most Australians because Sydney and </v>

750
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Melbourne are located on the southeast </v>
<v Speaker 2>coast of Australia,</v>

751
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:31.840
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of Australia to fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

752
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Australia is the same size as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contiguous United States.</v>

753
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 2>So you basically have to do the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight from like the equivalent of Miami</v>

754
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.940
<v Speaker 2>to Seattle before you start entering </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asiana air space.</v>

755
00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:43.730
<v Speaker 2>But from so from Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country itself,</v>

756
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.580
<v Speaker 2>it would probably only be two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours to Bangkok.</v>

757
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.260
<v Speaker 2>It's only like an hour or two to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia and Singapore from Sydney.</v>

758
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:56.261
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got to add on an extra six </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours just to get out of Australian </v>

759
00:33:56.261 --> 00:33:58.931
<v Speaker 2>airspace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing that you guys are the </v>

760
00:33:58.931 --> 00:34:01.031
<v Speaker 2>same size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Australia's the same size as </v>

761
00:34:01.031 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 2>America as far as the continental or </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to it.</v>

762
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.850
<v Speaker 2>But there's only 20 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's less people than California.</v>

763
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:05.780
<v Speaker 2>We have half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

764
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean two thirds of the population of </v>

765
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:10.800
<v Speaker 2>California in an area the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

766
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.770
<v Speaker 2>If you get rid of Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bad ass country.</v>

767
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just there.</v>

768
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I know you were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

769
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 2>that whole upset.</v>

770
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I had a great fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did stand up there to the Palais </v>

771
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.100
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking gradable.</v>

772
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I love it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Down there.</v>

773
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Wherever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on which way you go.</v>

774
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go north you can get there.</v>

775
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.940
<v Speaker 1>You'll get there eventually the gloves </v>
<v Speaker 1>round chair spinning.</v>

776
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:33.100
<v Speaker 1>The fucker doesn't stand still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

777
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Australia.</v>

778
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really is.</v>

779
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.370
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cool as fuck.</v>

780
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

781
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Policies are nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

782
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my number one go to spot.</v>

783
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 1>If the apocalypse happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if north the North America falls apart,</v>

784
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Australia is pretty much self </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting.</v>

785
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a democratic really cool.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hit with like one or two tentacles.</v>

804
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:33.590
<v Speaker 1>But you're fucked man,</v>

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 1>they're only there during certain times </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the year.</v>

809
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 1>So you were there in summer and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

810
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 1>They're not in Sydney or Melbourne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so didn't have to worry about them.</v>

811
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:47.630
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Barrier Reef or something?</v>

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking to people.</v>

815
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go in the fucking water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not retarded.</v>

816
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Speaker 1>You can go into the water and melons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They move around the water.</v>

817
00:35:57.691 --> 00:35:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

818
00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 1>it's all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could just travel to,</v>

819
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:06.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like saying that you're going to </v>

820
00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:06.531
<v Speaker 1>get eaten by a great white shark and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>

821
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Alaska don't go in the water and Alaska </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's connected to where the great </v>

822
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.750
<v Speaker 1>white sharks live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just never.</v>

823
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water.</v>

824
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:17.301
<v Speaker 1>It's the same water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about gigantic distances </v>

825
00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:17.301
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as we know,</v>

826
00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 1>they don't go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could.</v>

827
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

829
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.880
<v Speaker 1>If you knew that the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woods were filled with werewolves,</v>

830
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.730
<v Speaker 1>but only in a certain time of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you go during the full moon?</v>

832
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.020

<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is basically like you</v>

833
00:36:34.021 --> 00:36:37.680
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't go hiking in Panama because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are bears in Canada.</v>

834

844
00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:59.180
<v Speaker 1>which I can't remember whether it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same as the box jellyfish or not.</v>

846
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>and it was a case where these scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Great Barrier Reef that was </v>

847
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.210
<v Speaker 1>studying the ecology and they're almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>invisible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Every tiny small little jellyfish with </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely long tentacles.</v>

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>jellyfish if they're not the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the box jellyfish.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Steve Irwin,</v>

874
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:21.531
<v Speaker 1>the crocodile hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of Australia as big as if we're </v>

<v Speaker 1>in the outback.</v>

877
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Duality is almost half the country lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in to big cities and we were all sitting</v>

878
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:30.810
<v Speaker 1>around swilling shodan and drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>lattes,</v>

879
00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:35.811
<v Speaker 1>complaining about property prices and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on yachts and going to the </v>

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:45.570
<v Speaker 1>has much more regional variance in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no equivalent of the south </v>

884
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.110
<v Speaker 1>in Australia,</v>

907
00:39:39.991 --> 00:39:42.361
<v Speaker 1>snake bite or a spider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think since all of the </v>

908
00:39:42.361 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 1>antivenoms were discovered in the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties because every,</v>

909
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.690
<v Speaker 1>every local medical center has the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>antivenoms.</v>

910
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.500

913
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Australians are trained in knowing how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to basically,</v>

914

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously put a [inaudible] on so that </v>

915
00:39:59.060 --> 00:39:59.590
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you suck out the venom and spit it</v>

916
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 1>out and identify what the snake was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It'll take a few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll fuck you up.</v>

920
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:13.921
<v Speaker 1>I've had my dogs bitten three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had to have them go and get </v>

921
00:40:13.921 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 1>antivenom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for people if you're broke,</v>

922
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked because you don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

923
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It costs thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This antivenom stuff and you know,</v>

924
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:23.710
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're going to watch your dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>die because they swell up.</v>

925
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Like the only way I found out they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit because I knew that they were </v>

926
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:29.230
<v Speaker 1>barking and barking and barking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went outside and said,</v>

927
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:30.640
<v Speaker 1>ah fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a rattle snake.</v>

928
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And so I killed a rattlesnake and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

929
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.760
<v Speaker 1>they seem okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then all sudden I see some swelling </v>

930
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:38.760
<v Speaker 1>on their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

931
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.470
<v Speaker 1>God it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that I have to take him down </v>

932
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.371
<v Speaker 1>because they'll rattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snake will bite them and then pull away </v>

933
00:40:44.371 --> 00:40:44.371
<v Speaker 1>and still be alive and invite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite them again.</v>

934
00:40:44.371 --> 00:40:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And so their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their face just swole up like cartoon </v>

935
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and just like water balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're finding a day or so.</v>

936
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

937
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

938
00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean if a person gets bitten in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

939
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.330
<v Speaker 1>obviously they don't have to pay because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have communism.</v>

940
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good communism,</v>

941
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you know that I get really pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about healthcare and </v>

942
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:08.430
<v Speaker 1>healthcare in America and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that somehow or another it's </v>

943
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:11.521
<v Speaker 1>better to not have people covered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical insurance and then there's </v>

944
00:41:11.521 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 1>always been medicaid and there's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

945
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 1>for extreme example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have had medical issues that have</v>

946
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:19.420
<v Speaker 1>put them in severe debt and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

947
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that we shouldn't have </v>

948
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.570
<v Speaker 1>private private care in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best doctors and the best surgeons </v>

949
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.880
<v Speaker 1>should be allowed to be compensated for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their excellence.</v>

950
00:41:29.881 --> 00:41:34.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

951
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:35.881
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that we don't have some </v>

952
00:41:35.881 --> 00:41:35.881
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

953
00:41:35.881 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>we have roads that are taken care of by </v>
<v Speaker 1>our taxes.</v>

954
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:41.981
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck do we not have medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance or or medical care?</v>

955
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.500
<v Speaker 1>That's just standard and this is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to talk about on my </v>

956
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

957
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag we the people live which is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to do immediately </v>

958
00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.081
<v Speaker 1>after this because I want to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Bernie Sanders and I want to talk </v>

959
00:41:56.081 --> 00:41:58.210
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're talking about right now </v>

960
00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:58.210
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do it,</v>

961
00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:58.210
<v Speaker 1>but we do it later now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

962
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Freaking people out there like what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck I got to download something else,</v>

963
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that a country that cares </v>

964
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.821
<v Speaker 1>about its people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important things is the </v>

965
00:42:09.821 --> 00:42:09.821
<v Speaker 1>safety and the health of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

966
00:42:09.821 --> 00:42:11.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we shouldn't have.</v>

967
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have to pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>

968
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:16.940
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have to pay for the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be something that comes out</v>

969
00:42:16.941 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 1>of your check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

970
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

971
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you want to call the police?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

972
00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:21.900
<v Speaker 1>we're going to require a credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

973
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.210
<v Speaker 1>no guys breaking into my house.</v>

974
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>do you have a current credit card?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

976
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

977
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:27.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

978
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 1>We need the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

979
00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I hear people like rush limbaugh saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we buy everyone a car?</v>

980
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a fat fuck.</v>

981
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember fucking pill popping </v>

982
00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.541
<v Speaker 1>asshole Al Franken was on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on lead them and promoting his book </v>

983
00:42:43.541 --> 00:42:43.541
<v Speaker 1>about a rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold.</v>

984
00:42:43.541 --> 00:42:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember he wouldn't be able to write </v>

985
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:47.860
<v Speaker 1>that book today because he'd be fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

986
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.050
<v Speaker 1>That's probably true actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let him in.</v>

987
00:42:50.051 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 1>His first question is uh oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting title.</v>

988
00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:54.540
<v Speaker 1>How'd you come up with that title at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all?</v>

989
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Goes well for a start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

990
00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.610
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fat.</v>

991
00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I love Al didn't even lose a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight though.</v>

992
00:43:03.051 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 1>When he got on Oxycontin's it's taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 99 pills a day.</v>

993
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:09.560
<v Speaker 1>That fills up a lot of whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

994
00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about how many 99.</v>

995
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good handful of mass.</v>

996
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Was He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what he's done?</v>

997
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:16.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

998
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly standard for like severe </v>

999
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.361
<v Speaker 1>junkies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's they just start building up </v>

1000
00:43:25.361 --> 00:43:28.870
<v Speaker 1>two and three to 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why you then you then graduate </v>

1001
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 1>to smack and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got the heroin epidemic that we do</v>

1002
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 1>in places like too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to shoot it.</v>

1003
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really easy to swallow those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>

1004
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:35.640
<v Speaker 1>You can snort it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can smoke,</v>

1005
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 1>but you're also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting this inexact amount.</v>

1006
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.030
<v Speaker 1>When you just take a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have one pill,</v>

1007
00:43:41.031 --> 00:43:42.830
<v Speaker 1>you throw it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fats do 99.</v>

1008
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a WHO's taken a lot.</v>

1009
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Pull that up Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out exactly how many he was taking.</v>

1010
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 1>He was taking so much that and granted </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was told to me by Alex Jones,</v>

1011
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:56.950
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know exactly if I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticate the brasses particular </v>

1012
00:43:57.081 --> 00:44:02.081
<v Speaker 1>states like that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said that that was why he went </v>

1013
00:44:02.081 --> 00:44:02.870
<v Speaker 1>deaf because do you remember rush </v>
<v Speaker 1>limbaugh was going deaf,</v>

1014
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:08.170
<v Speaker 1>but he had like a real medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation for when you overdose on </v>

1015
00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:12.880
<v Speaker 1>opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you take massive amounts of </v>

1016
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.921
<v Speaker 1>opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it affects your central nervous system </v>

1017
00:44:14.921 --> 00:44:16.290
<v Speaker 1>in such a profound way and it affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

1018
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>like your entire physical body in such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound way that it's possible.</v>

1019
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:26.350
<v Speaker 1>You could induce hearing loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have sympathy for the guy just </v>

1020
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:30.191
<v Speaker 1>because he's caught up in what is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem beyond any individual's sort of </v>

1021
00:44:30.191 --> 00:44:30.191
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1022
00:44:30.191 --> 00:44:34.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem of over prescription of </v>

1023
00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:34.850
<v Speaker 1>opiates in America and like drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

1024
00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

1025
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.120
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't overprescribed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was actively seeking out these </v>

1026
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.340
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in Florida,</v>

1027
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

1028
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an addiction.</v>

1029
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It is an addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also a massive hypocrite.</v>

1030
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That was totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally bad.</v>

1031
00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 1>People really disagree with almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything he says.</v>

1032
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I have a grudging admiration for him as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an entertainer and a broadcast because </v>

1033
00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 1>they think he's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1034
00:44:57.511 --> 00:44:59.530
<v Speaker 1>he speaks very confidently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1035
00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:04.531
<v Speaker 1>he's so good at like saying at getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>you into a position in which his </v>

1036
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:09.561
<v Speaker 1>bullshit sounds reasonable and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing a kind of a line of logical </v>

1037
00:45:10.081 --> 00:45:12.570
<v Speaker 1>fallacies in such a way that you end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

1038
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's making a lot of sense.</v>

1039
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is that he was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>hamstrung and broken down when he called</v>

1040
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:25.131
<v Speaker 1>that a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slut who was trying to get birth </v>

1041
00:45:25.131 --> 00:45:26.030
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she was trying to get a.</v>

1042
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.850
<v Speaker 1>She wanted birth control to be covered </v>
<v Speaker 1>by her university.</v>

1043
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's some sort of insurance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 1>he started calling her a slut and St </v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis terrible things about it,</v>

1045
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but I believe she needed birth control </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of another medical ailment.</v>

1046
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.580
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that,</v>

1047
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but it might weigh the weigh what his </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument was and it's a perfect example </v>

1048
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:47.310
<v Speaker 1>of what I'm talking about where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts with something simple.</v>

1049
00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.130
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

1050
00:45:49.131 --> 00:45:54.131
<v Speaker 1>A woman who wants to be paid for sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good.</v>

1051
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.200
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get rid of the Australian </v>
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>

1052
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I do rush this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do.</v>

1053
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I wouldn't claim to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trough so,</v>

1054
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but like he ended up getting two slot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because his logical argument was right.</v>

1055
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.540
<v Speaker 1>She wants to be paid for something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is only needed.</v>

1056
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:17.541
<v Speaker 1>If she wants to have recreational sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what do you call someone who we </v>

1057
00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:18.540
<v Speaker 1>paid to have recreational sex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A prostitute.</v>

1058
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find that out if you get a chance.</v>

1059
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:25.110
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe that she needed it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>another reason.</v>

1060
00:46:25.111 --> 00:46:27.120
<v Speaker 1>There's other reasons why women take </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>

1061
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.380
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1062
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like women with severe acne take birth </v>

1063
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:33.400
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1064
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:37.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other things at birth </v>

1065
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.461
<v Speaker 1>control can help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way he's a fat fuck of a </v>

1066
00:46:40.461 --> 00:46:43.161
<v Speaker 1>dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is not that there's anything wrong </v>

1067
00:46:43.161 --> 00:46:43.161
<v Speaker 1>with being a fat fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my best friends are fat.</v>

1068
00:46:43.161 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with being overweight.</v>

1069
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1070
00:46:45.571 --> 00:46:47.820
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy,</v>

1071
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fix that.</v>

1072
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could fix that.</v>

1073
00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Just as easy as it is to get off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin is easy.</v>

1074
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It is for rush limbaugh to get off </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin,</v>

1075
00:46:55.791 --> 00:47:00.791
<v Speaker 1>he'd get off sugar and simple fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbs and all that stupid shit that </v>

1076
00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:05.451
<v Speaker 1>makes you balloon up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just walk on a treadmill for 30 </v>

1077
00:47:05.451 --> 00:47:05.451
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tara morning,</v>

1078
00:47:05.451 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Tara hard for people to change their </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

1079
00:47:07.621 --> 00:47:12.621
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for people to get excited </v>
<v Speaker 1>about doing something that's difficult </v>

1080
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:12.621
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be ultimately beneficial</v>

1081
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:15.450
<v Speaker 1>for them because it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drains your energy in the short term.</v>

1082
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work out if you're out of shape,</v>

1083
00:47:17.491 --> 00:47:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen an attache person workout?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

1085
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I've taken people to the gym that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out like come on,</v>

1086
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.520
<v Speaker 1>come to the gym with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just do a little bit of a workout </v>

1087
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 1>and you get them on the elliptical </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine and just go,</v>

1088
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do 20 minutes</v>

1089
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 3>and the elliptical machine and you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>over five minutes in there,</v>

1090
00:47:33.191 --> 00:47:38.191
<v Speaker 3>ready to fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there they turned white like </v>

1091
00:47:38.191 --> 00:47:39.640
<v Speaker 3>their face turns flush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1092
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:42.580
<v Speaker 3>It's weird to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watch them struggle and then you get</v>

1093
00:47:42.581 --> 00:47:44.920
<v Speaker 3>them to the weights and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't do anything.</v>

1094
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 3>They're so tired.</v>

1095
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the study that came out </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently about the huge increase in the,</v>

1096
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.260
<v Speaker 2>in the death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1097
00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:56.970
<v Speaker 2>The fatality rate of white people </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the age of 35 and 50,</v>

1098
00:47:56.971 --> 00:47:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1099
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.320
<v Speaker 2>So there's a spike which epidemiologists</v>
<v Speaker 2>are saying is as noticeable in the data </v>

1100
00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.860
<v Speaker 2>as the aids epidemic was in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties and there were three causes.</v>

1101
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Lattes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1102
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to be diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when we're talking about this,</v>

1103
00:48:11.851 --> 00:48:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to be hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1104
00:48:13.171 --> 00:48:15.180
<v Speaker 2>So something that's related to diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>

1105
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.040
<v Speaker 2>it's suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's booze and its drug overdoses.</v>

1106
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the only demographic group </v>

1107
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.290
<v Speaker 2>in America where the numbers are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1108
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Well I think there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that live a very</v>

1109
00:48:29.311 --> 00:48:34.311
<v Speaker 3>unsatisfying life and they got roped </v>
<v Speaker 3>into living this unsatisfying life </v>

1110
00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:35.340
<v Speaker 3>because someone told them that they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a living,</v>

1111
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:40.590
<v Speaker 3>that they have to make tough choices and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to go do things that they </v>

1112
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:40.590
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1113
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:45.440
<v Speaker 3>find a good job with a fucking plumbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>supply company or some stupid shit they </v>

1114
00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.820
<v Speaker 3>don't really want to do when they really</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be a musician or whatever.</v>

1115
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.050
<v Speaker 3>And then they just lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressed and there's.</v>

1116
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a giant percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1117
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's getting worse.</v>

1118
00:48:53.611 --> 00:48:56.580
<v Speaker 2>I was talking yesterday on facebook to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy of mine in Australia,</v>

1119
00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.200

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:49:21.081 --> 00:49:24.861
<v Speaker 2>feelings as a white man that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything other than guilt about being a </v>

1130
00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 2>white man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like we're so distracted by so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>little semi little cultural pieces of </v>

1151
00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:16.970
<v Speaker 2>bullshit at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're losing sight of the big picture.</v>

1152
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because it's too easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get by these people that are looking.</v>

1153
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.380
<v Speaker 3>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1154
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy to live today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much easier than it has been in an </v>

1155
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:31.380
<v Speaker 3>important time and I think also it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very easy to communicate today much more</v>

1156
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.060
<v Speaker 3>easy than it has been at any other point</v>
<v Speaker 3>in time and before.</v>

1157
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 3>Before this era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the era of instant communication,</v>

1158
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.960
<v Speaker 3>if you had an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had to be really good to get it out </v>

1159
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 3>there to the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to be really good.</v>

1160
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 3>It had to go through editors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicists that had to go to publishers.</v>

1161
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:51.020
<v Speaker 3>They had to print it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People had to read it and recommend it.</v>

1162
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.750
<v Speaker 3>It had to be verified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to be excellent.</v>

1163
00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were a hunter,</v>

1164
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:57.500
<v Speaker 3>s Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was a lot of jumps.</v>

1165
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.560
<v Speaker 3>You had to go through lots of hoops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ladders he had to climb before </v>

1166
00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 3>you can publish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1167
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:07.811
<v Speaker 3>a fear and loathing in Las Vegas today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any fucking dipshit can start a hashtag </v>

1168
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.940
<v Speaker 3>activist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1169
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:16.750
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could start a tumbler blog or </v>

1170
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:20.051
<v Speaker 3>anything and that it can immediately be </v>
<v Speaker 3>picked up by also by people that also </v>

1171
00:51:20.051 --> 00:51:23.741
<v Speaker 3>want to be outraged and they'll go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this goddamn rampage and it's confusing </v>

1172
00:51:23.741 --> 00:51:25.820
<v Speaker 3>as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because it's so easy to get by.</v>

1173
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:26.550
<v Speaker 3>It's we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

1174
00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 3>we were like spoiled rich kids in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spoiled,</v>

1175
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:35.350
<v Speaker 3>spoiled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich kids with our ability to </v>

1176
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:35.350
<v Speaker 3>communicate ideas.</v>

1177
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the lowering of the barriers is </v>

1178
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.950
<v Speaker 2>a good thing and a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1179
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flattening and the fact that I don't</v>

1180
00:51:38.321 --> 00:51:43.321
<v Speaker 2>have to go and talk to a network </v>
<v Speaker 2>executive or radio station owner about </v>

1181
00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:44.410
<v Speaker 2>doing my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just do the show that I want to do</v>

1182
00:51:44.411 --> 00:51:49.411
<v Speaker 2>and put it out there is great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right that like we've become </v>

1183
00:51:49.411 --> 00:51:53.160
<v Speaker 2>the Douglas Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this British conservative </v>

1184
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.090
<v Speaker 2>columnist was saying he thinks that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is that there's a lack of.</v>

1185
00:51:55.150 --> 00:52:00.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a supply and demand problem </v>

1186
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.220
<v Speaker 2>between social justice warriors and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>racists because there aren't enough </v>

1187
00:52:03.011 --> 00:52:04.660
<v Speaker 2>racist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1188
00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:09.840
<v Speaker 2>So like the left used to be agitated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting all of these big good noble </v>

1189
00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.350
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the like the fascists and the rice,</v>

1190
00:52:11.351 --> 00:52:16.351
<v Speaker 2>it's an older people who they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring down have basically been </v>

1191
00:52:16.351 --> 00:52:16.351
<v Speaker 2>vanquished.</v>

1192
00:52:16.351 --> 00:52:17.830
<v Speaker 2>So now they're not totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now they have to talk.</v>

1193
00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to accuse people like me of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being racist.</v>

1194
00:52:19.901 --> 00:52:24.901
<v Speaker 2>I was accused of being racist the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day because I used the phrase to call a </v>

1195
00:52:24.901 --> 00:52:25.180
<v Speaker 2>spade a spade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1196
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:29.110
<v Speaker 2>And in the 1920 you got called a racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that yet in Harlem,</v>

1197
00:52:29.111 --> 00:52:31.930
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 twenties a spade was a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>word for black people,</v>

1198
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.690
<v Speaker 2>not just the 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like pretty recently.</v>

1199
00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Was it because not in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in Australian language.</v>

1200
00:52:36.941 --> 00:52:40.540
<v Speaker 2>So even in like the seventies and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

1201
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:43.540
<v Speaker 2>people would use it a disparaging the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spades.</v>

1202
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd never heard it,</v>

1203
00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:50.041
<v Speaker 2>but apparently on racist now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because there aren't enough actual </v>

1204
00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.550
<v Speaker 2>racists to keep shouting it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have to stop shouting it.</v>

1205
00:52:51.551 --> 00:52:53.950
<v Speaker 2>But it's a spade a spade is a card term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1206
00:52:53.951 --> 00:52:54.370
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1207
00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:57.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a term about playing cards to call </v>
<v Speaker 3>a spade a spade.</v>

1208
00:52:57.601 --> 00:53:02.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like a club or a spade or a heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that is so fucking stupid.</v>

1209
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also I posted something on facebook </v>

1210
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:08.120
<v Speaker 2>about did you see the Brouhaha about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Meryl Streep's tee shirt,</v>

1211
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she's just finished shooting a movie </v>

1212
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 2>in London called suffragette way in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which she plays Emily Pankhurst,</v>

1213
00:53:14.781 --> 00:53:17.280
<v Speaker 2>who was one of the great women's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1214
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:22.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigners back in the late 18 </v>

1215
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:22.820
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds.</v>

1216
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.920
<v Speaker 2>It's about the birth of the feminism </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

1217
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:30.160
<v Speaker 2>And in 1913 pancoast gave this speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his famous speech for,</v>

1218
00:53:30.161 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 2>for women's rights in which he said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women's rights movement will survive</v>

1219
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.830
<v Speaker 2>so long as there is a woman alive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold up the flag of rebellion.</v>

1220
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I would rather be a rebel and a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they do this promotional thing in </v>

1221
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:45.480
<v Speaker 2>which his meryl streep a wearing a tee </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt.</v>

1222
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be a rebel in a slave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning I'd rather fight for my rights </v>

1223
00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.500
<v Speaker 2>then be downtrodden as a woman in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early part of the 20th century.</v>

1224
00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet blew up with how racist </v>

1225
00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Merrill is because she's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the context of that.</v>

1226
00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:03.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1227
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:06.330
<v Speaker 2>and then so I put a suit or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here are some of the tweets.</v>

1228
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>

1229
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:13.911
<v Speaker 2>Someone said with a link to it that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word rebel is juxtaposed with slave in </v>

1230
00:54:13.911 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 2>that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1231
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:19.220
<v Speaker 2>I can't fathom this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone else says then someone else </v>

1232
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:19.220
<v Speaker 2>tries to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm says,</v>

1233
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.790
<v Speaker 2>the quote is from Emily Pankhurst who </v>
<v Speaker 2>said it in 1913,</v>

1234
00:54:20.791 --> 00:54:25.791
<v Speaker 2>Rally for women's rights to which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors respond and I'm </v>

1235
00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:26.460
<v Speaker 2>letting you know that it doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>who said it,</v>

1236
00:54:26.461 --> 00:54:31.461
<v Speaker 2>the quote is trash and another person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white women have said a lot of terrible </v>

1237
00:54:31.461 --> 00:54:34.761
<v Speaker 2>things over the course of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you wear it on a shirt </v>

1238
00:54:34.761 --> 00:54:34.761
<v Speaker 2>and it just goes on and on.</v>

1239
00:54:34.761 --> 00:54:39.560
<v Speaker 2>And I put it on facebook and just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that we're focusing on what's </v>

1240
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 2>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like a black friend of mine said,</v>

1241
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:46.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just started attacking me for being an </v>

1242
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.150
<v Speaker 2>apologist for racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black friend of yours,</v>

1243
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 2>who would black friend is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1244
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to name him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to name them,</v>

1245
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:53.340
<v Speaker 2>but fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows you're not racist.</v>

1246
00:54:53.341 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is damn it.</v>

1247
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.110
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there's not enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1248
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what I made about supply </v>
<v Speaker 2>and demand thing,</v>

1249
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:05.571
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough actual problems for </v>

1250
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:05.571
<v Speaker 2>them to focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1251
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:05.571
<v Speaker 2>so no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I said,</v>

1252
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:09.740
<v Speaker 2>what I wrote on facebook was political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness is exhausting and he wrote </v>

1253
00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:10.990
<v Speaker 2>being black as exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1254
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.680
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.520
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1256
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately that tee shirt has nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with being black.</v>

1257
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 2>And then he went off onto this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how like everything,</v>

1258
00:55:22.681 --> 00:55:27.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you have to understand how </v>

1259
00:55:27.681 --> 00:55:29.271
<v Speaker 2>other people are gonna perceive things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will have to be cognizant of </v>

1260
00:55:29.271 --> 00:55:32.091
<v Speaker 2>always using the right words and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ends up spiraling down into this </v>

1261
00:55:32.091 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 2>situation where all of a sudden I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be censoring every single word that I</v>

1262
00:55:35.281 --> 00:55:40.281
<v Speaker 2>say in case some idiot misinterprets it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't understand the historical </v>

1263
00:55:40.281 --> 00:55:40.770
<v Speaker 2>context that we're talking about.</v>

1264
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:45.770
<v Speaker 2>The women's movement in like early 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century Britain and not the fight </v>

1265
00:55:45.901 --> 00:55:48.100
<v Speaker 2>against slavery in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like buy it,</v>

1266
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:53.190
<v Speaker 2>don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people really offended by </v>

1267
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a green light issue.</v>

1268
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:56.511
<v Speaker 2>I think it's agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at Meryl Streep and that t </v>

1269
00:55:56.511 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 2>shirt and if they understand the context</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what she's trying to say,</v>

1270
00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.820
<v Speaker 2>like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you quote the original piece that it </v>

1271
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:05.121
<v Speaker 2>was taken from [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still have a problem with that </v>

1272
00:56:05.121 --> 00:56:06.950
<v Speaker 2>they're doing is just finding a </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenlight green light.</v>

1273
00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go hit the gas.</v>

1274
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1275
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

1276
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.880
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she's.</v>

1277
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:17.910
<v Speaker 2>She's posting something or she has a a t</v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt on rather that's taken from a </v>

1278
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:20.280
<v Speaker 2>historical quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really simple.</v>

1279
00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>If you have an issue with those words </v>
<v Speaker 2>because those words can be used in other</v>

1280
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 3>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's your issue.</v>

1281
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:31.110
<v Speaker 3>It's your turn to make a big deal of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you have to be more aware and </v>

1282
00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 3>you have to be because being black is </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausting or being Chinese.</v>

1283
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:37.561
<v Speaker 3>We built the railroads for you to ride </v>
<v Speaker 3>that railroad and not acknowledged the </v>

1284
00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:40.411
<v Speaker 3>fact that Chinese people died during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>making of that real fucking Christ </v>

1285
00:56:40.411 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 3>enough that what we need is wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need wolves at the gates.</v>

1286
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.140
<v Speaker 3>What we need is a fucking winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need winter's coming.</v>

1287
00:56:47.141 --> 00:56:50.100
<v Speaker 3>We need to fucking black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've,</v>

1288
00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 3>we've just had Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Paris attacks.</v>

1289
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Let's focus or in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's like that,</v>

1290
00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:01.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11 and after September 11th </v>

1291
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:05.101
<v Speaker 3>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York was fucking amazing and I hate </v>

1292
00:57:05.101 --> 00:57:08.551
<v Speaker 3>to say this and it turns like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not minimizing the victims or the </v>

1293
00:57:08.551 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 3>families of the victims and horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy without a doubt.</v>

1294
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.190
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's denying that,</v>

1295
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.490
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is we were in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York City,</v>

1296
00:57:15.491 --> 00:57:20.491
<v Speaker 3>me and some friends when we were filming</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear factor and it was about 10 months </v>

1297
00:57:20.621 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 3>or 11 months after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My memory might be bad,</v>

1298
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.990
<v Speaker 3>but the point being people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticeably more friendly,</v>

1299
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 3>noticeably more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more like they were engaging.</v>

1300
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 3>They would say hi to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The firemen came.</v>

1301
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:38.980
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who blacked out because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave her some California weed.</v>

1302
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.190
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1303
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:45.530
<v Speaker 3>were hanging out in front of this bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all these people that work for </v>

1304
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.530
<v Speaker 3>fear factor and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1305
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.080
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I busted out Joanna go,</v>

1306
00:57:47.081 --> 00:57:48.880
<v Speaker 3>you guys want to get down or why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to do?</v>

1307
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Come on pussies and these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these producers,</v>

1308
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:51.670
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1309
00:57:51.671 --> 00:57:52.180
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll try.</v>

1310
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:53.980
<v Speaker 3>We'll try some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fucking space.</v>

1311
00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.740
<v Speaker 3>We'd just the deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blackest whole space we'd,</v>

1312
00:57:56.741 --> 00:58:01.741
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She takes a deep pit and you see her </v>

1313
00:58:01.741 --> 00:58:01.810
<v Speaker 3>eyes start to flutter and roll behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>her head.</v>

1314
00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:07.050
<v Speaker 3>And Luckily I was in a position to catch</v>
<v Speaker 3>her and I moved in and we grabbed her as</v>

1315
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:12.901
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was literally just blacking out on </v>

1316
00:58:12.901 --> 00:58:12.901
<v Speaker 3>the concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some serious shit,</v>

1317
00:58:12.901 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 3>serious weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's apparently it can happen to </v>

1318
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:18.310
<v Speaker 3>certain people if you don't smoke a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of weed.</v>

1319
00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:19.300
<v Speaker 3>And she just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>

1320
00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 3>let's give it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just took a big hit and you see her eyes</v>

1321
00:58:22.811 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 3>fluttering and she just gave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we called the fireman.</v>

1322
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:30.600
<v Speaker 3>The fireman came and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a nobleman on a knight on a horse </v>

1323
00:58:31.151 --> 00:58:36.151
<v Speaker 3>had arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was so happy to see the </v>

1324
00:58:36.151 --> 00:58:36.190
<v Speaker 3>firemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First responders got so much love.</v>

1325
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:41.370
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't hundreds of colleagues had </v>

1326
00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:41.370
<v Speaker 3>just died.</v>

1327
00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:43.600
<v Speaker 3>It was also the fact that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize the importance of having first</v>

1328
00:58:43.601 --> 00:58:48.601
<v Speaker 3>responders having farm and having </v>
<v Speaker 3>policemen and that they really felt it </v>

1329
00:58:48.601 --> 00:58:49.090
<v Speaker 3>like in a deep real way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1330
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for what you do.</v>

1331
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't for what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

1332
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.190
<v Speaker 3>we will be so much more danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1333
00:58:55.370 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 3>it's having a very real memory of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>stepping in and risking their lives and </v>

1334
00:59:01.301 --> 00:59:06.301
<v Speaker 3>helping people and seeing them covered </v>
<v Speaker 3>with dust as they carried people out of </v>

1335
00:59:06.301 --> 00:59:06.540
<v Speaker 3>the buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

1336
00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.310
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1337
00:59:07.311 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1338
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:10.300
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was solidified and people's memories.</v>

1339
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:15.420
<v Speaker 3>And then over the past decade or so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go back and it's back to being New York </v>

1340
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:17.380
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't look at each other.</v>

1341
00:59:17.381 --> 00:59:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was,</v>

1342
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:22.490
<v Speaker 3>there was a feeling of vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 3>that existed because we had recognized a</v>

1343
00:59:22.491 --> 00:59:25.480
<v Speaker 3>real problem and we had gone through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real uh,</v>

1344
00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 3>but they had gone through a real moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>of intense adversity.</v>

1345
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Did you do,</v>

1346
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:36.340
<v Speaker 2>did you see in the wake of Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I found </v>

1347
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.030
<v Speaker 2>interesting was this conversation around</v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy,</v>

1348
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:38.880
<v Speaker 2>hipster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trap,</v>

1349
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.770
<v Speaker 2>tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hipsters.</v>

1350
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:44.771
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about the hipster tragedy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hipster is someone who the moment </v>

1351
00:59:44.771 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 2>something like the Paris attacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1352
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:50.740
<v Speaker 2>a start shitting on people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pouring out sympathy online or changing </v>

1353
00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:54.821
<v Speaker 2>their face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their facebook profile pictures to the </v>

1354
00:59:54.821 --> 00:59:54.821
<v Speaker 2>French flag or something by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1355
00:59:54.821 --> 00:59:59.231
<v Speaker 2>where will you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why weren't you out route outrage when </v>

1356
00:59:59.231 --> 00:59:59.231
<v Speaker 2>there was a roof like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like this.</v>

1357
00:59:59.231 --> 01:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I've got an article here in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stranger,</v>

1358
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:05.350
<v Speaker 2>which is the Seattle blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled why putting the French flag on </v>

1359
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:05.960
<v Speaker 2>the space needle is racist?</v>

1360
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:12.120
<v Speaker 3>What by Charles Modality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's November 16.</v>

1361
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't anybody acknowledged the </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks in Lebanon?</v>

1362
01:00:14.881 --> 01:00:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't anybody acknowledge the </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks in Nigeria?</v>

1363
01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:18.590
<v Speaker 3>That was the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1364
01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:22.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a real racist aspect to that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a real argument for.</v>

1365
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:28.300
<v Speaker 2>So I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to be allowed to allow </v>

1366
01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.490
<v Speaker 2>people to express sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1367
01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also find it a bit fatuous when </v>

1368
01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:34.770
<v Speaker 2>everyone starts pouring out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1369
01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:35.370
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were certain fashionable things to</v>

1370
01:00:35.371 --> 01:00:36.090
<v Speaker 2>care about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1371
01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:41.091
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit like the Kony 2012 phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something where all of a sudden </v>

1372
01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:42.990
<v Speaker 2>everyone just jumps on some social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

1373
01:00:42.991 --> 01:00:47.991
<v Speaker 2>Social Justice Bandwagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like Paris is a bit </v>

1374
01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:47.991
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1375
01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:49.530
<v Speaker 2>People should pay attention to Beirut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1376
01:00:49.531 --> 01:00:51.780
<v Speaker 2>People should pay attention to Nigeria </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Boca.</v>

1377
01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Harambe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1378
01:00:52.591 --> 01:00:54.570
<v Speaker 2>People should be more aware of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1379
01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:57.630
<v Speaker 2>But as a Bama said in the wake of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris attacks,</v>

1380
01:00:57.631 --> 01:01:01.890
<v Speaker 2>it is understandable for people to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a more instinctive,</v>

1381
01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:06.891
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic reaction to a city that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>know the city that they've been to a </v>

1382
01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:10.200
<v Speaker 2>city populated by people like them who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing things just like them going to</v>

1383
01:01:10.201 --> 01:01:12.120
<v Speaker 2>see a soccer game sitting in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

1384
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they offer parts of the world where</v>

1385
01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 2>they think that violence is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>commonplace.</v>

1386
01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Like Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can be belittling </v>

1387
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.330
<v Speaker 2>people for genuine expressions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy.</v>

1388
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't think that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be accusing them of being racist.</v>

1389
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:31.910
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you wholeheartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should accuse people </v>

1390
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:32.700
<v Speaker 3>of anything negative for expressing </v>
<v Speaker 3>sympathy,</v>

1391
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.940
<v Speaker 3>but I think that culturally when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the news and when you look at </v>

1392
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.051
<v Speaker 3>CNN and the people that are supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be responsible for letting us know </v>

1393
01:01:42.051 --> 01:01:44.610
<v Speaker 3>what's happening in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the issue lies.</v>

1394
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Like why are they concentrating solely </v>
<v Speaker 3>on Paris?</v>

1395
01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Why doesn't CNN have all this coverage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Lebanon in Nigeria that,</v>

1396
01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.130
<v Speaker 3>that mirrors it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get this broad perspective of the</v>

1397
01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:58.850
<v Speaker 3>actual world itself and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1398
01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:03.890
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isis issue is not just an issue </v>

1399
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:06.530
<v Speaker 3>that happened to Europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an issue that's been happening </v>

1400
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 3>all over the world for awhile now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1401
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:10.560
<v Speaker 2>And CNN is fucking awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not going to defense,</v>

1402
01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:11.160
<v Speaker 2>can it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1403
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:16.210
<v Speaker 2>CNN is the worst example I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just following the most predictable </v>

1404
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:18.440
<v Speaker 2>line on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try not to alienate anyone by being</v>

1405
01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:23.441
<v Speaker 2>too left or too right and as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence they just a mush of </v>

1406
01:02:23.441 --> 01:02:23.441
<v Speaker 2>ignorance and like parochialism</v>

1407
01:02:23.441 --> 01:02:25.370
<v Speaker 3>do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are Jeff Zucker,</v>

1408
01:02:25.371 --> 01:02:27.740
<v Speaker 3>if you're the guy who runs cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you do?</v>

1409
01:02:27.741 --> 01:02:30.200
<v Speaker 3>But you put Anthony Bourdain show on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

1410
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:31.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else do you do?</v>

1411
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean how the fuck do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you cover the news and like a broad </v>

1412
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:41.590
<v Speaker 3>way and also make it a profitable </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment enterprise,</v>

1413
01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.050
<v Speaker 3>which is what</v>

1414
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I would like to think that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>market for smart conversations about </v>

1415
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.831
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I try to do at huffpost </v>

1416
01:02:50.831 --> 01:02:52.630
<v Speaker 2>live and we don't get small numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean things oftentimes I'm surprised </v>

1417
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:57.221
<v Speaker 2>when I have a smart conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between Islamism to </v>

1418
01:02:57.221 --> 01:03:00.881
<v Speaker 2>Islam and the plight of poor Muslims in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the suburbs of European capitals where </v>

1419
01:03:02.091 --> 01:03:07.091
<v Speaker 2>unemployment is 35 percent and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographics of the types of people in </v>

1420
01:03:07.091 --> 01:03:11.741
<v Speaker 2>Iraq who are joining isis who were 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old during the US invasion and </v>

1421
01:03:11.741 --> 01:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>have just endured all of the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives basically being full of </v>

1422
01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:20.561
<v Speaker 2>civil war and people being beheaded and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strung up in the streets and who hated </v>

1423
01:03:20.561 --> 01:03:24.161
<v Speaker 2>Saddam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hate America and hate the West now </v>

1424
01:03:24.161 --> 01:03:24.161
<v Speaker 2>for everything that they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1425
01:03:24.161 --> 01:03:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Like when we talk about a lot sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1426
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.380
<v Speaker 2>some people are actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1427
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>significant numbers of people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually interested in hearing about it </v>

1428
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.871
<v Speaker 2>instead of meanwhile on CNN should the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mayor of this city and in the midwest </v>

1429
01:03:35.601 --> 01:03:39.170
<v Speaker 2>that has a majority Muslim population be</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid,</v>

1430
01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.600
<v Speaker 3>how can we can do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good,</v>

1431
01:03:40.601 --> 01:03:43.450
<v Speaker 3>but you can't do a rush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a total American accent.</v>

1432
01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1433
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1434
01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are problematic and it's very </v>

1435
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:53.200
<v Speaker 3>difficult for people to separate their </v>
<v Speaker 3>motives from,</v>

1436
01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.890
<v Speaker 3>from the reality of the situation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're reporting on to.</v>

1437
01:03:56.950 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with commercial </v>

1438
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1439
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:02.500
<v Speaker 3>you have advertisers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have all these different things that</v>

1440
01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:06.010
<v Speaker 3>have a say or at least an influence on </v>
<v Speaker 3>what gets said.</v>

1441
01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 3>Whereas you don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also the difference between </v>

1442
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.090
<v Speaker 3>broadcast and selective media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>

1443
01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a selective media outlet which </v>

1444
01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.941
<v Speaker 3>means someone finds out about Josh Zaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>from one of your many wonderful </v>

1445
01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:24.541
<v Speaker 3>appearances all throughout the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>huff post live and all these different </v>

1446
01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:24.541
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get to know you.</v>

1447
01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I like this guy's perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very intelligent.</v>

1448
01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:30.541
<v Speaker 3>He's very articulate and then they seek </v>
<v Speaker 3>you out and they find your thing to </v>

1449
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.380
<v Speaker 3>subscribe to it and then they go to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they becoming a josh eps fan.</v>

1450
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Whereas CNN is at the fucking airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1451
01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm waiting for my flight the other day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have CNN and they're.</v>

1452
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:43.270
<v Speaker 3>They're showing these people doing these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and it's just.</v>

1453
01:04:43.271 --> 01:04:48.271
<v Speaker 3>It's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between something </v>

1454
01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:51.271
<v Speaker 3>that's broadcast and something that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>select and I think when someone gets </v>

1455
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:55.600
<v Speaker 3>excited about something like what you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>is someone who has chosen to go seek out</v>

1456
01:04:55.601 --> 01:05:00.601
<v Speaker 3>your perspective and your point of view </v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's very difficult to do that on a </v>

1457
01:05:00.601 --> 01:05:02.800
<v Speaker 3>show like CNN or a network like CNN.</v>

1458
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.740
<v Speaker 2>We have to be able to do better than we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1459
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:09.890
<v Speaker 2>It like 60 minutes for all of its faults</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally hits the nail on the head </v>

1460
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.770
<v Speaker 2>and does a good job and certainly used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to and people watch it and watched it.</v>

1461
01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Still cronkite used to direct John that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are good.</v>

1462
01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>PBS does a does a great job.</v>

1463
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think NBC news does a great job just </v>

1464
01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.891
<v Speaker 1>as a CCO as a whole collection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Williams with the exception of Brian </v>

1465
01:05:25.891 --> 01:05:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I mean like,</v>

1466
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1467
01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never be a robot.</v>

1468
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>A robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1469
01:05:32.141 --> 01:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit what he's to do his </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

1470
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what they should do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have a fucking laptop there,</v>

1471
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:42.630
<v Speaker 1>but he is on your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On your point about what people are </v>

1472
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>gonna Watch and seek out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good piece in vox by Max </v>

1473
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Fisher after the all the criticism of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like why didn't,</v>

1474
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:49.390
<v Speaker 1>why didn't the media cover the Beirut </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombings?</v>

1475
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Because like one of the most popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most retweeted tweets the day</v>

1476
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:57.781
<v Speaker 1>after the Paris attacks was a tweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>about why is the media covering this so </v>

1477
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 1>much when they didn't cover Beirut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1478
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.190
<v Speaker 1>so Max Fisher says we did and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>clicks on it.</v>

1479
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.440
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody ever clicks on it,</v>

1480
01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:15.310
<v Speaker 1>clicks at it or no one clicks on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they just let it go and they just,</v>

1481
01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>at some point you have to at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in having a </v>

1482
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:24.570
<v Speaker 1>thriving media business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to give people what they </v>

1483
01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:24.570
<v Speaker 1>actually want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is judged by what they click on.</v>

1484
01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they put Beirut at the very top of </v>

1485
01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.931
<v Speaker 1>the page and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you get doesn't even register as a </v>

1486
01:06:30.931 --> 01:06:35.071
<v Speaker 1>blip on the number of clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they downgrade it and then it </v>

1487
01:06:35.071 --> 01:06:35.071
<v Speaker 1>ends up falling back onto the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>section of the site.</v>

1488
01:06:35.071 --> 01:06:39.420
<v Speaker 1>But I think you just nailed it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a business and that's where it </v>

1489
01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.151
<v Speaker 1>becomes a problem and that becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is that it's an entertainment </v>

1490
01:06:42.151 --> 01:06:44.140
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like CNN is an entertainment network.</v>

1491
01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

1492
01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they entertain you by showing you the </v>

1493
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>real reality TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the news,</v>

1494
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.720
<v Speaker 1>but much like reality tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:54.150
<v Speaker 1>if you live in a house with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they,</v>

1496
01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:59.380
<v Speaker 1>they filmed six hours a day and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they water it down to 44 minutes on </v>

1497
01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>television or 22 minutes on television.</v>

1498
01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 1>When they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're gonna.</v>

1499
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:04.300
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna do it the way they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show it.</v>

1500
01:07:04.301 --> 01:07:09.301
<v Speaker 1>They're going to chop out a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other shit that you're not really </v>

1501
01:07:09.301 --> 01:07:11.671
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're gonna paint a picture and </v>

1502
01:07:11.671 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 1>they can edit it and paint that picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a variety of different ways.</v>

1503
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.760
<v Speaker 1>But they're going to do it in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think is going to be the most </v>

1504
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.741
<v Speaker 1>salacious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be the most compelling for </v>

1505
01:07:19.741 --> 01:07:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you to tune in so they can sell you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyota truck so they can,</v>

1506
01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:22.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise tide laundry detergent.</v>

1507
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it's all about.</v>

1508
01:07:24.401 --> 01:07:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

1509
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:31.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem when you combine </v>
<v Speaker 1>commerce with the dissemination of </v>

1510
01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:31.630
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1511
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:32.650
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is the tweet.</v>

1512
01:07:32.651 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Jones TV,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but rip to older people that lost their </v>

1515
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>lives in Lebanon yesterday from Isis </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>

1516
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how many retweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got that,</v>

1517
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>that's been reached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.680
<v Speaker 1>57,750</v>
<v Speaker 1>times and like 43,000.</v>

1520
01:07:55.681 --> 01:07:58.861
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from 2006 during the Israeli war </v>

1521
01:07:58.861 --> 01:08:01.321
<v Speaker 1>against Hezbollah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's absolutely not true that no </v>

1522
01:08:01.321 --> 01:08:04.591
<v Speaker 1>media has covered this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times covered at the </v>

1523
01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:04.591
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ip,</v>

<v Speaker 1>blasts.</v>

1525
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.760
<v Speaker 1>The economist had a piece on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN even seeing ended it,</v>

1526
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:15.300
<v Speaker 1>the daily mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a fake picture that's </v>

1527
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:15.300
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's from nine years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long picture the picture that Angelina </v>

<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>

1533
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.920
<v Speaker 3>so get on the fucking ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angelina,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Those.</v>

1535
01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Those are the tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hipsters and investigated the veracity </v>

1536
01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:32.250
<v Speaker 3>of the photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You post young lady,</v>

1537

<v Speaker 3>how dare she hashtag outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Hashtag [inaudible].</v>

1538
01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

1539
01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.060
<v Speaker 2>And now I don't know what to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About,</v>

1540
01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:43.980
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Islam as well.</v>

1541
01:08:43.981 --> 01:08:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Like the difficulty is what are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of all of the,</v>

1542
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:53.390
<v Speaker 2>all of the right wing is taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My greatest fear about terrorism is that</v>

1543
01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 2>we end up living in like a quasi fascist</v>
<v Speaker 2>state because we overreact so much that </v>

1544
01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:03.231
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I got a little nephew who's two </v>

1545
01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:03.231
<v Speaker 2>years old when he's 18 and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling around the world like I did.</v>

1546
01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Is he going to be able to sit outside in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cafe and,</v>

1547
01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:11.260
<v Speaker 2>and relax or is he gonna have to walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a metal detector every bloody </v>

1548
01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:11.260
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes like,</v>

1549
01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:11.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is he gonna?</v>

1550
01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:16.731
<v Speaker 2>Is He gonna have any privacy or is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>NSA going to spy on everything that he </v>

1551
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:16.731
<v Speaker 2>does?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1552
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:18.090
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna let it because we're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of having a text like this.</v>

1553
01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And is he going to live in a pluralistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>society or are we going to be so cowed </v>

1554
01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:24.210
<v Speaker 2>either one way or the other way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either we,</v>

1555
01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:27.900
<v Speaker 2>we take out trump ID and oppress </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>

1556
01:09:27.901 --> 01:09:30.900
<v Speaker 2>which only exacerbates the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or on the other hand,</v>

1557
01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:33.090
<v Speaker 2>we become social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors who were like,</v>

1558
01:09:33.091 --> 01:09:36.180
<v Speaker 2>this has nothing to do with Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam is a religion of peace.</v>

1559
01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:41.360
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to see here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about the </v>

1560
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.531
<v Speaker 2>Islamists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that we end up with mini </v>

1561
01:09:43.531 --> 01:09:45.561
<v Speaker 2>theocracies in our own cities where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically have a liberal communities </v>

1562
01:09:45.561 --> 01:09:46.990
<v Speaker 2>that don't respect women's rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't respect gay rights,</v>

1563
01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:47.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1564
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.550
<v Speaker 3>don't respect but actively suppress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:09:51.551 --> 01:09:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean isis is throwing gay people</v>

1566
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.010
<v Speaker 2>bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1567
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how we talk about this </v>

1568
01:09:59.500 --> 01:09:59.500
<v Speaker 2>is the problem way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I by make,</v>

1569
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.791
<v Speaker 2>by way I mean people like me who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly sympathetic to minority rights </v>

1570
01:10:04.071 --> 01:10:09.071
<v Speaker 2>and who abroadly pro civil rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>want everybody to be able to live life </v>

1571
01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:11.900
<v Speaker 2>however they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm pro high levels of immigration,</v>

1572
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not intolerant,</v>

1573
01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:19.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as in a phobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not racist or </v>

1574
01:10:19.071 --> 01:10:21.881
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do we talk honestly about the </v>

1575
01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:24.461
<v Speaker 2>fact that at the fringes of Islam there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a big fucking problem and not yield </v>

1576
01:10:24.461 --> 01:10:26.460
<v Speaker 2>that territory to the right wing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got this,</v>

1577
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>the rise of these right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if there was an election</v>

1578
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 2>this election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an election in Paris,</v>

1579
01:10:31.011 --> 01:10:35.900
<v Speaker 2>in France next week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how many more Paris is Paris attacks</v>

1580
01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 2>would you have to have before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>National Front,</v>

1581
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:42.680
<v Speaker 2>the anti-immigrant racist party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one pallet in Sweden.</v>

1582
01:10:42.681 --> 01:10:47.681
<v Speaker 2>Now the third largest party is a party </v>
<v Speaker 2>that wants to close the borders </v>

1583
01:10:47.681 --> 01:10:48.020
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1584
01:10:48.021 --> 01:10:53.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you practically already got that on the </v>

1585
01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:53.021
<v Speaker 2>gop side here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1586
01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:53.021
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even.</v>

1587
01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:53.021
<v Speaker 2>Not even remotely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

1588
01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I take that back because they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to close the illegal border,</v>

1589
01:10:55.221 --> 01:10:58.130
<v Speaker 2>but they still believe in having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate levels of.</v>

1590
01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1591
01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>It's don't believe in having people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>me coming in.</v>

1592
01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1593
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:05.110
<v Speaker 3>So how do people that speak well with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool accent?</v>

1594
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You educated.</v>

1595
01:11:08.021 --> 01:11:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on over,</v>

1596
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.080
<v Speaker 3>probably more educated than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1597
01:11:11.081 --> 01:11:16.081
<v Speaker 3>I think what we have here is a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings classically react to tragedies </v>

1598
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.870
<v Speaker 3>and massive events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1599
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.920
<v Speaker 3>we have problems and then we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions and there's the solution is </v>

1600
01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.601
<v Speaker 3>being debated and there's the extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing answer to the solution to </v>

1601
01:11:29.601 --> 01:11:32.310
<v Speaker 3>these problems which is close up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The borders are more military,</v>

1602
01:11:32.311 --> 01:11:34.530
<v Speaker 3>more guns attack Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to war.</v>

1603
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do that.</v>

1604
01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I think we're also dealing with people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trump that are gigantic egos that </v>

1605
01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:45.120
<v Speaker 3>have these platforms where they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>step up and they want to gather all this</v>

1606
01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:49.380
<v Speaker 3>attention to themselves and point to </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves as the solution to this issue</v>

1607
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:54.381
<v Speaker 3>with their hotline stances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what's going to happen is </v>

1608
01:11:54.381 --> 01:11:58.980
<v Speaker 3>technology as it becomes more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>pervasive and invasive,</v>

1609
01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:03.981
<v Speaker 3>and as we become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbiotically connected to the ability </v>

1610
01:12:03.981 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 3>to express ourselves through phones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the Internet,</v>

1611
01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I think the next level of this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately going to be some level that </v>

1612
01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:15.081
<v Speaker 3>allows people to communicate in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not just typing things down </v>

1613
01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.500
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just watching a video </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

1614
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with each other in some sort</v>

1615
01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:24.531
<v Speaker 3>of a neural transmitting manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be some next step level</v>

1616
01:12:25.501 --> 01:12:30.501
<v Speaker 3>of technology with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a decade from now or two </v>

1617
01:12:30.501 --> 01:12:33.351
<v Speaker 3>decades from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be it's gonna seem </v>

1618
01:12:33.351 --> 01:12:35.090
<v Speaker 3>pointless to have phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to seem point.</v>

1619
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:40.310
<v Speaker 3>The idea of having a physical thing when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to in order to access </v>

1620
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:41.940
<v Speaker 3>information is going to seem absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

1621
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:45.690
<v Speaker 3>And once that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see what we see right now</v>

1622
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:50.190
<v Speaker 3>in the world where I think w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's regardless of how crazy the</v>

1623
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:53.100
<v Speaker 3>world is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at least in America right now,</v>

1624
01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:58.310
<v Speaker 3>this is absolutely the safest time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when all this social justice warrior </v>

1625
01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:03.441
<v Speaker 3>shit they were saying and all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>craziness about outrage and Hashtag </v>

1626
01:13:03.441 --> 01:13:05.760
<v Speaker 3>racism and Hashtag this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad,</v>

1627
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's good.</v>

1628
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:09.270
<v Speaker 3>It's good because it's all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity.</v>

1629
01:13:09.271 --> 01:13:10.950
<v Speaker 3>It's good because it's all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>inclusion.</v>

1630
01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:15.951
<v Speaker 3>It's good because it's all about </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminating anything that's disparaging </v>

1631
01:13:15.951 --> 01:13:19.551
<v Speaker 3>or racist or anything where you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalizing groups based on something </v>

1632
01:13:19.551 --> 01:13:22.530
<v Speaker 3>that they can't control like what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like or their sexual preference.</v>

1633
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:27.710
<v Speaker 3>And I think as we get deeper and deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this interconnectivity that we're </v>

1634
01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:33.501
<v Speaker 3>experiencing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to absolve a lot of our </v>

1635
01:13:33.501 --> 01:13:38.181
<v Speaker 3>differences in grievances through our </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to communicate with each other </v>

1636
01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 3>and connect with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we're experiencing like this</v>

1637
01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:44.770
<v Speaker 3>adolescent sort of angst before we get </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the fucking house and go out onto</v>

1638
01:13:44.771 --> 01:13:45.900
<v Speaker 3>the our own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1639
01:13:45.901 --> 01:13:50.901
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're becoming adults as a civilization </v>

1640
01:13:50.901 --> 01:13:54.020
<v Speaker 3>and along the way we're experiencing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking teenage hormonal rage that you </v>

1641
01:13:55.291 --> 01:14:00.291
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 14 year old has when they're still </v>

1642
01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:02.061
<v Speaker 3>trapped in their parents house with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom that human beings are going to </v>

1643
01:14:02.061 --> 01:14:05.871
<v Speaker 3>have in the future to communicate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>express themselves is going to negate a </v>

1644
01:14:05.871 --> 01:14:09.090
<v Speaker 3>lot of this Hashtag college racism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag college activism.</v>

1645
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:14.330
<v Speaker 3>I think what that's coming from is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this feeling that a lot of people have </v>

1646
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:14.330
<v Speaker 3>that their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1647
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:16.540
<v Speaker 3>their ideas and their opinions aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken into consideration.</v>

1648
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 3>That they're not taken seriously and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's why they're overreacting and</v>

1649
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.000
<v Speaker 3>freaking out and walking through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

1650
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:25.000
<v Speaker 3>the hallways and Dartmouth and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>library.</v>

1651
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter.</v>

1652
01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing?</v>

1653
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:33.780
<v Speaker 2>What do you have a greater ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nail joe to communicate with each other </v>

1654
01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.010
<v Speaker 2>than we ever have already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So recent.</v>

1655
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:35.030
<v Speaker 2>It's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1656
01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I take your point with certainly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescents of our,</v>

1657
01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 2>of our species and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do suspect that you're looking at </v>

1658
01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.981
<v Speaker 2>this through the prism of a mind that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spends a lot of time thinking about </v>

1659
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:49.370
<v Speaker 2>things and a lot of time having </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that,</v>

1660
01:14:49.371 --> 01:14:54.371
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are uplifting and transcendence </v>

1661
01:14:54.371 --> 01:14:54.371
<v Speaker 2>stay through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to,</v>

1662
01:14:54.371 --> 01:14:55.390
<v Speaker 2>trying to find a way of saying drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just drugs,</v>

1663
01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:57.410
<v Speaker 2>but not just drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a float,</v>

1664
01:14:57.411 --> 01:14:58.160
<v Speaker 2>tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>

1665
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.240
<v Speaker 2>whatever else it is that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do in order to gain a </v>

1666
01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.480
<v Speaker 2>perspective on things that is beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own little tribe.</v>

1667
01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.840
<v Speaker 2>My concern is whether or not there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct correlation between upgrading </v>

1668
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:10.850
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1669
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.330
<v Speaker 2>the means of communication with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That obviously the way that we currently</v>

1670
01:15:14.331 --> 01:15:18.230
<v Speaker 2>communicate is going to seem completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>antiquated in decades to come.</v>

1671
01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.860
<v Speaker 2>But what we've seen happen when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when the Internet began,</v>

1672
01:15:21.861 --> 01:15:25.280
<v Speaker 2>you sound to me a little bit like people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I would listen to in the 19 nineties</v>

1673
01:15:25.281 --> 01:15:27.980
<v Speaker 2>who would say when once everyone is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the line,</v>

1674
01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:33.020
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be no need for </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference anymore because everyone's </v>

1675
01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:33.020
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1676
01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:37.511
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's going to be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to so many different ideas that </v>

1677
01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:38.030
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be able to be nclr </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1678
01:15:38.031 --> 01:15:39.980
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>parochial anymore,</v>

1679
01:15:39.981 --> 01:15:42.320
<v Speaker 2>trapped in your own little circle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

1680
01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:47.321
<v Speaker 2>Because with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to be available at </v>

1681
01:15:47.321 --> 01:15:47.321
<v Speaker 2>everyone's fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some people,</v>

1682
01:15:47.321 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there a futurist who was saying that of </v>

1683
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:52.650
<v Speaker 2>course what's happened is we've had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite effect that that the,</v>

1684
01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:57.670
<v Speaker 2>the availability of communication has on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a widespread scale has actually enabled </v>

1685
01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:02.591
<v Speaker 2>people to silo themselves into little </v>
<v Speaker 2>self thinking like communities of </v>

1686
01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Sameness so that we're actually more </v>
<v Speaker 2>divided than we've ever been because you</v>

1687
01:16:07.161 --> 01:16:12.161
<v Speaker 2>can seek out only the information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comports with the way that you see the </v>

1688
01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:15.701
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that a technology is </v>

1689
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:17.951
<v Speaker 2>necessarily going to drive an awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the awakening comes from drugs </v>

1690
01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:22.991
<v Speaker 2>and spiritual epiphany's and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication can be a tool to enact </v>

1691
01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:27.191
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can just as easily see some </v>

1692
01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:28.760
<v Speaker 2>communication revolution being </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulated by jihadis,</v>

1693
01:16:28.761 --> 01:16:33.761
<v Speaker 2>the way that they currently use the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet and twitter to coordinate </v>

1694
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:33.761
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attacks.</v>

1695
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:33.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's an either or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1696
01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that there are groups</v>

1697
01:16:36.501 --> 01:16:40.380
<v Speaker 3>of insulated people that searched for </v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmation bias and they,</v>

1698
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 3>they stay within their tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think one of the reasons why </v>

1699
01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:49.211
<v Speaker 3>they're so active now and there's more </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them is because they're recognizing </v>

1700
01:16:49.211 --> 01:16:52.370
<v Speaker 3>the inevitable future and that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1701
01:16:52.371 --> 01:16:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be able to insulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the past like you better get</v>

1702
01:16:55.161 --> 01:17:00.161
<v Speaker 3>it in now while you can better stockpile</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking food because the famine's </v>

1703
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:03.491
<v Speaker 3>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're going to experience </v>

1704
01:17:03.491 --> 01:17:06.071
<v Speaker 3>in the future is going to be more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more deterioration of these insulated </v>

1705
01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:08.840
<v Speaker 3>little tribes and I think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're.</v>

1706
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.700
<v Speaker 3>When people have to apologize for </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1707
01:17:10.701 --> 01:17:15.701
<v Speaker 3>they would never have to apologize </v>
<v Speaker 3>before people like w what we were </v>

1708
01:17:15.701 --> 01:17:16.040
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Al Franken saying,</v>

1709
01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:17.330
<v Speaker 3>rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot.</v>

1710
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.880
<v Speaker 3>That was just a few years ago that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote that book.</v>

1711
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1712
01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 3>you can't write that book today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't put that book on the </v>

1713
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 3>shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't,</v>

1714
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be supported.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be supported by Barnes and </v>

1715
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:32.801
<v Speaker 3>noble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you calling something a big fat </v>

1716
01:17:32.801 --> 01:17:32.801
<v Speaker 3>idiot is fat shaming now and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this,</v>

1717
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:36.830
<v Speaker 3>this increased outrage is also increased</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity.</v>

1718
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 3>It's also increased understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 3>once the dust settles in the argument,</v>

1719
01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:45.820
<v Speaker 3>then people have to like do you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take into consideration the validity of </v>

1720
01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:49.751
<v Speaker 3>other people's opinions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not you agree with them or </v>

1721
01:17:49.751 --> 01:17:52.061
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand that it's just a </v>

1722
01:17:52.061 --> 01:17:54.731
<v Speaker 3>matter of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this broad range of people expressing </v>

1723
01:17:54.731 --> 01:17:58.481
<v Speaker 3>themselves will slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll slowly come down to an </v>

1724
01:17:58.481 --> 01:17:58.481
<v Speaker 3>understandable vibration.</v>

1725
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just unpack two things that </v>

1726
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.550
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone not conflating two things,</v>

1727
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:05.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the social justice warrior debate</v>

1728
01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:07.070
<v Speaker 2>here in the United States and the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>is Islamism,</v>

1729
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.160
<v Speaker 2>and we're sort of kind of having two </v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel conversations about that.</v>

1730
01:18:10.161 --> 01:18:15.161
<v Speaker 2>At the same time in terms of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors in the United </v>

1731
01:18:15.161 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I hope that you're right,</v>

1732
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:21.581
<v Speaker 2>that what they think that they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is being an extension of the great </v>

1733
01:18:21.581 --> 01:18:23.060
<v Speaker 2>traditions of civil rights in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1734
01:18:23.061 --> 01:18:26.300
<v Speaker 2>that they being motivated by a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>

1735
01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:31.301
<v Speaker 2>I just found a passion and an outrage </v>
<v Speaker 2>against what they perceive as being </v>

1736
01:18:31.301 --> 01:18:35.440
<v Speaker 2>outrageous injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My concern is that what they're also </v>

1737
01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:38.861
<v Speaker 2>doing is buying into a long tradition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intolerance and a lack of respect for </v>

1738
01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:45.401
<v Speaker 2>pluralism and for other people's ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>about things for other people's right to</v>

1739
01:18:45.411 --> 01:18:49.040
<v Speaker 2>express ideas that they regard as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>

1740
01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.340
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier this study that I </v>

1741
01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:54.340
<v Speaker 2>thought you liked that I bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just find it because it's good.</v>

1742
01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:54.710
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>

1743
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:59.711
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this professor called April </v>

1744
01:18:59.711 --> 01:19:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Kelly and she's a professor of political</v>
<v Speaker 2>science at Elizabeth town college and </v>

1745
01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 2>she's got a chapter in this new paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the end of the experiment,</v>

1746
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 2>the rise of cultural elites and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decline of American civic culture.</v>

1747
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:12.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this study which is called the </v>

1748
01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:16.210
<v Speaker 2>General Social Survey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which looks at how tolerant or </v>

1749
01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.120
<v Speaker 2>intolerant particular demographics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans are.</v>

1750
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they stopped by on.</v>

1751
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll get tangled up in my microphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1752
01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I was getting too relaxed listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk.</v>

1753
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I was like kicking back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1754
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.340
<v Speaker 2>getting out the popcorn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to Joe.</v>

1755
01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in the general social survey,</v>

1756
01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:31.430
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1757
01:19:31.431 --> 01:19:33.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they propose a bunch of different groups</v>

1758
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:38.890
<v Speaker 2>and they asked people how much they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would like or dislike that group of </v>

1759
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:38.890
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1760
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Just to establish who we really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really don't like.</v>

1761
01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.320
<v Speaker 2>The least liked group included in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>survey was Muslim clergymen who preach </v>

1762
01:19:45.861 --> 01:19:48.230
<v Speaker 2>hatred against the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1763
01:19:48.231 --> 01:19:53.231
<v Speaker 2>That's understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second least liked group among </v>

1764
01:19:53.231 --> 01:19:57.851
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who believed that blacks are </v>

1765
01:19:57.851 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 2>genetically inferior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so racist.</v>

1766
01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:03.020
<v Speaker 2>So then they ask people how tolerant </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would be to,</v>

1767
01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:08.650
<v Speaker 2>towards those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person from that class of people </v>

1768
01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:11.770
<v Speaker 2>giving speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a public speech in their community and </v>

1769
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:17.150
<v Speaker 2>people in their forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more tolerant than people in their </v>

1770
01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:20.031
<v Speaker 2>thirties and people in their thirties </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more tolerant than people in their </v>

1771
01:20:20.031 --> 01:20:22.911
<v Speaker 2>twenties when people in their forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proportion who say that a member </v>

1772
01:20:22.911 --> 01:20:27.591
<v Speaker 2>that a Muslim clergymen who preaches </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred against the United States should </v>

1773
01:20:27.591 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 2>not be allowed to give a public speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>is 43 percent people in their thirties.</v>

1774
01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Fifty two percent people in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>

1775
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:37.490
<v Speaker 2>60 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if tolerance means not like,</v>

1776
01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support black rights,</v>

1777
01:20:38.761 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 2>or I support gay rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support Trans Rights,</v>

1778
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:45.210
<v Speaker 2>but if it means respecting the right of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who you really disagree with,</v>

1779
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:50.720
<v Speaker 2>to express that opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then young people are actually more </v>

1780
01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.140
<v Speaker 2>intolerant now than older people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more tolerant towards </v>

1781
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.090
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals and atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's because they like homosexuals</v>

1782
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.140
<v Speaker 2>and atheists more than older people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1783
01:20:58.141 --> 01:21:00.210
<v Speaker 2>That's not tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tolerance is,</v>

1784
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:05.300
<v Speaker 2>is not a measure of liking someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a willingness to extend political </v>

1785
01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 2>freedoms to people who you disliked when</v>
<v Speaker 2>young people are less,</v>

1786
01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:07.290
<v Speaker 2>less willing to do that.</v>

1787
01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're saying though is </v>

1788
01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:12.340
<v Speaker 3>they're less willing to accept hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>

1789
01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:17.171
<v Speaker 3>which they think are dangerous or </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous conversations.</v>

1790
01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:19.430
<v Speaker 3>They think that someone who is a Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>clergymen,</v>

1791
01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:22.460
<v Speaker 3>who wants to express the hate of </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

1792
01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:25.160
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerous because he could promote </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist attacks.</v>

1793
01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Someone who thinks that black people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically inferior to white people is </v>

1794
01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.481
<v Speaker 3>dangerous because they could promote </v>
<v Speaker 3>racism or they could promote someone </v>

1795
01:21:34.481 --> 01:21:39.170
<v Speaker 3>confirming their racist beliefs and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of becoming educated,</v>

1796
01:21:39.171 --> 01:21:44.171
<v Speaker 3>are becoming enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go with the initial racist </v>

1797
01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:44.750
<v Speaker 3>instincts and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was right.</v>

1798
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:46.690
<v Speaker 3>You know the white man is superior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1799
01:21:46.691 --> 01:21:47.490
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1800
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.450
<v Speaker 3>they're worried about hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1801
01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:50.320
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking</v>

1802
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.450
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both those things are about hate.</v>

1803
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:55.500
<v Speaker 2>This is Meryl Streep's Teesha at saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

1804
01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:56.690
<v Speaker 2>a rebel in a slave about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1805
01:21:56.691 --> 01:22:01.691
<v Speaker 2>because it is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to a lot of people in their 20 </v>

1806
01:22:01.691 --> 01:22:01.691
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people?</v>

1807
01:22:01.691 --> 01:22:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Well enough people that she has to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a press release about it.</v>

1808
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:05.370
<v Speaker 2>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything.</v>

1809
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I think we are better off living in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>society where bad ideas are exposed to </v>

1810
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1811
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sunlight is the best disinfectant.</v>

1812
01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:20.781
<v Speaker 2>You want bad ideas out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want a big roiling conversation </v>

1813
01:22:20.781 --> 01:22:24.530
<v Speaker 2>where people who are stupid or </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous ideas about the genetic </v>

1814
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:24.530
<v Speaker 2>inferiority of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1815
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:27.840
<v Speaker 2>of black people are able to be exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be argued with,</v>

1816
01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:30.150
<v Speaker 2>be contented because racists aren't just</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go away.</v>

1817
01:22:30.151 --> 01:22:32.760
<v Speaker 2>If you bend them talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go onto ground.</v>

1818
01:22:32.761 --> 01:22:37.761
<v Speaker 2>They're going to find out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities they gonna they gonna </v>

1819
01:22:37.761 --> 01:22:38.700
<v Speaker 2>increasingly self segregate into their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own little communities online.</v>

1820
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:41.670
<v Speaker 2>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you want free speech to be a big</v>

1821
01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:46.671
<v Speaker 2>roiling debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be censorious and </v>

1822
01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:49.850
<v Speaker 2>judgmental and intolerant towards people</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose eyes you just you whose ideas you </v>

1823
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:54.081
<v Speaker 2>disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to take them on and expose why </v>

1824
01:22:54.081 --> 01:22:54.081
<v Speaker 2>those ideas are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully through that,</v>

1825
01:22:54.081 --> 01:22:56.220
<v Speaker 2>through that wrestling match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intellectual wrestling match,</v>

1826
01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 2>you will end up progressing forward your</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress forward by simply banning ideas</v>

1827
01:23:00.571 --> 01:23:03.910
<v Speaker 2>that you think are are objectionable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's agreed.</v>

1828
01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>You know that's a very important point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1829
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:11.250
<v Speaker 3>what they're worried about though is </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people going to schools and </v>

1830
01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:14.371
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinating very gullible or very </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressionable young people and that's </v>

1831
01:23:14.371 --> 01:23:19.111
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a legit thing because they </v>

1832
01:23:19.111 --> 01:23:19.111
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

1833
01:23:19.111 --> 01:23:19.111
<v Speaker 2>That reinforces the Gullibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1834
01:23:19.111 --> 01:23:24.041
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't been exposed to any other </v>

1835
01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:24.041
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1836
01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.360
<v Speaker 3>is that they themselves have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinated into the idea of </v>

1837
01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.721
<v Speaker 3>liberalism and liberal thinking by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>charismatic people with interesting </v>

1838
01:23:29.721 --> 01:23:34.371
<v Speaker 3>ideas that they believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>wholeheartedly and they're very </v>

1839
01:23:34.371 --> 01:23:34.860
<v Speaker 3>confident in what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they speak very well.</v>

1840
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Those ideas become infectious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes those.</v>

1841
01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I've expressed this before on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast that I listened to these Islamic</v>

1842
01:23:42.091 --> 01:23:47.091
<v Speaker 3>clergyman speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and although I have zero desire to </v>

1843
01:23:47.091 --> 01:23:51.291
<v Speaker 3>become a Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something intoxicating about </v>

1844
01:23:51.291 --> 01:23:54.831
<v Speaker 3>people that extremely confident about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideology and that's dangerous for </v>

1845
01:23:54.831 --> 01:23:54.831
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous.</v>

1846
01:23:54.831 --> 01:23:57.150
<v Speaker 3>You have a person like me who's done a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of fucking drugs,</v>

1847
01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.300
<v Speaker 3>who does a lot of meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is involved in martial arts.</v>

1848
01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:03.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm a free thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a non theistic sort of a thinker,</v>

1849
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:08.990
<v Speaker 3>but I watch these people have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations with these massive crowds </v>

1850
01:24:09.330 --> 01:24:12.630
<v Speaker 3>and they're saying all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about Islam being the truth and I</v>

1851
01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:17.370
<v Speaker 3>feel I have a fee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel an understanding why people would</v>

1852
01:24:17.371 --> 01:24:22.371
<v Speaker 3>be drawn to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I'm drawn to it </v>

1853
01:24:22.371 --> 01:24:25.161
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I understand it like I feel that </v>

1854
01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:28.220
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The compelling idea behind someone </v>

1855
01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:28.290
<v Speaker 3>joining a group like that.</v>

1856
01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because certainty is </v>

1857
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:33.690
<v Speaker 2>intoxicating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1858
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're.</v>

1859
01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.310
<v Speaker 2>If you're discombobulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the world is complicated,</v>

1860
01:24:36.311 --> 01:24:41.311
<v Speaker 2>if you'd done what to make of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're in a situation </v>

1861
01:24:41.311 --> 01:24:43.090
<v Speaker 2>where you feel like you've been on for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of time,</v>

1862
01:24:43.091 --> 01:24:47.600
<v Speaker 2>which is what a lot of these followers </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these extremists do feel like a.</v>

1863
01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Then it's nice to just have clarity </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just have someone who knows what </v>

1864
01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:55.030
<v Speaker 2>the truth is and who knows what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right path is.</v>

1865
01:24:55.410 --> 01:24:59.790
<v Speaker 3>A perfect example that is country music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you</v>

1866
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.590
<v Speaker 2>if you'd asked to list five things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are going to end that sentence with,</v>

1867
01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.300
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have country music would not</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been top,</v>

1868
01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:05.830
<v Speaker 2>top 50.</v>

1869
01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:09.650
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people that I love </v>
<v Speaker 3>dearly that liked country music and they</v>

1870
01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:14.651
<v Speaker 3>lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They read the least out of all the </v>

1871
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:14.651
<v Speaker 3>people that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the people that I know that are like</v>

1872
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:16.520
<v Speaker 3>really into like really dumb country </v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

1873
01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:19.310
<v Speaker 3>These motherfuckers on aware of shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going on in the world.</v>

1874
01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:22.670
<v Speaker 3>I have good friends that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1875
01:25:22.671 --> 01:25:27.671
<v Speaker 3>I have to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially for like from the hunting </v>

1876
01:25:27.671 --> 01:25:30.041
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the hunting world has goddamn </v>

1877
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:32.470
<v Speaker 3>hilarious because I've somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another become a part of this world </v>

1878
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:36.191
<v Speaker 3>because I've expressed this idea that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is very important that we should </v>

1879
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:37.020
<v Speaker 3>be aware of where our food comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then uh,</v>

1880
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:41.480
<v Speaker 3>and I've become someone who gathers </v>
<v Speaker 3>their food from a hunting way,</v>

1881
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:45.320
<v Speaker 3>but then you connect yourself with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are also in this,</v>

1882
01:25:45.321 --> 01:25:48.050
<v Speaker 3>which became very religious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of really,</v>

1883
01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.540
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird kind of religion.</v>

1884
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:51.370
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1885
01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:56.540
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a hashtag activist sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of religious idea where they don't </v>

1886
01:25:57.051 --> 01:26:00.200
<v Speaker 3>understand the texts they don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll have religious tattoos.</v>

1887
01:26:00.450 --> 01:26:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey fucker,</v>

1888
01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:03.560
<v Speaker 3>you got to read the whole book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the book says,</v>

1889
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 3>don't Tattoo yourself just like it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't blow guys.</v>

1890
01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1891
01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.110
<v Speaker 3>I've had arguments with people but</v>

1892
01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:15.290
<v Speaker 2>pretty much more explicit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get a tattoo then don't blow a guy</v>

1893
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.370
<v Speaker 2>blow a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat is always nebulous about like lying</v>

1894
01:26:18.371 --> 01:26:19.300
<v Speaker 2>with another male Wilson</v>

1895
01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:24.040
<v Speaker 3>the no tattoo on his knees and sucks my </v>
<v Speaker 3>desk.</v>

1896
01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:28.880
<v Speaker 3>There's no lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the tattoo thing is very clear,</v>

1897
01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:33.881
<v Speaker 3>but when I got into it with these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>was when that woman from Kentucky </v>

1898
01:26:33.881 --> 01:26:38.351
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't marry gay people and I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 3>this piece on instagram and facebook and</v>

1899
01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:44.441
<v Speaker 3>it got millions of likes and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people traded it back and forth and I </v>

1900
01:26:44.441 --> 01:26:48.311
<v Speaker 3>got all this blow back from the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>community because all these people that </v>

1901
01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:51.491
<v Speaker 3>are really into God or really into </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and then you know,</v>

1902
01:26:51.941 --> 01:26:53.360
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also recognizing them.</v>

1903
01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:58.410
<v Speaker 3>So like they were getting pressured by </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends who are in the hunting </v>

1904
01:26:58.410 --> 01:27:01.271
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're getting pressure to talk to me </v>

1905
01:27:01.271 --> 01:27:01.271
<v Speaker 3>about my stance on God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1906
01:27:01.271 --> 01:27:01.800
<v Speaker 3>this is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1907
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much do you guys actually know about</v>

1908
01:27:03.981 --> 01:27:05.960
<v Speaker 3>the scripts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much have you guys read?</v>

1909
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:11.140
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you know about the origins </v>

1910
01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:11.140
<v Speaker 3>of the scripts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out very little.</v>

1911
01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very little,</v>

1912
01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:15.590
<v Speaker 3>but there's this need to simplify things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that appear to be very complex.</v>

1913
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 3>And the way to simplify things is put it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in God's hands.</v>

1914
01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.010
<v Speaker 3>It's all about Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Jesus.</v>

1915
01:27:21.011 --> 01:27:26.011
<v Speaker 3>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why I'm going to vote for </v>

1916
01:27:26.011 --> 01:27:26.011
<v Speaker 3>him because he's on Jesus.</v>

1917
01:27:26.011 --> 01:27:29.980
<v Speaker 2>This comes back to the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribalism that we were alluding to </v>

1918
01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:29.980
<v Speaker 2>earlier in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1919
01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.620
<v Speaker 2>That there is no greater way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraging people to be tribalistic </v>

1920
01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.140
<v Speaker 2>than religion or political affiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loosely,</v>

1921
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.180
<v Speaker 2>loosely understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1922
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1923
01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Dan Collins History podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like a 20 hour explanation </v>

1936
01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:12.260
<v Speaker 2>of the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so good.</v>

1937
01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.110
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about is when he's talking about</v>

1938
01:28:15.111 --> 01:28:20.111
<v Speaker 2>the Bulcans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying like when the bulcans </v>

1939
01:28:20.111 --> 01:28:23.530
<v Speaker 2>imploded in the 19 nineties and we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>the collapse of Yugoslavia and united </v>

1940
01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Bosnia and Serbia and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1941
01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:29.630
<v Speaker 2>you go there even to this day and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to a Bosnian Muslim,</v>

1942
01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.720
<v Speaker 2>will you talk to a Serb or you talk to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cro at about the problems that they've </v>

1943
01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:40.511
<v Speaker 2>endured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every single one of them will point </v>

1944
01:28:40.511 --> 01:28:43.751
<v Speaker 2>a finger at the other groups and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing this to us for so </v>

1945
01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:47.411
<v Speaker 2>long and that back in this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did that and then they did </v>

1946
01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:47.411
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they did that.</v>

1947
01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:47.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Israelis and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palestinians or something.</v>

1948
01:28:47.481 --> 01:28:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

1949
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:49.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>

1950
01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 2>fucking years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ancestors got massive,</v>

1951
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:52.010
<v Speaker 2>goodbye blahdy Blah.</v>

1952
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's so easy to think of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of aggrieved groups,</v>

1953
01:28:56.990 --> 01:29:00.440
<v Speaker 2>whether or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my problem with religion is,</v>

1954
01:29:00.441 --> 01:29:05.441
<v Speaker 2>and my problem with this is this is sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a weird parallel that I'm drawing </v>

1955
01:29:05.441 --> 01:29:06.210
<v Speaker 2>just as I'm sort of thinking this up </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1956
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:11.211
<v Speaker 2>But there is a parallel between jihadis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and social justice warriors in the sense</v>

1957
01:29:11.551 --> 01:29:16.551
<v Speaker 2>that they ate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're able to take an off the shelf </v>

1958
01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:19.590
<v Speaker 2>prepackaged kind of identity instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs about things and gain certainty </v>

1959
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:24.471
<v Speaker 2>from it and be part of a tribe and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of a community and be fighting the </v>

1960
01:29:24.471 --> 01:29:25.530
<v Speaker 2>good fight against people who disagree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

1961
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:28.170
<v Speaker 2>They'll hold beliefs that they believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>are objectionable.</v>

1962
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Whether that belief is that the west is </v>
<v Speaker 2>at war with Islam,</v>

1963
01:29:31.711 --> 01:29:33.270
<v Speaker 2>which is what your do you think that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

1964
01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 2>or whether the belief is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1965
01:29:36.061 --> 01:29:41.061
<v Speaker 2>that racist racism is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what social justice warriors </v>

1966
01:29:41.061 --> 01:29:44.301
<v Speaker 2>think that all white people think right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are these easy off the shelf </v>

1967
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:46.620
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think independently.</v>

1968
01:29:46.621 --> 01:29:47.040
<v Speaker 2>People</v>

1969
01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.880
<v Speaker 3>thinking independently is a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1970
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm with you on that one</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1971
01:29:52.670 --> 01:29:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Just the stories of the Jihad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see where you go in with it.</v>

1972
01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.140
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

1973
01:29:57.470 --> 01:30:02.470
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their worldviews that are self </v>

1974
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.630
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing and their cliques that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>soft supporting.</v>

1975
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to ask a lot of </v>

1976
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.870
<v Speaker 2>difficult questions.</v>

1977
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand what you're saying </v>

1978
01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.420
<v Speaker 3>in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think extreme liberalism is a a sense </v>

1979
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:15.820
<v Speaker 3>may like extreme conservatism is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion in a sense.</v>

1980
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1981
01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an ideology.</v>

1982
01:30:18.010 --> 01:30:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Ideologies are very dangerous ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have locked into a </v>

1983
01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:25.600
<v Speaker 3>predetermined pattern of thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to conform to,</v>

1984
01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I think becomes very problematic for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because the world is fluid.</v>

1985
01:30:28.961 --> 01:30:30.670
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on,</v>

1986
01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:35.680
<v Speaker 3>lot of weirdness to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that there's also an issue </v>

1987
01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.671
<v Speaker 3>in communication through language and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication through words and the </v>

1988
01:30:38.671 --> 01:30:39.700
<v Speaker 3>ability to express yourself through </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

1989
01:30:39.701 --> 01:30:41.800
<v Speaker 3>It's sometimes difficult because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do,</v>

1990
01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:47.040
<v Speaker 3>as you're trying to express intent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get someone to </v>

1991
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:47.830
<v Speaker 3>understand how you think and view things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're trying to say,</v>

1992
01:30:47.831 --> 01:30:52.831
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you express and view yourself </v>

1993
01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:52.831
<v Speaker 3>like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or why don't you see things?</v>

1994
01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:57.541
<v Speaker 3>How I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you're talking to someone who </v>

1995
01:30:57.541 --> 01:30:59.971
<v Speaker 3>has a completely different idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>those words mean and completely </v>

1996
01:30:59.971 --> 01:31:04.410
<v Speaker 3>different idea of the context of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular scenario that you're </v>

1997
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:04.900
<v Speaker 3>discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

1998
01:31:04.901 --> 01:31:05.680
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's clumsy.</v>

1999
01:31:05.681 --> 01:31:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that very difficult</v>

2000
01:31:06.970 --> 01:31:11.970
<v Speaker 2>because you've got this kind of platonic</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal in your head of what you want to </v>

2001
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:15.301
<v Speaker 2>communicate and then you have to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>rummage around in the scrabble bucket </v>

2002
01:31:15.301 --> 01:31:16.240
<v Speaker 2>for for the closest approximation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is</v>

2003
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:21.270
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to impart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why podcasts are so unique in a </v>

2004
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:24.040
<v Speaker 3>way because you know one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful things about it is that you do</v>

2005
01:31:24.041 --> 01:31:28.120
<v Speaker 3>sort of search for the correct way to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you hear us do this sometimes,</v>

2006
01:31:28.121 --> 01:31:32.410
<v Speaker 3>but this is like this is what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is we're just trying to figure out</v>

2007
01:31:32.411 --> 01:31:37.411
<v Speaker 3>what's the best way for me to express </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that I've got bouncing around </v>

2008
01:31:37.411 --> 01:31:38.670
<v Speaker 3>in my head where I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand how,</v>

2009
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.590
<v Speaker 3>how this thing sort of lays out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>

2010
01:31:41.591 --> 01:31:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Like how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I,</v>

2011
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:47.910
<v Speaker 3>how do I broadcast it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I get it out there in a way </v>

2012
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:50.731
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm actually saying what </v>

2013
01:31:50.731 --> 01:31:50.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually thinking instead of getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>outraged,</v>

2014
01:31:50.731 --> 01:31:52.810
<v Speaker 3>it's something that's not what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this meryl streep thing.</v>

2015
01:31:52.811 --> 01:31:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not what she meant.</v>

2016
01:31:54.071 --> 01:31:56.830
<v Speaker 3>She obviously didn't mean I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a slave,</v>

2017
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:58.980
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a black person in the 1800</v>

2018
01:31:59.210 --> 01:32:03.080
<v Speaker 2>clay and there are certain triggers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really hard for people to get beyond</v>

2019
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 2>in communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to find a way to get beyond </v>

2020
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:11.220
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the most pressing form of </v>

2021
01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:14.711
<v Speaker 2>communication that we have to grapple </v>
<v Speaker 2>with now is how do we speak to the </v>

2022
01:32:14.711 --> 01:32:19.331
<v Speaker 2>Muslim community and to one another </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Muslim community and about </v>

2023
01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:23.051
<v Speaker 2>jihadism without either being bigoted </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards Muslims or pretending that there</v>

2024
01:32:25.221 --> 01:32:30.221
<v Speaker 2>isn't a problem of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam that has some relationship to the </v>

2025
01:32:30.221 --> 01:32:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Muslim community and that has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the text of Islam.</v>

2026
01:32:31.341 --> 01:32:36.341
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the moment I say anything </v>

2027
01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:40.091
<v Speaker 2>remotely suggesting like the day after </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris,</v>

2028
01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:46.150
<v Speaker 2>how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dayne went on morning joe on Msnbc and </v>

2029
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:48.500
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are about as Muslim as I am.</v>

2030
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit,</v>

2031
01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's obviously not true.</v>

2032
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Are more Muslim there arguably a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>more Muslim than most Muslims.</v>

2033
01:32:56.721 --> 01:32:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are very phonetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim.</v>

2034
01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.220
<v Speaker 2>At least they think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2035
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 2>So we can't keep litigating whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not they're theologically correct or </v>

2036
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:10.391
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there is obviously a cancer at the </v>

2037
01:33:10.391 --> 01:33:12.170
<v Speaker 2>extremist fringe of Islam that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with and has to be talked about.</v>

2038
01:33:12.171 --> 01:33:17.171
<v Speaker 2>And the more we just talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the left talks about it in </v>

2039
01:33:17.171 --> 01:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>terms of well it's just a problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism in all faiths.</v>

2040
01:33:18.771 --> 01:33:23.771
<v Speaker 2>It's got nothing to do with the faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less able we are to actually have a </v>

2041
01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:26.570
<v Speaker 2>conversation about what needs to be done</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how to win over moderate Muslims and</v>

2042
01:33:26.571 --> 01:33:28.640
<v Speaker 2>how not to alienate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if we,</v>

2043
01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.760
<v Speaker 2>if tolerant people can't talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the only people talking about the </v>

2044
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.250
<v Speaker 2>problem a right wing xenophobes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascists.</v>

2045
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we have to do is find a way </v>

2046
01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:43.610
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about like those off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shelf ideologies,</v>

2047
01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.570
<v Speaker 2>whether it's jihadism or Social Justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>Warrior Ism,</v>

2048
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:52.390
<v Speaker 2>we have to find a way to win over </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate Muslims and make them not feel </v>

2049
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:54.230
<v Speaker 2>like they're being alienated and judged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to not be,</v>

2050
01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:59.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending southwest flights back to the </v>

2051
01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:01.211
<v Speaker 2>gate as it were the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because two people were speaking Arabic </v>

2052
01:34:01.211 --> 01:34:03.380
<v Speaker 2>and watching a video about what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on in like the wake of the Paris attacks</v>

2053
01:34:03.381 --> 01:34:06.410
<v Speaker 2>or something and people freaked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't know who I think will</v>

2054
01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Arab is a terrorist or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to make sure that doesn't </v>

2055
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.961
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't have that not happen as </v>

2056
01:34:13.961 --> 01:34:15.920
<v Speaker 2>long as everyone is pretending that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a problem with Islam,</v>

2057
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:22.330
<v Speaker 2>right at the edge of Islam and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how to have that conversation </v>

2058
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:23.360
<v Speaker 2>without sounding like I'm intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep</v>

2059
01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.760
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's gotTa.</v>

2060
01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Keep talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The arguments against it come up.</v>

2061
01:34:26.931 --> 01:34:30.290
<v Speaker 3>You talk about the arguments against it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just just takes time.</v>

2062
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:35.500
<v Speaker 3>I really do believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it just takes a lot of </v>

2063
01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.811
<v Speaker 3>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes a lot of communication and the </v>

2064
01:34:37.811 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 3>clumsy type of communication that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get through language through,</v>

2065
01:34:38.690 --> 01:34:41.540
<v Speaker 3>through talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the more this happens,</v>

2066
01:34:41.541 --> 01:34:46.541
<v Speaker 3>the more this gets discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more people gained an understanding </v>

2067
01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:49.480
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we were looking at people aging or </v>

2068
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.031
<v Speaker 3>like trees growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a slow process that in the middle </v>

2069
01:34:52.031 --> 01:34:55.720
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like any progress is </v>

2070
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:55.720
<v Speaker 3>happening at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately,</v>

2071
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.050
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the world today versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world of 10 years ago,</v>

2072
01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.200
<v Speaker 3>you see a big difference between what Al</v>
<v Speaker 3>Franken was able to publish with that </v>

2073
01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 3>book and what you're able to get away </v>
<v Speaker 3>with today.</v>

2074
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:06.590
<v Speaker 3>And I think that sort of in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better analogy,</v>

2075
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.080
<v Speaker 3>it highlights the growth that's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2076
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.580
<v Speaker 3>It highlights this very strange era that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're currently experiencing.</v>

2077
01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:18.880
<v Speaker 3>And with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's end this and do your podcast so </v>

2078
01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:18.880
<v Speaker 3>that we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get to.</v>

2079
01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 3>We're going to keep talking folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to end this because I got to</v>

2080
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:25.241

<v Speaker 3>but we're going to do an episode of we </v>
