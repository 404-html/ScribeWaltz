<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>so this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

99
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

101
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 2>must be able to the bean dust or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then it.</v>

102
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.780

<v Speaker 2>turned it off.</v>

106
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

107
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not supposed to blend </v>

108
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It smelled up the whole house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

119
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.250
<v Speaker 2>If you want to start a fire near a cave </v>
<v Speaker 2>man and he had a Blendtec blender,</v>

120
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:11.910
<v Speaker 2>that's what you would do.</v>

121
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.300
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome for celery though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that if fox salary up </v>

122
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.020
<v Speaker 3>salary and Kale and cucumbers because it</v>

<v Speaker 3>Shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

125
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.480
<v Speaker 3>There's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really what it is is like a ridiculously</v>

126
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:29.481
<v Speaker 3>powered blender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's ridiculous and it has like </v>

127
00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:29.481
<v Speaker 3>little cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes on,</v>

128
00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I make that bulletproof </v>

129
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.180
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my kids run out of the room because </v>

130
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.180
<v Speaker 3>they're scared of the noise because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

131

<v Speaker 3>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

132
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 3>You should probably have like a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>shield in front of you.</v>

133
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

185
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 3>countries with very unusual last names </v>

186
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.580
<v Speaker 3>Negra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of pressure,</v>

187
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:13.581
<v Speaker 3>they must have changed our name to </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that the American people can </v>

188
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:15.720
<v Speaker 3>pronounce a sloppy ass bitches I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

189
00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:19.350
<v Speaker 3>So I the worst is virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard virgin many times.</v>

190
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.110
<v Speaker 3>Salto when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were a virgin,</v>

191
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:24.510
<v Speaker 3>was that painful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt bad.</v>

192
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Matt is a professional poker player and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a friend of our friend.</v>

193
00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Aubrey's and a Alpha brain enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess you,</v>

194
00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:39.591
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently he said that you help like </v>

195
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:39.690
<v Speaker 3>fighters sometimes with their mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>game planning.</v>

196
00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have two fighters right now,</v>

197
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Martin Kelman and calmly that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked with.</v>

198
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 3>So I basically just focused on getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>them present mentally before their </v>

199
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 3>fights because poker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

200
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

201
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Speaker 3>please go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because poker is basically like 95 </v>

202
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.290
<v Speaker 3>percent mental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've found ways to prepare myself</v>

203
00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it helps with mma because it's </v>

204
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.480
<v Speaker 4>pure competition and if you're not there</v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally,</v>

205
00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:02.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter how good you are,</v>

206
00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:04.900
<v Speaker 4>you can get caught really easy if you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not paying attention.</v>

207
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a subtle aspect to a,</v>

208
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.880
<v Speaker 1>to fighting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people aren't aware of </v>

209
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.640
<v Speaker 1>the fact that a guy can look exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same and be moving up,</v>

210
00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:20.681
<v Speaker 1>but he could have lapses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's mental lapses that happened in </v>

211
00:09:20.681 --> 00:09:23.651
<v Speaker 1>some guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those mental lapses sort of defined </v>

212
00:09:23.651 --> 00:09:23.660
<v Speaker 1>their careers because they have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>talent,</v>

213
00:09:23.661 --> 00:09:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

214
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:25.970
<v Speaker 1>they can never put it together.</v>

215
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.900
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

216
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:29.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you get caught with one </v>
<v Speaker 4>submission,</v>

217
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:31.220
<v Speaker 4>just one second off you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be out,</v>

218
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be tapping and it's the same </v>

219
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.171
<v Speaker 4>thing with poker that's wives saw the </v>
<v Speaker 4>both were kind of correlated and I </v>

220
00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:38.171
<v Speaker 4>wanted to do something new and </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

221
00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:40.820
<v Speaker 4>That hasn't really been done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did you get brought in on this?</v>

222
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.570
<v Speaker 4>On which the coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

223
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:47.600
<v Speaker 4>one day I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually was watching Martin fight and</v>

224
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

225
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.890
<v Speaker 4>a lapse in his eyes where he was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking one way and then he was kind of </v>

226
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.610
<v Speaker 4>lackadaisical for a minute and it got </v>
<v Speaker 4>put away and I was like,</v>

227
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.760
<v Speaker 4>which was after Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tiago,</v>

228
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:00.610
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

229
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one after policy I'll go.</v>

230
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:04.850
<v Speaker 4>He had a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one,</v>

231
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.760
<v Speaker 4>it was his first loss out of his three </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he had.</v>

232
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.010
<v Speaker 4>He had three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you had two wins.</v>

233
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Do you know which one that was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really remember.</v>

234
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

235
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.320
<v Speaker 4>well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

236
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.690
<v Speaker 4>I saw him kind of like get out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the moment.</v>

237
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:22.691
<v Speaker 4>I saw like I can see it in people's eyes</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually because playing poker you can </v>

238
00:10:22.691 --> 00:10:22.691
<v Speaker 4>kind of see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

239
00:10:22.691 --> 00:10:24.790
<v Speaker 4>so I contacted him on facebook and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

240
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.750
<v Speaker 4>we met about three months later and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

241
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.500
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do this.</v>

242
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Speaker 4>I've never done it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

243
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.680
<v Speaker 4>would you like to be the first?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

244
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:31.340
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

245
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.680
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you brought up that you saw </v>

246
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:36.680
<v Speaker 1>that to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he resist it?</v>

247
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Did he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he agree with you?</v>

248
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

249
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of times this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>

250
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard issue for fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very emotionally attached to </v>

251
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 1>their work and so if you'll say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

252
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got this,</v>

253
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 1>you got to be careful with the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your chin,</v>

254
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.640
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to do something about </v>

255
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.951
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you say that like they'll get </v>

256
00:10:57.951 --> 00:11:00.830
<v Speaker 1>angry at you and it's almost like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to keep their chin up to show that </v>

257
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:00.830
<v Speaker 1>you are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just their ego.</v>

258
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It is a weird thing though with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fighters.</v>

259
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

260
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 1>a guy who is a professional poker </v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

261
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a non fighter goes,</v>

262
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as to say that you saw the actual</v>

263
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>moment where a guy like Martin Kampmann </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a fucking professional killer,</v>

264
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.920
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean mark kamins bad motherfuckers.</v>

265
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>So for you to like bring that up and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to accept it,</v>

266
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows that he's a smart dude.</v>

267
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

268
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>aware guy and that's why he's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been very open</v>

270
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.390
<v Speaker 4>when he's able to step outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself and learn things that you know,</v>

271
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.190
<v Speaker 4>that most people wouldn't consider </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning.</v>

272
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:39.020
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's really important for </v>
<v Speaker 4>growth,</v>

273
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a fighter or you know,</v>

274
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.660
<v Speaker 4>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call it.</v>

275
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Well he got caught by Johnny Hendricks </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his last fight.</v>

276
00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:48.250
<v Speaker 1>But you know what man at first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy can catch anybody like that.</v>

277
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.480
<v Speaker 1>We didn't work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His last fight,</v>

278
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.700
<v Speaker 1>we worked for his three win streak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We work</v>

279
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 4>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We actually kind of had a disagreement </v>

280
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 4>on pricing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we didn't work together.</v>

281
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 4>The last one,</v>

282
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.930
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible thing to happen.</v>

283
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

285
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say that.</v>

286
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.900
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't talk about what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it actually was.</v>

287
00:12:05.901 --> 00:12:08.510
<v Speaker 4>It was just the disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a fair to Mr Kamin sure.</v>

288
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.810
<v Speaker 4>That sucks.</v>

290
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.940

352
00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:43.640
<v Speaker 4>hardly cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

353
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.030
<v Speaker 4>See you were talking earlier about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

354
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.860
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tell a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

355
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.520
<v Speaker 4>that as a killer what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I try to separate the two completely</v>

356
00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:52.960
<v Speaker 4>because I'm a big MMA fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've watched like every UFC for probably</v>

357
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 4>four years and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

358
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 4>I like as much as I want to chime in </v>
<v Speaker 4>about technique or whatever.</v>

359
00:14:58.431 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 4>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

360
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.160
<v Speaker 4>that's just not my right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's expert.</v>

361
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

362
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:05.240
<v Speaker 4>So I try to keep it separate.</v>

363
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.550
<v Speaker 3>You're just concentrating on them having</v>
<v Speaker 3>a winning mindset.</v>

364
00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:13.551
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want them to get to beating the </v>

365
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:13.551
<v Speaker 3>winning everything</v>

366
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:13.551
<v Speaker 4>on their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get off their mind.</v>

367
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 4>I want them to just deal with anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they might be thinking about,</v>

368
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 4>whether it be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's my next I want.</v>

369
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.100
<v Speaker 4>I want them to stay present.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want them to think too much </v>

370
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.201
<v Speaker 4>about the past or the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want them to just be right there for </v>

371
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:26.201
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the only thing that matters.</v>

372
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 4>That's my goal.</v>

373
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.720
<v Speaker 3>And how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you address their,</v>

374
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.000
<v Speaker 3>what they normally think about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

375
00:15:33.001 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 3>when sometimes like big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

376
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:39.210
<v Speaker 3>I've always seen with fighters one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst,</v>

377
00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:42.090
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend problems when fighters </v>
<v Speaker 3>have girlfriend problems.</v>

378
00:15:42.091 --> 00:15:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when shit goes bad like that can,</v>

379
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.270
<v Speaker 3>that can signify like a huge skid in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their career.</v>

380
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.020
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

381
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

382
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.320
<v Speaker 4>both of the fighters are happily </v>
<v Speaker 4>married,</v>

383
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.380
<v Speaker 4>so that's not an issue for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how I would probably tackle it,</v>

384
00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to get that stuff off your </v>

385
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

386
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 4>you can feel like that's taking over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

387
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.671
<v Speaker 4>when you break up with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just feels like you can't get away </v>

388
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:04.671
<v Speaker 4>from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

389
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time it's just because </v>

390
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.681
<v Speaker 4>you've never faced that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've never really faced it down and </v>

391
00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:09.681
<v Speaker 4>you kind of just push it aside and put </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in the back of your mind.</v>

392
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 4>But the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way to really do it,</v>

393
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:12.330
<v Speaker 4>it's just address it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

394
00:16:12.331 --> 00:16:14.490
<v Speaker 4>go back to exactly what happened and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just deal with it,</v>

395
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a man</v>

396
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.050
<v Speaker 3>and new pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

397
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.750
<v Speaker 3>And it's also very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot try to like,</v>

398
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.810
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to get my own shit </v>

399
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:24.810
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop,</v>

400
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:24.970
<v Speaker 3>go get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you crazy?</v>

401
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying go fall in love,</v>

402
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.680
<v Speaker 3>but go get your freak on best medicine </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

403
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With someone who would also like to get </v>

404
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:34.740
<v Speaker 3>the freak out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

405
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Mutually beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that needs to be recognized that it is </v>

406
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:38.130
<v Speaker 3>mutually beneficial and that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why it's any good.</v>

407
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:43.050
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand their point of view </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't understand are part of </v>

408
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.730
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true in medicine.</v>

409
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Puts it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can die from if you take it with the</v>

410
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:47.260
<v Speaker 3>wrong things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

411
00:16:47.261 --> 00:16:51.100
<v Speaker 3>You definitely die and or just ruin your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and wish you were dead.</v>

412
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sometimes worse.</v>

413
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes pussies worse than suicide.</v>

414
00:16:55.991 --> 00:17:00.991
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Red Dye and the Jelly </v>

415
00:17:00.991 --> 00:17:00.991
<v Speaker 3>Bean.</v>

416
00:17:00.991 --> 00:17:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know that one new to just can't </v>

417
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:03.010
<v Speaker 3>keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to girls,</v>

418
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.560
<v Speaker 3>you know the guy's a little chicks </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominate their life and yell at them and</v>

419
00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:10.561
<v Speaker 3>tell them what to do and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a spooky thing when you see that </v>

420
00:17:10.561 --> 00:17:11.350
<v Speaker 3>kind of shit happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it becomes really real for them.</v>

421
00:17:11.351 --> 00:17:16.351
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I try to think of it as </v>

422
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:17.731
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that serious really in the </v>

423
00:17:17.731 --> 00:17:17.731
<v Speaker 3>scheme of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really that serious.</v>

424
00:17:17.731 --> 00:17:21.511
<v Speaker 3>It is to them in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that moment it is separation anxiety </v>

425
00:17:21.511 --> 00:17:21.520
<v Speaker 3>and it's just as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

426
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:22.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for uh,</v>

427
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women that are involved with crazy </v>

428
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.491
<v Speaker 3>fucked up men too that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominate your life probably even more </v>

429
00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:33.360
<v Speaker 3>worse because it's scary physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the threat of physical violence is </v>

430
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:33.460
<v Speaker 3>much more prevalent.</v>

431
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.650
<v Speaker 4>It's especially if they try to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>what to do with your life and their life</v>

432
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:41.651
<v Speaker 4>is kind of in shambles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of people want to give </v>

433
00:17:41.651 --> 00:17:41.651
<v Speaker 4>advice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

434
00:17:41.651 --> 00:17:44.321
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they don't have their shit </v>

435
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:44.321
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

436
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:44.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hilarious.</v>

437
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:46.150
<v Speaker 3>But this is related on twitter today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some dude sent me some,</v>

438
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.800
<v Speaker 3>a thing on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some comment about how I,</v>

439
00:17:50.801 --> 00:17:52.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to uh,</v>

440
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.750
<v Speaker 3>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like,</v>

441
00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I need to like take a dose of my </v>

442
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 3>own medicine or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them,</v>

443
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those sort of things.</v>

444
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.060
<v Speaker 3>So I'd go and look at his twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>profile real quick.</v>

445
00:18:04.061 --> 00:18:09.061
<v Speaker 3>And his last tweet was about how he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed coming off of a coke binge.</v>

446
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.280
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

447
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.400
<v Speaker 3>do you think that like you should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving advice to someone about how they </v>

448
00:18:18.561 --> 00:18:23.561
<v Speaker 3>should think like we're 30 seconds ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about coming off some </v>

449
00:18:23.621 --> 00:18:26.930
<v Speaker 3>off your first year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can say something that doesn't</v>

450
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:29.120
<v Speaker 3>seem like the type of person should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>given that advice.</v>

451
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:34.780
<v Speaker 5>I found out that liquid coke was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know how the liquid coke they're </v>

452
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.961
<v Speaker 5>using that they're also using it because</v>
<v Speaker 5>girls can put it in them and squirting </v>

453
00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:40.370
<v Speaker 5>their pussies before sex and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>buttholes and it numbs it down.</v>

454
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.110
<v Speaker 5>So you can just go to town on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you put it in your Dick Hole,</v>

455
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 5>it feels like you have the biggest dick </v>
<v Speaker 5>hole in the whole entire world.</v>

456
00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:50.540
<v Speaker 5>Like the bones just gonna slide out like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hot dog.</v>

457
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.280
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds terrible.</v>

458
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just gave people an idea.</v>

459
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.140
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine getting so fucked up </v>

460
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.160
<v Speaker 5>with regular sex?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to shoot coke in your Dick?</v>

<v Speaker 5>part,</v>

464
00:19:12.561 --> 00:19:16.280
<v Speaker 5>like stretching your whole life to fit </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole nose thing of the nose spray,</v>

465
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.020
<v Speaker 5>which is that what you would use on your</v>
<v Speaker 5>nose,</v>

466
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.700
<v Speaker 5>nasal spray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a nasal spray,</v>

467
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.730
<v Speaker 5>and I guess a saline solution so it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>used for your eyes,</v>

468
00:19:22.731 --> 00:19:24.590
<v Speaker 5>so your Dick cries all the time so it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>

469
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.510
<v Speaker 5>but then eventually their pussy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>asshole is going to start being numb and</v>

470
00:19:29.511 --> 00:19:31.010
<v Speaker 5>then we're going to be in a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>pain.</v>

471
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.690
<v Speaker 5>They probably going to have infections </v>
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

472
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 5>That's all I'd be thinking about why </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're doing it,</v>

473
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 5>but like she can't even feel this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What Joey Dee dee is it just cleans it </v>

474
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 5>right out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

475
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.860
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joey Diaz is not even a human.</v>

476
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.550
<v Speaker 5>So what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The laws that apply to normal humans.</v>

477
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.070
<v Speaker 5>Just think about what Joe has done and </v>
<v Speaker 5>here he is,</v>

478
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:49.880
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Healthy,</v>

479
00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:54.881
<v Speaker 5>still alive and made a baby recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now stop and think about the average </v>

480
00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 5>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they go through Joey Diaz,</v>

481
00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:58.730
<v Speaker 5>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you had to go through Joey Diaz his</v>

482
00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:00.740
<v Speaker 5>life and take all the drugs that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>took?</v>

483
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.750
<v Speaker 5>Find yourself in all the situations you </v>
<v Speaker 5>find.</v>

484
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.530
<v Speaker 5>Good luck reaching 50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good luck reaching where Joey is,</v>

485
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.230
<v Speaker 5>but you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he's not even human.</v>

486
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.660
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gave Joey Diaz is live to 100 </v>

487
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:15.660
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ninety nine</v>

499
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.320
<v Speaker 5>It feels like you're sitting on a really</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard rock.</v>

500
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying if he's on one side of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>plan,</v>

<v Speaker 5>bitch out.</v>

502
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.200
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

503
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.970
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a solid guy and his head is </v>

507
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.060
<v Speaker 1>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which a problem.</v>

508
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:07.170
<v Speaker 1>You try to lose some weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing with dudes like my </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is also a giant head.</v>

511
00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Like if that was on a normal person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

512
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you get really big,</v>

513
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.080
<v Speaker 1>if you get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>certain dudes they get like incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>obese will everything grows and then </v>

515
00:21:24.441 --> 00:21:27.100
<v Speaker 1>when they bring their body in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they lose the weight,</v>

516
00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:29.900
<v Speaker 1>it looks very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's going on?</v>

517
00:21:29.901 --> 00:21:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Like why is his head's so big?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

518
00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:32.690

<v Speaker 1>just unusual for me or why?</v>

520
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.880
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

521
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a sad thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone who's,</v>

522
00:21:40.881 --> 00:21:42.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost their marbles so bad,</v>

523
00:21:42.711 --> 00:21:45.140
<v Speaker 1>the eat themselves into oblivion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

524
00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 1>when you read about like people that get</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in trailers and they got to cut a </v>

525
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.310
<v Speaker 1>hole through the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull their couch out in,</v>

526
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 1>bedded into the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked to know that people can go </v>

527
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 1>that far off the rails.</v>

528
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever watch Dr Oz?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched it before.</v>

529
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.180
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not that bad.</v>

530
00:22:02.181 --> 00:22:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty interesting.</v>

531
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.230
<v Speaker 2>He seems like he's pretty legit.</v>

532
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like he's a bad guy,</v>

533
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

534
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.490
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're not like super </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgmental and like tough guy.</v>

535
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:16.760
<v Speaker 1>He liked doctor Phil is on occasion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

536
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

537
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

538
00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to help people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get your act together.</v>

539
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 1>That's not how you help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

540
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nonsense.</v>

541
00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing be rating them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television but he doesn't seem like that</v>

542
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:33.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

543
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 1>he's a medical doctor to actual real </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor.</v>

544
00:22:35.861 --> 00:22:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

545
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just watching Dr Oz.</v>

546
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:41.210
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got really baked and it was,</v>

547
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 2>he has this thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

548
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three out of four people are super tired</v>

549
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 2>and there it's because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough of this one medicine or,</v>

550
00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:51.490
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or nutrient or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

551
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.200
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

552
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.350
<v Speaker 2>they brought these three women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman was,</v>

553
00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.380
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can fix all your shit using this one </v>

554
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 2>thing that you have to take every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Multiple Times a day and they're like,</v>

555
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because I have four kids,</v>

556
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:08.011
<v Speaker 2>I have to wake up every morning at six </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do this and this and this is like </v>

557
00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:08.011
<v Speaker 2>vitamin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's magnesium and,</v>

558
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.240
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

559
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:14.241
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should get on top of magnesium </v>

560
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:15.871
<v Speaker 2>because he said the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they don't have it in daily </v>

561
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:18.181
<v Speaker 2>multivitamins because it be so big of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pill because you have to take it all day</v>

562
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>long so you have to get out of food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like certain food,</v>

563
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.180
<v Speaker 2>like bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinach,</v>

564
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.540
<v Speaker 2>a Chenwa and all that stuff that has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high amount of it and it.</v>

565
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:31.541
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't have any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just running on empty and your </v>

566
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:31.541
<v Speaker 2>body has to like freak out and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get irritable.</v>

567
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:34.240
<v Speaker 2>That's when you're just like tired and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatigue all the time.</v>

568
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if there's a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have magnesium every day easy,</v>

569
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big thing.</v>

570
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the stuff that,</v>

572
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:48.781

<v Speaker 1>Conte gut also says is a natural </v>

573
00:23:48.781 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 1>testosterone booster or one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective ones.</v>

574
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:50.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd take that over.</v>

575

<v Speaker 3>Defend is a,</v>

583
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.300
<v Speaker 1>that it's possible that they could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in there.</v>

584
00:24:07.301 --> 00:24:08.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody makes their own little,</v>

585
00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:11.680
<v Speaker 1>a nutritional supplement sorta </v>
<v Speaker 1>concoctions.</v>

586
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

587
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.280
<v Speaker 1>zinc is also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

588
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a healthy mineral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

589
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like your body should have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway and we should.</v>

590
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit that we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>take man,</v>

591
00:24:23.321 --> 00:24:28.321
<v Speaker 1>that we don't take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people just like barely get the </v>

592
00:24:28.321 --> 00:24:30.960
<v Speaker 1>amount of required daily vitamins in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their diet and most people are not </v>

593
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.411
<v Speaker 1>taking vitamin supplements and then most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not eating that much </v>

594
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:34.411
<v Speaker 1>vegetables either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

595
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:38.101
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are rolling the fucking dice with </v>

596
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:38.101
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

597
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you got to give your body nutrients if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't give your body nutrients.</v>

598
00:24:40.031 --> 00:24:42.760
<v Speaker 1>It just fucking misfires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And w the why.</v>

599
00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:47.761
<v Speaker 1>Intelligent people neglect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me drives me nuts because you </v>

600
00:24:47.761 --> 00:24:49.420
<v Speaker 1>can do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen me eat,</v>

601
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I eat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat shit.</v>

602
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat cheeseburgers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go off.</v>

603
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.320
<v Speaker 1>But I also supplement the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

604
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I make sure I'm always taken vitamins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the most part when I'm not </v>

605
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.820
<v Speaker 1>eating a fucking pastrami sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will eat really healthy.</v>

606
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.350
<v Speaker 1>So I'll allow myself these like French </v>
<v Speaker 1>fry binges and shit.</v>

607
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.300
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part I'm eating really </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

608
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.280
<v Speaker 2>But if you really stone watching Dr Oz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like okay,</v>

609
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 2>this woman says she eats healthiest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heck she has the greatest diet ever.</v>

610
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 2>She's just tired all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other girl was like,</v>

611
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have 15 kids.</v>

612
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat normal.</v>

613
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably have enough.</v>

614
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Magnesium is probably not magnesium and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not like a 25 year old crack addict,</v>

615
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:26.540
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

616
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just like blew it off.</v>

617
00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Like all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

618
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 2>see magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the secret?</v>

619
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 2>And then he moves onto this next girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

620
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't poop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried everything.</v>

621
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I tried yogurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try fruit and stuff like that.</v>

622
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

623
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you need to try live culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yogurt and raspberries.</v>

624
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 2>And she's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just said,</v>

625
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I've tried yogurt and fruits and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

626
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:43.970
<v Speaker 2>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move on.</v>

627
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm Dr Oz to Dr Oz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just a bunch of little fails.</v>

628
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 2>He has good advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the shows is a bunch of little fails</v>

629
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I highly recommend watching Dr.</v>

630
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I was super stoked.</v>

631
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

632
00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if there's a collection of Dr </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oz's fails and if that sounds okay.</v>

633
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Not like half the time it's the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>even say anything.</v>

634
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.170
<v Speaker 2>You could just tell by their faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

635
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.080
<v Speaker 2>I just told you fruit in.</v>

636
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I think I got something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There can be something really wrong with</v>

637
00:26:13.241 --> 00:26:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you when there's some people they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do poop transplants.</v>

638
00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:21.461
<v Speaker 3>So have you heard of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you take my picture and put it in </v>

639
00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:21.461
<v Speaker 3>your butt wherever?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

640
00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not joking.</v>

641
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether they do it between family </v>

642
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:27.640
<v Speaker 3>members.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really interesting question.</v>

643
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

644
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is true.</v>

645
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.120
<v Speaker 3>They need fecal transplants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they think of next?</v>

646
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I think fucking saves people's lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

647
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

648
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Science as a mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

649
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just they're always coming up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some incredible shit that just makes you</v>

650
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did this even happen?</v>

651
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

652
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I always find interesting to look back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be like,</v>

653
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:49.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

654
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time ago,</v>

655
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 3>lobotomies were considered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

656
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

657
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Like how it changes how science changes.</v>

658
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

659
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 3>our bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

660
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't really do that anymore.</v>

661
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I would like to think that we're way </v>
<v Speaker 3>past that.</v>

662
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:07.500
<v Speaker 3>I would like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're way past the law bottomy stage.</v>

663
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:13.010
<v Speaker 3>I would like to think that they pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>much know exactly what everything does </v>

664
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.360
<v Speaker 3>as far as like what the negative health </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit or repercussions are.</v>

665
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.100
<v Speaker 3>But then you see pharmaceutical drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you find out that's not really the </v>

666
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.591
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see like every week some new thing </v>

667
00:27:24.591 --> 00:27:27.361
<v Speaker 3>gets fucking yanked off the shelves from</v>
<v Speaker 3>recall signs of maybe they did do a lot </v>

668
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:32.901
<v Speaker 3>of good though too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of people that are </v>

669
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:35.181
<v Speaker 3>alive because of pharmaceutical drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of people that they have </v>

670
00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:36.990
<v Speaker 3>illnesses and they literally keeps them </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

671
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had back surgery a couple years ago </v>

672
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 3>and the pain pills they have are </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

673
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Like I had shit no after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

674
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.110
<v Speaker 3>after I healed up I got off on.</v>

675
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.380
<v Speaker 3>But like before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

676
00:27:50.381 --> 00:27:50.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

677
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Actually I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to get off them.</v>

678
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

679
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to quit cold Turkey and I got </v>

680
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.060
<v Speaker 3>physically ill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my whole body just felt like I </v>

681
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.060
<v Speaker 3>wanted to die and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

682
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.060
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

683
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.030
<v Speaker 3>I better weaned myself off and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just did like two and then one.</v>

684
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 3>And what specifically were you taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hydrocodone?</v>

685
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it was hydrocodone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the same as Oxycontin or </v>

686
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 3>oxycodone is what it's called and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds kind of someone.</v>

687
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:16.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a doctor.</v>

688
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

689
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:19.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an opiate based hoping it will be a</v>

690
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 3>base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that will mess your body.</v>

691
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Like I can understand why people get </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted because like I said,</v>

692
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I tried to get off and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole body was like wanting to die.</v>

693
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just,</v>

694
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:29.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

695
00:28:29.851 --> 00:28:34.851
<v Speaker 3>you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets attached to your stuff </v>

696
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:34.851
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

697
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:34.851
<v Speaker 3>Kinda like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

698
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Spiderman,</v>

699
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Velma was that the black van them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

700
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like that.</v>

701
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:43.281
<v Speaker 3>Like it just Kinda Tanya isn't crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they just trust that people are </v>

702
00:28:43.281 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 3>going to have the willpower to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>through those.</v>

703
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is crazy.</v>

704
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.040
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts that they're allowing people </v>

705
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.741
<v Speaker 3>to become junkies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally anything like that that </v>

706
00:28:54.741 --> 00:28:54.741
<v Speaker 3>can get a normal look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

707
00:28:54.741 --> 00:28:57.690
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people that could get </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to almost anything.</v>

708
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.680
<v Speaker 3>They have a mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mental issue,</v>

709
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 3>but there's a physical addiction is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different story.</v>

710
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 3>You're not talking about some weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like washing your hands or playing</v>

711
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:13.461
<v Speaker 3>poker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about something crazy </v>

712
00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:13.980
<v Speaker 3>where you've gotten your body physically</v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted.</v>

713
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.760
<v Speaker 3>This for its new system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the system,</v>

714
00:29:17.761 --> 00:29:20.490
<v Speaker 3>the system is heroin and terrorists runs</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

715
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have some business chick </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a clip was got a clipboard in </v>

716
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 3>their hand and she's like leading on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tour through your body.</v>

717
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 3>We started incorporating heroine three </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

718
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Without it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we die,</v>

719
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is where the heroin comes in.</v>

720
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:34.140
<v Speaker 3>These are holes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See this,</v>

721
00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:39.141
<v Speaker 3>this is called gang green's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to you on 10 to your </v>

722
00:29:39.141 --> 00:29:41.570
<v Speaker 3>holes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you get someone hooked on something </v>

723
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard for them to stop.</v>

724
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why it's the most evil thing in the</v>

725
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 1>world to be selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like that.</v>

726
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:55.020
<v Speaker 1>knowing that this must be alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand there's some people that </v>

728
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 1>are in intense pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially people that are about to die,</v>

729
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it'd be good for that.</v>

730
00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part,</v>

731
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:00.040
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

732
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people don't need it.</v>

733
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.480
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't give them the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't eat it.</v>

734
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you engineer your back?</v>

735
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a genetic thing basically,</v>

736
00:30:11.131 --> 00:30:16.131
<v Speaker 4>like out of pineal cyst on my tailbone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I had to get it like a 12 inch </v>

737
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.850
<v Speaker 4>portion of my back taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sucks.</v>

738
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all healed now.</v>

739
00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:23.250
<v Speaker 4>But it was terrible for like 60.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were a foot taller than you are now,</v>

740
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 4>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was actually eight feet and six </v>

741
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 4>inches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three years.</v>

742
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.460
<v Speaker 4>He was like a foot shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

743
00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:31.050
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't let me play in the NBA </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

744
00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.120
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

745
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.650
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this how you got involved with,</v>

746
00:30:37.651 --> 00:30:39.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

747
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.960
<v Speaker 1>like mind over body type shit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place because you were like that </v>

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.410
<v Speaker 1>what's up John Sarno was this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

750
00:30:49.411 --> 00:30:54.411
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor that believes there's a mind </v>

751
00:30:54.411 --> 00:30:54.660
<v Speaker 1>body connection with back injuries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>

752
00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard?</v>

753
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have now.</v>

754
00:30:56.631 --> 00:30:57.490
<v Speaker 4>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

755
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.010
<v Speaker 4>what do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe you do.</v>

756
00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.810
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

757
00:30:59.811 --> 00:31:01.280
<v Speaker 4>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

758
00:31:01.281 --> 00:31:06.281
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I didn't have much support </v>

759
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:07.340
<v Speaker 4>back then and I think that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bank is support in your life.</v>

760
00:31:07.341 --> 00:31:10.100
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for me it's real.</v>

761
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

762
00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.620
<v Speaker 4>That's how I feel at least.</v>

763
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 1>So you have this injury you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>repaired?</v>

764
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how long did it take before you were</v>

765
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:18.350
<v Speaker 1>like 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

766
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:22.410
<v Speaker 4>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm five months of,</v>

767
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.880
<v Speaker 4>of basically nothingness.</v>

768
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you all these questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just discovered recently have </v>

769
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:29.670
<v Speaker 1>a bulging disc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bulging disc in my back.</v>

770
00:31:29.671 --> 00:31:33.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really bad.</v>

771
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I can still do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do kickboxing and no problem.</v>

772
00:31:36.871 --> 00:31:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I do all these strength and conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises.</v>

773
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:44.210
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem only comes when I do Jujitsu </v>

774
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.691
<v Speaker 1>and I get my head yanked on that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say that again when you're </v>

775
00:31:47.691 --> 00:31:50.631
<v Speaker 1>defending from something it's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the middle of my back and it's </v>

776
00:31:50.631 --> 00:31:53.300
<v Speaker 1>hustle found out to my posture is dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit most was already.</v>

777
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to sit up straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>

778
00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:01.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I sit like this all the time </v>

779
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.190
<v Speaker 1>and apparently that's bad.</v>

780
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm the exact same way and I feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like doing this because it feels </v>

781
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 4>like I'm just putting out my boobs saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>the boy looks at it.</v>

782
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially I'm trying to look less </v>

783
00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:08.781
<v Speaker 4>Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not more Jewish.</v>

784
00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:09.800
<v Speaker 4>This makes me look more Douchey,</v>

785
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.730
<v Speaker 1>like sitting straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can be more chill like this,</v>

786
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:17.731
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is like way better for your </v>

787
00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:17.731
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit Straight.</v>

788
00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:22.231
<v Speaker 1>But then someone said this is John Sarno</v>
<v Speaker 1>book and then I should read it so I </v>

789
00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't really shouldn't comment until</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it,</v>

790
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not in pain like all the time.</v>

791
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:29.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing to try to describe to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because it's like saying,</v>

792
00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:31.300
<v Speaker 1>well it only hurts when I do two digits </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they'll just say,</v>

793
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 1>don't do Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're saying,</v>

794
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:38.071
<v Speaker 1>but it's don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is not really that much of an </v>

795
00:32:38.071 --> 00:32:40.591
<v Speaker 1>option for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been annoying that I haven't been </v>

796
00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.571
<v Speaker 1>able to do it regularly for the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>five months while this thing has been </v>

797
00:32:42.571 --> 00:32:45.731
<v Speaker 1>healing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying all sorts of different </v>

798
00:32:45.731 --> 00:32:45.731
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

799
00:32:45.731 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a real injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's the weird thing.</v>

800
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone says it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

801
00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.070
<v Speaker 1>senior mine man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it may manifest the same.</v>

802
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like it may manifest itself</v>

803
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about it where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have issues in that area.</v>

804
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:59.351
<v Speaker 1>But who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's hard though because it </v>

805
00:32:59.351 --> 00:33:02.231
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself defending a triangle </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was trying to fucking tapped me and </v>

806
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get out and I'm using my </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

807
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what it manifested itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

808
00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being defensive and to start </v>

809
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:12.150
<v Speaker 1>starnell fans will jump in right now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

810
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moon full could choose you.</v>

811
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Said you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will read the book and I will read the</v>

812
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:22.181
<v Speaker 1>book with a 100 percent open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't tell me that that injury </v>

813
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:27.251
<v Speaker 1>happened because of my mind or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pain because of my mind because </v>

814
00:33:27.251 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really like a Weirdo and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying that shit.</v>

815
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have this like self hating thing</v>

816
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:37.721
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any tension as far as my </v>

817
00:33:37.721 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 1>life goes and I'm carrying in my back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

818
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get out of something and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt my back.</v>

819
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is like tissue and it tears,</v>

820
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.640
<v Speaker 1>so that's where like scientists go </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bananas and a lot of medical </v>

821
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 1>doctors that replaced disks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go bananas when they hear this shit</v>

822
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen bitch,</v>

823
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 1>you got bone on bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a desk anymore.</v>

824
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.780
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

825
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.820
<v Speaker 1>No matter what this guy says in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wacky book,</v>

826
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 1>if you have like a real physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries back,</v>

827
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>injuries are tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

828
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:04.110
<v Speaker 1>They're the worst I think because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

829
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he would be saying,</v>

830
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying he's wrong in saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

831
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 1>but what he would be saying by saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that somehow know that you control where</v>

832
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you're injured and control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where you feel pain because of your</v>

833
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:16.790
<v Speaker 1>emotional state.</v>

834
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.110
<v Speaker 1>What we're basically saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

835
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:24.450
<v Speaker 1>You're creating your life and your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination and your body is just one </v>

836
00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 1>physical manifestation of you creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own life,</v>

837
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:32.410
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to argue with it may be </v>

838
00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:35.381
<v Speaker 1>very well the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you if you want to carry the logic </v>

839
00:34:35.381 --> 00:34:39.341
<v Speaker 1>of thinking that your mind controls pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actual injuries aren't real or are </v>

840
00:34:39.341 --> 00:34:43.961
<v Speaker 1>created by your own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you've got to carry that all the </v>

841
00:34:43.961 --> 00:34:43.961
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

842
00:34:43.961 --> 00:34:47.860
<v Speaker 1>You got to take that all away and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is something that you're </v>

843
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.621
<v Speaker 1>creating in your own mind because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about physical reality being </v>

844
00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:51.770
<v Speaker 1>manifested by the imagination and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intent.</v>

845
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

846
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 1>just because it's your body doesn't mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's any less crazy voodoo talk.</v>

847
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.940
<v Speaker 1>That's still crazy Voodoo talk and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying it's wrong,</v>

848
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:04.270
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying if you believe that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really should take it to the utmost and </v>

849
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.270
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

850
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a fucking dream.</v>

851
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is your imagination manifested in </v>

852
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a representation of a true </v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

853
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:13.730
<v Speaker 1>but there is no true form behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting deep.</v>

854
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way you're going to </v>

855
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking tell me that your emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

856
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.350
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind is why you have a back pain.</v>

857
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you got hit by a car bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

858
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Know that's all possible to like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's this physical </v>

859
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:34.940
<v Speaker 1>manifestation is because of your intent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of your mind,</v>

860
00:35:34.941 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 1>because of your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that is even at possible,</v>

861
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 1>then you've got to take that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

862
00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.710
<v Speaker 1>That means your physical intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably controlling everything.</v>

863
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.220
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not just controlling your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body is probably controlling your </v>

864
00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 1>environment as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's controlling your environment,</v>

865
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is how much everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of it is real?</v>

866
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

867
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I put this on online and a lot of</v>

<v Speaker 4>illegal shit as this patriot.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that existed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to Martin a little bit now.</v>

912
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.370
<v Speaker 4>And when you started working with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Martin,</v>

913
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.360
<v Speaker 4>he was the first guy.</v>

914
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.340
<v Speaker 4>First Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:48.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never done this before.</v>

917
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:50.220
<v Speaker 4>I kind of want to experiment on </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>

918
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:55.350
<v Speaker 4>What made you like want to like reach </v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm a number one.</v>

920
00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like the purest form of competition</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is I think right now.</v>

921
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.760
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I love it because I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive.</v>

922
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.820
<v Speaker 4>I grew up playing games and video games </v>
<v Speaker 4>and poker is obviously a perfect choice </v>

923
00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 4>for my lifestyle now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.450
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

925
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:13.800
<v Speaker 4>I just felt like doing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

926
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

974
00:40:07.881 --> 00:40:12.881

<v Speaker 2>to look and imagine her life going there</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's like a miniature early when look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and Kat Williams is in it.</v>

00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:25.521
<v Speaker 3>He's one of my favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I see them it makes me sad like </v>

<v Speaker 2>Lohan.</v>

1031
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.840

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.540
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I guess,</v>

1045
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:04.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they originally said was supposed to be </v>

1046
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:06.101
<v Speaker 2>for Herbie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Herbie supposed to be on their TV and </v>

1047
00:44:06.101 --> 00:44:06.101
<v Speaker 2>they changed it to report them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions.</v>

1048
00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.730
<v Speaker 6>Scared.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing to be.</v>

1049
00:44:12.731 --> 00:44:17.731
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gotta call you back.</v>

1050
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which I guess that was.</v>

1051
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

1052
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.690
<v Speaker 2>that looks horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame is the scary</v>

1053
00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.750
<v Speaker 1>was thinking that that clip is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1054
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.960
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these constant jokes too.</v>

1055
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've come back from worse than this.</v>

1056
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:47.151
<v Speaker 1>Like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this constant playing off the fact that </v>

1057
00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:49.701
<v Speaker 1>he's like this consummate partier who </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebounds and it's starting to be like </v>

1058
00:44:49.701 --> 00:44:49.701
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

1059
00:44:49.701 --> 00:44:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just keep it.</v>

1060
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't just keep it</v>

1061
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.410
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep talking about being a fuck up and </v>

1062
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.410
<v Speaker 1>bouncing back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got to actually do something</v>

1063
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.410
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1064
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the scariest pre that.</v>

1065
00:44:59.160 --> 00:44:59.940
<v Speaker 1>That is scary.</v>

1066
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carrie Williams isn't it?</v>

1067
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:03.470
<v Speaker 2>And that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's scary is that</v>

1068
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:08.570
<v Speaker 1>people were willing to make that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they saw it and they glued it all </v>

1069
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:08.900
<v Speaker 1>together and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1070
00:45:08.901 --> 00:45:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

1071
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty funny.</v>

1072
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Whoever's in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever made that movie is like a </v>

1073
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:16.760
<v Speaker 2>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just sitting there going,</v>

1074
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Andy Dick,</v>

1075
00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:20.650
<v Speaker 1>that's pure madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That movie is pure madness that you will</v>

1076
00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:23.440
<v Speaker 1>leave that movie baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1077
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do I know?</v>

1078
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't take your opinions for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1079
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.980
<v Speaker 1>but I hope that that Kat Williams did </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets his shit together or if he does </v>

1080
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:32.800
<v Speaker 1>have his shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he explains himself.</v>

1081
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I think he's fucking hilarious comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1082
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.280
<v Speaker 1>You go back and watch the pimp </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronicles.</v>

1083
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:40.780
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1084
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:42.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to watch.</v>

1085
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.620
<v Speaker 1>He was good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really good.</v>

1086
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I hope he's still is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1087
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I hope he can bounce back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

1088
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to guess as to what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to them,</v>

1089
00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 1>what happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know about all these like </v>

1090
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.550
<v Speaker 1>cancelled shows not showing up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating people up and shit sounds </v>

1091
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.290
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know fucking dudes.</v>

1092
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>

1093
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to be a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of crazy to be able to pull off comedy,</v>

1094
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially pulled off like at Joey Diaz </v>

1095
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.601
<v Speaker 1>levels or fucking cat Williams levels or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Brian Cowen levels probably counts </v>

1096
00:46:15.641 --> 00:46:16.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>

1097
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:17.980
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking awesome.</v>

1098
00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.470
<v Speaker 2>And do you ever talk to Steven Wright </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever heard?</v>

1099
00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to his comedy the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1100
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.160
<v Speaker 2>He is a hilarious course.</v>

1101
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I saw that guy live like way back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day when he first started making it </v>

1102
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.590
<v Speaker 1>before I was even a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid to see him live and I was,</v>

1103
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I was like 18 or 19 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to see him in a concert.</v>

1104
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.830
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

1105
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:41.290
<v Speaker 2>He said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was on this on an airplane the other </v>

1106
00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:41.290
<v Speaker 2>day and you forgot to take the seat belt</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he stood up,</v>

1107
00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:42.260
<v Speaker 2>and then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1108
00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I was dragging that F or did this </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane around the lobby knocking </v>

1109
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:47.310
<v Speaker 2>people over with my wings.</v>

1110
00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 1>He had a great joke about working out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fire extinguisher factory.</v>

1111
00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't park anywhere near the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that kind of style.</v>

1112
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy that,</v>

1113
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:06.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was um,</v>

1114
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:11.541
<v Speaker 1>a movie that was written about or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was made about standing up called when </v>

1115
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:15.621
<v Speaker 1>stand standup stood out and he was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that really like changed the whole </v>

1116
00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 1>face of the Boston scene because he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered and when he got discovered,</v>

1117
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:19.910
<v Speaker 1>they were putting them on television all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1118
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get discovered to.</v>

1119
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.580
<v Speaker 1>And it sort of changed it from everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just going out and trying to kill,</v>

1120
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 1>just be the funniest people you could to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wanting to try to get a TV.</v>

1121
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 1>So he likes sort of by his success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately tanked the entire boss.</v>

1122
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.510
<v Speaker 1>He was the first step in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston comedy scene.</v>

1123
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Slowly degenerating over time.</v>

1124
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't get steven right in my face </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1125
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.190
<v Speaker 2>like know how you get Louis C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k everywhere he goes.</v>

1126
00:47:43.191 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Katie,</v>

1127
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:44.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Tomlinson,</v>

1128
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:48.140
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons is that</v>

1129
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:53.280
<v Speaker 1>was not nearly as prolific as Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that so amazing about </v>

1130
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Louise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just that he's funny,</v>

1131
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:59.650
<v Speaker 1>but he's so prolific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Louis puts out a whole new hour </v>

1132
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:01.670
<v Speaker 1>every year and he's constantly writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of that,</v>

1133
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fan,</v>

1134
00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.570
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a fan of Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1135
00:48:05.571 --> 00:48:07.070
<v Speaker 1>But was the last time I saw Steven </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wright,</v>

1136
00:48:07.071 --> 00:48:08.760
<v Speaker 1>special ones last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1137
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:12.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I downloaded one of his mp3s.</v>

1138
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare because he only has a certain </v>

1139
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 1>body of work and I'm through with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already eaten through it.</v>

1140
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with a guy like Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fan,</v>

1141
00:48:19.941 --> 00:48:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you're continually refreshed with new </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1142
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Like every year you're going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole new hour.</v>

1143
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:27.620
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get all these interviews</v>
<v Speaker 1>in between.</v>

1144
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the fan and the</v>

1145
00:48:30.411 --> 00:48:31.850
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it makes sense.</v>

1146
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:36.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense that I'm still </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans with Steven Wright are fans of </v>

1147
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Stephen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1148
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:38.000
<v Speaker 1>But I haven't heard any of this shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

1149
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:41.930
<v Speaker 1>But if he was like a dude like Louie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like banging it out every year.</v>

1150
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Like an hour every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:46.130
<v Speaker 1>He would hear about them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that he's not hilarious.</v>

1152
00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:48.710
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doesn't work that much.</v>

1153
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 2>A Sitcom with Steven Wright and Katt </v>
<v Speaker 2>Williams and they're gay levers and it's</v>

1154
00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>perfect because Kat Williams never </v>
<v Speaker 2>slapped steven.</v>

1155
00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's a tall and stuff,</v>

1156
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:58.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably wouldn't slap them as much.</v>

1157
00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Steven Meisel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dancehall,</v>

1158
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:00.690
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't he?</v>

1159
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Williams was standing on the couch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smack in your face,</v>

1160
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1161
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:05.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Coming.</v>

1162
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.430
<v Speaker 7>You see on the video,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pop it at Walmart employee.</v>

1163
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.870
<v Speaker 7>He'll smack you.</v>

1164
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Usually what Kat said Walmart employee </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying to him that way.</v>

1165
00:49:13.741 --> 00:49:18.741
<v Speaker 2>Slap him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called him the n word and that's why </v>

1166
00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:18.741
<v Speaker 2>I slapped him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that at all,</v>

1167
00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:18.741
<v Speaker 2>but I</v>

1168
00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:19.570
<v Speaker 7>might have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You might have.</v>

1169
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:25.480
<v Speaker 7>And if he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the right thing to say if you </v>

1170
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.320
<v Speaker 7>want to get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess that too.</v>

1171
00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.900
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>back to Matt.</v>

1172
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 7>A little bit random access,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but hey man,</v>

1173
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 7>I'm enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's how a real conversation is,</v>

1174
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:40.831
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we'll conversations don't always go the </v>

1175
00:49:40.831 --> 00:49:40.831
<v Speaker 7>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

1176
00:49:40.831 --> 00:49:40.831
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1177
00:49:40.831 --> 00:49:44.970
<v Speaker 7>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you started working with Martin </v>

1178
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:44.970
<v Speaker 7>Kampmann,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did you come up with like something that</v>

1179
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:45.780
<v Speaker 7>you wrote down on paper?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like easily,</v>

1180
00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ways to address it?</v>

1181
00:49:47.411 --> 00:49:49.990
<v Speaker 7>Did you develop like a curriculum?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how did you,</v>

1182
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.800
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how'd you approach it?</v>

1183
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:55.830
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to do that because it just </v>
<v Speaker 7>depends so much on every different </v>

1184
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:55.830
<v Speaker 7>person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

1185
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 7>Depends on how much time do you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We usually spend like,</v>

1186
00:49:57.821 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 7>I would say a half hour now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

<v Speaker 7>a fight.</v>

1188
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:02.830
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1189
00:50:02.831 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 7>About two months.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In two months.</v>

1190
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:07.720
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So d all through like heavy training.</v>

1191
00:50:07.721 --> 00:50:08.950
<v Speaker 7>You're there?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 7>I mean I don't go to his gym that much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went to extreme for a couple of times,</v>

1193
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:16.810
<v Speaker 7>just kinda hung out and just saw his </v>
<v Speaker 7>body language and stuff like that,</v>

1194
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:19.290
<v Speaker 7>but mostly it's just on the phone or </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll go over to his house and we'll have</v>

1195
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 7>of chat it out and see what's on his </v>
<v Speaker 7>mind and you know,</v>

1196
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.320
<v Speaker 7>just try to get it off there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

1197
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1198
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.990
<v Speaker 7>did you develop legere course for how </v>
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>

1199
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.990
<v Speaker 1>how you handle this kind of</v>

1200
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 8>man?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm still so new to this.</v>

1201
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:33.420
<v Speaker 8>I don't even know what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes you just have</v>

1202
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 1>some really good ideas about being able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in the moment.</v>

1203
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:42.300
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the bottom line is just getting them </v>

1204
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:42.300
<v Speaker 8>present.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the only thing that I'm concerned</v>

1205
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.991
<v Speaker 8>about is just getting them to the point </v>
<v Speaker 8>where they're not thinking about their </v>

1206
00:50:45.991 --> 00:50:48.781
<v Speaker 8>acts or whatever's on their mind where </v>
<v Speaker 8>they can just be in that cage and all </v>

1207
00:50:48.781 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 8>that matters is what's in front of them </v>
<v Speaker 8>because if they go,</v>

1208
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:50.650
<v Speaker 8>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like I said,</v>

1209
00:50:50.651 --> 00:50:55.651
<v Speaker 8>we talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one second away from the moment they're </v>

1210
00:50:55.651 --> 00:50:55.651
<v Speaker 8>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they could get knocked out,</v>

1211
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.400
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So</v>

1212
00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:00.040
<v Speaker 1>what is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you tell us like what's a,</v>

1213
00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.140
<v Speaker 1>what's a good way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you've got something on your</v>

1214
00:51:02.141 --> 00:51:07.141
<v Speaker 1>mind that's fucking with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a good way to get that out of </v>

1215
00:51:07.141 --> 00:51:07.930
<v Speaker 1>your mind to smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke weed and deal with it?</v>

1216
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Smoke weed and deal with it.</v>

1217
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:10.270
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1218
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.750
<v Speaker 8>do you know that's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But uh,</v>

1219
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:13.860
<v Speaker 8>I'm not as funny as you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying.</v>

1220
00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:14.710
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You gave it a shot.</v>

1221
00:51:14.711 --> 00:51:15.300
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

1222
00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:16.840
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1223
00:51:16.841 --> 00:51:18.160
<v Speaker 8>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just to deal with it.</v>

1224
00:51:18.161 --> 00:51:19.030
<v Speaker 8>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like I said,</v>

1225
00:51:19.031 --> 00:51:21.070
<v Speaker 8>they'll push it aside,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they'll pretend like it's not there.</v>

1226
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some people it's not that easy </v>

1227
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 1>to just deal with things like I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1228
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.210
<v Speaker 1>is there a tool that you could give </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1229
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that they could take away like,</v>

1230
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me look at it this way now.</v>

1231
00:51:31.231 --> 00:51:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Instead it was like maybe a loss loss in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

1232
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:35.970
<v Speaker 1>the loss of a pad or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1233
00:51:35.971 --> 00:51:40.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people that shit is like </v>

1234
00:51:40.971 --> 00:51:40.971
<v Speaker 1>absolutely devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for them to move on.</v>

1235
00:51:40.971 --> 00:51:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you what,</v>

1236
00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:47.090
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're dealing with a fighter </v>

1237
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:47.090
<v Speaker 1>and he has an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1238
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:47.850
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

1239
00:51:47.851 --> 00:51:49.020
<v Speaker 1>loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

1240
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get them to like,</v>

1241
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.800
<v Speaker 1>let that truck go.</v>

1242
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:58.180
<v Speaker 8>You got to get them to go back to that </v>
<v Speaker 8>moment and live it again because they </v>

1243
00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.631
<v Speaker 8>haven't got,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're not okay with it one way or </v>

1244
00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:01.631
<v Speaker 8>another.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're just not okay with it,</v>

1245
00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Speaker 8>so they have to go back and really go </v>
<v Speaker 8>through what was going on.</v>

1246
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.710
<v Speaker 8>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1247
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:09.520
<v Speaker 1>so you feel that a lot of times when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people keep things in their mind or </v>

1248
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 1>distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unresolved issues.</v>

1249
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.520
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly from childhood actually.</v>

1250
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Now how do you address that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say do,</v>

1252
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.210
<v Speaker 1>like when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're working with a fighter,</v>

1253
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.390
<v Speaker 1>do you dress like specific areas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their child that.</v>

1254
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far do you go with that?</v>

1255
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.230
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

1256
00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 8>it'll come up in conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1257
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:32.590
<v Speaker 8>they'll one way or another they'll tell </v>
<v Speaker 8>me like what the issue is and then we'd </v>

1258
00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:32.590
<v Speaker 8>just go deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1259
00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:33.870
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's hard though because a lot of people</v>

1260
00:52:33.871 --> 00:52:35.220
<v Speaker 8>don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't want to deal with.</v>

1261
00:52:35.221 --> 00:52:37.290
<v Speaker 8>They've been living with it for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're just like,</v>

1262
00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.030
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's the way it is for them.</v>

1263
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1264
00:52:41.121 --> 00:52:42.870
<v Speaker 1>it makes it difficult for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1265
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 1>to Sorta if they let it go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the game's over.</v>

1266
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.370
<v Speaker 8>Phil let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The game's over.</v>

1268
00:52:48.371 --> 00:52:50.860
<v Speaker 8>They don't get because they're mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're getting something out of it.</v>

1269
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.420
<v Speaker 8>That's the reason why they keep doing </v>
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

1270
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.700
<v Speaker 8>Even as a traumatic experience or </v>
<v Speaker 8>something bad.</v>

1271
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
<v Speaker 8>They're getting something out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether it be people feeling bad for </v>

1272
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.521
<v Speaker 8>them or whatever it is for them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There'll be getting something out of it </v>

1273
00:53:02.521 --> 00:53:03.670
<v Speaker 8>until they can let that go and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and that game and move on.</v>

1274
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.270
<v Speaker 8>It's just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like groundhog day over and over.</v>

1275
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you meet someone and they have an </v>

1276
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.030
<v Speaker 1>issue like that and they keep repeating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so fucking frustrated.</v>

1277
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so frustrating.</v>

1278
00:53:15.131 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I went through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1279
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I've gone through it a couple times with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends with drugs,</v>

1280
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

1281
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.380
<v Speaker 1>or an o or alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1282
00:53:23.381 --> 00:53:25.920
<v Speaker 1>when someone has just got that where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they will,</v>

1283
00:53:25.921 --> 00:53:29.040
<v Speaker 1>they'll get sober for a couple months </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they fuck up and then,</v>

1284
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1285
00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 1>like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're stuck in like a,</v>

1286
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.280
<v Speaker 1>any like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1287
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 1>why are you in this little track?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a terrible track,</v>

1288
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maze,</v>

1289
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just go that way.</v>

1290
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.710
<v Speaker 1>You can just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1291
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 1>this is your fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it down.</v>

1292
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Pretend you're talking to yourself on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table.</v>

1293
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:53.780
<v Speaker 1>What would you tell yourself to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you tell yourself to keep </v>

1294
00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:53.780
<v Speaker 1>repeating these same stupid fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns?</v>

1295
00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.920
<v Speaker 1>He went to yourself for advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a weird thing with people.</v>

1296
00:53:56.921 --> 00:54:01.921
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people were good about </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving advice but their own life,</v>

1297
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:04.560
<v Speaker 1>they can't follow that know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Too sometimes.</v>

1298
00:54:04.561 --> 00:54:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm human.</v>

1299
00:54:05.181 --> 00:54:06.330
<v Speaker 1>It happens with me too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1300
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1301
00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1302
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1303
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.340
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to turn that same.</v>

1304
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:16.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at other people you can </v>

1305
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.510
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty objective.</v>

1306
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.510
<v Speaker 1>You're not attached to their success or </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

1307
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:19.010
<v Speaker 1>You see them for what they are for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most part or what you know,</v>

1308
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.600
<v Speaker 1>what they represent to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yourself.</v>

1309
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 1>That's hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't want to deal with </v>

1310
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 1>their own issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1311
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.760
<v Speaker 1>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people give advice all the </v>

1312
00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:30.760
<v Speaker 1>time because they don't want to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>inward and really work on themselves and</v>

1313
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.920
<v Speaker 1>a song that they would play on like zoom</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one of those little kid shows.</v>

1314
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.370
<v Speaker 1>The most important person in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide world is you and you're hardly even</v>

1315
00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:42.900
<v Speaker 1>know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>

1316
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember it either that </v>

1317
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 1>barely remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that line.</v>

1318
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Remember like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was I was six going,</v>

1319
00:54:49.481 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 1>what is this bitch talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even know me.</v>

1320
00:54:52.411 --> 00:54:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I know me well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know you.</v>

1321
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't project your bullshit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six years old,</v>

1322
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I fucking know me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1323
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:04.850
<v Speaker 1>The most important person in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life or help you in your even know you.</v>

1324
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult for people to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves though.</v>

1325
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.260
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the hardest things to do.</v>

1326
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Straighten out your own issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about fighting is that the </v>

1327
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:18.810
<v Speaker 1>stakes are so insanely high that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more pressure.</v>

1328
00:55:18.811 --> 00:55:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's not just a loss like </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a regular person,</v>

1329
00:55:22.261 --> 00:55:27.261
<v Speaker 1>like say if you like to play basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a one on one game with the </v>

1330
00:55:27.261 --> 00:55:27.261
<v Speaker 1>guy and you're pretty sure you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat them,</v>

1331
00:55:27.261 --> 00:55:30.330
<v Speaker 1>but you fuck up some clutch shots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

1332
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel good.</v>

1333
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make it funny,</v>

1334
00:55:33.091 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 1>funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He smoked you in basketball.</v>

1335
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.960
<v Speaker 1>But that is so much better than losing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1336
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 1>The losing a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emotional.</v>

1337
00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emotional aspect of it is so </v>

1338
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:44.680
<v Speaker 1>devastating to a lot of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

1339
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Especially with Egos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>

1340
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 1>we all have egos one way or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly.</v>

1341
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:53.660
<v Speaker 1>But with fighting it's like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing in front of that many people and </v>

1342
00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go back to the drawing </v>
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

1343
00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:54.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get a title shot now</v>

1344
00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:57.030
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Know Martin was right there,</v>

1345
00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:55:57.841 --> 00:56:02.841
<v Speaker 1>Especially in a situation where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like the guy and you guys have a </v>

1347
00:56:02.841 --> 00:56:06.060
<v Speaker 1>lot of emotions invested in the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the guy goes out and chaos.</v>

1348
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.680
<v Speaker 1>That gets ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1349
00:56:07.681 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things I teach.</v>

1350
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.950
<v Speaker 1>You cannot think about that stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not get emotionally invested.</v>

1351
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.530
<v Speaker 1>If you get emotionally invested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

1352
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so important.</v>

1353
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 1>With a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important with even with art,</v>

1354
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta like you gotta be able to</v>

1355
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:27.020
<v Speaker 1>let the exist outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you know,</v>

1356
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:29.030
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of your own bullshit,</v>

1357
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to let it just,</v>

1358
00:56:31.011 --> 00:56:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you can't get wrapped up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker's eyeballing me,</v>

1359
00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.460
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really are.</v>

1360
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:36.800
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be the one that shoots </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

1361
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:41.210
<v Speaker 1>like all that nonsense can't exist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order for you to perform optimally.</v>

1362
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:46.310
<v Speaker 1>It can never grow if you order a few to </v>
<v Speaker 1>execute the technique and the best way </v>

1363
00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:48.170
<v Speaker 1>and to not have all this extra baggage </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to your,</v>

1364
00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 1>your performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when people don't understand is </v>

1365
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:53.480
<v Speaker 1>that this is a very important thing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

1366
00:56:53.481 --> 00:56:58.481
<v Speaker 1>and I know this specifically because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent so much time in sensory </v>

1367
00:56:58.671 --> 00:57:02.480
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a really big,</v>

1368
00:57:02.481 --> 00:57:05.000
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big thing in my life,</v>

1369
00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.050
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1370
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to separate and get a look </v>

1371
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 1>at what the fuck is really going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your thoughts and all of your </v>

1372
00:57:16.191 --> 00:57:19.280
<v Speaker 1>intentions when you're by yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>no distractions,</v>

1373
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 1>because if you have any distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it distraction is an unnecessary </v>

1374
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.340
<v Speaker 1>element to a situation.</v>

1375
00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 1>If there's a situation and there's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ego attached with you and this guy </v>

1376
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:31.400
<v Speaker 1>fighting that did not need to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you've,</v>

1377
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you've added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might still beat the guy,</v>

1378
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:39.520
<v Speaker 1>but you've added a layer of difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this equation that didn't exist </v>

1379
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.151
<v Speaker 1>before and you focus resources on it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have a certain amount of </v>

1380
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:43.151
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

1381
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 4>And guess who created that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't always.</v>

1382
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.880
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the isolation tank is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

1383
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:52.980
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly understand when your body is </v>

1384
00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.831
<v Speaker 1>separated from any sensory input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much resources are going to that?</v>

1385
00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 1>That will also affect consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you have to deal your,</v>

1386
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.340
<v Speaker 1>your mind is managing space as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving around,</v>

1387
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:05.860
<v Speaker 1>like bumping into objects and opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors and your,</v>

1388
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 1>your mind is managing all this as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as communicating with people and you </v>

1389
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.340
<v Speaker 1>don't feel like you're in any way taxed </v>
<v Speaker 1>or stressed,</v>

1390
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in an environment where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's none of that going on,</v>

1391
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.770
<v Speaker 1>the sensory deprivation tank being at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same temperatures,</v>

1392
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:23.790
<v Speaker 1>your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're floating in there so there's </v>

1393
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:23.790
<v Speaker 1>nothing come in into your skin and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

1394
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:24.730
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're flying through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1395
00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see anything.</v>

1396
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:27.710
<v Speaker 1>It's pitch black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1397
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 1>hearing your ears are underwater so </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing coming in and everything</v>

1398
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:36.030
<v Speaker 1>seems so clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no distractions there </v>

1399
00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:39.541
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just your thoughts and then you </v>

1400
00:58:39.541 --> 00:58:39.541
<v Speaker 1>look at it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1401
00:58:39.541 --> 00:58:43.711
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why don't I get out of this </v>

1402
00:58:43.711 --> 00:58:43.711
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I stop drinking?</v>

1403
00:58:43.711 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I quit smoking cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I keep gambling my paycheck away?</v>

1404
00:58:47.171 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inside that environment,</v>

1405
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.240
<v Speaker 1>those answers seem like so obvious.</v>

1406
00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1407
00:58:52.881 --> 00:58:54.680
<v Speaker 4>what you just said is as perfect way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>put it.</v>

1408
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 4>There's so much going on in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even take a moment to look </v>

1409
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 4>inward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1410
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:03.581
<v Speaker 4>we're either driving somewhere or we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating and talking to somebody or </v>

1411
00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:03.770
<v Speaker 4>whatever we're doing and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping,</v>

1412
00:59:03.771 --> 00:59:05.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never really have that time.</v>

1413
00:59:05.031 --> 00:59:07.520
<v Speaker 4>So being in the deprivation tank is </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely huge.</v>

1414
00:59:07.521 --> 00:59:10.250
<v Speaker 4>I've tried it a couple times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually done in Venice at the float lab</v>

1415
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:11.660
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

1416
00:59:11.661 --> 00:59:13.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just that guy's nuts,</v>

1417
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dude who runs a float lab crash.</v>

1418
00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

1419
00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:22.790
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a community of people all </v>

1420
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:25.831
<v Speaker 1>throughout world that create these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory deprivation tanks and there's </v>

1421
00:59:25.831 --> 00:59:26.460
<v Speaker 1>some very good models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

1422
00:59:26.461 --> 00:59:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1423
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.970
<v Speaker 1>a Samadhi that was my first one and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1424
00:59:30.971 --> 00:59:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed that thing very much.</v>

1425
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I had great experiences in that tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very adequate,</v>

1426
00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but the level of sophistication and </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that this crazy motherfucker </v>

1427
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:45.711
<v Speaker 1>puts in to his shit crashes systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 100 years in the future.</v>

1428
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:50.100
<v Speaker 1>The amount of filtration that's in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ozone and nobody.</v>

1429
00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.860
<v Speaker 1>No one else has anywhere near what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1430
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 1>He put in this giant control panel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to get it hardwired into the room </v>

1431
00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:00.930
<v Speaker 1>where the tank is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is fucking crazy.</v>

1432
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:05.931
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eight feet high and six feet wide </v>

1433
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:05.931
<v Speaker 1>and nine feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1434
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a gigantic fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1435
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1436
01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>He takes everything to this crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the newest version of the tanks,</v>

1437
01:00:13.591 --> 01:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The experience is still the same.</v>

1438
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to make sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water is as pure as it can be.</v>

1439
01:00:18.391 --> 01:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>The distractions are minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1440
01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>there's no light that gets in at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you,</v>

1441
01:00:22.921 --> 01:00:27.921
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have this experience on a </v>

1442
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:27.921
<v Speaker 1>regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really.</v>

1443
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It makes it puts into perspective why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do certain things where they just</v>

1444
01:00:31.471 --> 01:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>keep doing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a momentum and impulse,</v>

1445
01:00:33.721 --> 01:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>like pull into Dunkin donuts or get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dead to horrible fatty foods and</v>

1446
01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>stuff your face and you just fill a hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a second and then you're like,</v>

1447
01:00:41.311 --> 01:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the gym tonight.</v>

1448
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you keep repeating this </v>

1449
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:49.491
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but note that you're repeating it with </v>

1450
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:52.071
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really strange because </v>

1451
01:00:52.071 --> 01:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>actions also require resources and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an issue,</v>

1452
01:00:53.701 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>when you have something that's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your mind,</v>

1453
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you will eat up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources so that you don't have to deal</v>

1454
01:00:59.491 --> 01:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>with it because the pressure of dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it is scary to you.</v>

1455
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>So you create this sort of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation by actions.</v>

1456
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why meditative time time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's just doing,</v>

1457
01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>sitting down and concentrating on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing and just trying to clear your </v>

1458
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:20.931
<v Speaker 1>mind or actually doing something or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking where like a lot of people think </v>

1459
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>hiking is like a meditative sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing thing because you're,</v>

1460
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>as you're moving all your completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on that and your life sort</v>

1461
01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>of goes away and the stress of it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of goes away</v>

1462
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.360
<v Speaker 5>is living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1463
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:33.610
<v Speaker 5>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how he's like a.</v>

1464
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:38.670
<v Speaker 5>He rents them out for hour so he should </v>
<v Speaker 5>the mix like massage with flotation tank</v>

1465
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.240
<v Speaker 5>imagines is laying there and having </v>
<v Speaker 5>another girl in a bathing suit just give</v>

1466
01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:46.040
<v Speaker 5>you like a real time massage while in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the flotation tank.</v>

1467
01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:51.010
<v Speaker 5>Can't that way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing doesn't really work that</v>

1468
01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:56.011
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you want to see her you </v>

1469
01:01:56.011 --> 01:01:57.991
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what if she looks like Gollum </v>

1470
01:01:57.991 --> 01:01:57.991
<v Speaker 5>when you maybe the one of the things you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get to pick.</v>

1471
01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that plus the tank only 11</v>

1472
01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:07.030
<v Speaker 5>inches deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she can't really do that.</v>

1473
01:02:07.031 --> 01:02:08.740
<v Speaker 5>You would design it so like your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1474
01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 5>you can breathe in another planet where </v>
<v Speaker 5>gravity gravity's definitely make no.</v>

1475
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.320
<v Speaker 5>Just one answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can breathe underwater.</v>

1476
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's a ramp like where it goes</v>
<v Speaker 5>up so your.</v>

1477
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.140
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't work to see if that's silly </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if it's a ramp</v>

1478
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.990
<v Speaker 3>you would be sloshing around in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman.</v>

1479
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.160
<v Speaker 3>That would ruin the whole idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory deprivation.</v>

1480
01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:31.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're laying on like some like </v>

1481
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.001
<v Speaker 5>fleshlight material all the way in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole thing's flashlight </v>

1482
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:34.570
<v Speaker 5>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why don't they make us feel good in</v>

1483
01:02:34.571 --> 01:02:39.571
<v Speaker 5>your Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it wouldn't feel so good on your </v>

1484
01:02:39.571 --> 01:02:39.571
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>

1485
01:02:39.571 --> 01:02:39.571
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this rubbery thing on </v>
<v Speaker 5>my face?</v>

1486
01:02:39.571 --> 01:02:44.280
<v Speaker 5>Fleshlight blankets you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels good in your deck because your </v>

1487
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.360
<v Speaker 5>Dick is so crazy at Dick's willing to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>into assholes readily.</v>

1488
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:49.510
<v Speaker 5>One of the girls like put it in my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know your Dixon idiot.</v>

1489
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.070
<v Speaker 5>Your Dick is essentially</v>

1490
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.240
<v Speaker 3>being shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walls all over itself.</v>

1491
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Your Dick is a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference between that </v>

1492
01:02:58.270 --> 01:02:58.910
<v Speaker 3>and what you're willing to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

1493
01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most respectful people and not rub a </v>

1494
01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:04.820
<v Speaker 3>shit wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wall where all the shit passes by.</v>

1495
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.620
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't take a rub it all over your </v>
<v Speaker 3>skin,</v>

1496
01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.390
<v Speaker 3>but your Dick is like,</v>

1497
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.240
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>love it baby.</v>

1498
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:14.330
<v Speaker 5>For Christmas I got dolphin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vib dolphin encounter.</v>

<v Speaker 5>When would you try any mini experiments?</v>

1510
01:03:41.661 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 5>It was first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as John Lilly Lilly today.</v>

1511
01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.760
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you smoke through?</v>

1512
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:49.160
<v Speaker 5>I've been sick for three days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was sick,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Now this what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to what?</v>

1517
01:03:56.841 --> 01:03:59.060
<v Speaker 5>Like a rational person having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

1518
01:03:59.061 --> 01:04:00.350
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't go to the dolphins.</v>

1519
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.060
<v Speaker 5>You fuck the shit out of you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People know.</v>

1520
01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:08.110
<v Speaker 5>What are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you first hung out with a dog </v>

1521
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:08.110
<v Speaker 5>or when you hang out with dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1522
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:13.001
<v Speaker 5>you always sit there and like you read </v>
<v Speaker 5>my mind and I know every experiment with</v>

1523
01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:15.080
<v Speaker 5>your cats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never do anything.</v>

1524
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't pretend to be doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1525
01:04:17.991 --> 01:04:19.160
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's be clear.</v>

1526
01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:23.390
<v Speaker 5>You pretending that your dog might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to see you and we'll talk to you.</v>

1527
01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:25.310
<v Speaker 5>Look at Dr doolittle movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

1528
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:30.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't pretend I don't sit around and </v>

1529
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:30.370
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I read your mind?</v>

1530
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:30.370
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why,</v>

1531
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:32.450
<v Speaker 5>because I read a lot of books on dogs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and humans and not once does it ever say</v>

1532
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.490
<v Speaker 5>anywhere that they can read your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>mind.</v>

1533
01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.580
<v Speaker 5>So I assume that they can't read your </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind and then when I watched like </v>

1534
01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.240
<v Speaker 5>zookeeper that that's just bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1535
01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:41.300
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

1536
01:04:41.301 --> 01:04:43.360
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't sit around and go,</v>

1537
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.450
<v Speaker 5>fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mr Dolphin.</v>

1538
01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.020
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1539
01:04:45.021 --> 01:04:50.021
<v Speaker 5>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you tell me if you had a dolphin in </v>

1540
01:04:50.021 --> 01:04:50.021
<v Speaker 5>an aquarium tank inside your bedroom and</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyday he looked at that.</v>

1541
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:55.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it asks you where it would want to live </v>

1542
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:57.341
<v Speaker 5>and I wouldn't let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if it was a crippled often it </v>

1543
01:04:57.341 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 5>couldn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just sat there and had to stare and </v>

1544
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.481
<v Speaker 5>look at it and shoot it in the head and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll make the next life will come back </v>

1545
01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:02.240
<v Speaker 5>as a tuna to they sell retarded dolphins</v>
<v Speaker 5>for pets.</v>

1546
01:05:02.241 --> 01:05:07.241
<v Speaker 5>That'd be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could keep it in an aquarium </v>

1547
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:07.241
<v Speaker 5>because it doesn't want to move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just wants to sit there and drool.</v>

1548
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:11.110
<v Speaker 5>But it'd be so cool to be alive and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>would still want to eat and like just </v>

1549
01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:11.480
<v Speaker 5>having a retarded dolphin in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>bedroom.</v>

1550
01:05:11.481 --> 01:05:16.190
<v Speaker 5>That'd be perfect if you were into that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I suspect you get bored because he'd</v>

1551
01:05:16.191 --> 01:05:18.020
<v Speaker 5>probably be really stupid like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of</v>

1552
01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.700
<v Speaker 1>the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like a crying out for you.</v>

1553
01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.060
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1554
01:05:23.061 --> 01:05:26.240
<v Speaker 1>You know how bad dolphin street sound at</v>
<v Speaker 1>3:00</v>

1555
01:05:26.241 --> 01:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>in the morning when you're hung over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if it says happy noises?</v>

1556
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:30.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a relaxing,</v>

1557
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but you're just hoping for a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of Down's syndrome animal.</v>

1558
01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>You're not hoping for like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>down's syndrome animals or an animal </v>

1559
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:39.710
<v Speaker 1>with a disease for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1560
01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a magical down central animal </v>

1561
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>that's happy all the time.</v>

1562
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we can clone them,</v>

1563
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.750
<v Speaker 5>if they're 13 cloning now animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>cloning,</v>

1564
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.760
<v Speaker 5>so maybe you can clone your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be all right to close a </v>

1565
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:50.760
<v Speaker 5>retarded dolphin that you keep an </v>
<v Speaker 5>aquarium that doesn't squeak.</v>

1566
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really lucky.</v>

1567
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>We're really lucky that people can't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals pregnant.</v>

1568
01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really lucky because if,</v>

1569
01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.800

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:55.960
<v Speaker 1>they had a fucking figure out what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

1612
01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:59.680
<v Speaker 1>That would be the human dog population </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it will be so many human dogs.</v>

1613
01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:01.360
<v Speaker 1>There would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck your dogs.</v>

1614
01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:06.361
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like big billboards with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deck and a dog and a big red line </v>

1615
01:08:06.361 --> 01:08:09.631
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck your dogs because people </v>

1616
01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:09.631
<v Speaker 1>would fucked her dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would definitely fuck the dogs.</v>

1617
01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:11.950
<v Speaker 1>People have fucked parrots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you,</v>

1618
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:14.560
<v Speaker 1>if a person can get a pair of pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be people,</v>

1619
01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>parent hybrids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it will be</v>

1620
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.100
<v Speaker 3>flying around our cities all day </v>
<v Speaker 3>snatching purses and throwing shit at </v>

1621
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 3>people shitting on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1622
01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:26.861
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people could make hybrids with </v>

1623
01:08:26.861 --> 01:08:29.351
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those motherfuckers would be like </v>

1624
01:08:29.351 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>prisoners flying in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping rocks on people's heads,</v>

1625
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:34.690
<v Speaker 3>killing the Mashiah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you there'd be a person </v>

1626
01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:34.690
<v Speaker 3>pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would look at it and go,</v>

1627
01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck did that even happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there'll be a half person,</v>

1628
01:08:36.651 --> 01:08:38.970
<v Speaker 3>half pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a foot and a half tall,</v>

1629
01:08:38.971 --> 01:08:42.740
<v Speaker 3>all fucking pissed off and fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feet fucked up.</v>

1630
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Pigeon feet and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people could get everything pregnant,</v>

1631
01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 3>we would get everything pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There would be people,</v>

1632
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:49.970
<v Speaker 3>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be people,</v>

1633
01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:54.971
<v Speaker 3>melons and pumpkins there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be people like Lord of the </v>

1634
01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 3>rings just describing Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what of your loads got duplicated?</v>

1635
01:08:57.441 --> 01:09:02.441
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't just human being and be </v>

1636
01:09:02.441 --> 01:09:02.441
<v Speaker 3>like Mac book pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come over here and sit on daddy's lap.</v>

1637
01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Sperm just reproduced everything and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw,</v>

1638
01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.890
<v Speaker 3>just shoot sperm on a water bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes another waterfall right next to</v>

1639
01:09:09.891 --> 01:09:14.891
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of those pods and that movie </v>

1640
01:09:14.891 --> 01:09:14.891
<v Speaker 3>invasion of the body snatchers is grown </v>
<v Speaker 3>under the bed.</v>

1641
01:09:14.891 --> 01:09:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Trying to become what it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1642
01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I'd find a time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would suck my own dick and fuck my </v>

1643
01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 3>mouth and get my own pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it would just spin in a circle,</v>

1644
01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:26.231
<v Speaker 3>like a cart wheel going down the street </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be two mirrors looking into each </v>

1645
01:09:26.231 --> 01:09:26.231
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forever.</v>

1646
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Never end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be two mirrors facing each other to</v>

1647
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:36.431
<v Speaker 3>oblivion of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boeing yourself in a spinning circle </v>

1648
01:09:36.431 --> 01:09:39.311
<v Speaker 3>like you're in one of those cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheels going down the hill like one guy </v>

1649
01:09:39.311 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 3>holding another guy's foot or a dog </v>
<v Speaker 3>biting it's tail a dog.</v>

1650
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Biting it's tail is the perfect analogy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is rolling down the hill.</v>

1651
01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:46.910
<v Speaker 3>There will be you sucking your own Dick </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking yourself in the ass.</v>

1652
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:49.370
<v Speaker 3>And a giant circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a spiral spiral.</v>

1653
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Fractal had a marine we could roll up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his face goes on and billions and</v>

1654
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.990
<v Speaker 3>billions of light years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a huge swirling galaxy.</v>

1655
01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Have a zillion trillion Brian sucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own dick and calling themselves in</v>

1656
01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:05.210
<v Speaker 3>the ass and a giant circle of impossible</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

1657
01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1658
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:10.520
<v Speaker 3>that's not any more impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe than a galaxy itself.</v>

1659
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way a guy can be,</v>

1660
01:10:12.501 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 3>suck his own dick and fucking himself in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ass flying around a star,</v>

1661
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.360
<v Speaker 3>but shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic balls of gas and slash or water</v>

1662
01:10:20.361 --> 01:10:25.361
<v Speaker 3>and slash or rock that kind of makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense with molten centers shooting live </v>

1663
01:10:25.731 --> 01:10:27.350
<v Speaker 3>out of their tents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:28.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes.</v>

1665
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes more sense than a dude flying</v>

1666
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:32.970
<v Speaker 3>around sucking his own dick of boning </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself in the ass.</v>

1667
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes just as much sense.</v>

1668
01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.020
<v Speaker 3>It's just as ridiculous.</v>

1669
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:41.170
<v Speaker 3>A whole universe filled with a spiral of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian's a trillion light years long.</v>

1670
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 3>All bone in them is less than half as </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacular as a real supernova.</v>

1671
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 3>So I'm really impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not impressed by your performance.</v>

1672
01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to totally do what your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1673
01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.810
<v Speaker 3>your friend does with the stripper </v>
<v Speaker 3>pants.</v>

1674
01:10:56.811 --> 01:10:58.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shave like down,</v>

1675
01:10:58.161 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 3>like my swim trunks down to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really thin layer and then when it often</v>

1676
01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:05.570
<v Speaker 3>comes up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to see again,</v>

1677
01:11:05.571 --> 01:11:07.430
<v Speaker 3>you don't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I said makes sense.</v>

1678
01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:09.110
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1679
01:11:09.111 --> 01:11:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're not going to let you.</v>

1682
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 3>They're</v>

1683
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.450
<v Speaker 1>going to see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna arrest you.</v>

1684
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be a fucking website </v>

1685
01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>dedicated just like they have sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal websites.</v>

1686
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have guys who were even</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about fucking dolphins.</v>

1687
01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:30.050
<v Speaker 1>It's sad enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These poor dolphins are kept in these </v>

1688
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:32.751
<v Speaker 1>cages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wished they were out in the ocean </v>

1689
01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:32.751
<v Speaker 1>chasing fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a good time with each other.</v>

1690
01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Know that we have to contain them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shitty little spot and not even let</v>

1691
01:11:35.281 --> 01:11:40.281
<v Speaker 1>them kill their own fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the big thrill of life </v>

1692
01:11:40.281 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 1>and some asshole thinks it's cute to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1702
01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:04.110

<v Speaker 1>I saw you do it on stage where our </v>

1703
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:05.860
<v Speaker 1>dolphins nipples in the ass hole.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>mother's underbelly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would have known</v>

1732
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.860
<v Speaker 2>they actually brought me to like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>science page or something like I have it</v>

1733
01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:14.560

1736
01:13:17.441 --> 01:13:19.570
<v Speaker 1>a female dolphin nursing.</v>

1757
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.090
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be feeding near fecal matter.</v>

1758
01:14:12.091 --> 01:14:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Why would nature ever set that up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:14:13.921 --> 01:14:17.210

<v Speaker 1>in these slits hidden inside the small </v>
<v Speaker 1>underbelly.</v>

1764
01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Every website that I'm looking at.</v>

1767
01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:35.091

1771
01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.800
<v Speaker 1>They want to find out how dumb people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and whether or not people will </v>

1772
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.081
<v Speaker 1>google things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably an experiment and you </v>

1773
01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:51.911
<v Speaker 1>probably just led to this disinformation</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign because you've been talking </v>

<v Speaker 5>Did you like it was at Dick's house.</v>

1850
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.680
<v Speaker 5>What time did you fall asleep?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I grew up in our,</v>

1851
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:56.580
<v Speaker 5>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my wife nuts,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was totally asleep.</v>

1855
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:04.750
<v Speaker 5>You've got to get your points up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's a new game that you get </v>

1856
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:07.571
<v Speaker 5>your points and like how fast she can </v>
<v Speaker 5>fall asleep in the hobbit and 18 </v>

1857
01:18:07.571 --> 01:18:10.640
<v Speaker 5>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't have to sleep about a half an</v>

1858
01:18:10.641 --> 01:18:11.660
<v Speaker 5>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1859
01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:13.340
<v Speaker 5>the problem with all those movies is.</v>

1860
01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I hate saying this because I even make </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun of people say that.</v>

1861
01:18:16.321 --> 01:18:21.321
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read the books and I read them when I </v>

1862
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:21.321
<v Speaker 3>was a little kid and they were like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of me growing up,</v>

1863
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some watching it and I know that certain</v>

1864
01:18:23.581 --> 01:18:26.460
<v Speaker 3>shit has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you already like it.</v>

1865
01:18:26.461 --> 01:18:31.461
<v Speaker 3>That takes away from a lot of the drama </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the movie because you know all these </v>

1866
01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:31.461
<v Speaker 3>things going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1867
01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:35.331
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how are they going to happen as </v>

1868
01:18:35.331 --> 01:18:35.331
<v Speaker 3>opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1869
01:18:35.331 --> 01:18:38.870
<v Speaker 3>a great film that's entirely original.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this movie is an adaptation of the </v>

1870
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:41.310
<v Speaker 3>novel that you've already read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's that and then there's that.</v>

1871
01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:46.320
<v Speaker 3>There's so much to tell that it takes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long ass time to tell it all and it's </v>

1872
01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.510
<v Speaker 3>just not as enjoyable when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching it in the film forum.</v>

1873
01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Then if you're watching it in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's all this shit that happened </v>

1874
01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:53.850
<v Speaker 3>that it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1875
01:18:53.851 --> 01:18:56.550
<v Speaker 3>it looks really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just some shit happening.</v>

1876
01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Like the scene of they're fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ogres and I'm like,</v>

1877
01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:01.230
<v Speaker 3>spoiler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoiler alert.</v>

1878
01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:03.870
<v Speaker 3>They fight Ogres,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after awhile I'm like,</v>

1879
01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:04.560
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1880
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:06.870
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be fine and let's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch them.</v>

1881
01:19:06.871 --> 01:19:11.871
<v Speaker 3>Cartoon initially have this fight that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has no drama attached to it at all and </v>

1882
01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:13.140
<v Speaker 3>it there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of that,</v>

1883
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:16.260
<v Speaker 3>but the special effects are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>stunning.</v>

1884
01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:19.140
<v Speaker 3>What they can do now is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>stunning.</v>

1885
01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:21.400
<v Speaker 5>What frame rate did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you see the creepy one?</v>

1886
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:22.210
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

1917
01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:35.070
<v Speaker 3>the technology for those things has </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten really,</v>

1918
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:36.130
<v Speaker 3>really powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1919
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.330
<v Speaker 3>I saw a three d television recently at </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those.</v>

1920
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:40.810
<v Speaker 3>What are those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1921
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:45.600
<v Speaker 3>those high end fucking stores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a audio visual store.</v>

1922
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was,</v>

1923
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 3>but we were on the road and we walked </v>
<v Speaker 3>into one of these retail stores and they</v>

1924
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:56.061
<v Speaker 3>had this crazy fucking setup where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really thin glass and that was </v>

1925
01:20:57.421 --> 01:20:58.920
<v Speaker 3>essentially the entire TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1926
01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.830
<v Speaker 3>it was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you put these glasses on it.</v>

1927
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 3>What did we watch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monster's inc.</v>

1928
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1929
01:21:04.670 --> 01:21:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Monsters Inc and three d.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like,</v>

1930
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:13.250
<v Speaker 3>it's such an overwhelming experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's so much more visual input </v>

1931
01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:16.230
<v Speaker 3>coming your way and like this added </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension of it,</v>

1932
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 3>if they could just get it down like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1933
01:21:18.991 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 3>like the perfect way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like really bad at like avatar.</v>

1934
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Avatar I think was way better because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the three days.</v>

1935
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avatar just came out on three day.</v>

1936
01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:28.250
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a three d tv,</v>

1937
01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:30.020
<v Speaker 2>it just finally came out so everyone can</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy.</v>

1938
01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.320
<v Speaker 2>It used to be where you only could buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>it if he bought this $150.</v>

1939
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:35.480
<v Speaker 3>See I feel like if you wear glasses in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your house,</v>

1940
01:21:35.481 --> 01:21:36.380
<v Speaker 3>you might be an asshole.</v>

1941
01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I love it man.</v>

1942
01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I got these new ones off amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just generic for like 20 bucks.</v>

1943
01:21:40.961 --> 01:21:43.330
<v Speaker 2>They just charge it by usb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you always have them charged.</v>

1944
01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:44.860
<v Speaker 2>You just put on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like putting on sunglasses.</v>

1945
01:21:44.861 --> 01:21:46.870
<v Speaker 2>But while you're laying in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think one day we'll look</v>

1946
01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:51.900
<v Speaker 3>back in the day when we'll laugh about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the days when they used to have to wear </v>

1947
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.860
<v Speaker 3>glasses to greedy fucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it'll be like,</v>

1948
01:21:53.861 --> 01:21:58.861
<v Speaker 3>it's ancient data technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean essentially we're trying to </v>

1949
01:21:58.861 --> 01:22:01.471
<v Speaker 3>distort an image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take your glasses off and you </v>

1950
01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:01.471
<v Speaker 3>watched the hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's craziness.</v>

1951
01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's very rarely see what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck's happening.</v>

1952
01:22:02.801 --> 01:22:04.720
<v Speaker 3>It's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he put the glasses on.</v>

1953
01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.660
<v Speaker 3>So somehow or another they need this </v>

<v Speaker 1>no censorship.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The internet is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the wild west and it's free.</v>

2002
01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.650

<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

2004
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Most people are on the internet for at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least an hour a day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a computer at work and you don't have a </v>

<v Speaker 1>lot of shit to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are online all the </v>

2008
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:08.471
<v Speaker 1>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much different is that than real </v>

2009
01:24:08.471 --> 01:24:11.291
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And imagine if real life had no </v>

2010
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:12.110
<v Speaker 1>censorship at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either in real life,</v>

2011
01:24:12.111 --> 01:24:17.111
<v Speaker 1>you could buy all the drugs you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a gun whenever you want it to get a </v>

2012
01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:17.111

2013
01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Even when you do everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do online you could do in real </v>

2014
01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.610
<v Speaker 1>life with no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no restrictions whatsoever.</v>

2015
01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>How many districts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you wonder,</v>

01:24:25.341 --> 01:24:30.341
<v Speaker 1>how much regulation do we actually need </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much could just exist under </v>

2017
01:24:30.341 --> 01:24:31.230
<v Speaker 1>common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean would,</v>

2018
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:36.250
<v Speaker 1>could you allow someone to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>stockpile a fucking huge ammo dump and </v>

2019
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>backyard,</v>

2028
01:24:50.181 --> 01:24:51.290
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you planning on doing?</v>

2029
01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live right down the street.</v>

2030
01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to meet you.</v>

2031
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our kids go to school together I think.</v>

2032
01:24:56.271 --> 01:24:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2033
01:24:56.661 --> 01:24:58.670
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are you an army?</v>

2034
01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:00.800
<v Speaker 1>What's what's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you know?</v>

2035
01:25:00.801 --> 01:25:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Should there be any restrictions </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever?</v>

2036
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:08.350
<v Speaker 1>And if there weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the way people have sort </v>

2037
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.390
<v Speaker 1>of learned how to express themselves on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet.</v>

2038
01:25:08.391 --> 01:25:13.391
<v Speaker 1>I think the internet went through a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad time and now I think it's slowly </v>

2039
01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:16.970
<v Speaker 1>starting to like level out where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are less and less tolerant of assholes.</v>

2040
01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Less and less tolerant of trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less and less.</v>

2041
01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.890
<v Speaker 1>That dude that got busted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like on reddit,</v>

2042
01:25:21.891 --> 01:25:26.891
<v Speaker 1>you know about that story with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's doing a lot of creepy shit online </v>

2043
01:25:26.891 --> 01:25:31.410
<v Speaker 1>like because that's what got them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>like posts and fucked up pictures and </v>

2044
01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:35.230
<v Speaker 1>saying fucked up things about things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people found out who he was in </v>

2045
01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:39.761
<v Speaker 1>real life and they contacted his </v>
<v Speaker 1>employer and he got fired for operating </v>

2046
01:25:39.951 --> 01:25:44.060
<v Speaker 1>under a pseudonym online under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different name than his own.</v>

2047
01:25:44.061 --> 01:25:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Not representing their company in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2048
01:25:45.591 --> 01:25:47.960
<v Speaker 1>shape or form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they established that it was</v>

2049
01:25:47.961 --> 01:25:50.780
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went after him and decided that his</v>

2050
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:54.530
<v Speaker 1>actions and the way he was behaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside during his own free time,</v>

2051
01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.190
<v Speaker 1>they could fire him for that regardless </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how well he performed at work,</v>

2052
01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:02.750
<v Speaker 1>which is really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also sends a message that sends a</v>

2053
01:26:02.751 --> 01:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

2054
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2055
01:26:04.221 --> 01:26:09.221
<v Speaker 1>we're more concerned with humanity than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are with this idea that you have </v>

2056
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:13.280
<v Speaker 1>these irrefutable rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yes,</v>

2057
01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:18.281
<v Speaker 1>you have irrefutable rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're posting pictures of dead </v>

2058
01:26:18.281 --> 01:26:18.281
<v Speaker 1>kids online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might.</v>

2059
01:26:18.281 --> 01:26:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You might be a piece of shit and I might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not want you to have anything to do with</v>

2060
01:26:22.131 --> 01:26:27.110
<v Speaker 1>my life and just because we worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>together like I should be able to remove</v>

2061
01:26:27.111 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be able to stop that.</v>

2062
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sort of the anonymity is </v>

2063
01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:35.480
<v Speaker 1>slowly slipping away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:38.660
<v Speaker 1>But for people that have never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous like me or brian,</v>

2065
01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2066
01:26:39.730 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're better off that way.</v>

2067
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:46.870
<v Speaker 1>You're better off everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be better off for everybody if </v>

2068
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:50.590
<v Speaker 1>we all figured out how to treat each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other a lot better online and be chill </v>

2069
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>and I think people because there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions for a long time,</v>

2070
01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:00.400
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an experience that they </v>

2071
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:00.400
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have had.</v>

2072
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>They had the ability to affect someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nothing coming back your way is the</v>

2073
01:27:03.121 --> 01:27:08.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no social repercussions and that's like </v>

2074
01:27:08.121 --> 01:27:08.121
<v Speaker 1>not normal for humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that in real life.</v>

2075
01:27:08.121 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should you be able to do it online?</v>

2076
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not a setup for it and I think </v>

2077
01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.931
<v Speaker 1>this is a total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a totally new experience that </v>

2078
01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:20.111
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings are culture and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think all cultures in general went into </v>

2079
01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:25.631
<v Speaker 1>this completely ignorant to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions of it to completely </v>

2080
01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:30.641
<v Speaker 1>ignorant to how it was going to operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the effects of human beings and</v>

2081
01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:36.011
<v Speaker 1>human instincts are going to be when </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted with this completely non </v>

2082
01:27:36.011 --> 01:27:39.441
<v Speaker 1>human scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to communicate with people </v>

2083
01:27:39.441 --> 01:27:41.981
<v Speaker 1>who don't know who you are and not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate like you yell something out </v>

2084
01:27:42.501 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 1>from that from a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but write detailed shit about them.</v>

2085
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:50.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and send some mean angry letter to them </v>

2086
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:54.430
<v Speaker 1>and that you could do that and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>burst and had not have anything come </v>

2087
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.430
<v Speaker 1>back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

2088
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 1>because people have this unique ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reach people like that,</v>

2089
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:59.930
<v Speaker 1>it presented this thing that hadn't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolved yet in,</v>

2090
01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.050
<v Speaker 1>in the human body and in the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture in like,</v>

2091
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are our ways of resolving conflicts for </v>

2092
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:08.480
<v Speaker 1>one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been pretty clearly established.</v>

2093
01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people shouldn't,</v>

2094
01:28:09.831 --> 01:28:11.570
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't treat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the bible,</v>

2095
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:12.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2096
01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:14.180
<v Speaker 1>love your brother and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2097
01:28:14.181 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 1>it's all like the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2098
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:21.370
<v Speaker 1>this is the best way to operate a world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to figure out how to resolve </v>

2099
01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:21.370
<v Speaker 1>these conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they're done,</v>

2100
01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 1>they appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2101
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:23.180
<v Speaker 1>these conflicts had never appeared </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2102
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:25.370
<v Speaker 1>They literally didn't exist in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

2103
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that is escaping a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people.</v>

2104
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't really truly wrapped their </v>

2105
01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.621
<v Speaker 1>heads on the insanity that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet and what it's done to human </v>

2106
01:28:35.621 --> 01:28:36.710
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we've,</v>

2107
01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.860
<v Speaker 1>we've sort of wobbled it and I've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way better handle on it now and I think </v>

2108
01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>that you see way less and less douchey </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit way westland,</v>

2109
01:28:43.791 --> 01:28:45.740
<v Speaker 1>less people that will just want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

2110
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 1>It's less like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you could see like statistics</v>

2111
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:51.470
<v Speaker 1>on internet trolling and douchebags on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and stuff like that.</v>

2112
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it's slowly tapered off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2113
01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's just for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's always going to be a good </v>

2114
01:28:58.690 --> 01:28:59.030
<v Speaker 1>supply always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2115
01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.440
<v Speaker 1>just like there's always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys throw shit at other.</v>

2116
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.790
<v Speaker 1>There's always.</v>

2117
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:08.530
<v Speaker 7>But I think it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've even had people online on poker </v>

2118
01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:10.760
<v Speaker 7>like talk crap to me and say how they're</v>
<v Speaker 7>gonna mess me up in vegas and then I see</v>

2119
01:29:10.761 --> 01:29:11.780
<v Speaker 7>him at the table and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

2120
01:29:11.781 --> 01:29:13.970
<v Speaker 7>I'm so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they're trying to be all nice to me</v>

2121
01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:15.830
<v Speaker 7>and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait a second,</v>

2122

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2123
01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.030
<v Speaker 7>you were talking to shit to me online </v>
<v Speaker 7>now you're trying to be my friend.</v>

2124
01:29:20.031 --> 01:29:21.740
<v Speaker 7>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You confront them.</v>

2125
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:23.300
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I should.</v>

2126
01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:25.130
<v Speaker 7>poker players are like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2127
01:29:25.190 --> 01:29:28.100
<v Speaker 7>it's a weird way to make a living man </v>
<v Speaker 7>lot.</v>

2128
01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:33.340
<v Speaker 7>I've met a lot of poker players and </v>
<v Speaker 7>first of all they're all like really </v>

2129
01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.820
<v Speaker 7>intense dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everyone is like an intense and like,</v>

2130
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:38.060
<v Speaker 7>like they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're all very focused,</v>

2131
01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:43.120
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like when you're having conversations </v>

2132
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.651
<v Speaker 7>with them and there's no dumb </v>
<v Speaker 7>professional poker players because it </v>

2133
01:29:44.651 --> 01:29:44.651
<v Speaker 7>doesn't seem like he can really pull </v>
<v Speaker 7>that off.</v>

2134
01:29:44.651 --> 01:29:49.270
<v Speaker 7>Are there that I don't know aBout well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dumb how colleges like a showing or </v>

2135
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:51.320
<v Speaker 7>intelligence in general,</v>

2136
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:54.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between intelligence and education.</v>

2137
01:29:54.441 --> 01:29:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I've met a lot of people that are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated but stupid as fuck.</v>

2138
01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.300
<v Speaker 1>He just repeats shit and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

2139
01:29:59.301 --> 01:30:00.740
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting the connection to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2140
01:30:00.741 --> 01:30:02.480
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

2141
01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.040
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no thinking on their own.</v>

2142
01:30:04.041 --> 01:30:09.041
<v Speaker 1>It's repeating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a lot of people that </v>

2143
01:30:09.041 --> 01:30:09.380
<v Speaker 1>have like bArely a high school diploma </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're sharp as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2145
01:30:09.901 --> 01:30:14.901
<v Speaker 7>it's interesting you just said that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a kid online that didn't </v>

2146
01:30:14.901 --> 01:30:17.301
<v Speaker 7>graduate high school yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He made millions of dollars playing </v>

2147
01:30:17.301 --> 01:30:19.551
<v Speaker 7>poker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Quinn tarantino didn't graduate high </v>

2148
01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:19.551
<v Speaker 7>school.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2149
01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:19.551
<v Speaker 7>mostly we were just talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>django.</v>

2150
01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 7>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Drop days.</v>

<v Speaker 7>A lot of people will not.</v>

2152
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:25.510

<v Speaker 7>that I know even just didn't finish.</v>

2153
01:30:25.511 --> 01:30:25.960

2154
01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.530
<v Speaker 1>out of college with one semester to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2155
01:30:28.531 --> 01:30:33.531
<v Speaker 1>I didn't finish college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did three years at umass boston and </v>

2156
01:30:33.531 --> 01:30:36.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe the only reason I did it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want people thinking I </v>

2157
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:37.260
<v Speaker 1>was a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even come close to grAduating.</v>

2158
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of shit that I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted to.</v>

2159
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Like first of all it's taken like </v>
<v Speaker 1>elective courses.</v>

2160
01:30:42.481 --> 01:30:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I was taking whatever courses I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to because it was on like a,</v>

2161
01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.080
<v Speaker 1>they have a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they had like different programs </v>

2162
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:51.080
<v Speaker 1>for people that had jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2163
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I forget what they call adult education </v>
<v Speaker 1>or secondary education wherever.</v>

2164
01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I took a year off and then I </v>

2165
01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:58.220
<v Speaker 1>started doing this and I was barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention.</v>

2166
01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:58.830
<v Speaker 1>That was barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2167
01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I've learned way more through </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries than I did for those three</v>

2168
01:31:01.651 --> 01:31:06.651
<v Speaker 1>years of showing up at this building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To wonder what the fuck I'm doing with </v>

2169
01:31:06.651 --> 01:31:06.651
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

2170
01:31:06.651 --> 01:31:06.940
<v Speaker 7>I was just talking about this the other </v>
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>

2171
01:31:06.941 --> 01:31:08.200
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>out everything you need to figure out </v>

<v Speaker 7>What's</v>

2177
01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:21.660
<v Speaker 1>dope about college is the college gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>you an opportunity to be excited by new </v>

2178
01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and different people and new points of </v>

<v Speaker 1>And I missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed that.</v>

2180
01:31:26.291 --> 01:31:28.010
<v Speaker 1>That aspect of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of college.</v>

2181
01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:28.990
<v Speaker 1>The social aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't go Anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2183
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I could,</v>

2184
01:31:31.751 --> 01:31:35.350
<v Speaker 1>but when I had graduated high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my competitive taekwondo dance,</v>

2185
01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:40.380
<v Speaker 1>so from 18 through 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like my most competitive days </v>

2186
01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:44.400
<v Speaker 1>when I was completely dedicated to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of me going somewhere else </v>

2187
01:31:44.411 --> 01:31:46.230
<v Speaker 1>to go to school was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I couldn't.</v>

2188
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I had a really good instructor and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good team.</v>

2189
01:31:48.571 --> 01:31:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going anywhere.</v>

2190
01:31:49.541 --> 01:31:54.541
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to move somewhere and go </v>

2191
01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:55.801
<v Speaker 1>to school for what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what the fuck I want </v>

2192
01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:55.801
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no aspirations whatsoever,</v>

2193
01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but I got so tired everybody telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2194
01:31:58.151 --> 01:31:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2195
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:02.590
<v Speaker 1>for awhile I would say I was training </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the olympics because I was trying to</v>

2197
01:32:02.591 --> 01:32:05.220
<v Speaker 1>make the us olympic taekwondo team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2198
01:32:05.221 --> 01:32:06.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave up on saying that,</v>

2199
01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:11.410
<v Speaker 1>but when I started kickboxing I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting beat up and I was like,</v>

2200
01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.330
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking window.</v>

2201
01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Have some fucking holes in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2202
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>So then that stopped wanting to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that,</v>

2203
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to find some other </v>

2204
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>path in life and figure out what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do,</v>

2205
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:28.231
<v Speaker 1>like is terrifying to say to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all I heard out of my own mouth </v>

2206
01:32:28.231 --> 01:32:28.231
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2207
01:32:28.231 --> 01:32:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking loser and I'm always going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a loser.</v>

2208
01:32:29.501 --> 01:32:34.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to be able to take care </v>

2209
01:32:34.501 --> 01:32:34.501
<v Speaker 1>of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I thought of when I said it.</v>

2210
01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:36.970
<v Speaker 1>But today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit man,</v>

2211
01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:42.150
<v Speaker 1>you could learn it least as much online </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you could in a school most likely </v>

2212
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:47.170
<v Speaker 1>more because you're going to have way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more access to information than just the</v>

2213
01:32:47.171 --> 01:32:49.480
<v Speaker 1>few books this one guy subscribes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of a book to you is what it is,</v>

2215

<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it all day,</v>

2216
01:32:54.761 --> 01:32:56.290
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you are.</v>

2217
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.710
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing about online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you got a big phone,</v>

2218
01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.130
<v Speaker 1>one of those tablets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones or something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fucking read like websites and</v>

2220
01:33:03.731 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:07.480
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

2222
01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have a signal that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to you,</v>

2223
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you have access to like pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>every question that's ever been asked </v>

2224
01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.690
<v Speaker 1>the if not the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slew of different competing answers </v>

2225
01:33:18.690 --> 01:33:23.130
<v Speaker 1>that you might not even get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you go to like brigham </v>

2226
01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:23.130
<v Speaker 1>young university and get one opinion,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm saying you got to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be fucking the most </v>

2228
01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.880
<v Speaker 1>devastating thing for like religions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The access to information.</v>

2229
01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 1>The more people are finding out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I remember when I was a catholic,</v>

2230
01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:38.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had friends that were jewish </v>

2231
01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:38.540
<v Speaker 1>because um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the east coast is filled with jewish </v>

2235

<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't understand what the jew,</v>

2237
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I would just hear someone say,</v>

2254
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.080
<v Speaker 1>versions of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I could have gotten online when I was</v>

2256
01:34:36.251 --> 01:34:37.330
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

2257
01:34:37.331 --> 01:34:39.640
<v Speaker 1>when you're six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fucking read kinda,</v>

2258
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.760

2259
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:44.760
<v Speaker 1>you could figure out if you could ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

2263
01:34:52.381 --> 01:34:54.781
<v Speaker 1>good idea of why you shouldn't pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to these crazy fox because </v>

<v Speaker 3>Google that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>

2409
01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sleep tonight.</v>

2410
01:41:13.551 --> 01:41:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2411
01:41:14.541 --> 01:41:17.630
<v Speaker 3>It's an estimation because we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been asked to be on any scale.</v>

2412
01:41:17.631 --> 01:41:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're really counting this.</v>

2413
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Is there a census where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking show up somewhere and count or </v>

2414
01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:26.100
<v Speaker 3>did the girls get to mail in their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

2415
01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Because then we start adding pounds all </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the fucking place because no one's </v>

2416
01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:30.940
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2417
01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:33.810
<v Speaker 3>You don't have those boner pills from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>aunts.</v>

2418
01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:37.130
<v Speaker 3>They're made from an supposedly those </v>
<v Speaker 3>boner pills.</v>

2419
01:41:37.131 --> 01:41:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Like what are they called again?</v>

2420
01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Hot rod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six thousand or 5,000</v>

2421
01:41:41.331 --> 01:41:42.150
<v Speaker 2>hot rod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000.</v>

2422
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:44.000
<v Speaker 2>But supposedly there's ants in them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2423
01:41:44.001 --> 01:41:45.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extract ants.</v>

2424
01:41:45.181 --> 01:41:46.280
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

2425
01:41:46.281 --> 01:41:50.540
<v Speaker 2>So that means there's somebody and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an ant farmer that has distract the</v>

2426
01:41:50.541 --> 01:41:51.800
<v Speaker 2>ants and instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2427
01:41:51.801 --> 01:41:54.370
<v Speaker 2>you buy this little bump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making bone or your</v>

2428
01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.460
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to.</v>

2430
01:41:57.991 --> 01:42:02.991
<v Speaker 3>Before we started talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>online google and find out if they </v>

2431
01:42:02.991 --> 01:42:02.991
<v Speaker 3>actually make this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2432
01:42:02.991 --> 01:42:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

2433
01:42:03.161 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would I,</v>

2434
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:06.040
<v Speaker 2>why would I read a bottle and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2435
01:42:06.041 --> 01:42:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a.</v>

2436
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Why would you read that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A dolphin as nipples inside.</v>

2437
01:42:09.231 --> 01:42:11.510
<v Speaker 3>It's because I can show you five </v>
<v Speaker 3>websites that say that.</v>

2438
01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:11.930
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2439
01:42:11.931 --> 01:42:14.600
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can show me one website that has one</v>

2440
01:42:14.601 --> 01:42:17.120
<v Speaker 3>article and they all copied it and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>it on their website.</v>

2441
01:42:17.121 --> 01:42:19.880
<v Speaker 3>I looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same exact story verbatim.</v>

2442
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2443
01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:25.170
<v Speaker 2>well this is on the actual bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so unless they just decided to like,</v>

2444
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.850
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

2445
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:31.930
<v Speaker 3>It says it has aunts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something an extract.</v>

2446
01:42:31.931 --> 01:42:36.070
<v Speaker 3>It's an ant extract type in x and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're calling it,</v>

2447
01:42:36.071 --> 01:42:37.360
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking cialis,</v>

2448
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:38.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that um,</v>

2449
01:42:38.890 --> 01:42:41.530
<v Speaker 3>that brazilian wandering spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're trying to figure out</v>

2450
01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:46.531
<v Speaker 3>what that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it causes erections and they're </v>

2451
01:42:46.531 --> 01:42:47.230
<v Speaker 3>going to try to turn that into like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next supervisor aggro.</v>

2452
01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.840
<v Speaker 3>You've heard of That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brazilian wondering spider.</v>

2453
01:42:49.841 --> 01:42:53.980
<v Speaker 3>It kills you and gives you this </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable boner before you die.</v>

2454
01:42:53.981 --> 01:42:58.981
<v Speaker 3>Most people die of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently if you live your dick's </v>

2455
01:42:58.981 --> 01:42:58.981
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

2456
01:42:58.981 --> 01:43:00.220
<v Speaker 3>it's like taking an engine and just red </v>
<v Speaker 3>lining.</v>

2457
01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2458
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:03.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2459
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:08.910
<v Speaker 3>it's hitting the fucking the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tac officer and then it just </v>

2460
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:09.080
<v Speaker 3>explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The engine blows up.</v>

2461
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:11.700
<v Speaker 3>So most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2462
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 3>they don't live from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do live your dick's broken.</v>

2463
01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:19.321
<v Speaker 3>So they're trying to take that as smart </v>
<v Speaker 3>people would turn that into a boner </v>

2464
01:43:19.321 --> 01:43:19.321
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

2465
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Here's the extract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one is just another one super aunt </v>

2466
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.910
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2467
01:43:24.911 --> 01:43:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you can buy it for $34 and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>extracted aunts and they're wildly used.</v>

2468
01:43:29.081 --> 01:43:31.690
<v Speaker 2>An agent promotes strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual vego law,</v>

2469
01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.320
<v Speaker 2>vigor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vigor,</v>

2470
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:37.860
<v Speaker 2>powerpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti aging thing.</v>

2471
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:39.370
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have all these ants.</v>

2472
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.030
<v Speaker 2>There's so much fucking that a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>all have boners the same error</v>

2473
01:43:44.130 --> 01:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>knucklehead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're talking about the </v>

2474
01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>same ants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

2475
01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>I bet that's a very specific type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

2476
01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Does the fda have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when 50 percent ground raw and</v>

2477
01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 5>extra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does it say that ground raw aunts and </v>

2478
01:43:58.130 --> 01:43:58.130
<v Speaker 5>aunt extract?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2479
01:43:58.130 --> 01:44:02.860
<v Speaker 5>What that means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've taken a bunch of ants and </v>

2480
01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 5>extracted it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So each book,</v>

2481
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:05.490
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm sending each pill you </v>
<v Speaker 5>take.</v>

2482
01:44:05.491 --> 01:44:09.540
<v Speaker 5>IT's like $500 million ants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably boners all adds up.</v>

2483
01:44:09.541 --> 01:44:10.620
<v Speaker 5>And it analogy is that</v>

2484
01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 1>they have celery and celery juice </v>
<v Speaker 1>altogether in the same bowl,</v>

2485
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:17.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aunt and the aunt extract.</v>

2486
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:18.780
<v Speaker 1>So there's crush up the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2487
01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:23.570
<v Speaker 1>So the aunt is like the hard part and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the extract is like the gooey stuff</v>

2488
01:44:23.571 --> 01:44:25.400
<v Speaker 1>that keeps it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2489
01:44:25.401 --> 01:44:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably does nothing.</v>

2490
01:44:26.590 --> 01:44:31.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to create a salamander pill </v>
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow that makes yoU live 10 yearS </v>

2491
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:32.800
<v Speaker 5>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People will Buy it.</v>

2492
01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:35.020
<v Speaker 5>I might give you one of theSe hot duncan</v>
<v Speaker 5>swears by it.</v>

2493
01:44:35.021 --> 01:44:36.160
<v Speaker 5>Now I wonder what</v>

2494
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:40.210
<v Speaker 1>like who writes these supplement </v>
<v Speaker 1>critiques?</v>

2495
01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:44.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's like all talking about how hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cockiness.</v>

2496
01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of this stuff before though.</v>

2497
01:44:48.131 --> 01:44:53.131
<v Speaker 1>It's called um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uri coma long full leah and it's </v>

2498
01:44:54.701 --> 01:44:57.580
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be a natural testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>booster also.</v>

2499
01:44:57.581 --> 01:44:58.950
<v Speaker 1>This stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2500
01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I think this stuff has a lot of shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that's probably would give you a </v>

2501
01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:04.690
<v Speaker 1>boner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the aunt,</v>

2502
01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:05.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's.</v>

2503
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:06.620
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the things.</v>

2504
01:45:06.621 --> 01:45:08.440
<v Speaker 5>It's just one of the ingredients in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2505
01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:09.870
<v Speaker 5>but that long fully shit</v>

2506
01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:12.250
<v Speaker 1>that is supposed to be a testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>booster.</v>

2507
01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of those is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>called tongue got ali.</v>

2508
01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.590
<v Speaker 1>That's supposed to be a natural and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tribulus,</v>

2509
01:45:17.591 --> 01:45:22.060
<v Speaker 1>which everybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which apparently varies pretty widely in</v>

2510
01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:27.450
<v Speaker 1>strength and efficacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sorta like garlic or some </v>

2511
01:45:27.611 --> 01:45:28.900
<v Speaker 1>things like you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get garlic,</v>

2512
01:45:28.901 --> 01:45:30.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not that strong and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get it.</v>

2513
01:45:30.431 --> 01:45:31.720
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

2514
01:45:31.721 --> 01:45:36.721
<v Speaker 1>this is powerful garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like the way a tomato tastes like a </v>

2515
01:45:36.721 --> 01:45:40.381
<v Speaker 1>beef steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomatoes from someone's backyard versus </v>

2516
01:45:40.381 --> 01:45:40.900
<v Speaker 1>one of those pale tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd get that same sort of shit</v>

2517
01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:45.901
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of these herbal supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you could get that stuff like </v>

2518
01:45:45.901 --> 01:45:49.720
<v Speaker 1>from the plant instead of like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground up powdered bullshit.</v>

2519
01:45:49.721 --> 01:45:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you get like tribulus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think tribulus or route,</v>

2520
01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:53.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a route?</v>

2521
01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you get that shit right from </v>

2522
01:45:59.040 --> 01:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>the tree,</v>

<v Speaker 5>these pills.</v>

2525
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:05.470

<v Speaker 5>you can fuck your shit up really bad.</v>

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.900
<v Speaker 1>you're a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't mix,</v>

2549
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:58.120

<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

2550
01:46:58.220 --> 01:46:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

2551
01:46:59.090 --> 01:47:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be doing it well and you </v>

2552
01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:04.090
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use that stuff.</v>

2554
01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You smoke it.</v>

2555
01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:08.690
<v Speaker 2>When I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm on ecstasy,</v>

2556
01:47:08.691 --> 01:47:13.691
<v Speaker 2>I usually don't drink that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually just drink orange juice and </v>

2557
01:47:13.691 --> 01:47:14.930
<v Speaker 2>water and gatorade and fucking tons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and appeal it,</v>

2558
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:15.210
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

2559
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:18.220
<v Speaker 1>there's several dangers and combining </v>
<v Speaker 1>viagara and ecstasy.</v>

2560
01:47:18.221 --> 01:47:23.221
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soc is a powerful mind altering drug </v>

2561
01:47:23.221 --> 01:47:23.221
<v Speaker 1>that impairs judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I talked like that,</v>

2562
01:47:23.221 --> 01:47:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it means I'm reading something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combining it with viagra.</v>

2563
01:47:24.911 --> 01:47:28.120
<v Speaker 1>It encourages people to engage in unsafe</v>
<v Speaker 1>and risky sexual behavior,</v>

2564
01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:31.420
<v Speaker 1>aka brian's whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2565
01:47:31.421 --> 01:47:33.400
<v Speaker 1>so you're saying that it's dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

2566
01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:38.820
<v Speaker 1>public health officials feel this combo </v>
<v Speaker 1>will increase the spread of aids and </v>

2567
01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:39.220
<v Speaker 1>slash or other sexually transmitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

2568
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:41.530
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a real medical issue,</v>

2569
01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.180
<v Speaker 1>here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2570
01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't say that first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't believe them because that </v>

2571
01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.620
<v Speaker 1>saying that first means that the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing is to stop,</v>

2572
01:47:50.621 --> 01:47:52.480
<v Speaker 1>but sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're trying to do.</v>

2573
01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:57.540
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to stop aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to say that people are going to </v>

2574
01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:58.000
<v Speaker 1>get sexually crazy and sexually risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2575
01:47:58.001 --> 01:48:00.490
<v Speaker 1>That is not an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell me what I'm going to do.</v>

2576
01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2577
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I can handle Being drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't drive when I'm drunk,</v>

2578
01:48:03.731 --> 01:48:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't get fucked up and go buttfuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2579
01:48:06.690 --> 01:48:11.690
<v Speaker 2>What you're telling me that ecstasy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a touching drug that when you have </v>

2580
01:48:11.690 --> 01:48:13.710
<v Speaker 2>a raging boner on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty dangerous.</v>

2581
01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's dangerous at all.</v>

2582
01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's dangerous for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like cars are dangerous for some </v>

2583
01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:21.700
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give them a cell phone,</v>

2584
01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:23.810
<v Speaker 1>they text because some people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty fucking self control,</v>

2585
01:48:24.170 --> 01:48:26.480
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2586
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:29.840
<v Speaker 1>there's no like argument medically in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2587
01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean there might be this thing called </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and [inaudible] is like the </v>

2588
01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:35.370
<v Speaker 1>boners that won't go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2589
01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:40.070
<v Speaker 1>that's just from taking ecstasy or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>viagara rather that you can get that in </v>

2590
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:42.140
<v Speaker 1>a viagara situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the fact that you're on ecstasy,</v>

2591
01:48:42.250 --> 01:48:44.570
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it worse because now every time</v>

2592
01:48:44.571 --> 01:48:46.370
<v Speaker 1>you take guys like better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>need to have somebody swallow that.</v>

2594
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:54.870
<v Speaker 1>So few people have that problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those boner pills where they actually </v>

2595
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:55.790
<v Speaker 1>have to go to a doctor because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that,</v>

2596
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:59.090
<v Speaker 1>that that's like an erection that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go to a doctor for,</v>

2597
01:48:59.091 --> 01:48:59.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2600
01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 2>It even says on the commercial owners </v>
<v Speaker 2>may last up to three days</v>

<v Speaker 1>the erection,</v>

<v Speaker 1>kill your dick.</v>

01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Just like the brazilian wandering spider</v>
<v Speaker 1>can kill your dick.</v>

2604
01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:16.530

<v Speaker 1>The exact same thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>dark beard and somebody put that online,</v>

<v Speaker 3>rhubarb rhubarb with the wolverine </v>
<v Speaker 3>avatar,</v>

2641
01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:18.720
<v Speaker 3>so you know he's got some taste powerful</v>
<v Speaker 3>x men fan and this guy has a some sort </v>

2642

<v Speaker 3>of a g string type thing up his butt </v>
<v Speaker 3>crack and he's very well built and it </v>

2643
01:51:24.301 --> 01:51:27.100
<v Speaker 3>looks very handsome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps middle eastern art or spanish,</v>

2644
01:51:27.101 --> 01:51:29.320
<v Speaker 3>maybe a spaniard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like a thick weightlifting.</v>

2645
01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Dave navarro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a nice,</v>

2646
01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:33.670
<v Speaker 3>thick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solid and tight as the underground would</v>

2647
01:51:33.671 --> 01:51:34.450
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2648
01:51:34.451 --> 01:51:35.560
<v Speaker 3>he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big boy.</v>

2649
01:51:35.561 --> 01:51:37.000
<v Speaker 3>That guy's got some horsepower to his.</v>

2650
01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:42.190
<v Speaker 2>So you're an ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But viagra in a waterbed at a fucking w.</v>

2651
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:44.610
<v Speaker 3>It's looks like we're gonna fight to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

2652
01:51:44.730 --> 01:51:49.730
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think they're trying to </v>

2653
01:51:49.730 --> 01:51:51.651
<v Speaker 3>say with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To try and not do it or fighting to the </v>

2654
01:51:51.651 --> 01:51:51.651
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think is going to happen.</v>

2655
01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.910
<v Speaker 3>If you insist on pursuing this line</v>

2656
01:51:58.330 --> 01:51:59.460
<v Speaker 1>of action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

2657
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:04.680
<v Speaker 1>we will have to fight to the death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only other thing is the ecstasy </v>

2658
01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:09.670
<v Speaker 1>causes high blood pressure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydration and that viagra only worsens</v>

2659
01:52:09.671 --> 01:52:14.671
<v Speaker 1>those effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that means to me is that you </v>

2660
01:52:14.671 --> 01:52:14.671
<v Speaker 1>have to drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't be stupid.</v>

2661
01:52:14.671 --> 01:52:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes when you're on ecstasy,</v>

2662
01:52:15.301 --> 01:52:20.301
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to even drink anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you're going to puke it </v>

2663
01:52:20.301 --> 01:52:20.301
<v Speaker 2>back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know</v>

2664
01:52:20.301 --> 01:52:20.301
<v Speaker 1>what I didn't hear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hear?</v>

2665
01:52:20.301 --> 01:52:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear cancer.</v>

2666
01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear any of the shit that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would keep me from doing ecstasy and and</v>

2667
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:27.700
<v Speaker 1>viagra at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard nothing.</v>

2668
01:52:27.701 --> 01:52:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this kills you,</v>

2669
01:52:29.231 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>

2670
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm getting out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you die from ecstasy and viagara </v>

2671
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:36.310
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of a not saying you should take</v>

2672
01:52:36.311 --> 01:52:37.960
<v Speaker 1>viagra and excess together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2673
01:52:37.961 --> 01:52:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying you definitely shouldn't take</v>
<v Speaker 1>viagra and extra city.</v>

2674
01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say nothing before the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying you shouldn't for spiritual </v>

2675
01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:46.800
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know when you're involved in</v>

2676
01:52:46.801 --> 01:52:48.780
<v Speaker 1>that ecstasy feely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touchy thing,</v>

2677
01:52:48.810 --> 01:52:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it should be nonsexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be that you can't get it up.</v>

2678
01:52:51.670 --> 01:52:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Just enjoy it as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything doesn't have to be about </v>

2679
01:52:56.670 --> 01:52:56.970
<v Speaker 1>sticking your dirty loads places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brian.</v>

2680
01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be inside of us to be</v>

2681
01:53:00.331 --> 01:53:02.640
<v Speaker 1>all about you shooting loads all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the place.</v>

2682
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:05.130
<v Speaker 1>How will you let it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pow and just be in the moment.</v>

2683
01:53:05.131 --> 01:53:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Hold hands with somebody.</v>

2684
01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:11.280
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I masturbated and it used a paper towel </v>

2685
01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:15.151
<v Speaker 5>to clean up and it's through it on my </v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee table and then my friend came </v>

2686
01:53:15.151 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 5>over and we were watching a show and she</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes like,</v>

2698
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.350
<v Speaker 1>statue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2700
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 5>That's cool as fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

2701
01:53:51.130 --> 01:53:51.970
<v Speaker 5>that's your tattoo.</v>

2702
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly like pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just made in a physical form with the</v>

2703
01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:59.340
<v Speaker 1>third eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it like that is like this.</v>

2704
01:53:59.341 --> 01:54:01.860
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this position that this thing is.</v>

2705
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't ask him to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's hilarious is that this is </v>

2706
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:11.211
<v Speaker 1>exactly the reason I got this tattoo is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had this crazy dmt trip that </v>

2707
01:54:12.091 --> 01:54:17.091
<v Speaker 1>really like made me reassess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>RealIty made me reassess my life and one</v>

2708
01:54:17.521 --> 01:54:21.000
<v Speaker 1>of the most humbling aspects of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip,</v>

2709
01:54:21.001 --> 01:54:26.001
<v Speaker 1>there was an infinite series of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden buddhas that was flying in front </v>

2710
01:54:26.001 --> 01:54:29.400
<v Speaker 1>of me and trying to explain like </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive energy in life to me.</v>

2711
01:54:29.850 --> 01:54:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned it into a tattoo and it </v>

2712
01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:37.380
<v Speaker 1>literally looked like that in the dmt </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>

2713
01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Like literally looked just like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2714
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:44.870
<v Speaker 1>except it was made out of some strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of light and there was no borders </v>

2715
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:45.210
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense.</v>

2716
01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:48.250
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't do.</v>

2717
01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Dmt has this very intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost like a two d sort of a thing</v>

2718
01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:59.520
<v Speaker 1>that happens sometimes where everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of seems connected on one plane,</v>

2719
01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but then you realize that it's just this</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy sort of fractal thing going on.</v>

2720
01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And when that was happening in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip,</v>

2721
01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:09.630
<v Speaker 1>this is what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw these things just like everywhere.</v>

2722
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Would it mean to you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was high as fuck kind of question.</v>

2723
01:55:13.771 --> 01:55:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

2724
01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:17.970
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can never.</v>

2725
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Who knows when you're out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>

2726
01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.510
<v Speaker 1>there's so mucH different shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2727
01:55:21.690 --> 01:55:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Like for anybody to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that this happened.</v>

2728
01:55:23.731 --> 01:55:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I know that that happened and I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>said those things you can't eat right.</v>

2729

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck happened </v>

2730
01:55:32.210 --> 01:55:32.210
<v Speaker 1>were interpretation and you're on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy drug man.</v>

2731
01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2732
01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't really bank on any one </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible answer to any of your shit.</v>

2733
01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:39.330
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

<v Speaker 1>do you smoke when you do hormone?</v>

2738
01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Dependent upon the area of I'm sure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

2739
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:57.430

<v Speaker 1>weed and some spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 8>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Definitely it makes me more clear about,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how many do you take?</v>

2749
01:56:18.450 --> 01:56:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Usually just to do you take it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you do an event?</v>

2750
01:56:21.511 --> 01:56:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you do it?</v>

2751
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:27.620
<v Speaker 8>Like when I play online,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like on sundays is the biggest day for </v>

2752
01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:27.620
<v Speaker 8>poker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I'll take it like when I wake up,</v>

2753
01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:29.250
<v Speaker 8>like when I'm making my shake or </v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

2754
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I take four before every ufc for four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2755
01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It says on here you should only take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximum for.</v>

2756
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2757
01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Says do not seek four capsules in 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

2758
01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I violated that too.</v>

2759
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Should I say for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't listen to me,</v>

2760
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:56:44.101 --> 01:56:46.240
<v Speaker 1>If I'm doing it like a ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all you have fcs.</v>

2762
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot that's going on like when </v>

2763
01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a fight and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to describing </v>

2764
01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:58.071
<v Speaker 1>ground positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to coordinate your </v>

2765
01:56:58.071 --> 01:56:58.071
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2766
01:56:58.071 --> 01:57:02.091
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his right foot in this </v>

2767
01:57:02.091 --> 01:57:03.981
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what he's got to do to finish this </v>

2768
01:57:03.981 --> 01:57:03.981
<v Speaker 1>off because he's got to turn his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2769
01:57:03.981 --> 01:57:08.601
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to get his left foot </v>

2770
01:57:08.601 --> 01:57:08.980
<v Speaker 1>underneath his right knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I got to get this all done.</v>

2771
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I have to get it all out in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be able to </v>

2772
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:14.000
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

2773
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.680
<v Speaker 1>While the fight is actually happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I gotta kind of like manage.</v>

2774
01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:21.740
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all I have to see what he's </v>

2775
01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:23.031
<v Speaker 1>doing so I have to know what direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can do and what the counter could </v>

2776
01:57:23.031 --> 01:57:26.571
<v Speaker 1>possibly be and then when I see a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>going after and I wanted to get the </v>

2777
01:57:26.571 --> 01:57:29.481
<v Speaker 1>audience excited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say this is where he's in </v>

2778
01:57:29.481 --> 01:57:29.481
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see this,</v>

2779
01:57:29.481 --> 01:57:29.481
<v Speaker 1>this is pulling down on his neck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2780
01:57:29.481 --> 01:57:31.980
<v Speaker 1>he's in a bad situation here and if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could get his leg over here,</v>

2781
01:57:31.981 --> 01:57:33.270
<v Speaker 1>then it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2782
01:57:33.271 --> 01:57:36.520
<v Speaker 1>and the alpha brain and any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any nootropics.</v>

2783
01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I took that neuro one ship before I took</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2784
01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I noticed a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that I could get sentences </v>

2785
01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:43.880
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear my thoughts,</v>

2786
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:45.580
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts,</v>

2787
01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:50.780
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts for it seemed like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate it easier and it just makes </v>

2788
01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:50.780
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

2789
01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's isolated a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different shit that improves your memory</v>

2790
01:57:52.321 --> 01:57:57.321
<v Speaker 1>statistically proven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can see people taking it and </v>

2791
01:57:57.321 --> 01:58:00.070
<v Speaker 1>then people have done double blind tests</v>
<v Speaker 1>on different nootropics when it comes to</v>

2792
01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:05.240
<v Speaker 1>memory enhancement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's like prasad tam and a bunch </v>

2793
01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.380
<v Speaker 1>of different ones that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and it as this caffeine,</v>

2794
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:12.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caffeine has a performance enhancing </v>

2795
01:58:12.381 --> 01:58:12.381
<v Speaker 1>quality to it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2796
01:58:12.381 --> 01:58:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Because you're more jacked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some shit going.</v>

2797
01:58:13.891 --> 01:58:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why you can only take in </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain.</v>

2798
01:58:16.321 --> 01:58:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I think of the olympics and I think even</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Nevada state athletic commission,</v>

2799
01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.200
<v Speaker 1>they have a limit to how much caffeine </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fighter can have in their system.</v>

2800
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that she also had actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of hip to that because he does it </v>

2801
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:31.701
<v Speaker 1>in a pill form to make sure that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>never takes more than than you're </v>

2802
01:58:31.701 --> 01:58:33.270
<v Speaker 1>supposed to because you could get like </v>
<v Speaker 1>starbucks,</v>

2803
01:58:33.271 --> 01:58:35.070
<v Speaker 1>like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a venti.</v>

2804
01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:40.130
<v Speaker 1>If you have a starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>venti and you compare that to like </v>

2805
01:58:40.130 --> 01:58:40.130
<v Speaker 1>coffee that you're going to get at </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerry's deli.</v>

2806
01:58:40.130 --> 01:58:41.920
<v Speaker 1>This is a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2807
01:58:41.970 --> 01:58:43.260
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends who makes it to.</v>

2808
01:58:43.261 --> 01:58:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be just different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2809
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:46.810
<v Speaker 1>but more or less in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2810
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:49.530
<v Speaker 1>The starbucks ones haven't seen amounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of caffeine.</v>

2811
01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:53.850
<v Speaker 1>So you might be possible to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>like piss hot for caffeine.</v>

2812
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:59.030
<v Speaker 1>If you drank like a bunch of a it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many you would have to </v>

2813
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.900
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many mentees?</v>

2814
01:58:59.910 --> 01:59:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could only drink a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you die.</v>

2815
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:09.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dudes could drink that shit all </v>

2816
01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:11.960
<v Speaker 1>day following day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fully got to a point where he was </v>

2817
01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:16.430
<v Speaker 1>drinking so much coffee a day that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a drink it black because he was </v>

2818
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:19.560
<v Speaker 1>drinking several quarts of half and half</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>

2819
01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:22.830
<v Speaker 1>What saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2820
01:59:22.831 --> 01:59:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to.</v>

2821
01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2822
01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:27.870
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves coffee.</v>

2823
01:59:27.930 --> 01:59:30.450
<v Speaker 1>He used to drink it by the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get him back on the podcast.</v>

2824
01:59:30.451 --> 01:59:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of love the fuck out of that dude.</v>

2825
01:59:32.490 --> 01:59:34.540
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>

2826
01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:40.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't the caffeine khan listed for </v>

2827
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:43.040
<v Speaker 1>starbucks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beverage is apparently people want </v>

2828
01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.050
<v Speaker 1>caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Content is variable and starbucks </v>

2829
01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:47.031
<v Speaker 1>currently doesn't have any quantitative </v>
<v Speaker 1>caffeine information for all of our </v>

2830
01:59:47.031 --> 01:59:50.361
<v Speaker 1>beverages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We intend on adding caffeine in </v>

2831
01:59:50.361 --> 01:59:50.361
<v Speaker 1>information in a future upgrade.</v>

2832
01:59:50.361 --> 01:59:51.110
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We into.</v>

2833
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:53.520
<v Speaker 5>We don't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

2834
01:59:53.521 --> 01:59:55.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost shaking.</v>

2835
01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:57.600
<v Speaker 5>Why am I shaking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I know to my coffee,</v>

2836
01:59:57.670 --> 02:00:00.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if they even tested like they,</v>

2837
02:00:00.841 --> 02:00:02.670
<v Speaker 5>even though they probably test it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2838
02:00:02.671 --> 02:00:05.880
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck that closed the door </v>
<v Speaker 5>light.</v>

2839
02:00:05.881 --> 02:00:08.820
<v Speaker 5>This place on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kill everybody that saw the results.</v>

2840
02:00:09.050 --> 02:00:14.050
<v Speaker 5>We got to retreat and figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to tell people before we </v>

2841
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:14.050
<v Speaker 5>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet starbucks,</v>

2842
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:18.290
<v Speaker 5>not only would they not tested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they should find out what equipment is </v>

2843
02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:20.790
<v Speaker 5>used to test caffeine levels and buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>them all out and burn them.</v>

2844
02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:22.460
<v Speaker 5>Blow them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2845
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:23.760
<v Speaker 5>Because it's really clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are</v>

2846
02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>red line people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking gills.</v>

2847
02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know what we're doing a</v>

2848
02:00:28.471 --> 02:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2849
02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>there's apparently there's a caffeine </v>
<v Speaker 1>database.</v>

2850
02:00:32.101 --> 02:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>You can find out how much different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have in it and uh,</v>

2851
02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>it's all about milligrams per fluid </v>
<v Speaker 1>ounce.</v>

2852
02:00:40.230 --> 02:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And like say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you would go with like a red bull.</v>

2853
02:00:43.081 --> 02:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we could find red bull </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2854
02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are crazy mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>

2855
02:00:49.770 --> 02:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>There's something called 50 1:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>juice.</v>

2856
02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has 6,000</v>

2857
02:00:57.330 --> 02:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>milligrams of caffeine per port,</v>
<v Speaker 1>per every 500 fluid ounces.</v>

2858
02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:10.130
<v Speaker 5>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lived mostly off just a trenta a day </v>

2859
02:01:10.130 --> 02:01:10.130
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coconut water,</v>

2860
02:01:10.130 --> 02:01:10.130
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2861
02:01:10.130 --> 02:01:10.490
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2862
02:01:10.491 --> 02:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

2863
02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>How is it 500 fluid ounces?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's too low.</v>

2864
02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Of course it would be much larger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else's because everybody else </v>

2865
02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>is like 11 fluid ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six fluid ounces.</v>

2866
02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>So this is 500 flu announces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

2867
02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>And measuring it for a jug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so stupid.</v>

2868
02:01:26.141 --> 02:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did that even get included?</v>

2869
02:01:28.021 --> 02:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't even</v>

2870
02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:31.520
<v Speaker 5>because most people can't do the math to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get it done to where it needs to be.</v>

2871
02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500,</v>

2872
02:01:33.130 --> 02:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying,</v>

2873
02:01:34.531 --> 02:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a trenta</v>

2874
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:38.410
<v Speaker 5>I haven't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty good on caffeine nowadays.</v>

2875
02:01:38.411 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 5>I usually drink a trenta</v>

2876
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coconut water and water most of the </v>

2877
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.310
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time now.</v>

2878
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:50.170
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on those five hour energy </v>

2879
02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:50.480
<v Speaker 2>drinks a lot lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything negative with drinking</v>

2880
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2881
02:01:51.051 --> 02:01:52.670
<v Speaker 2>because they're mostly what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be 12?</v>

2882
02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2883
02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be 12.</v>

2884
02:01:53.791 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Was water soluble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You piss it out if you have too much and</v>

2885
02:01:56.061 --> 02:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very healthy.</v>

2886
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 is a really good supplement.</v>

2887
02:01:59.740 --> 02:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>More people should be on b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve is great for your immune system.</v>

2888
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 is just a good all around energy </v>

2889
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.611
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good that like and people that </v>

2890
02:02:10.611 --> 02:02:12.531
<v Speaker 1>work crazy hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games sometimes like those guys </v>

2891
02:02:12.531 --> 02:02:13.120
<v Speaker 1>that are forced to work like 16 hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

2892
02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>like many days in a row and then trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to complete a people on sets.</v>

2893
02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>They give them b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 shots.</v>

2894
02:02:18.421 --> 02:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super common.</v>

<v Speaker 1>12 shots.</v>

2896
02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Then wrestlers do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of wrestlers do that before they </v>

2897
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.261
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll take like an intramuscular v12 </v>

2898
02:02:30.261 --> 02:02:30.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so.</v>

2899
02:02:30.261 --> 02:02:33.261
<v Speaker 1>It's that healthy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's way better than starbucks </v>

2900
02:02:33.261 --> 02:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>because starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean although it is delicious and I'm </v>

2901
02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:39.741
<v Speaker 1>drinking some right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fucking caffeine in </v>

<v Speaker 1>get at a diner.</v>

2904
02:02:44.130 --> 02:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>The average cup of coffee and eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>ounce cup of coffee has a hundred and 80</v>

2905

<v Speaker 1>milligrams of caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a venti starbucks has 415 as tested in </v>

2906

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2909
02:02:59.641 --> 02:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>it might've been one really strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>batch.</v>

2910
02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many batches they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested.</v>

2911
02:03:03.301 --> 02:03:08.301
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this guy just made all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these numbers up and put it on his </v>

2912
02:03:08.301 --> 02:03:08.301
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

2913
02:03:08.301 --> 02:03:10.760
<v Speaker 2>starbucks itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a caffeine free,</v>

2914
02:03:10.761 --> 02:03:13.820
<v Speaker 2>decaffeinated coffee that they add 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2915
02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that is good idea,</v>

2916
02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2917

2918
02:03:21.690 --> 02:03:24.120
<v Speaker 1>has caffeine in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just very small amounts.</v>

2919
02:03:24.150 --> 02:03:25.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2920
02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.360
<v Speaker 1>It has quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2921
02:03:27.361 --> 02:03:30.300
<v Speaker 1>some people say that there are decaf </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

2922
02:03:30.301 --> 02:03:33.060

2927
02:03:47.941 --> 02:03:50.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not a little amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'S a lot.</v>

2928
02:03:50.670 --> 02:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>How much caffeine?</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

2940
02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you there's caffeine in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2941
02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:27.560
<v Speaker 2>So you play a lot of online pokers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>debbie noticed that there's a lot of </v>

2942
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:28.590
<v Speaker 2>cheaters online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a lot of programs?</v>

2943
02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it even fair to play online nowadays?</v>

2944
02:04:31.050 --> 02:04:32.840
<v Speaker 2>is a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2945
02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll just address that by telling you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2946
02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 2>When I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

2947
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:43.190
<v Speaker 8>was in the library,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know how they have those cubicles </v>

2948
02:04:43.190 --> 02:04:43.680
<v Speaker 8>with computers in them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was walking by and I,</v>

2949
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:48.710
<v Speaker 8>this was just when I got into poker and </v>
<v Speaker 8>I looked in one and there was a guy </v>

2950
02:04:48.710 --> 02:04:49.350
<v Speaker 8>playing poker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I was like,</v>

2951
02:04:49.351 --> 02:04:54.351
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>knock on the door and see what's going </v>

2952
02:04:54.351 --> 02:04:54.351
<v Speaker 8>on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Knock on the door.</v>

2953
02:04:54.351 --> 02:04:58.400
<v Speaker 8>He opens up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's playing on the computer that they </v>

2954
02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:01.521
<v Speaker 8>have there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's playing on a laptop and then </v>

2955
02:05:01.521 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 8>another laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now that wouldn't be that abnormal.</v>

2956
02:05:04.381 --> 02:05:09.381
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's playing the same six player </v>

2957
02:05:09.381 --> 02:05:11.541
<v Speaker 8>tournament on all three.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So he essentially cs six cards out of </v>

2958
02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:15.480
<v Speaker 8>52,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which gives you a gigantic advantage.</v>

2959
02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:16.800
<v Speaker 8>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's shooting.</v>

2960
02:05:16.801 --> 02:05:21.801
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So he's playing as three different </v>

2961
02:05:21.801 --> 02:05:21.801
<v Speaker 8>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's playing us.</v>

2962
02:05:21.801 --> 02:05:21.801
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>exactly.</v>

2963
02:05:21.801 --> 02:05:22.650
<v Speaker 8>So there's six people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a call to sit and go.</v>

2964
02:05:22.651 --> 02:05:26.390
<v Speaker 8>So six people enter and then top to get </v>
<v Speaker 8>paid is illegal.</v>

2965
02:05:26.490 --> 02:05:27.450
<v Speaker 8>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2966
02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:28.560
<v Speaker 8>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

2967
02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:30.910
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So yeah,</v>

2968
02:05:30.911 --> 02:05:32.460
<v Speaker 8>it happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Caffeine,</v>

2969
02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>content of decaf is a much less.</v>

2970
02:05:35.550 --> 02:05:40.550
<v Speaker 1>It says to label it decaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must have at least 97 percent of the </v>

2971
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:44.271
<v Speaker 1>caffeine removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that leaves about five milligrams as </v>

2972
02:05:44.271 --> 02:05:46.860
<v Speaker 1>compared to 100 to 150 for six ounces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>brewed coffee.</v>

2973
02:05:46.861 --> 02:05:51.861
<v Speaker 1>They're saying 150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one I think said a little bit </v>

2974
02:05:51.861 --> 02:05:51.861
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's variable obviously.</v>

2975
02:05:51.861 --> 02:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>And as they're talking about six ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's um,</v>

2976
02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.250
<v Speaker 1>that's five milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very much.</v>

2977
02:05:56.350 --> 02:05:57.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that.</v>

2978
02:05:57.950 --> 02:06:00.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's definitely not going in.</v>

2979
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:03.480
<v Speaker 1>But if you're sensitive to caffeine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you drink quite a few of those,</v>

2980
02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.530
<v Speaker 1>you got to think five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

2981
02:06:04.531 --> 02:06:05.310
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

2982
02:06:05.311 --> 02:06:10.311
<v Speaker 1>like it started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're starting to get to a point </v>

2983
02:06:10.311 --> 02:06:12.111
<v Speaker 1>where you might feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as opposed to like 100 which was </v>

2984
02:06:12.111 --> 02:06:12.111
<v Speaker 1>like a regular cup of coffee or more.</v>

2985
02:06:12.111 --> 02:06:16.450
<v Speaker 2>So to a point it is broken the online </v>
<v Speaker 2>poker because you can pretty much Just </v>

2986
02:06:16.450 --> 02:06:20.471
<v Speaker 2>gang up on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like a single new person sitting </v>

2987
02:06:20.471 --> 02:06:24.701
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just pretty much play all the </v>

2988
02:06:24.701 --> 02:06:24.701
<v Speaker 2>other characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking rolled again.</v>

2989
02:06:24.701 --> 02:06:27.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>so the problem is with cash games and </v>

2990
02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:27.800
<v Speaker 8>with,</v>
<v Speaker 8>with smaller tournaments,</v>

2991
02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:28.740
<v Speaker 8>when you get bigger tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have 10,000</v>

2992
02:06:28.741 --> 02:06:30.420
<v Speaker 8>players in them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not such a big deal.</v>

2993
02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:35.840
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's definitely some cheating going </v>

2994
02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:35.840
<v Speaker 8>on and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2995
02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:36.960
<v Speaker 8>I've had multiple times where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's something fishy going on here.</v>

2996
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:41.340
<v Speaker 8>What about bots behind an issue?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not really.</v>

2997
02:06:41.341 --> 02:06:46.341
<v Speaker 8>They can be like low stakes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when you get people that recognize </v>

2998
02:06:46.341 --> 02:06:48.080
<v Speaker 8>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 8>good players that recognize patterns,</v>

2999
02:06:48.081 --> 02:06:50.040
<v Speaker 8>they're going to know you're a button,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just take advantage of it.</v>

3000
02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.410
<v Speaker 8>But when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3001
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:53.160
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I heard this has been done,</v>

3002
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:58.220
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if it's still being done,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but let's say if you would go into a </v>

3003
02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:01.491
<v Speaker 8>room and it was like a six person table,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like they're allowed to have artificial </v>

3004
02:07:01.491 --> 02:07:02.970
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're allowed to have,</v>

3005
02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.880
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they could run a bot that's playing you.</v>

3006
02:07:06.150 --> 02:07:07.140
<v Speaker 8>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3007
02:07:07.150 --> 02:07:07.710
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

3008
02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:08.830
<v Speaker 8>it's allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3009
02:07:08.850 --> 02:07:10.260
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it's allowed.</v>

3010
02:07:10.261 --> 02:07:11.850
<v Speaker 8>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when the sites find them,</v>

3011
02:07:11.851 --> 02:07:12.900
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they shut them down.</v>

3012
02:07:13.170 --> 02:07:14.070
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's,</v>

3013
02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:15.690
<v Speaker 8>that's just misinformation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3014
02:07:15.930 --> 02:07:19.920
<v Speaker 8>So if someone says that they played </v>
<v Speaker 8>against three bots and one other dude,</v>

3015
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:21.180
<v Speaker 8>it's not right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3016
02:07:21.181 --> 02:07:24.180
<v Speaker 8>they may have been but,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's not like it's not illegal.</v>

3017
02:07:24.181 --> 02:07:25.320
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're not supposed to do that.</v>

3018
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:30.350
<v Speaker 8>Where is it legal to gamble now?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Still not legal to gamble if it's an </v>

3019
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.690
<v Speaker 8>american website,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

3020
02:07:30.691 --> 02:07:33.750
<v Speaker 8>We're not allowed to play poker.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm home skins consulting adults.</v>

3021
02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:35.960
<v Speaker 8>You're not even allowed to play poker </v>
<v Speaker 8>poker with money.</v>

3022
02:07:35.961 --> 02:07:36.920
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We can do that still,</v>

3023
02:07:36.921 --> 02:07:40.230
<v Speaker 8>but only only in vegas and casinos and </v>
<v Speaker 8>casinos.</v>

3024
02:07:40.650 --> 02:07:45.650
<v Speaker 1>You're at home like are you allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a poker game with a bunch of your </v>

3025
02:07:45.650 --> 02:07:48.191
<v Speaker 1>friends and you have like stacks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds on the table and getting crazy </v>

3026
02:07:48.191 --> 02:07:48.191
<v Speaker 1>and drinking.</v>

3027
02:07:48.191 --> 02:07:48.191
<v Speaker 8>Is that illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

3028
02:07:48.191 --> 02:07:48.220
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yes.</v>

3029
02:07:48.610 --> 02:07:49.660
<v Speaker 8>The way it is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like if,</v>

3030
02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:51.670
<v Speaker 8>if the house takes a rake,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's illegal.</v>

3031
02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:53.920
<v Speaker 8>If you're just playing with your friends</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>

3032
02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:55.510
<v Speaker 8>it seems like five bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You say,</v>

3033
02:07:55.511 --> 02:08:00.511
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we'll play for five bucks and what have </v>

3034
02:08:00.511 --> 02:08:00.511
<v Speaker 8>you played for $50,000?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's fine.</v>

3035
02:08:00.511 --> 02:08:00.511
<v Speaker 8>I think as long as there's no rape being</v>
<v Speaker 8>collected.</v>

3036
02:08:00.511 --> 02:08:01.120
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3037
02:08:01.450 --> 02:08:03.310
<v Speaker 8>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't actually,</v>

3038
02:08:03.311 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 8>I don't know that for a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I'm pretty sure that's where it is.</v>

3039
02:08:06.041 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 8>I feel like you would have to pay taxes </v>
<v Speaker 8>on that shit and then it's illegal,</v>

3040
02:08:09.011 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 8>but still have to pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have to,</v>

3041
02:08:10.601 --> 02:08:12.490
<v Speaker 8>you have to claIm the claim it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3042
02:08:12.670 --> 02:08:17.670
<v Speaker 8>That's another reason why they made it </v>
<v Speaker 8>illegal here is because the taxes were </v>

3043
02:08:17.670 --> 02:08:21.751
<v Speaker 8>just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they were not being paid by a lot of </v>

3044
02:08:21.751 --> 02:08:22.510
<v Speaker 8>people because it's based off shore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was based in Ireland,</v>

3045
02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:25.420
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>england and Costa Rica.</v>

3046
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:26.510
<v Speaker 8>What were the three big assignment?</v>

3047
02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3048
02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:32.250
<v Speaker 1>irs problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could they deny the entire.</v>

3049
02:08:32.370 --> 02:08:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like as a technology issue,</v>

3050
02:08:34.021 --> 02:08:36.600
<v Speaker 1>how could you deny an entire industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't getting paid off.</v>

3051
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:41.670
<v Speaker 8>It's about the money.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're not getting revenue because the </v>

3052
02:08:41.670 --> 02:08:43.951
<v Speaker 8>sites are based offshore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so they're only getting revenue when </v>

3053
02:08:43.951 --> 02:08:43.951
<v Speaker 8>people pay their taxes.</v>

3054
02:08:43.951 --> 02:08:48.530
<v Speaker 1>People that have sites on shore and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the money from that and then say,</v>

3055
02:08:48.590 --> 02:08:53.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then say if you have an offshore </v>

3056
02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:53.590
<v Speaker 1>when you have to pay taxes on it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get you.</v>

3057
02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:57.330
<v Speaker 8>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of thIngs in this world </v>

3058
02:08:57.330 --> 02:08:57.330
<v Speaker 8>that just don't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could fix so much.</v>

3059
02:08:57.330 --> 02:08:58.180
<v Speaker 8>Just simple logic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>logic.</v>

3060
02:08:58.330 --> 02:08:59.910
<v Speaker 8>Hey listen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's,</v>

3061
02:08:59.911 --> 02:09:02.500
<v Speaker 8>it's incredibly terrible that I have to </v>
<v Speaker 8>play.</v>

3062
02:09:02.650 --> 02:09:03.890
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like Mexico.</v>

3063
02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:05.080
<v Speaker 8>I'm right on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's beautiful.</v>

3064
02:09:05.081 --> 02:09:09.430

<v Speaker 8>but like that where you live right now?</v>

<v Speaker 8>a lot of things about the states,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like the law,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I went for a run on the beach and </v>

02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:48.450
<v Speaker 8>a cliff and it's kind of a secluded on </v>
<v Speaker 8>one end and there were two people just </v>

3084
02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:50.500
<v Speaker 8>banging it out rigHt there hanging out </v>

<v Speaker 8>that's fine.</v>

3086

3089
02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:01.320
<v Speaker 8>I was looking right in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What I'm saying is you don't see,</v>

3090

3108
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:43.640
<v Speaker 8>So you have to be in Mexico to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't put like if I was right here and</v>

3109
02:10:43.641 --> 02:10:45.170
<v Speaker 8>I tried to fire it up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it wouldn't let me.</v>

3110
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:46.840
<v Speaker 8>The ip will be blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

3111
02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.600
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And not only that,</v>

3112
02:10:50.601 --> 02:10:55.601
<v Speaker 8>but now there's millions and millions of</v>
<v Speaker 8>dollars that's doj has seized from full </v>

3113
02:10:55.601 --> 02:10:57.410
<v Speaker 8>tilt poker.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's just sitting there.</v>

3114
02:10:57.411 --> 02:11:00.260
<v Speaker 8>We haven't been paid that back yet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>so what they basically did was they shut</v>

3115
02:11:00.261 --> 02:11:01.610
<v Speaker 8>the site's down.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was,</v>

3116
02:11:01.611 --> 02:11:03.470
<v Speaker 8>I think it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>April 15th,</v>

3117
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:08.890
<v Speaker 8>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They shut all the sites down and if you </v>

3118
02:11:08.890 --> 02:11:10.630
<v Speaker 8>had money online deck went to the doj </v>
<v Speaker 8>and now you have to sub.</v>

3119
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:14.000
<v Speaker 8>You have to ask them for your money back</v>
<v Speaker 8>and we still can't get our money back.</v>

3120
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:16.220
<v Speaker 8>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Good.</v>

3121
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:18.400
<v Speaker 8>Be creepy government.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is.</v>

3122
02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:20.990
<v Speaker 8>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Creepy fucking government,</v>

3123
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:21.940
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

3124
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:23.390
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm just baffled that,</v>

3125
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:25.760
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>against other consenting adults.</v>

3126
02:11:25.761 --> 02:11:27.580
<v Speaker 8>I can't play poker with them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3127
02:11:28.150 --> 02:11:29.210
<v Speaker 8>it's really gross.</v>

3128
02:11:29.290 --> 02:11:34.290
<v Speaker 3>We allow grown adults to tell us what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can and can't do when it comes to </v>

3129
02:11:34.290 --> 02:11:36.580
<v Speaker 3>situations like this that is not in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not.</v>

3130
02:11:36.610 --> 02:11:39.670
<v Speaker 3>That's not a tax issue because it should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be completely unrelated.</v>

3131
02:11:39.810 --> 02:11:44.810
<v Speaker 3>How how you pay your taxes should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>your personal responsibility based on </v>

3132
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:44.830
<v Speaker 3>what your actually income is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

3133
02:11:44.831 --> 02:11:46.540
<v Speaker 3>If you want to hide your gambling </v>
<v Speaker 3>income,</v>

3134
02:11:46.690 --> 02:11:49.210
<v Speaker 3>they should be able to find out or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>only make $50,000</v>

3135
02:11:49.211 --> 02:11:51.220
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you have a $300,000</v>

3136
02:11:51.221 --> 02:11:52.450
<v Speaker 3>car?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So oh,</v>

3137
02:11:52.451 --> 02:11:57.451
<v Speaker 3>let's go online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See this motherfucker plays poker all </v>

3138
02:11:57.451 --> 02:11:57.451
<v Speaker 3>day and he's not reporting his winnings </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm all for that.</v>

3139
02:11:57.451 --> 02:11:59.020
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody should have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>their share,</v>

3140
02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:00.880
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't be able to tell me </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I can do.</v>

3141
02:12:01.330 --> 02:12:02.350
<v Speaker 8>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I agree.</v>

3142
02:12:02.351 --> 02:12:03.010
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can see.</v>

3143
02:12:03.011 --> 02:12:08.011
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can google anyone's name and see </v>

3144
02:12:08.011 --> 02:12:08.011
<v Speaker 8>what they've won.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's just,</v>

3145
02:12:08.011 --> 02:12:08.011
<v Speaker 8>it's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's all.</v>

3146
02:12:08.011 --> 02:12:08.890
<v Speaker 8>It's all public because when you cash in</v>
<v Speaker 8>a tournament,</v>

3147
02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:09.880
<v Speaker 8>it shows it online.</v>

3148
02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what about didn't know what was</v>

3149
02:12:12.730 --> 02:12:17.730
<v Speaker 3>it filled?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Full tilt poker that got busted for </v>

3150
02:12:17.730 --> 02:12:17.730
<v Speaker 3>fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who got busted for fraud?</v>

3151
02:12:17.730 --> 02:12:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Absolute poker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute poker.</v>

3152
02:12:18.590 --> 02:12:18.950
<v Speaker 3>What would they do?</v>

3153
02:12:18.970 --> 02:12:21.730
<v Speaker 8>They had a guy that basically could see </v>
<v Speaker 8>your whole cards,</v>

3154
02:12:24.730 --> 02:12:26.490
<v Speaker 8>like an admin,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but yeah,</v>

3155
02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:29.010
<v Speaker 8>he liked recreated some kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I dunno,</v>

3156
02:12:29.050 --> 02:12:34.050
<v Speaker 8>I'm not very computer savvy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but something that he could see every </v>

3157
02:12:34.050 --> 02:12:37.021
<v Speaker 8>card at the table and what he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 8>was he was just winning these insane </v>

3158
02:12:37.021 --> 02:12:38.350
<v Speaker 8>amounts of money and not even trying to </v>
<v Speaker 8>hide it.</v>

3159
02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:40.710
<v Speaker 8>LIke for example,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3160
02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:44.500
<v Speaker 8>when he won a tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he made a call at the last one,</v>

3161
02:12:44.501 --> 02:12:47.170
<v Speaker 8>the last car.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The river came out with 10 high.</v>

3162
02:12:47.171 --> 02:12:48.210
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if you play poker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>

3163
02:12:48.211 --> 02:12:51.340
<v Speaker 8>but basically a call that you would net </v>
<v Speaker 8>that I've never met in my life.</v>

3164
02:12:51.850 --> 02:12:52.840
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3165
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:57.990
<v Speaker 8>Never because it's never good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>and he was right because he could see </v>

3166
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:57.990
<v Speaker 8>the guys cards,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's like,</v>

3167
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.540
<v Speaker 8>how are you going to be that blatant </v>
<v Speaker 8>about it?</v>

3168
02:12:58.541 --> 02:13:03.541
<v Speaker 8>If you could see that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why would you not just play cool a </v>

3169
02:13:03.541 --> 02:13:03.940
<v Speaker 8>little bit more discreet.</v>

<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3227
02:15:08.401 --> 02:15:10.800

<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>To play a round of golf for a million </v>

3242
02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:52.220
<v Speaker 7>bucks.</v>

3243
02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:52.220
<v Speaker 7>But that's so normal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>isn't it?</v>

3244
02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:53.350
<v Speaker 7>Will you do those guys for them?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3245

<v Speaker 7>I don't bet a million dollars.</v>

3246
02:15:55.621 --> 02:16:00.621
<v Speaker 7>Have you ever had a crazy bad about </v>
<v Speaker 7>something like who's going to lose the </v>

3247
02:16:00.621 --> 02:16:03.771
<v Speaker 7>most about a way to take the longest </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit or because that's the kind of </v>

3248
02:16:03.771 --> 02:16:03.771
<v Speaker 7>things they bet on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3249
02:16:03.771 --> 02:16:05.310
<v Speaker 7>I could ship the longest complete shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever.</v>

3250
02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:10.340
<v Speaker 7>We bet on a lot of weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like we bet one time we met a guy that </v>

3251
02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:10.950
<v Speaker 7>he wouldn't take a shot glass full of </v>
<v Speaker 7>like steak rub.</v>

3252
02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:12.780
<v Speaker 7>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3253
02:16:12.850 --> 02:16:13.980
<v Speaker 7>he was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A little water.</v>

3254
02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:17.040
<v Speaker 7>He did you know that that guy could die </v>
<v Speaker 7>if that's all salt.</v>

3255
02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:19.680
<v Speaker 7>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think if you eat like a pound of salt,</v>

3256
02:16:19.681 --> 02:16:24.681
<v Speaker 7>you could die.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess the shot glass is not a pound </v>

3257
02:16:24.681 --> 02:16:28.240
<v Speaker 7>shot glass,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but be submitted in that stake rep is </v>

3258
02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:29.530
<v Speaker 7>like more granulated space in between.</v>

3259
02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:31.730
<v Speaker 7>It's not as heavY as like morton salt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3260
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:33.940
<v Speaker 7>Like if you drank a shot glass of morton</v>
<v Speaker 7>salt,</v>

3261
02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:37.420
<v Speaker 7>that would be impressive as fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's dig.</v>

3262
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:39.400
<v Speaker 7>rob's not quite heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like a.</v>

3263
02:16:39.430 --> 02:16:42.370
<v Speaker 7>That's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you can stay in a pool for 24 hours,</v>

3264
02:16:42.371 --> 02:16:45.220
<v Speaker 7>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The state in a pool for 24 hours.</v>

3265
02:16:45.221 --> 02:16:47.380
<v Speaker 7>Who did that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't remember his name,</v>

3266
02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:49.960
<v Speaker 7>but he did take probably because he died</v>
<v Speaker 7>in that pool.</v>

3267
02:16:50.290 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what about that guy?</v>

<v Speaker 7>Bet by getting breast implants for a </v>

<v Speaker 7>parallel parks for you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that has been nana's.</v>

3323
02:18:57.210 --> 02:18:58.270

<v Speaker 7>Parks for you.</v>

3325
02:18:59.830 --> 02:19:02.020
<v Speaker 7>Cameras in the front,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cameras in the rear,</v>

3326
02:19:02.021 --> 02:19:05.620
<v Speaker 7>you know all this different shit that </v>
<v Speaker 7>makes it run perfect.</v>

3327
02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:08.230
<v Speaker 7>So it's amazing how like computer </v>
<v Speaker 7>control and all these things.</v>

3328
02:19:08.231 --> 02:19:10.720
<v Speaker 7>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't wait until five to 10 years from</v>

3329
02:19:10.721 --> 02:19:13.920
<v Speaker 7>now will be the google car.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The car that's driving around now.</v>

3330
02:19:13.921 --> 02:19:15.090
<v Speaker 7>That's going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>

3331
02:19:15.570 --> 02:19:17.410
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to lose all your fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3332
02:19:17.411 --> 02:19:19.390
<v Speaker 7>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

3333
02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:21.580
<v Speaker 7>It should be that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You should have the option to do it that</v>

3334
02:19:21.590 --> 02:19:24.670
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck that way.</v>

3335
02:19:24.671 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 7>or it's just on a table.</v>
<v Speaker 7>you should</v>

3336
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.460
<v Speaker 3>be able to have the option to either </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the google car.</v>

3337
02:19:30.470 --> 02:19:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Not like being able to almost like ride </v>
<v Speaker 3>a train.</v>

3338
02:19:32.331 --> 02:19:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Like I just want to be fun for long </v>
<v Speaker 3>trips,</v>

3339
02:19:35.001 --> 02:19:38.000
<v Speaker 3>like a five hour drive and just sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>there with your ipad or watch a movie.</v>

3340
02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:41.090
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be able to avoid all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other crazy assholes.</v>

3341
02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have google cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3342
02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:46.130
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can switching lanes and shit and make it</v>

3343
02:19:46.131 --> 02:19:51.131
<v Speaker 3>even hit the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd probably be sitting there with no </v>

3344
02:19:51.131 --> 02:19:51.131
<v Speaker 3>seatbelt to get in an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably not.</v>

3345
02:19:51.131 --> 02:19:54.930
<v Speaker 3>The lag is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they ever figure out that </v>

3346
02:19:54.930 --> 02:19:56.771
<v Speaker 3>this accidents that are caused by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>google car that w or caused because the </v>

3347
02:19:56.771 --> 02:20:00.881
<v Speaker 3>google car couldn't respond as quickly </v>
<v Speaker 3>or as precisely as a person could where </v>

3348
02:20:00.881 --> 02:20:01.420
<v Speaker 3>there was options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google car,</v>

3349
02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:03.080
<v Speaker 3>car trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shitty option.</v>

3350
02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm done with engines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

3351
02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm like living right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this right now.</v>

3352
02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we get to enjoy this.</v>

3353
02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allegedly I took that car up to 1:40.</v>

3354
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allegedlY.</v>

3355
02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:14.720
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fast.</v>

3356
02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:17.270
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a wheel fall off fast feeling.</v>

3357
02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:22.360
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's interesting because I'm </v>

3358
02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:22.360
<v Speaker 3>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also took my old saab up to $100.</v>

3359
02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:23.600
<v Speaker 3>It was shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3360
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:25.180
<v Speaker 3>This one was clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's big difference,</v>

3361
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.440
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those japanese engineers,</v>

3362
02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:29.960
<v Speaker 3>they're not fucking playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not playing around.</v>

3363
02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:35.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that one crazy lexis </v>

3364
02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:36.440
<v Speaker 3>that they held the ls lf lfo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lfo.</v>

3365
02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Elephants lfa and say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jesus,</v>

3366
02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:44.220
<v Speaker 3>they had one and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I went to vegas to get my car </v>

3367
02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:47.291
<v Speaker 3>serviced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have one in the showroom and I was </v>

3368
02:20:47.291 --> 02:20:47.291
<v Speaker 3>just like a half a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3369
02:20:47.291 --> 02:20:47.291
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3370
02:20:47.291 --> 02:20:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I think they stopped making them though </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they only had a certain amount.</v>

3371
02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they made like $300.</v>

3372
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:53.050
<v Speaker 3>How much was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>300.</v>

3373
02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:58.060
<v Speaker 3>I think it's super duper expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just weird that it was like </v>

3374
02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:01.990
<v Speaker 3>performance wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't really much better than a </v>

3375
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:04.130
<v Speaker 3>nissan gtr if better at all that she saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>something where they raised those two,</v>

3376
02:21:04.131 --> 02:21:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was pretty comparable.</v>

3377
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gtr is a $100,000</v>

3378
02:21:08.121 --> 02:21:11.480
<v Speaker 3>car and it's a monster and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>another same coin.</v>

3379
02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:16.840
<v Speaker 3>That's an insane piece of engineering </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also something that apparently </v>

3380
02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:16.880
<v Speaker 3>nissan doesn't really even make any </v>
<v Speaker 3>money on it.</v>

3381
02:21:16.881 --> 02:21:19.460
<v Speaker 3>They just wanted to prove a point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of a country move.</v>

3382
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:22.910
<v Speaker 3>They're like put out a better car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheaper and like deal with it.</v>

3383
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:24.530
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your prices are way too high.</v>

3384
02:21:24.531 --> 02:21:27.140
<v Speaker 3>We're going to bring them down like good</v>
<v Speaker 3>luck for rory.</v>

3385
02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:29.420
<v Speaker 3>How much is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>$300,000</v>

3386
02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:30.590
<v Speaker 3>to come up with that number.</v>

3387
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to know how they come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that number,</v>

3388
02:21:32.061 --> 02:21:33.710
<v Speaker 3>how much it costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen it?</v>

3389
02:21:33.711 --> 02:21:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Ferrari factory does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're artisans.</v>

3390
02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:41.170
<v Speaker 3>They're big difference between like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferrari and a like just if you're going </v>

3391
02:21:41.931 --> 02:21:46.931
<v Speaker 3>to buy a ferrari,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to buy something that's </v>

3392
02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:47.330
<v Speaker 3>made by craftsmen like the leather </v>
<v Speaker 3>stitching.</v>

3393
02:21:47.331 --> 02:21:52.331
<v Speaker 3>The dash has done by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The car's engines pieced together by a </v>

3394
02:21:52.331 --> 02:21:53.960
<v Speaker 3>bunch of specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TheY all do it in this gigantic,</v>

3395
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:59.230
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean warehouse where they eat espresso </v>

3396
02:21:59.230 --> 02:22:02.200
<v Speaker 3>at lunch and take two hour naps and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these are like artists and they put </v>

3397
02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:02.750
<v Speaker 3>together these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these machines that are.</v>

3398
02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:05.810
<v Speaker 3>They're not just beautiful and not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like perfect engineering,</v>

3399
02:22:05.811 --> 02:22:10.811
<v Speaker 3>but it sounded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can construct it like there's just </v>

3400
02:22:10.811 --> 02:22:14.491
<v Speaker 3>like a feeling to them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're into watches and he pick </v>

3401
02:22:14.491 --> 02:22:18.081
<v Speaker 3>up a rolex and feel the automatic timer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and know that someone like put all that </v>

3402
02:22:18.081 --> 02:22:21.611
<v Speaker 3>shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something to mechanical things </v>

3403
02:22:21.611 --> 02:22:24.880
<v Speaker 3>that are created by the human hand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes him like really special to us and </v>

3404
02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 3>you don't really get that with the gtr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

3405
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is designed by man and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3406
02:22:27.991 --> 02:22:32.991
<v Speaker 1>But what you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this feeling of this crazy </v>

3407
02:22:32.991 --> 02:22:33.900
<v Speaker 1>technological marvel like you get in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you feel like,</v>

3408
02:22:33.930 --> 02:22:35.680
<v Speaker 1>you know the lights come on though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3409
02:22:35.681 --> 02:22:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3410
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:37.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the engine revs up.</v>

3411
02:22:37.441 --> 02:22:40.920
<v Speaker 1>You hear the turbines like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a fucking spaceship.</v>

3412
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:42.180
<v Speaker 1>This thing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

3413
02:22:42.210 --> 02:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>some crazy piece of the most advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>automobile technology available,</v>

3414
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:51.590
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't feel like an old ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you started up and he had a bomb</v>

3415
02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:58.520
<v Speaker 1>and you realize some of the italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes built this thing and stitch these </v>

3416
02:22:58.520 --> 02:22:59.140
<v Speaker 1>seats together by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you pull the seatbelt,</v>

3417
02:22:59.141 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 1>it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone made all this shit.</v>

3418
02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel that leather steering wheel and</v>

3419
02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:08.260
<v Speaker 1>like everything's mechanical and moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shifter and hearing the clickety </v>

3420
02:23:08.641 --> 02:23:10.200
<v Speaker 1>clack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about like,</v>

3421
02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:14.040
<v Speaker 1>man created things that in my opinion is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3422
02:23:14.390 --> 02:23:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like art in a physical form that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional and that you use,</v>

3423
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:20.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's this.</v>

3424
02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Whenever someone tells me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3425
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:23.880
<v Speaker 1>don't even like cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3426
02:23:23.881 --> 02:23:28.881
<v Speaker 1>cars are stupid to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A car's just gets you where you want to </v>

3427
02:23:28.881 --> 02:23:28.881
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3428
02:23:28.881 --> 02:23:32.091
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever driven a shelby mustang?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you even know what the fuck you're </v>

3429
02:23:32.091 --> 02:23:32.091
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3430
02:23:32.091 --> 02:23:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like that feeling when you hit</v>

3431
02:23:33.211 --> 02:23:38.211
<v Speaker 1>the gas and you hear and feel those </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tires squeaking a little bit </v>

3432
02:23:38.211 --> 02:23:39.810
<v Speaker 1>because they're trying to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>traction because there's so much fucking</v>

3433
02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:40.350
<v Speaker 1>horsepower</v>

3434
02:23:40.930 --> 02:23:42.310
<v Speaker 8>then you're not alive,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

3435
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:43.870
<v Speaker 8>You're not alive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You really need a prius.</v>

3436
02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:46.330
<v Speaker 8>You got to try that one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So at least it's a good feeling.</v>

3437
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:48.310
<v Speaker 8>It is a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Amazing.</v>

3438
02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:51.250
<v Speaker 8>Especially when you do standard because </v>
<v Speaker 8>then you really feel like you're part of</v>

3439
02:23:51.251 --> 02:23:53.230
<v Speaker 8>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That I'll make that lexis so standard.</v>

3440
02:23:53.530 --> 02:23:58.530
<v Speaker 8>Even though the wall that I can bring it</v>
<v Speaker 8>in and I can actually do up and down </v>

3441
02:23:58.530 --> 02:23:58.930
<v Speaker 8>with the shifter,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's not the same because you know,</v>

3442
02:23:58.931 --> 02:24:03.931
<v Speaker 8>you don't have the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's like being a little kid in high </v>

3443
02:24:03.931 --> 02:24:05.851
<v Speaker 8>school.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It does not drive a stick shift and you </v>

3444
02:24:05.851 --> 02:24:07.590
<v Speaker 8>pretending to shifting the gears and </v>
<v Speaker 8>your role and exactly what it is and it </v>

3445
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:12.330
<v Speaker 8>won't even actually there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's things put in place where you </v>

3446
02:24:12.330 --> 02:24:12.330
<v Speaker 8>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it'll,</v>

3447
02:24:12.330 --> 02:24:12.330
<v Speaker 8>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it'll,</v>

3448
02:24:12.330 --> 02:24:14.620
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>gear up even if you don't.</v>

3449
02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:16.540
<v Speaker 8>Because if you could take it to a </v>
<v Speaker 8>certain point.</v>

3450
02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:18.010
<v Speaker 8>So it's not really real.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3451
02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:19.390
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's bullshit.</v>

3452
02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:21.040
<v Speaker 8>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My m three has that.</v>

3453
02:24:21.041 --> 02:24:22.340
<v Speaker 8>They have a doubles watch.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3454
02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 8>It's nice and it's great for traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

3455
02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:25.050
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and it's,</v>

3456
02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:26.640
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's way more efficient</v>

3457
02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:31.680
<v Speaker 1>than you would ever be with a clutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So clutch is kind of stupid in the long </v>

3458
02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:32.530
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is that mechanical feeling.</v>

3459
02:24:32.531 --> 02:24:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing of shifting your own gears and</v>

3460
02:24:34.811 --> 02:24:35.950
<v Speaker 1>turning on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing,</v>

3461
02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:38.660
<v Speaker 1>steering wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thrill to that that like,</v>

3462
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:41.620
<v Speaker 1>it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even about speeding,</v>

3463
02:24:41.890 --> 02:24:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have you ever driven one of those </v>

3464
02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:46.930
<v Speaker 1>really old porsches and I was like 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>

3465
02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:48.190
<v Speaker 1>like 69,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70,</v>

3466
02:24:48.191 --> 02:24:53.191
<v Speaker 1>71.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really tiny little mechanical </v>

3467
02:24:53.191 --> 02:24:53.191
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the engine in the back.</v>

3468
02:24:53.191 --> 02:24:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all screwy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hit too much gas.</v>

3469
02:24:55.001 --> 02:24:57.610
<v Speaker 1>He goes side with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only have like 150 horsepower.</v>

3470
02:24:57.611 --> 02:24:59.410
<v Speaker 1>They're not heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reallY light,</v>

3471
02:24:59.650 --> 02:25:02.200
<v Speaker 1>but you feel everything in that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get out.</v>

3472
02:25:02.201 --> 02:25:07.201
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're going 40 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get out of the car with a big smile </v>

3473
02:25:07.201 --> 02:25:07.201
<v Speaker 1>on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was fucking cool.</v>

3474
02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:09.580
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've lost something.</v>

3475
02:25:09.581 --> 02:25:14.581
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot more to get us to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling in like some crazy technological</v>

3476
02:25:14.681 --> 02:25:15.670
<v Speaker 1>marvel like alexa.</v>

3477
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:16.230
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3478
02:25:16.231 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 8>I think it's more like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you feel lIke you're,</v>

3479
02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:20.240
<v Speaker 8>you're actually doing something in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>cars,</v>

3480
02:25:20.250 --> 02:25:21.990
<v Speaker 8>not just driving for you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know what I mean?</v>

3481
02:25:22.350 --> 02:25:22.740
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're,</v>

3482
02:25:23.370 --> 02:25:23.910
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>exactly.</v>

3483
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:25.660
<v Speaker 7>Moving it along this car.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3484
02:25:25.661 --> 02:25:28.610
<v Speaker 7>I don't even know what someone's buttons</v>
<v Speaker 7>do and they're just like,</v>

3485
02:25:29.350 --> 02:25:31.450
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you find out about traction control</v>

3486
02:25:31.451 --> 02:25:33.520
<v Speaker 7>and stability control and like they </v>
<v Speaker 7>literally,</v>

3487
02:25:33.521 --> 02:25:35.560
<v Speaker 7>they're going around a corner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If one wheel starts spinning,</v>

3488
02:25:35.561 --> 02:25:38.140
<v Speaker 7>they'll hit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they'll apply brakes to it and like only</v>

3489
02:25:38.141 --> 02:25:42.100
<v Speaker 7>break one wheel and turned the car this </v>
<v Speaker 7>way to try to balance it out.</v>

3490
02:25:42.101 --> 02:25:44.290
<v Speaker 7>It'll turn you out a fishtails yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's amazing.</v>

3491
02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:47.140
<v Speaker 7>Especially that gtr gtr is incredible </v>
<v Speaker 7>for that.</v>

3492
02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:49.770
<v Speaker 7>Like all the guys who review it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

3493
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:54.790
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they'll joke around about taking on a </v>

3494
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.790
<v Speaker 7>race track,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just trying to throw it into the corners</v>

3495
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:56.380
<v Speaker 7>and the car just figures out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>it and corrects itself.</v>

3496
02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:00.340
<v Speaker 7>Which is really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want some asshole in some 1970</v>

3497
02:26:00.341 --> 02:26:05.341
<v Speaker 7>porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's gonna fucking kick out sideways </v>

3498
02:26:05.341 --> 02:26:07.801
<v Speaker 7>on him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>EverY time he goes around a corner and </v>

3499
02:26:07.801 --> 02:26:07.801
<v Speaker 7>gives it the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want that.</v>

3500
02:26:07.801 --> 02:26:11.130
<v Speaker 7>You want that asshole to drive the gtr.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then in order for him to get his </v>

3501
02:26:11.130 --> 02:26:12.220
<v Speaker 7>asshole kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's got to go a lot faster.</v>

3502
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:14.950
<v Speaker 7>You got to go a lot faster.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One 40,</v>

3503
02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:16.780
<v Speaker 7>you've got to hit that gas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>feel,</v>

3504
02:26:16.781 --> 02:26:17.980
<v Speaker 7>that fucking thing.</v>

3505
02:26:21.810 --> 02:26:24.340
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just had my.</v>

3506
02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:26.950
<v Speaker 7>I'm leaving my car out here because it </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of sticks out there,</v>

3507
02:26:26.951 --> 02:26:31.951
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I drive my roommate's car and it's </v>

3508
02:26:31.951 --> 02:26:31.951
<v Speaker 7>just such a treat to get back here and </v>
<v Speaker 7>drive this thing.</v>

3509
02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:33.340
<v Speaker 7>What kind of cars?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought,</v>

3510
02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:37.960
<v Speaker 7>oh my roommates or my room as his was </v>
<v Speaker 7>like a corolla.</v>

3511
02:26:37.961 --> 02:26:40.360
<v Speaker 7>I'm like a 92.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think somewhere around there.</v>

3512
02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:45.490
<v Speaker 7>You don't want to drive his fucking car </v>
<v Speaker 7>while I do out there because it's </v>

3513
02:26:45.490 --> 02:26:46.300
<v Speaker 7>getting a push.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do that in Mexico.</v>

3514
02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:47.350
<v Speaker 7>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3515
02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.230
<v Speaker 7>That's a good move because I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 7>to attract attention to that.</v>

3516
02:26:50.470 --> 02:26:51.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3517
02:26:51.251 --> 02:26:53.200
<v Speaker 7>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought you meant like here and.</v>

3518
02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.280
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3519
02:26:54.310 --> 02:26:55.930
<v Speaker 7>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People love my scars here.</v>

3520
02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:56.980
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here is fine.</v>

3521
02:26:57.040 --> 02:26:58.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm in Mexico.</v>

3522
02:26:58.481 --> 02:27:00.970
<v Speaker 7>Like if you have like a mercedes or you </v>
<v Speaker 7>a target.</v>

3523
02:27:01.130 --> 02:27:06.130
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think they say the guy that was </v>

3524
02:27:06.130 --> 02:27:06.130
<v Speaker 7>helping me move in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the landlord was like,</v>

3525
02:27:06.130 --> 02:27:06.460
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can take your car here.</v>

3526
02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:07.450
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's mercedes.</v>

3527
02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:10.120
<v Speaker 7>And so he's such a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw like one mercedes in the garage.</v>

3528
02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:15.140
<v Speaker 7>And was he sweating?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The one who's just fucking would be </v>

3529
02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:15.140
<v Speaker 7>looking around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

3530
02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:16.900
<v Speaker 7>I'm looked at everyone's stairs </v>
<v Speaker 7>whenever,</v>

3531
02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:21.930
<v Speaker 7>wherever I go in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I would just imagine how it would be </v>

3532
02:27:21.930 --> 02:27:25.030
<v Speaker 7>if they saw a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So how often do you go out?</v>

3533
02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:26.770
<v Speaker 7>You said you don't really leave the </v>
<v Speaker 7>resort.</v>

3534
02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:29.320
<v Speaker 7>How often do you mean grocery?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Grocery shopping.</v>

3535
02:27:29.321 --> 02:27:29.780
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you want to leave to go grocery </v>
<v Speaker 7>shopping,</v>

3537
02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:34.120
<v Speaker 7>but that's just highway and then grocery</v>
<v Speaker 7>store and then highway back.</v>

3538
02:27:34.121 --> 02:27:39.121
<v Speaker 7>It's not that bad to go there and </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's dudes with arrows and machine </v>

3539
02:27:39.121 --> 02:27:39.121

02:27:42.971 --> 02:27:43.660
<v Speaker 7>it's no big deal.</v>

3545
02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:45.890
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is different.</v>

3546
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:47.650
<v Speaker 7>Would be the case?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3547
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:50.170
<v Speaker 7>they clamPed down a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>From what I understand.</v>

3548
02:27:50.210 --> 02:27:51.760
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's more of a,</v>

3549
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.910
<v Speaker 7>it's more police now than it was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>little while ago.</v>

3550
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:57.580
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like when I first started going,</v>

3551
02:27:57.630 --> 02:28:02.630
<v Speaker 7>the first time I went to Mexico I think </v>
<v Speaker 7>was pre 2000 I think.</v>

3552
02:28:03.370 --> 02:28:05.080
<v Speaker 7>I think I might've went.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3553
02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:10.260
<v Speaker 7>it was when I was on mtv,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was on this thing for fear factor and </v>

3554
02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:11.350
<v Speaker 7>we did it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it must have been like 2001 or 2002.</v>

3555
02:28:11.530 --> 02:28:13.290
<v Speaker 7>It was pretty much safe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3556
02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:14.560
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty safe.</v>

3557
02:28:14.561 --> 02:28:16.890
<v Speaker 7>I think a lot of the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 7>show here,</v>

3558
02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:19.300
<v Speaker 7>just like the worst of the worst and </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like you can find that anywhere.</v>

3559
02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:20.240
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3560
02:28:20.490 --> 02:28:21.800
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's murders here too.</v>

3561
02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:23.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3562
02:28:23.031 --> 02:28:24.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not publicized as much as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

3563
02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:29.800
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The video of those guys put out with </v>

3564
02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:33.431
<v Speaker 1>their fucking crazy narco music over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I show people getting machine gun </v>

3565
02:28:33.431 --> 02:28:33.431
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have that.</v>

3566
02:28:33.431 --> 02:28:37.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some videos of them chopping </v>

3567
02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:38.450

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's really not.</v>

3569
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.470
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not very nice.</v>

3570
02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out how to fix that </v>

3571
02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:49.271
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worrIed about Iraq and </v>

3572
02:28:49.271 --> 02:28:51.161
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live next to one of the craziest </v>

3573
02:28:51.161 --> 02:28:51.161
<v Speaker 1>spots on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3575
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:53.810
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to go out and refill our water.</v>

3576
02:28:53.811 --> 02:28:57.620
<v Speaker 1>We can't use the water in the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really can do the mexicans use it.</v>

3577
02:28:57.860 --> 02:29:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get sick for a long time if you </v>

3578
02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:02.860
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually you get used to it,</v>

3579
02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:05.150
<v Speaker 1>which I mean develops a good bacteria.</v>

3580
02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:07.310
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to that fecal transplants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>

3583
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real thing,</v>

3584
02:29:16.431 --> 02:29:17.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we were talking about earlier,</v>

3585
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:18.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I actually googled it and it's called a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it fecal microbiota </v>

3587
02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:28.390
<v Speaker 1>transplantation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as a stool transplants </v>

3588
02:29:28.390 --> 02:29:31.541
<v Speaker 1>process of transporting fecal bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a healthy individual into a </v>

3589
02:29:31.541 --> 02:29:34.940
<v Speaker 1>recipient as a treatment for patients </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering for them from a cdi,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ious colitis.</v>

3592
02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Colitis is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime someone says he got colitis.</v>

3593
02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Previous terms for the procedure include</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3596
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:59.230

<v Speaker 1>colonic flora by introducing healtHy </v>

3597
02:30:00.591 --> 02:30:04.370
<v Speaker 1>bacterial flora through an infusion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stool.</v>

3598
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:05.750
<v Speaker 1>People just eat better.</v>

3599
02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that someone came up with this </v>

3600
02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:11.000
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3605
02:30:16.161 --> 02:30:21.161
<v Speaker 1>they're starting to understand so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more when it comes to bacteria and </v>

3606
02:30:21.161 --> 02:30:22.850
<v Speaker 1>healthy bacteria and they're starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that it,</v>

3607
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:25.310
<v Speaker 1>it affects mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's affects behavior,</v>

3608
02:30:25.311 --> 02:30:30.311
<v Speaker 1>it affects so much and it wards off </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and improves your immune system</v>

3609
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:36.070
<v Speaker 1>and actually some bacteria aggressively </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights off colds and aggressively fights</v>

3610
02:30:37.071 --> 02:30:40.040
<v Speaker 1>off when you come into contact with a </v>

3612
02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:45.780
<v Speaker 1>like having troops and your body does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

3613
02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:48.530
<v Speaker 1>don't viruses just mutate and come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger though.</v>

3614
02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>all 10 days.</v>

3616
02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:57.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those bitches like doug</v>
<v Speaker 1>stanhope who openly admitted on the </v>

3617
02:30:57.610 --> 02:31:01.361

<v Speaker 1>someone's body and it healed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3624
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>the guy might not be lying.</v>

3628
02:31:29.470 --> 02:31:33.990
<v Speaker 7>like a sort of an expert on positive </v>
<v Speaker 7>thinking or mental concentration?</v>

3629
02:31:33.991 --> 02:31:36.570
<v Speaker 7>Or did you just get it by experimenting </v>
<v Speaker 7>yourself?</v>

3630
02:31:36.571 --> 02:31:41.220
<v Speaker 7>And tHen I met someone in a poker game a</v>

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:54.330
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shocker.</v>

3660
02:32:55.390 --> 02:32:56.560
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go ahead and tell us your story.</v>

3661
02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:58.080
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

3662
02:32:58.170 --> 02:33:03.170
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't even go up to a woman because</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was scared of rejection and one day I </v>

3663
02:33:03.170 --> 02:33:03.170
<v Speaker 7>was sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3664
02:33:03.170 --> 02:33:04.880
<v Speaker 7>why am I scared of this rejection?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I thought to myself like,</v>

3665
02:33:05.310 --> 02:33:08.670
<v Speaker 7>if I don't go up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a no right every time.</v>

3666
02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:11.730
<v Speaker 7>And if you just close your eyes and jerk</v>
<v Speaker 7>off in the bathroom,</v>

3667
02:33:11.731 --> 02:33:16.731
<v Speaker 7>it's a yes every time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you pretended to actually </v>

3668
02:33:16.731 --> 02:33:18.180
<v Speaker 7>happen and then you can talk to where </v>
<v Speaker 7>without needing something,</v>

3669
02:33:18.181 --> 02:33:23.181
<v Speaker 7>without being such a needy bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you probably wind up being more </v>

3670
02:33:23.181 --> 02:33:23.181
<v Speaker 7>successful.</v>

3671
02:33:23.181 --> 02:33:23.820
<v Speaker 7>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's one of the things I've learned is</v>

3672
02:33:23.821 --> 02:33:28.821
<v Speaker 7>like everything is created By yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're as confident as you believe you </v>

3673
02:33:28.821 --> 02:33:29.940
<v Speaker 7>can be as weak as you believe you are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw your twitter.</v>

3674
02:33:29.941 --> 02:33:31.030
<v Speaker 7>It was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3675
02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:33.030
<v Speaker 7>I do.</v>

<v Speaker 7>And so he,</v>

3677

<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he text messaged me,</v>

3678
02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:44.300

<v Speaker 7>you got the wrong number and this is </v>

3679
02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:44.300
<v Speaker 7>matt and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

3680
02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:44.300
<v Speaker 7>girls don't like it when you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

3681
02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:44.920
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he texted,</v>

3682
02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:50.240
<v Speaker 7>he texted me three times within an hour </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was sitting there playing poker </v>

3683
02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:50.240
<v Speaker 7>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

3684
02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:51.390
<v Speaker 7>stop annoying me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>

3685
02:33:51.391 --> 02:33:52.110
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3686
02:33:52.111 --> 02:33:54.070
<v Speaker 7>I'm just going to help this guy out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>

3687
02:33:54.390 --> 02:33:59.390
<v Speaker 7>you cannot text the girl three times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's done with you after the second </v>

3688
02:33:59.390 --> 02:33:59.580
<v Speaker 7>text probably.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3689
02:33:59.610 --> 02:34:01.680
<v Speaker 7>Even the second text you've given up </v>
<v Speaker 7>your cards,</v>

3690
02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:02.910
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what are you doing?</v>

3691
02:34:02.930 --> 02:34:05.880
<v Speaker 7>But unless you're just having fun and </v>
<v Speaker 7>not have to worry about anything,</v>

3692
02:34:05.881 --> 02:34:08.100
<v Speaker 7>you're not actually playing a game of </v>
<v Speaker 7>trying to catch the pussy.</v>

3693
02:34:08.170 --> 02:34:09.080
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3694
02:34:09.090 --> 02:34:11.520
<v Speaker 7>if you could be friends and you could </v>
<v Speaker 7>send three text to a friend.</v>

3695
02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:16.640
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But let's be realistic trying to get </v>

3696
02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:17.830
<v Speaker 7>some blue cards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the same as poker.</v>

3697

<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 7>and you're fucked.</v>

3699
02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Requires discipline.</v>

02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:23.830
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the big,</v>

<v Speaker 7>It is a long time ago.</v>

3710
02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:41.800
<v Speaker 7>If you'Re going to make up a story,</v>

<v Speaker 7>learned how to play.</v>

3730

<v Speaker 7>keeps me learning new things every day </v>

3745
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:14.740
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and growing as a poker player,</v>

3746
02:36:14.741 --> 02:36:15.910
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a personal that stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 7>make a living too,</v>

3748
02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:23.320
<v Speaker 7>as long as you're actually successful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that one year you said you had like </v>

<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3751
02:36:26.251 --> 02:36:31.251
<v Speaker 7>most of the reason was because I lost my</v>
<v Speaker 7>online income because of the black </v>

3752
02:36:31.251 --> 02:36:32.770

<v Speaker 7>making it.</v>

3754
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:36.820
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>

02:39:56.260 --> 02:39:57.230
<v Speaker 3>when you have a professional poker </v>

<v Speaker 3>try to like stockpile enough money away </v>

3849
02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:04.240
<v Speaker 3>so that you can get through a bad year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3850
02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:05.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3851
02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:07.400
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought a house last year,</v>

3852
02:40:07.730 --> 02:40:08.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I have some money with a financial </v>

3854
02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:13.720

<v Speaker 3>I just try to diversify</v>

3856
02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:16.830
<v Speaker 7>because there are going to be rainy days</v>
<v Speaker 7>where you don't make money.</v>

3857
02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:18.570
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3858
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:21.990
<v Speaker 7>I was fortunate that I was able to make </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough to not have to really worry about</v>

3859
02:40:21.991 --> 02:40:24.170
<v Speaker 7>it when black friday hit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could,</v>

3860
02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:29.300
<v Speaker 7>I could live.</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's funny that eVerybody calls it in </v>

3861
02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:29.300
<v Speaker 7>the poker community friday,</v>
<v Speaker 7>black friday,</v>

3862
02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:29.860
<v Speaker 7>black friday.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is there,</v>

<v Speaker 7>is there any work being done and try to </v>
<v Speaker 7>fix that.</v>

3864
02:40:31.561 --> 02:40:33.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's going on I would say about a year</v>

3865
02:40:33.481 --> 02:40:35.510
<v Speaker 7>until it's legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the problem lies,</v>

3866
02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:39.420
<v Speaker 7>the problem now is that they want to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>it state to state where you're not gonna</v>

3867
02:40:39.421 --> 02:40:41.550
<v Speaker 7>be able to play with the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're going to have.</v>

3868
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:43.740
<v Speaker 7>It's not going to be able to make as </v>
<v Speaker 7>much money as you could,</v>

3869
02:40:44.090 --> 02:40:45.910
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just to play against californians.</v>

3870
02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:48.960
<v Speaker 7>But that's the job bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>

3871
02:40:49.050 --> 02:40:50.450
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>On a,</v>

3872
02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:54.180
<v Speaker 7>on sunday they have a $200 buy in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which gets about 4,000</v>

3873
02:40:54.181 --> 02:40:54.600
<v Speaker 7>players.</v>

3874
02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:56.400
<v Speaker 7>You can win a quarter of a million </v>
<v Speaker 7>dollars.</v>

3875
02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:58.080
<v Speaker 7>Where's this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's online.</v>

3876
02:40:58.770 --> 02:40:59.940
<v Speaker 7>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 7>pokerstars.</v>

3877
02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:01.740
<v Speaker 7>And you can't play it if you live in </v>
<v Speaker 7>America.</v>

3878
02:41:01.770 --> 02:41:02.550
<v Speaker 7>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>To try to go.</v>

3879
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:07.350
<v Speaker 7>Could you go through a proxy or as you </v>
<v Speaker 7>could but then like a pierogi but not as</v>

3880
02:41:07.351 --> 02:41:07.950
<v Speaker 7>tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could.</v>

3881
02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:09.300
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you could.</v>

3882
02:41:09.301 --> 02:41:10.340
<v Speaker 7>But I wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3883
02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:11.780
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't suggest it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3884
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.830
<v Speaker 7>because if they catch you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what they would do.</v>

3885
02:41:14.970 --> 02:41:16.170
<v Speaker 7>So it probably arrest you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3886
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:17.430
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well that's what I said.</v>

3887
02:41:17.431 --> 02:41:22.431
<v Speaker 7>The law with poker is it's so new that </v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't really have anything set in </v>

3888
02:41:22.431 --> 02:41:22.800
<v Speaker 7>place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they could probably take your money.</v>

3889
02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:24.420
<v Speaker 7>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Isn't that funny?</v>

3890
02:41:24.421 --> 02:41:26.010
<v Speaker 7>They can't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you do it in Mexico,</v>

3891
02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.500
<v Speaker 7>even though you're paying them the taxes</v>
<v Speaker 7>on that.</v>

3892
02:41:28.501 --> 02:41:30.660
<v Speaker 7>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's one of the worst part of it.</v>

3893
02:41:30.690 --> 02:41:33.000
<v Speaker 7>Please is that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well finally they just remedy this,</v>

3894
02:41:33.001 --> 02:41:35.490
<v Speaker 7>but for a bunch of years you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>carry over losses.</v>

3895
02:41:35.490 --> 02:41:40.490
<v Speaker 7>So let's say you made 100 k one year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then the next year he lost 40 and </v>

3896
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.490
<v Speaker 7>they're not giving you any of the 100 </v>
<v Speaker 7>back.</v>

3897
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:44.250
<v Speaker 7>So it's hard to survive sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Will that just makes sense.</v>

3898
02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:46.950
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's just based on a yearly </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>

3899
02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:48.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you think that you'd be able to.</v>

3900
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:50.070
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because like for example,</v>

3901
02:41:50.071 --> 02:41:52.890
<v Speaker 7>if you're a doctor you're making around </v>
<v Speaker 7>the same each year,</v>

3902
02:41:53.430 --> 02:41:55.290
<v Speaker 7>but if you're a poker player you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>lose some,</v>

3903
02:41:55.291 --> 02:41:56.740
<v Speaker 7>some urine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3904
02:41:56.860 --> 02:41:59.310
<v Speaker 7>now you can carry over though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They let you now carry over.</v>

3905
02:41:59.430 --> 02:42:01.590
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you do now you can as the last.</v>

3906
02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:03.270
<v Speaker 7>Within the last year I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3907
02:42:03.271 --> 02:42:08.271
<v Speaker 7>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I should say I was told this by </v>

3908
02:42:08.271 --> 02:42:11.181
<v Speaker 7>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the same guy that told brian that </v>

3909
02:42:11.181 --> 02:42:11.520
<v Speaker 7>dolphins have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but no,</v>

3910
02:42:11.521 --> 02:42:16.521
<v Speaker 7>this was a cpa,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I'm hoping it's right or else I'm </v>

3911
02:42:16.521 --> 02:42:16.521
<v Speaker 7>screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a producer.</v>

3912
02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:18.930
<v Speaker 7>There are distributors of </v>
<v Speaker 7>disinformation.</v>

3913
02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:21.870
<v Speaker 7>Make sure you check.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3914
02:42:22.050 --> 02:42:23.630
<v Speaker 7>I should check the same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You never know man.</v>

3915
02:42:23.690 --> 02:42:24.960
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It might be fucking with you.</v>

3916
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:26.130
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Next thing you know,</v>

3917
02:42:26.131 --> 02:42:28.650
<v Speaker 7>you're trying to claim some shit and </v>
<v Speaker 7>he's trying to get you locked up.</v>

3918
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:33.950
<v Speaker 7>Maybe he's deep inside.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's working from the inside like that </v>

3919
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:34.170
<v Speaker 7>show homeland and I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven't seen it yet.</v>

3920
02:42:34.171 --> 02:42:36.810
<v Speaker 7>I've been told to watch that though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's good man.</v>

3921
02:42:37.260 --> 02:42:37.980
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3922
02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:41.390
<v Speaker 7>you said you worked with camp men and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you work with commonly?</v>

3923
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:46.630
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You work with conference last five </v>

3924
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.630
<v Speaker 7>franklin.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>

3925
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:47.640
<v Speaker 7>Well actually I worked with him for his </v>
<v Speaker 7>last fight before that,</v>

3926
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:51.030
<v Speaker 7>against more extensively for the other </v>
<v Speaker 7>fight.</v>

3927
02:42:51.031 --> 02:42:53.080
<v Speaker 7>We talked once.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

3928
02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:58.300
<v Speaker 7>so we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's sort of like still in its infancy </v>

3929
02:42:58.300 --> 02:43:00.501
<v Speaker 7>stages.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you planning on doing this as a </v>

3930
02:43:00.501 --> 02:43:00.501
<v Speaker 7>business?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to know what would you do?</v>

3931
02:43:00.501 --> 02:43:05.301
<v Speaker 7>Just make different programs based on </v>
<v Speaker 7>different guys and how just play it by </v>

3932
02:43:05.911 --> 02:43:08.670
<v Speaker 7>ear and try to figure out how what we </v>
<v Speaker 7>can do to fix them.</v>

3933
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:09.240
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3934
02:43:09.241 --> 02:43:10.160
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the thing is,</v>

3935
02:43:10.350 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 7>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it differs so much from person</v>

3936
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.160
<v Speaker 3>to person so you can have kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of where you're going,</v>

3937
02:43:15.190 --> 02:43:20.190
<v Speaker 3>but how you get there is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>different based on everybody else and </v>

3938
02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:20.190
<v Speaker 3>what they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on in their head.</v>

3939
02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:21.010
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

3940
02:43:21.011 --> 02:43:26.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're obviously a guy who's a sort of </v>

3941
02:43:26.011 --> 02:43:27.310
<v Speaker 3>figured out in life that you can carve </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own path.</v>

3942
02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:28.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have.</v>

3943
02:43:28.091 --> 02:43:30.820
<v Speaker 3>You're not living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're living in fucking Mexico.</v>

3944
02:43:30.821 --> 02:43:35.821
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's be a big hand professional poker </v>

3945
02:43:35.821 --> 02:43:36.490
<v Speaker 3>player and I'm just going to go mentally</v>
<v Speaker 3>coach fighters.</v>

3946
02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3947
02:43:37.301 --> 02:43:39.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the fun way to live life I think.</v>

3948
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3949
02:43:40.781 --> 02:43:45.781
<v Speaker 3>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's so important for people to </v>

3950
02:43:45.781 --> 02:43:48.151
<v Speaker 3>hear that people like you are doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>too because so many people think that </v>

3951
02:43:48.151 --> 02:43:52.231
<v Speaker 3>life is just this sort of mundane series</v>
<v Speaker 3>of events that you've been thrown into </v>

3952
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:57.630
<v Speaker 3>and there's no way to get out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be stuck doing </v>

3953
02:43:57.630 --> 02:43:57.630
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3954
02:43:57.630 --> 02:43:57.630
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3955
02:43:57.630 --> 02:43:58.180
<v Speaker 3>along these lines for the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3956
02:43:58.210 --> 02:44:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Like you can do anything you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know it sounds corny,</v>

3957
02:44:01.150 --> 02:44:03.940
<v Speaker 3>but one day I literally woke up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

3958
02:44:03.941 --> 02:44:05.000
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to work with them.</v>

3959
02:44:05.001 --> 02:44:06.850
<v Speaker 3>May flyers and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I Took action.</v>

3960
02:44:06.980 --> 02:44:07.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best.</v>

3961
02:44:07.711 --> 02:44:09.550
<v Speaker 3>The one thing I think that most people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are lacking.</v>

3962
02:44:09.551 --> 02:44:11.380
<v Speaker 3>They can think of great things they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>

3963
02:44:11.381 --> 02:44:16.381
<v Speaker 3>but as far as action goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are waiting for someone </v>

3964
02:44:16.381 --> 02:44:17.890
<v Speaker 3>else to come along and help them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3965
02:44:17.891 --> 02:44:21.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's one of the most annoying</v>
<v Speaker 3>things I bet you must get this,</v>

3966
02:44:21.521 --> 02:44:26.521
<v Speaker 3>is people that have requests for you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help them start a business or requests </v>

3967
02:44:26.521 --> 02:44:28.240
<v Speaker 3>for you to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you get that kInd of investor?</v>

3968
02:44:28.241 --> 02:44:31.090
<v Speaker 3>You mean as an investor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been burned a couple of times.</v>

3969
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

3970
02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:34.600
<v Speaker 3>You've got to figure out your own pants </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3971
02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:36.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and coming up to someone and say,</v>

3972
02:44:36.071 --> 02:44:41.071
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you took this and brought it to a </v>

3973
02:44:41.071 --> 02:44:41.071
<v Speaker 3>producer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3974
02:44:41.071 --> 02:44:41.071
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my own things to worry about.</v>

3975
02:44:41.071 --> 02:44:42.250
<v Speaker 3>You've got to find your own way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

3976
02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:47.280
<v Speaker 3>don't try to get a bunch of people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking make your business by donating </v>

3977
02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:50.821
<v Speaker 3>money and stop fap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to set up a structure that you </v>

3978
02:44:50.821 --> 02:44:52.120
<v Speaker 3>need to just set up a structure for how </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get to where you want to</v>

3979
02:44:52.121 --> 02:44:53.650
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the only way to do it.</v>

3980
02:44:53.950 --> 02:44:56.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fucking people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>want other people to help them.</v>

3981
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:59.560
<v Speaker 3>I get requests like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you teach me how to play poker?</v>

3982
02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:02.130
<v Speaker 3>That seems easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3983
02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:05.320
<v Speaker 3>do you realize how much time it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get good at poker?</v>

3984
02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I asked them that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

3985
02:45:06.350 --> 02:45:09.520
<v Speaker 3>do you understand that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be completely immersed in it for</v>

3986
02:45:09.521 --> 02:45:11.500
<v Speaker 3>a year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you do that with your time?</v>

3987
02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Eight hours a day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck,</v>

3988
02:45:13.481 --> 02:45:14.620
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna lose.</v>

3989
02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he never be a fucking professional.</v>

3990
02:45:16.781 --> 02:45:18.790
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's verY important though,</v>

3991
02:45:18.810 --> 02:45:23.680
<v Speaker 3>do to have guys like you to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with someone who's living a</v>

3992
02:45:23.681 --> 02:45:26.410
<v Speaker 3>life that seems like a crazy life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

3993
02:45:26.430 --> 02:45:27.250
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3994
02:45:27.251 --> 02:45:29.350
<v Speaker 3>that guy figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How that to do that,</v>

3995
02:45:29.650 --> 02:45:33.880
<v Speaker 3>it's so important for normal folks too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To hear stuff like your story.</v>

3996
02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was 18 and I heard your story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be great for me because I'd be </v>

3997
02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:39.060
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3998
02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:40.860
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's possible too.</v>

3999
02:45:41.090 --> 02:45:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe you don't have to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

4000
02:45:43.121 --> 02:45:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe I should figure out if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be a poker player.</v>

4001
02:45:45.370 --> 02:45:46.870
<v Speaker 3>That guy seems cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's having a good time.</v>

4002
02:45:47.140 --> 02:45:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Like just the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put the idea of you being able to </v>

4003
02:45:52.140 --> 02:45:54.670
<v Speaker 3>accomplish things that are unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things you don't see around you.</v>

4004
02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:58.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes work and that's why most people</v>

4005
02:45:58.221 --> 02:46:00.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think do it because it takes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of work,</v>

4006
02:46:00.821 --> 02:46:03.040
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a lot of work to do anything to</v>

4007
02:46:03.041 --> 02:46:08.041
<v Speaker 3>do any of you to be an mma fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a poker player and anything and </v>

4008
02:46:08.051 --> 02:46:10.310
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of the key to life.</v>

4009
02:46:10.311 --> 02:46:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Find something that you really love to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do and just go fucking crazy with it</v>

4010
02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:19.160
<v Speaker 8>and the key is to not be stopped because</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're going to hit road bumps and some </v>

4011
02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:19.160
<v Speaker 8>people will just say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

4012
02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:19.950
<v Speaker 8>well I'll try something new,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>

4013
02:46:19.951 --> 02:46:21.840
<v Speaker 8>I hit road bumps in poker too when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>broke,</v>

4014
02:46:21.841 --> 02:46:22.740
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you didn't.</v>

4015
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:26.000
<v Speaker 8>I thought about quitting every time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4016
02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:27.660
<v Speaker 8>and I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know what,</v>

4017
02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:30.300
<v Speaker 8>I'm just going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I actually with the way I did it was</v>

4018
02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:33.540
<v Speaker 8>I messages the top 10 ranked poker </v>
<v Speaker 8>players online.</v>

4019
02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:35.430
<v Speaker 8>That's how I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

4020
02:46:35.431 --> 02:46:37.380
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm looking to get good.</v>

4021
02:46:37.770 --> 02:46:39.810
<v Speaker 8>Will you take five minutes out of your </v>
<v Speaker 8>day to talk to me?</v>

4022
02:46:40.220 --> 02:46:41.430
<v Speaker 8>And three of them said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>

4023
02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:43.710
<v Speaker 8>those are suckers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those guys screwed up.</v>

4024
02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.650
<v Speaker 8>Sudden let this guy in nice take all </v>
<v Speaker 8>your fucking money.</v>

4025

<v Speaker 8>what the fuck?</v>
