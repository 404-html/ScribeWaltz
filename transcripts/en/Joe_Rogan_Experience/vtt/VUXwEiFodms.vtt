1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.733
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we were</v>

3
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.683
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

4
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Now we are going to go cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No cans.</v>

5
00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

6
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a note.</v>

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking animal.</v>

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Semans just connect man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's mind meld.</v>

9
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I think in mind meld more with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things on really some weird way.</v>

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>You were in each other's head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hate my voice.</v>

12
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I sound like a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely don't sound like a woman.</v>

13
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.323
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I call for like tech support to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead me through the first few steps and </v>

14
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:34.964
<v Speaker 1>then I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

15
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>and then I hit delete and they'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

16
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>no ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is.</v>

17
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.673
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like it's too far into it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to correct them because it feels </v>

18
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:44.264
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too embarrassed to correct them at </v>

19
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I just can't.</v>

20
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.523
<v Speaker 1>I just let them assume I'm alone for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the call and it's weird because </v>

21
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>then you see what it's like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated like a woman like he talks.</v>

22
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I find that they talked down to you more</v>
<v Speaker 1>like especially about tech support,</v>

23
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

24
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.823
<v Speaker 1>A chick on a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They treat you like you're a baby and </v>

25
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:12.101
<v Speaker 1>now he's just screamed blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shake your little mouse.</v>

26
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.943
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is there a difference in like tech </v>

27
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:19.634
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why are men more attracted to the </v>

28
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>tech stuff aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't we more</v>

29
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>mathematical than women?</v>

30
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing to say.</v>

31
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's right and left side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

32
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yeah,</v>

33
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 1>men are much more mathematical to women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not mathematical even slightly.</v>

34
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.263
<v Speaker 1>So what am I a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just said that like you're going to </v>

35
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:45.310
<v Speaker 1>kick my broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do I read?</v>

36
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Fucking chick lit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking skirt.</v>

37
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

38
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>They get it made right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women got it made.</v>

39
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:57.431 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>there's this sort of like postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism coming back where,</v>

42
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>

43
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>with the lean in and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>women really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are going to start getting.</v>

45
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I think they're still making like eighty</v>
<v Speaker 1>cents on a dollar.</v>

46
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.083
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you say that before and I </v>

47
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>wanted to correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not true.</v>

48
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

49
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.753
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that means when they say </v>

50
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 1>women make eighty cents of the dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means overall women make eighty cents</v>

51
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>compared to the dollar that men make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for the same jobs when women and</v>

52
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.074
<v Speaker 1>men are making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the same when they're doing the </v>

53
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>same job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

54
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.743
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that statistic is it </v>

55
00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:32.134
<v Speaker 1>leads you to believe that a man and </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman are working alongside each other </v>

56
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 1>doing the exact same amount of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of hours,</v>

57
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.850
<v Speaker 1>but the woman makes less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case in the same.</v>

58
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.693
<v Speaker 1>Just a lot of executives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been that have been found out to </v>

59
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a couple that were,</v>

60
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>that are executives that were doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same job,</v>

61
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>leading the sales team and making less </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

62
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps there's a few exceptions,</v>

63
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part when you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about overall jobs,</v>

64
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>like it's pretty statistically proven </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like lawyers,</v>

65
00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:58.294
<v Speaker 1>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck the is when they're </v>

66
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>working</v>

67
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 3>side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very little disparity.</v>

68
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very little podcast thing is women take </v>

69
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 3>time off for work time off of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a maternity leave.</v>

70
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Of course if they have babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also they tend to work less hours.</v>

71
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Men tend to be more ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more driven work,</v>

72
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 3>more hours and they get paid more </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of it.</v>

73
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

74
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those weird ones where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

75
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Everybody says it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even fucking Obama said it.</v>

76
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 3>You know the wage gap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the income gap.</v>

77
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

78
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Like why are you saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're.</v>

79
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.923
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about you talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as if there's some sort of </v>

80
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:34.294
<v Speaker 3>discrimination when in fact there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural tendency that a lot of women </v>

81
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 3>have to choose different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as far as like nursing,</v>

82
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 3>like overwhelmingly a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's predominantly women.</v>

83
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.443
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying if you take the total </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount women make versus the total </v>

84
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>amount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men May.</v>

85
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 3>That's where the eighty cents on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar difference,</v>

86
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's the job choices.</v>

87
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 3>You're saying the exact right job </v>
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>

88
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Men are much more likely to die on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

89
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

90
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.673
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men are much more likely to take high </v>

91
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 3>paying high risk jobs like mining things</v>
<v Speaker 3>on those lines.</v>

92
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what that is.</v>

93
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.703
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those weird ones where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeated a lot of people repeat it and </v>

94
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.823
<v Speaker 3>they think it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that men and women who are </v>

95
00:04:09.951 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 3>working alongside each other making the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same amount of money.</v>

96
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.173
<v Speaker 3>The other thing about executives is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that no one wants </v>

97
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 3>to say because it sounds sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might be that the men are earning</v>

98
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:22.744
<v Speaker 3>more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it might not just be that they're </v>

99
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.024
<v Speaker 3>making more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be their actual performance as </v>

100
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 3>an executive is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible.</v>

101
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 3>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can also see,</v>

102
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I hired a man and a woman,</v>

103
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I would pay the woman less</v>

104
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 4>just because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men are just.</v>

105
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.313
<v Speaker 4>Did you better looking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want them around more women are </v>

106
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:50.634
<v Speaker 4>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare you leave periods who I like </v>

107
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.653
<v Speaker 4>literally if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would I pay somebody who's bleeding </v>

108
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:57.474
<v Speaker 4>on the job as much as a man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad I never have to have a </v>

109
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:08.210
<v Speaker 4>workforce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

110
00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 4>what do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he got one guy.</v>

111
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:11.460
<v Speaker 4>You got to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a few people working for you.</v>

112
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're guys.</v>

113
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Call guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sexy guys.</v>

114
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a good looking guy.</v>

115
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Jamie is not a bad looking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You play sports.</v>

116
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 4>What'd you play?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I played back in high school.</v>

117
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 4>I played basketball for four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the city.</v>

118

<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

120
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.250

<v Speaker 4>virginity?</v>

121
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

122
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Slow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little slow on the uptake there?</v>

123
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>17.</v>

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.550
<v Speaker 3>16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>15.</v>

126
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Almost 16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe older woman.</v>

127
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

128
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I got molested by a girl when I was 13 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was 21,</v>

129
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 3>but nothing really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those weird ones,</v>

130
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:56.854
<v Speaker 3>like she was grabbing my deck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was all confused and I made out with </v>

131
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.564
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

132
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 3>how are we doing here now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so confused.</v>

133
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hit puberty yet.</v>

134
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was 13.</v>

135
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.070
<v Speaker 3>When do you hit puberty?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hit until I was 15.</v>

136
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.750
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't beating off at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually had sex before.</v>

137
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Beat off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

138
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I was just,</v>

139
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I figured out beating off though,</v>

140
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

141
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a slave to getting rid of this.</v>

142
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

143
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.283
<v Speaker 3>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized like once I beat </v>

144
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

145
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can do this myself?</v>

146
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm not so fucking needy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

147
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.443
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time I was dating </v>
<v Speaker 3>this girl and the first time I beat off </v>

148
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 3>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to call her.</v>

149
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

150
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hang out with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

151
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 3>this is annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I realized like,</v>

152
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't so much that I was attracted to</v>

153
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that not that it wasn't attractor.</v>

154
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't so much that I enjoyed being </v>
<v Speaker 3>around her.</v>

155
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.083
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to have sex with her and then </v>

156
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 3>once the sex was taken out once a book </v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of the load,</v>

157
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

158
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want to be around her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just some biological trick.</v>

159
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my body's tricking me into wanting </v>

160
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 3>to be near her and hanging around with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

161
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

162
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.131
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

163
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:15.964
<v Speaker 4>Because teenage boys and girls have sell</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little income and all you care about </v>

164
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:23.830
<v Speaker 4>is sports laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get fucked up will,</v>

165
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:26.640
<v Speaker 4>you didn't really do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like we did and then uh,</v>

166
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 4>and girls at that age are just extremely</v>
<v Speaker 4>social beings.</v>

167
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.310
<v Speaker 4>They're very much about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

168
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.340
<v Speaker 4>their social circle and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

169
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 4>establishing who's in the group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

170
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm just talking about my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my daughter is like this.</v>

171
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.303
<v Speaker 4>And I think that they're much more like </v>
<v Speaker 4>in line with what school is telling you </v>

172
00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:46.750
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

173
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:47.584
<v Speaker 4>they tend to do better in school because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a little bit more linear and </v>

174
00:07:50.531 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 4>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

175
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.313
<v Speaker 4>they're self motivated more than boys </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we just were just distracted too </v>

176
00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

177
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 3>I think what boys also have like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious problem with authority,</v>

178
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teachers are telling you what to do.</v>

179
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:03.004
<v Speaker 3>You automatically don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a natural inclination that </v>

180
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:09.250
<v Speaker 3>people have of now I'm getting scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

181
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.573
<v Speaker 3>that's illegal though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can blow it in my face on legal problem </v>

182
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

183
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.173
<v Speaker 4>that's totally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a total second hand high and the </v>

184
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.400
<v Speaker 4>Green Room at the comedy store the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting a fucking t the middle </v>

236
00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:17.630
<v Speaker 4>of Beverly Hills where you get ticketed </v>
<v Speaker 4>for fucking picking your nose.</v>

237
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making the legal levies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

238
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.121

239
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:20.954
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making the fucking left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go past it and I doubled back and </v>

240
00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:25.184
<v Speaker 4>then I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get to his place and his place is a </v>

241
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.680
<v Speaker 4>hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he talk about this on your show?</v>

242
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Why don't want to like do it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal.</v>

243
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 3>You definitely said the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hotel,</v>

244
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:36.864
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a water problem and it's not </v>

245
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.873
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

246
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.023
<v Speaker 3>He spent like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think more than two years building </v>

247
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 3>this house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me five years,</v>

248
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 3>bought it and then they had to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plans approved and then the building.</v>

249
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a total process of about five </v>

250
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:56.064
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

251
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.993
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was two solid years in </v>

252
00:10:58.051 --> 00:10:59.000
<v Speaker 3>building this house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

253
00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.843
<v Speaker 3>So he goes out of town and a water </v>
<v Speaker 3>faucet broke and the whole house from </v>

254
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 3>the top floor flooded all the way down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the bottom.</v>

255
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.403
<v Speaker 4>All the walls have fucking fungus and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mold in them and it's a complete tear </v>

256
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:12.230
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

257
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had that happen to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever have like a fungus or mold issue?</v>

258
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did.</v>

259
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't lethal.</v>

260
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:20.844
<v Speaker 4>We got to test it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a mold and my wife's very </v>

261
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:23.364
<v Speaker 4>sensitive to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she was getting all kinds of like </v>

262
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:25.703
<v Speaker 4>allergies from it and they came in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the testing is fucking expensive and it </v>

263
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:30.571
<v Speaker 4>was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

264
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 4>it was just a leaky pipe under the house</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

269
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.330

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go back every time.</v>

351
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.200
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it once.</v>

352
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

353
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 4>it was a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

354
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the morning radio thing.</v>

355
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 4>Conduct and fucking get you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

356
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.343
<v Speaker 4>I was just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was that guy who was an athlete </v>

357
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 4>that shot his driver?</v>

358
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that story?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a radio guy.</v>

359
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.743
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a professional athlete and he </v>

360
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 4>pulled out a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jason Williams does that,</v>

361
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 4>who it is that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

362
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.573
<v Speaker 4>but he had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a limo driver and apparently he pulled </v>

363
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:20.054
<v Speaker 4>out a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like playing with a gun and </v>

364
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 4>accidentally shot and killed his limo </v>
<v Speaker 4>driver.</v>

365
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

366
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look what the fuck?</v>

367
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Jason Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a basketball player,</v>

368
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.570
<v Speaker 4>like pulp fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that kind of stuff happens.</v>

369
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:38.890
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you got shot by bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last punch.</v>

370
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.953
<v Speaker 4>Like that's how it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you go to the next stage of </v>

371
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got accidentally shot by Baba.</v>

372
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

373
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.320
<v Speaker 4>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Williams.</v>

374
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Speaker 4>I was a coward for covering up shooting </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the limo driver.</v>

375
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.603
<v Speaker 4>I mean is he free now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spent 26 months in prison and starting </v>

376
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:01.420
<v Speaker 4>in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

377
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:05.860
<v Speaker 4>maybe battled with alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well here's the thing.</v>

378
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Incredibly shadow with a 12 gauge </v>
<v Speaker 4>shotgun.</v>

379
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.123
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say you kill a guy by accident with a </v>

380
00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:20.721
<v Speaker 4>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You then have a choice to cover it up or</v>

381
00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:24.130
<v Speaker 4>come forward and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did this whole shit.</v>

382
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Now existentially,</v>

383
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.780
<v Speaker 4>is it so wrong to cover it up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

384
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 4>you're going to feel bad for the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

385
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.953
<v Speaker 4>You don't really need to be punished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to change how his family </v>

386
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 4>feels about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just say somebody else shot him.</v>

387
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.580
<v Speaker 4>That's a DB argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A DB argument about ethics.</v>

388
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.143
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>

389
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 4>You know you're going to face a of</v>

390
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.800
<v Speaker 5>hate of hate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

391
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.560
<v Speaker 5>No one's going to believe you have you </v>
<v Speaker 5>say it was an accident.</v>

392
00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.960
<v Speaker 5>People are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

393
00:17:59.961 --> 00:18:02.800
<v Speaker 5>Assume that he murdered them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know they're going to pursue it that</v>

394
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.790
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But on the other hand,</v>

395
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.550
<v Speaker 5>you did fucking kill a guy.</v>

396
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.623
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if here's it more innocuous </v>

397
00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:10.844
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're driving down an alley late at </v>

398
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.380
<v Speaker 4>night and a homeless person walks out in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of your car and you hit him and he</v>

399
00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:22.760
<v Speaker 4>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can either just drive away,</v>

400
00:18:22.761 --> 00:18:27.290
<v Speaker 4>wash your car and know that a homeless </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy is no more.</v>

401
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.610
<v Speaker 4>Or you can go get the police and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

402
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.640
<v Speaker 4>I was speeding and I killed a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that Johnny cash song.</v>

403
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.120
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it fascinating that when you say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that story,</v>

404
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.173
<v Speaker 5>when you give that scenario that a </v>
<v Speaker 5>homeless person in some way or another </v>

405
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 5>makes it like less fucked up?</v>

406
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.813
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just made in terms of like the family </v>

407
00:18:52.871 --> 00:18:55.190
<v Speaker 4>blaming you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's going to blame me for</v>

408
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 5>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

409
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.473
<v Speaker 5>but even even so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's not as bad as scenario as </v>

410
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 5>hitting a nice person who's got their </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit together.</v>

411
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.903
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if you kill somebody and you </v>

412
00:19:07.931 --> 00:19:10.900
<v Speaker 4>get sued by the family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on it.</v>

413
00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:13.420
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you kill a child and you get sued,</v>

414
00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.730
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to pay a lot of money,</v>

415
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.610
<v Speaker 4>but if you kill a guy who's supporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>his family,</v>

416
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.440
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll take everything you got.</v>

417
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 4>So that life in the eyes of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the law is</v>

418
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.030
<v Speaker 5>worth more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How strange is it that we put a monetary</v>

419
00:19:30.031 --> 00:19:34.830
<v Speaker 5>value on actual life itself?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

420
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 5>It's just such a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 5>strange concept.</v>

421
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.923
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that guy accidentally hit </v>

422
00:19:42.551 --> 00:19:45.190
<v Speaker 5>that Moose with his car now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

423
00:19:45.191 --> 00:19:46.280
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pull that video up.</v>

424
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.713
<v Speaker 5>I tweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy's driving down the road </v>

425
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.793
<v Speaker 5>somewhere probably near where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked you out of that club that one </v>

426
00:19:55.691 --> 00:19:55.930
<v Speaker 5>night</v>

427
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:56.763
<v Speaker 1>made you drive home and drive home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of Moose they kicked you out in </v>

428
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.420
<v Speaker 1>great detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to be a clean gig.</v>

429
00:20:04.421 --> 00:20:05.650
<v Speaker 1>He gets up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts swearing,</v>

430
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.780
<v Speaker 1>they kicked him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kicked him out.</v>

431
00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 1>They had his bags packed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time he gets off stage,</v>

432
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.523
<v Speaker 4>spend the night at the hotel after you </v>
<v Speaker 4>do the Gig and they fucking five hours </v>

433
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.113
<v Speaker 4>drive.</v>

434
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.773
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

435
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.050
<v Speaker 6>Oh</v>

436
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:22.630
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking</v>

437
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.690
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

438
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else has slowed down all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

439
00:20:28.571 --> 00:20:29.404
<v Speaker 1>It's slowed down a route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People had seen the Moose and they were </v>

440
00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.570
<v Speaker 1>kind of checking it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

441
00:20:34.571 --> 00:20:38.260
<v Speaker 1>this guy fucking hits it full on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>since everything flying,</v>

442
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:39.340
<v Speaker 1>that was like an Olympic big</v>

443
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.530
<v Speaker 5>tumble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta wonder like,</v>

444
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.483
<v Speaker 5>is that Moose dead now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm surprised the car wasn't trashed </v>

445
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think Moose is dead?</v>

446
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.240
<v Speaker 5>Got Up and walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

447
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>

448
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.453
<v Speaker 5>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something flew off and he lost her </v>

449
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.350
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck right.</v>

450
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 5>You can create an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

451
00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not like that.</v>

452
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 5>I've hit squirrels and rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ran over a raccoon with a big wreck.</v>

453
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.813
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It made a big thumping noise under the </v>

454
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've.</v>

455
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 5>I was grossed out for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just disturbed.</v>

456
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that and that thing goes flying.</v>

457
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.110
<v Speaker 5>That's a huge animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

458
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.980
<v Speaker 5>they're dangerous in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

459
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.170
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think most are dangerous in the wild.</v>

460
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 5>They can be there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the few deer species that will go</v>

461
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:27.400
<v Speaker 5>after you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

462
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.133
<v Speaker 5>probably the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe an elk would go after you </v>

463
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.633
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's pretty rare like you have to </v>

464
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 5>fuck up to get an elk to attack you.</v>

465
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you're too close to a Mama Moose </v>

466
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 5>and she's got her babies in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she'll just fuck you up.</v>

467
00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was this kid that got killed.</v>

468
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.173
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it was on a campus </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere in Alaska and apparently </v>

469
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:52.384
<v Speaker 5>someone had been throwing snowballs at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Moose and they had agitated the </v>

470
00:21:56.261 --> 00:21:59.920
<v Speaker 5>Moose and this guy just walked in wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>

471
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 5>wrong time and the Moose just starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>stomping the shit out of them.</v>

472
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.773
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy just gets stomped and stomped </v>

473
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:10.204
<v Speaker 5>and stomped by this huge animal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's rearing up and trying to kill him </v>

474
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 5>and keep stomping on him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was horrific.</v>

475
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.620
<v Speaker 5>He just bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>

476
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just getting pummeled by these.</v>

477
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.973
<v Speaker 5>I mean this thing is a thousand pounds </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was because they were throwing </v>

478
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:27.814
<v Speaker 5>snowballs at him because somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently had been agitating the Moose </v>

479
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:32.770
<v Speaker 5>before this guy got there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

480
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.110
<v Speaker 5>Don't fuck with wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

481
00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:38.520
<v Speaker 5>Had that gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Gun.</v>

482
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 5>That's a bad one to fuck with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

483
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:42.963
<v Speaker 5>you gotta think in their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're fighting off bears and wolves </v>

484
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:46.354
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just constantly like kicking at </v>

485
00:22:47.891 --> 00:22:49.750
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

486
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not attacked,</v>

487
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 5>but have you had an animal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like had you lined up in the cross hairs</v>

488
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:59.380
<v Speaker 5>when you're hunting or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that I know.</v>

489
00:22:59.381 --> 00:23:02.730
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever had a bear like come out </v>
<v Speaker 5>about a bear?</v>

490
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.930
<v Speaker 5>I've had a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like encounters with bears.</v>

491
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:06.520
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see them,</v>

492
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:08.310
<v Speaker 5>but most of the time they just run away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

493
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.660
<v Speaker 5>like A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a grizzly bear once.</v>

494
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.303
<v Speaker 5>That was a weird one because they have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>different way of looking at you as </v>

495
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:15.874
<v Speaker 5>opposed to like a regular beer does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a brown bear is a more aggressive </v>

496
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:23.290
<v Speaker 5>bear in terms of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's more of a hunter or as black bears,</v>

497
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 5>they're.</v>

498
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 5>They're kind of hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're more.</v>

499
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 5>I think they tend to eat more berries </v>
<v Speaker 5>and things along those lines,</v>

500
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.703
<v Speaker 5>but those big ass brown bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to be like really aggressive </v>

501
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 5>because they're so big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you've got to feed a thousand pound</v>

502
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:39.580
<v Speaker 5>body or whatever the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they eat meat?</v>

503
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do they eat?</v>

504
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 5>Bears eat a lot of crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

505
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 5>They'll eat like a beached whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll camp out on a beach.</v>

506
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:51.170
<v Speaker 5>Whale eat that fucking thing for is </v>
<v Speaker 5>rotten and disgusting.</v>

507
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.033
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the best places that </v>

508
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:56.150
<v Speaker 5>people find them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to go bear sighting,</v>

509
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 5>you want to go looking for bears and </v>
<v Speaker 5>spot those big Kodiak bears.</v>

510
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 5>They go to places where bears would find</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a dead whale.</v>

511
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 5>It's almost lover.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

512
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.520
<v Speaker 5>It just gets rancid and disgusting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're still chewing it up,</v>

513
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just have to eat a lot.</v>

514
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.930
<v Speaker 4>What's your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

515
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.910
<v Speaker 4>what you usually kill something for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>winter to eat.</v>

516
00:24:17.911 --> 00:24:18.744
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually an elk who is ever going to go </v>

517
00:24:20.371 --> 00:24:21.204
<v Speaker 4>for this year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to either got one already this </v>

518
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you did.</v>

519
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the one you were carrying?</v>

520
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

521
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.223
<v Speaker 4>when you show me a picture of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking carrying an animal on your back </v>

522
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.840
<v Speaker 4>that you had killed.</v>

523
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.860
<v Speaker 5>I think that was a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

524
00:24:35.861 --> 00:24:38.320
<v Speaker 5>You can't carry an elk on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way too big.</v>

525
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And silk is like a thousand pounds.</v>

526
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.430
<v Speaker 5>So you cut it up out in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll put it in coolers or something.</v>

527
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.493
<v Speaker 5>I did it at this ranch and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of guys that work at the ranch </v>

528
00:24:50.981 --> 00:24:51.814
<v Speaker 5>that just drag it into a pickup truck </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you take it to like this cold </v>

529
00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:59.410
<v Speaker 5>storage area and the cold storage area </v>
<v Speaker 5>that break it down.</v>

530
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.453
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what you do is you just cut the </v>

531
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.083
<v Speaker 5>quarters off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you cut the legs off and you break it </v>

532
00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:07.480
<v Speaker 5>down just like a butcher shop does </v>
<v Speaker 5>freely.</v>

533
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.640
<v Speaker 5>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

534
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.200
<v Speaker 5>it's very weird to see man because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes meat.</v>

535
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.093
<v Speaker 5>Like it starts off an animal and then it</v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes meat as opposed to just seeing </v>

536
00:25:18.581 --> 00:25:21.400
<v Speaker 5>meet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like once.</v>

537
00:25:21.401 --> 00:25:23.740
<v Speaker 5>It's once it's down and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

538
00:25:23.741 --> 00:25:26.950
<v Speaker 5>you start breaking it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a sober,</v>

539
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:27.963
<v Speaker 5>sober reminder of what meat actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One day they're going to have that lab </v>

540
00:25:37.481 --> 00:25:39.580
<v Speaker 5>to test tube meat that they're working </v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

541
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:40.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that stuff they're doing.</v>

542
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.183
<v Speaker 5>One day they're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be like fully fully </v>

543
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.570
<v Speaker 5>available and there's going to be no </v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

544
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Last night I was talking to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

545
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.430

<v Speaker 4>Just fucking smiles all the time.</v>

548
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.190

<v Speaker 4>little while.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I put it in the blender with a little </v>

554
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:13.370
<v Speaker 4>bit of oil and I flag it and chop it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it on sandwiches with some lessons.</v>

555
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.950
<v Speaker 4>I gave it to my kids.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's good.</v>

560
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.080
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a chicken salad type thing,</v>

561
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds good.</v>

<v Speaker 4>meat in our fridge.</v>

564
00:26:38.721 --> 00:26:41.900

<v Speaker 5>I hear that.</v>

567
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 5>The way to get the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a fryer?</v>

568
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get a,</v>

569
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.343
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could buy them where you stick the </v>

570
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:52.560
<v Speaker 5>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

571
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:53.394
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

572
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.343
<v Speaker 5>like these prongs stick into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he just sort of lower it into </v>

573
00:26:57.061 --> 00:26:59.340
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Vat for like 20 minutes.</v>

574
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:00.174
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a certain time per </v>

575
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 5>pound of bird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bird is,</v>

576
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 5>but it's so good dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he had cook it in peanut oil and</v>

577
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 5>it's just juicy and delicious and crispy</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the outside.</v>

578
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 5>It's my all time favorite way to get a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Turkey.</v>

579
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turkeys,</v>

581
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.400

<v Speaker 5>As I get older it's freaking me out more</v>

582
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 5>and more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It freaks me out.</v>

583
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:25.614
<v Speaker 5>Like buying chickens in the store freaks</v>
<v Speaker 5>me out because of the way you know they </v>

584
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 5>were treated or a hundred percent.</v>

585
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.233
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

586
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.070
<v Speaker 5>Chickens for the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the big one.</v>

587
00:27:32.071 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 5>That freaks me out because there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like chickens and pigs because</v>

588
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 5>there's something that we do with </v>
<v Speaker 5>chickens where you would.</v>

589
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 5>You can't really do with a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We stack them on top of each other.</v>

590
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 5>Just smoosh them all into these places </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they can't even fucking move.</v>

591
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.893
<v Speaker 5>They just stuck there and then they wait</v>
<v Speaker 5>until they get to a certain size and </v>

592
00:27:50.681 --> 00:27:52.250
<v Speaker 5>then they kill them and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oof.</v>

593
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like a.</v>

594
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:59.990
<v Speaker 5>it's like they're a human or not human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A living organism that's,</v>

595
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.160
<v Speaker 5>that's a battery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a power supplies.</v>

596
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.023
<v Speaker 5>They doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pumping them full of chemicals that </v>

597
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:09.000
<v Speaker 5>make them get fatter and big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

598
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:11.730
<v Speaker 5>I know they definitely have used </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals on the birds,</v>

599
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:12.564
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if they use on them on </v>

600
00:28:14.141 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 5>them all the time.</v>

601
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 5>I think the thing that's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 5>those birds is genetic selection.</v>

602
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:19.523
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where they've just genetically made </v>

603
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:26.750
<v Speaker 5>certain birds breed with certain birds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've established this gene does,</v>

604
00:28:27.021 --> 00:28:27.551
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

605
00:28:27.551 --> 00:28:28.384
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>genetic selection where they're just </v>

606
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:30.414
<v Speaker 5>like super fucking plump and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculously big breasts and then they </v>

607
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 5>get those to do that in a very short </v>
<v Speaker 5>period of time.</v>

608
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.360
<v Speaker 5>And then they kill them and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk because their chests are so big.</v>

609
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:43.690
<v Speaker 5>They fall over forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

610
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.700
<v Speaker 5>Well it's like what they did with </v>
<v Speaker 5>bulldogs,</v>

611
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 5>like how the fuck did they make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bulldog out of a wolf?</v>

612
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How'd they do?</v>

613
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.360
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they can't fucking breathe.</v>

614
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

615
00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:55.350
<v Speaker 5>Pugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So sad.</v>

616
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 5>It's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a wolf and they made,</v>

617
00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.170
<v Speaker 5>they made the face smaller because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted it to be cuter.</v>

618
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.603
<v Speaker 5>Acute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cute dogs having a fucking asthma </v>

619
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:09.681
<v Speaker 5>attack his entire life to the house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two ranges that you have at the chickens</v>

620
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:11.994
<v Speaker 5>and I think the only criteria for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken pen is that the chicken has to </v>

621
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:17.160
<v Speaker 5>be able to turn around in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

622
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 5>That's how big it has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy and they're getting shit</v>

623
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:24.330
<v Speaker 5>on by all the chickens above it their </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole life.</v>

624
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

625
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:28.830
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that really how it works?</v>

626
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 5>How many do they stack on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other?</v>

627
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 5>12 for real now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

628
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 5>but a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say 100.</v>

629
00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 5>One went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred.</v>

630
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 5>One hundred floors and chicken.</v>

631
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 5>That noise</v>

632
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 3>around that is placed on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

633
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 3>but that's like taking an organism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>using it as cells in a battery.</v>

634
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.953
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're taking like these </v>

635
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:52.354
<v Speaker 3>chickens and you're literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>compartmentalizing it into a specific </v>

636
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:56.044
<v Speaker 3>size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a cell and the Mitochondria of the </v>

637
00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:58.984
<v Speaker 3>cell is this chicken and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of them stacked </v>

638
00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:05.720
<v Speaker 3>into this place and they're like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>living organisms that you've.</v>

639
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.573
<v Speaker 3>You've got locked into these clearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>defined spaces and you're extracting </v>

640
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 3>energy from those chickens you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>

641
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 3>You're extracting food from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

642
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.490
<v Speaker 4>they're just protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're protein bars.</v>

643
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is fucking bizarre.</v>

644
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a bizarre practice.</v>

645
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when they're not in cages,</v>

646
00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 4>they have them so smushed together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't even fucking move.</v>

647
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun.</v>

648
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.063
<v Speaker 3>They're not having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the only way to raise </v>

649
00:30:37.611 --> 00:30:38.930
<v Speaker 3>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

650
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.823
<v Speaker 3>I had this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel Salitan on the podcast a while </v>

651
00:30:41.211 --> 00:30:42.350
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

652
00:30:42.351 --> 00:30:47.351
<v Speaker 3>really interesting guy and he runs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's farm's called polyface.</v>

653
00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Polyface farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

654
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.113
<v Speaker 3>but he's into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got these things that he does with </v>

655
00:30:55.431 --> 00:30:58.760
<v Speaker 3>these chickens where he puts them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these giant like chicken houses that are</v>

656
00:30:58.761 --> 00:31:02.510
<v Speaker 3>on wheels and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roll them into an area and then you just</v>

657
00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:04.940
<v Speaker 3>let them out and they run around at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the day,</v>

658
00:31:04.941 --> 00:31:07.460
<v Speaker 3>they go right back in because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they do.</v>

659
00:31:07.461 --> 00:31:08.294
<v Speaker 3>They go into their nest again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you roll them down a hill to </v>

660
00:31:09.831 --> 00:31:11.720
<v Speaker 3>another place and then he has these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pigs,</v>

661
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.240
<v Speaker 3>they takes pigs and he puts a fence </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the pigs,</v>

662
00:31:14.241 --> 00:31:15.074
<v Speaker 3>a movable fence and the pigs just stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside that fence and eat whatever the </v>

663
00:31:17.781 --> 00:31:18.614
<v Speaker 3>fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next day they moved the </v>

664
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 3>fence and they keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got these animals like that,</v>

665
00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:26.560
<v Speaker 3>those chickens in like fucking chickens </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't freak out,</v>

666
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.683
<v Speaker 3>don't freak out when he comes near them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this guy is like the prime example </v>

667
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.950
<v Speaker 3>of what you would think of as like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent,</v>

668
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:42.770
<v Speaker 3>an intelligent take on ethical farming </v>
<v Speaker 3>practices because that's,</v>

669
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I think when</v>

670
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.910
<v Speaker 4>purdue and a lot of these houses buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>from you,</v>

671
00:31:45.911 --> 00:31:49.180
<v Speaker 4>you have to use their cages in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet.</v>

672
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:51.340
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a franchise like Mcdonald's,</v>

673
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:52.174
<v Speaker 4>like when you raise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you raise livestock for a lot of </v>

674
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:56.200
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

675
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 4>agro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

676
00:31:57.461 --> 00:31:58.480
<v Speaker 4>what'd he call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>

677
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big agro.</v>

678
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 4>It's specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted done a certain way.</v>

679
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.500
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't buy from you.</v>

680
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.473
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard to be independent like </v>

681
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:08.104
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

682
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:08.810
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

683
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.900
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're a poultry grower,</v>

684
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.760
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

685
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.450
<v Speaker 3>like if you want to work for purdue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like grow chickens for them.</v>

686
00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

687
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.550
<v Speaker 3>you don't think they grow their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens?</v>

688
00:32:19.551 --> 00:32:20.384
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's that work?</v>

689
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.520
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you get a contract with them and</v>

690
00:32:22.521 --> 00:32:24.200
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come in and buy your stuff,</v>

691
00:32:24.201 --> 00:32:26.970
<v Speaker 4>but it's all got to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As I say,</v>

692
00:32:26.971 --> 00:32:31.971
<v Speaker 4>Tyson track poultry farming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Read that out there with Gregory Tyson</v>

693
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.530
<v Speaker 3>foods is one of the leading supporters </v>
<v Speaker 3>of American agriculture,</v>

694
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:36.364
<v Speaker 3>paying more than $15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion annually to independent farmers </v>

695
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.780
<v Speaker 3>supply us with cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hogs and chickens.</v>

696
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 3>We depend on more than 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>independent farmers across the country.</v>

697
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.633
<v Speaker 3>This includes more than 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>poultry farmers who contact us to raise </v>

698
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:51.840
<v Speaker 3>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

699
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.880

701
00:32:55.721 --> 00:32:56.554
<v Speaker 4>it's all done with a lot of leverage and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to do things exactly the way </v>

702
00:32:59.851 --> 00:33:01.320
<v Speaker 4>they want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

703
00:33:01.321 --> 00:33:02.154
<v Speaker 4>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it food inc or something that did a </v>

704
00:33:04.531 --> 00:33:05.580
<v Speaker 4>documentary about it?</v>

705
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.810
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this documentary today </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was on dig A.</v>

706
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.073
<v Speaker 3>I found it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about this guy who was like this </v>

707
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.653
<v Speaker 3>super bad ass Sushi chef in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the best Sushi chef in Tokyo right </v>

708
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:21.620
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they were saying and it's really</v>

709
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 3>interesting like watching this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>acquire the,</v>

710
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 3>the fish and how it talks about how he </v>
<v Speaker 3>ages to fish.</v>

711
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.823
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that when they catch tuna </v>

712
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.420
<v Speaker 3>they'll often age them for five days and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

713
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they age a lot of times at the </v>

714
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:35.744
<v Speaker 3>fish market before he takes it or he </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes it back and he'll agent another </v>

715
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 3>five days more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they might,</v>

716
00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:41.534
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might keep shit for like two weeks </v>

717
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 3>before you eat it to make it more </v>
<v Speaker 3>tender.</v>

718
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing that with tuna.</v>

719
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this and I was like,</v>

720
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:49.424
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is jamie and I were talking about </v>

721
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

722
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.320
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

723
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to do when they kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the fish?</v>

724
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Like how long does it take to grow a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking tune of that big.</v>

725
00:33:57.381 --> 00:33:58.214
<v Speaker 3>This guy has his tune it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's sawing it with a giant Paul </v>

726
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.173
<v Speaker 3>Bunyan saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking huge to the video is </v>

727
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.574
<v Speaker 3>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people who made the video or </v>

728
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:08.264
<v Speaker 3>like obvious like serious Sushi dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're like super amped up to be </v>

729
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:15.800
<v Speaker 3>getting some Sushi from this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all I could think of is like,</v>

730
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Speaker 3>how many fish are there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

731
00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:18.434
<v Speaker 3>how many days can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everyday they're knocking them out </v>

732
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 3>of the AH,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean.</v>

733
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every day.</v>

734
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.700
<v Speaker 4>And there used to be areas where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

735
00:34:27.701 --> 00:34:30.370
<v Speaker 4>they restricted how much fishing went on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now it's like,</v>

736
00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.690
<v Speaker 4>it's a free for all.</v>

737
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.233
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under Donald Trump we're going to fix </v>

738
00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:35.334
<v Speaker 3>all this.</v>

739
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:40.660
<v Speaker 4>Thank God I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been pulled for trump's.</v>

740
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.530
<v Speaker 4>I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the concept of trump.</v>

741
00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:44.364
<v Speaker 4>I've always been really into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like when I remember studying the </v>

742
00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:49.620
<v Speaker 4>constitution as a kid and thinking this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is fucking bullshit.</v>

743
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:50.903
<v Speaker 4>We need a guy who's got some balls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to come in and get around </v>

744
00:34:53.971 --> 00:34:58.140
<v Speaker 4>all this fucking liberal bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kidding.</v>

745
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.970
<v Speaker 4>I think of the apocalypse is upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think it's over.</v>

746
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't even taken office yet and he's</v>

747
00:35:05.341 --> 00:35:08.730
<v Speaker 4>already alienated China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks he's friends.</v>

748
00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.010
<v Speaker 4>The best part is he thinks he's friends </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Russia.</v>

749
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:12.383
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like hanging out with the school </v>

750
00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:14.544
<v Speaker 4>bully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And thinking you're safe until one day </v>

751
00:35:16.141 --> 00:35:16.974
<v Speaker 4>you say something that bully doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like any fucking cracks in the face and </v>

752
00:35:20.401 --> 00:35:22.080
<v Speaker 4>you realize he's just a broken child.</v>

753
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.143
<v Speaker 3>How much you know way more about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>than I do because I've spent the </v>

754
00:35:27.361 --> 00:35:28.194
<v Speaker 3>majority of my adult life ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost everything about how the system </v>

755
00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:32.244
<v Speaker 3>works and you win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how much power does he really have </v>

756
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 3>it president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

757
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.820
<v Speaker 3>How much power does he really have in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of decisions to be made for things</v>

758
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like any sort of a military action?</v>

759
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you've already seen is,</v>

760
00:35:48.391 --> 00:35:49.224
<v Speaker 4>but by taking a phone call from Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a simple act that he didn't think twice </v>

761
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:54.684
<v Speaker 4>about that opened up the floodgates to </v>
<v Speaker 4>China saying that we are recognizing </v>

762
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Taiwan is an independent state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has been a.</v>

763
00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:05.790
<v Speaker 4>there's been a one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a one China policy going back to Nixon,</v>

764
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 4>which basically ensured that it put a </v>
<v Speaker 4>clamp down on the cold war and it said,</v>

765
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:11.334
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to keep building up </v>

766
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:13.794
<v Speaker 4>against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a part of that is we're going to </v>

767
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:17.424
<v Speaker 4>live by certain doctrines like the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>China policy and when he takes a call </v>

768
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 4>from Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something as simple as that.</v>

769
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.743
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>China is talking about a nuclear </v>

770
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:27.600
<v Speaker 4>buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that simple.</v>

771
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.793
<v Speaker 4>It's not about what laws he enacts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about him as a spokesman for our </v>

772
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what messages he sends out.</v>

773
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like Obama did with Israel.</v>

774
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why,</v>

775
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.643
<v Speaker 4>but in his 11th hour he is soured </v>
<v Speaker 4>relations with Israel to the point </v>

776
00:36:43.471 --> 00:36:44.700
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

777
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:45.534
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though he's a lame duck president </v>

778
00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:50.570
<v Speaker 4>on his way out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

779
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.560
<v Speaker 4>it was a destructive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

780
00:36:52.561 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I disagree with it.</v>

781
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 4>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

782
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.300
<v Speaker 4>the UN had a resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was saying that the,</v>

783
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Israel has new developments in the,</v>

784
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:02.123
<v Speaker 4>in the West Bank and which are illegal </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to UN previously UN </v>

785
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 4>resolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

786
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno what they're calling it,</v>

787
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's illegal what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

788
00:37:13.761 --> 00:37:16.770
<v Speaker 4>and the US signed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they signed onto it.</v>

789
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.143
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they set up these settlements in </v>

790
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Palestinian territories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is,</v>

791
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.143
<v Speaker 4>well the disputed Palestinian territory </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just decided to start building </v>

792
00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been doing,</v>

793
00:37:28.711 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 4>they've been building there for years </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they put it,</v>

794
00:37:31.471 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 4>they put up like 600 homes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're planning on putting up 5,000</v>

795
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.620
<v Speaker 4>in an area that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

796
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.360
<v Speaker 4>pieces the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

797
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no peace over there.</v>

798
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:45.930
<v Speaker 4>But what's keeping it from being an all </v>
<v Speaker 4>out war is that area that is,</v>

799
00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 4>that is supposed to be kept neutral for </v>
<v Speaker 4>now or,</v>

800
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 4>and now they're building on it.</v>

801
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Why would someone want to build?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they running out of land?</v>

802
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.430
<v Speaker 3>They can't build other places?</v>

803
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.383
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

804
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.110
<v Speaker 4>they don't recognize uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Palestinians.</v>

805
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:02.973
<v Speaker 4>And so they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they see that that's all their land </v>

806
00:38:04.811 --> 00:38:06.610
<v Speaker 4>still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they,</v>

807
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.473
<v Speaker 4>they won't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will continue building and pushing </v>

808
00:38:09.341 --> 00:38:12.580
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the tide is turned on Israel from</v>

809
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:13.414
<v Speaker 4>what I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't follow Israel very closely </v>

810
00:38:14.861 --> 00:38:15.694
<v Speaker 4>at all except for when I hear people </v>
<v Speaker 4>yelling about it at parties that I met </v>

811
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.713
<v Speaker 4>because I have friends that are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardcore Zionists and I have friends </v>

812
00:38:22.361 --> 00:38:26.560
<v Speaker 4>that are hardcore anti Zionist and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're totally rational people and they</v>

813
00:38:26.561 --> 00:38:30.050
<v Speaker 4>can joke around about talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking your mother and Blah,</v>

814
00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:32.140
<v Speaker 4>Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as soon as Israel comes up,</v>

815
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.170
<v Speaker 4>shit gets real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they talk,</v>

816
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

817
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:38.643
<v Speaker 1>I think the tide is turned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more people that are </v>

818
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 1>seeing Israel as a terrorist state.</v>

819
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:44.723
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

820
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very aggressive net and yahoo is</v>

821
00:38:50.451 --> 00:38:52.370
<v Speaker 1>just a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bowl.</v>

822
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.540
<v Speaker 1>What's the right resolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the right solution?</v>

823
00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Because what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much is in dispute?</v>

824
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Like how much territory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

825
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.540
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a small place doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed very small.</v>

826
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Isn't Israel like the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut or some shit like that.</v>

827
00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Like how big is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's very big,</v>

828
00:39:11.761 --> 00:39:16.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's where it's located.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's find out how big is Israel?</v>

829
00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Just a hotly charged subject?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

830
00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:22.924
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most charged subjects </v>

831
00:39:25.021 --> 00:39:30.020
<v Speaker 1>and all of the Holocaust survivors </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

832
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

833
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.813
<v Speaker 1>And you're talking about people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>right next to each other with opposing </v>

834
00:39:35.251 --> 00:39:40.251
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and various reasons for being</v>
<v Speaker 1>righteous or villain and Iran.</v>

835
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Iran looking at Israel erected that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it right,</v>

836
00:39:48.601 --> 00:39:49.560
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Iran?</v>

837
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:50.783
<v Speaker 1>Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

838
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:51.843
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that they don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to exist and that they're gonna </v>

839
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.250
<v Speaker 1>throw a nuclear bomb over there.</v>

840
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.863
<v Speaker 1>What did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the guy from Pakistan who </v>

841
00:40:00.001 --> 00:40:01.230
<v Speaker 1>wasn't Jamie that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

842
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.500
<v Speaker 1>got duped by a fake news story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Masada.</v>

843
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that guy by the.</v>

844
00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did see that in the guy got.</v>

845
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:11.783
<v Speaker 1>He got duped by fake news story and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said some inflammatory shit about </v>

846
00:40:15.571 --> 00:40:17.580
<v Speaker 1>causing a war and all of a sudden it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

847
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:18.414
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys got got all up in arms about a </v>

848
00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.130
<v Speaker 1>fake story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

849
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is going on?</v>

850
00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.750
<v Speaker 1>What do you think was the first fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>news story?</v>

851
00:40:27.751 --> 00:40:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Because you go back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking that it was an old fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>news story was a</v>

853
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.163
<v Speaker 1>fake news stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think probably been around for a </v>

854
00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:45.970
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the Bible was a giant fake news,</v>

855
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 1>dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did their best.</v>

856
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>They did their best to remember the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

857
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Find a good map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the provinces,</v>

858
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>the arguments over the maps and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I see.</v>

859
00:40:59.381 --> 00:41:00.101
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

860
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the one I have.</v>

861
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Does it say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to know,</v>

862
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:08.500
<v Speaker 1>like I'm too stupid to know what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

863
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:13.590
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask Google compared to a state like,</v>

864
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.510
<v Speaker 1>because I think there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a simple comparison.</v>

865
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:17.344
<v Speaker 1>I just don't remember what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Connecticut or something like </v>

866
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:20.014
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe Massachusetts size comparison </v>

867
00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:27.784
<v Speaker 1>map Israel in USA anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were we just telling you with a </v>

868
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.230
<v Speaker 1>size comparison and fake news?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

869
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.290
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>

870
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

871
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.043
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically the size of New Jersey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and New Jersey is building a lot of </v>

872
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:43.544
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks a little bit bigger than New </v>

873
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.453
<v Speaker 1>Jersey.</v>

874
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.920
<v Speaker 1>But look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It barely fits in Lake Michigan.</v>

875
00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.460
<v Speaker 1>You can stick Israel in Lake Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

876
00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.820
<v Speaker 1>How big is Lake Michigan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

877
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that insane?</v>

878
00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I know a giant ocean of water that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can surf on Lake Michigan.</v>

879
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.910
<v Speaker 1>What's the one that's near Chicago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lake Michigan.</v>

880
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Lake Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

881
00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I stayed at girl and when she was a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

882
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.310
<v Speaker 1>you dated her when she was a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

883
00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:18.130
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story she told when she was a dare you</v>

884
00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.520
<v Speaker 1>when she was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in a,</v>

885
00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:22.354
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a storm on Lake Michigan where they had </v>

886
00:42:25.661 --> 00:42:28.300
<v Speaker 1>to turn into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the waves,</v>

887
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.310
<v Speaker 1>like over and over and over again all </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

888
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.100
<v Speaker 1>They were not safe like they were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger,</v>

889
00:42:33.101 --> 00:42:36.040
<v Speaker 1>being capsized by the waves on a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>lake.</v>

890
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.920
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was her stepdad.</v>

891
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I forgot who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's steering the boat,</v>

892
00:42:40.841 --> 00:42:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but was just wrecked by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

893
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Like his arms were falling off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

894
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:48.820
<v Speaker 1>he barely could use his arms because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

895
00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:51.190
<v Speaker 1>he had to keep turning the boat all </v>
<v Speaker 1>night long.</v>

896
00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.890
<v Speaker 1>They had to strap everyone down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boat on a,</v>

897
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.660
<v Speaker 1>on a fucking lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

898
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.340
<v Speaker 1>On a lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the ocean.</v>

899
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care where you put a boat in,</v>

900
00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you got what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever's coming to you.</v>

901
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that Lake Michigan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

902
00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Look at the waves by foot waves on Lake </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>

903
00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:11.530
<v Speaker 1>It says 25 foot waves on land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

904
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's all that wind that comes in.</v>

905
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just an immense puddle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

906
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.160
<v Speaker 1>That used to be a fucking glacier</v>

907
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.313
<v Speaker 1>glaciers that are in some places as high</v>
<v Speaker 1>as two miles high and they became all </v>

908
00:43:29.851 --> 00:43:31.470
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

909
00:43:31.471 --> 00:43:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy of mine lives,</v>

910
00:43:33.721 --> 00:43:34.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Wisconsin,</v>

911
00:43:34.861 --> 00:43:37.110
<v Speaker 1>in the driftless area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the area where the,</v>

912
00:43:37.111 --> 00:43:38.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glaciers didn't hit.</v>

913
00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of cool because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these hills and crazy,</v>

914
00:43:42.331 --> 00:43:45.240
<v Speaker 1>like a beautiful typography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the place,</v>

915
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.190
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eraser came along.</v>

916
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.043
<v Speaker 1>It just flattened that motherfucker out </v>
<v Speaker 1>just from the weight of the glacier is </v>

917
00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:51.624
<v Speaker 1>pushing down on the land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glacier just pushing for and </v>

918
00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.810
<v Speaker 1>crushing everything in its path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally like God's eraser.</v>

919
00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.673
<v Speaker 1>And that's when the wind whips up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's nothing stopping that </v>

920
00:44:00.781 --> 00:44:01.710
<v Speaker 1>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

921
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember driving through,</v>

922
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.373
<v Speaker 1>I think it was North Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was North Dakota and I was driving </v>

923
00:44:07.201 --> 00:44:08.034
<v Speaker 1>from I think Iowa or Nebraska and North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dakota is doing a college gig and the </v>

924
00:44:13.561 --> 00:44:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Gig was at night and it was like a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>four hour drive and they told me,</v>

925
00:44:18.001 --> 00:44:19.950
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a single lane road.</v>

926
00:44:19.951 --> 00:44:22.950
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only way there and it's flat as</v>

927
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:23.784
<v Speaker 1>shit and it's windy out so be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in my rent a car and a snow snow </v>

928
00:44:29.791 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 1>starts as I'm and the snow</v>

929
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 4>is just going just vertically across the</v>
<v Speaker 4>road and it starts to build up.</v>

930
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.013
<v Speaker 4>It starts to build up the snow on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road and all of a sudden I'm like </v>

931
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 4>halfway there and it's fucking white out</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions.</v>

932
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 4>All I can see is the light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the snow in my headlights ahead of me.</v>

933
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.930
<v Speaker 4>And for a long time I was just looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at that,</v>

934
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 4>looking at the line on the road and </v>
<v Speaker 4>following that line disappeared.</v>

935
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I fucking freak out.</v>

936
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:00.864
<v Speaker 4>And so I just pull what I think is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the side of the road because I don't </v>

937
00:45:04.781 --> 00:45:05.614
<v Speaker 4>know where I'm driving and I wait and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden I see headlights coming </v>

938
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:12.390
<v Speaker 4>from behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking 18 wheeler barreling down,</v>

939
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:13.703
<v Speaker 4>hopefully hope and he sees me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He passes me and I immediately get </v>

940
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:18.504
<v Speaker 4>behind him and I rode that motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>for two hours to get to the school </v>

941
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 4>shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking shaken.</v>

942
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 4>And I got to the Gig and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>these kids,</v>

943
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 4>it was like fucking Jesus Christ has </v>
<v Speaker 4>shown up in their town.</v>

944
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:37.463
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

945
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.520
<v Speaker 7>this is our only entertainment all year.</v>

946
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:44.673
<v Speaker 4>And so we did a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did a show in so many people came </v>

947
00:45:46.811 --> 00:45:47.644
<v Speaker 4>that they added a second shell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but half the kids stayed for the second </v>

948
00:45:50.951 --> 00:45:51.784
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was definitely one of those year </v>

949
00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:55.060
<v Speaker 4>material got told that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan,</v>

950
00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you that your is Don Gavin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve Sweeney.</v>

951
00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Todd Parker's fucking ripping every joke</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of my ass.</v>

952
00:46:03.341 --> 00:46:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I can think of that second step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They paid me devil hilarious.</v>

953
00:46:07.841 --> 00:46:09.790
<v Speaker 4>And I couldn't get out of there for two </v>
<v Speaker 4>days afterwards.</v>

954
00:46:09.791 --> 00:46:11.660
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

955
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

956
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:14.903
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was so much uncertainty in the </v>

957
00:46:16.271 --> 00:46:17.104
<v Speaker 5>winters in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was like you weren't certain if </v>

958
00:46:19.661 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 5>you were going to get home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

959
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.233
<v Speaker 5>Like I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's important for people to </v>

960
00:46:25.031 --> 00:46:27.340
<v Speaker 5>understand that don't live in a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

961
00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.293
<v Speaker 5>Like if you got hit with a big January </v>
<v Speaker 5>snow storm and it hit while you were at </v>

962
00:46:33.221 --> 00:46:34.660
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've got to work,</v>

963
00:46:34.661 --> 00:46:35.291
<v Speaker 5>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

964
00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:37.390
<v Speaker 5>there'd be warnings everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd be worn.</v>

965
00:46:37.391 --> 00:46:39.980
<v Speaker 5>They'd cancel school before the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking drop up.</v>

966
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.840
<v Speaker 5>Snow fell right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't freak out about like big blizzard.</v>

967
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.620
<v Speaker 5>But if a big one hit and you fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you weren't paying attention,</v>

968
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.990
<v Speaker 5>you could get stuck wherever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>you are.</v>

969
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Highways just stopped for days.</v>

970
00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:53.224
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

971
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.103
<v Speaker 5>It takes forever for them to chew all </v>
<v Speaker 5>that snow way and if it stays cold in </v>

972
00:46:58.161 --> 00:47:01.070
<v Speaker 5>Boston it will stay cold for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking time.</v>

973
00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:01.904
<v Speaker 5>We remember those black piles of ice ice</v>
<v Speaker 5>that had just gotten road grime and </v>

974
00:47:06.711 --> 00:47:09.530
<v Speaker 5>exhaust on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was too cold for it to melt,</v>

975
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.980
<v Speaker 5>so we just push that shit to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would narrow the fucking highway.</v>

976
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

977
00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd get out there with those,</v>

978
00:47:15.771 --> 00:47:16.604
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those trucks throwing the salt and the </v>

979
00:47:18.231 --> 00:47:20.720
<v Speaker 4>sand down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they be out there before the snow</v>

980
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:22.070
<v Speaker 4>had started.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were laying down.</v>

981
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Salt</v>

982
00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:24.940
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was why if you've got an old car,</v>

983
00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:27.480
<v Speaker 5>you wanted to get a California car where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't,</v>

984
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 5>they didn't use salt on the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you've got an old car in Boston,</v>

985
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:32.134
<v Speaker 5>the fucking fenders were all rotted out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything rotted it out because of all </v>

986
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:37.260
<v Speaker 5>that salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they constantly re up the,</v>

987
00:47:37.261 --> 00:47:38.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the highways.</v>

988
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

989
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:40.504
<v Speaker 5>It's just chewing through it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But isn't that kind of the only way to </v>

990
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 5>ensure that shit's gonna Melt?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You kinda have to salt.</v>

991
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.650
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Salt it and say.</v>

992
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 5>I think they sand it more than they salt</v>
<v Speaker 5>it now.</v>

993
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:51.750
<v Speaker 5>They probably are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know where they get this?</v>

994
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 5>They get the salt from like on these </v>
<v Speaker 5>giant fucking barges from South America.</v>

995
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 5>Salt wars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the old days.</v>

996
00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 5>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

997
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 5>but imagine they used to go to war for </v>
<v Speaker 5>salt.</v>

998
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.220
<v Speaker 5>How you mean like way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way back salt.</v>

999
00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing that we give it away for </v>
<v Speaker 5>free because if you really think of what</v>

1000
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.060
<v Speaker 5>it was worth like five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>600 years ago,</v>

1001
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.700
<v Speaker 5>it was incredibly valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1002
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.320
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because food was so bland.</v>

1003
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.490
<v Speaker 5>No To preserve food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1004
00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.000
<v Speaker 5>they didn't have refrigeration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like their meat,</v>

1005
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 5>if you cover the outside of it with </v>
<v Speaker 5>salt,</v>

1006
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:28.420
<v Speaker 5>the bacteria can eat the meat and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>slows the decaying process.</v>

1007
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.440
<v Speaker 5>You could dry things out and salt them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and as a way to preserve food,</v>

1008
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.380
<v Speaker 5>like an important way to preserve food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1009
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:36.923
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how long you get to have a </v>

1010
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:39.064
<v Speaker 5>piece of meat and just cover it with </v>
<v Speaker 5>salt and leave it laying around at room </v>

1011
00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:41.884
<v Speaker 5>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's a lot more than it </v>

1012
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.900
<v Speaker 5>would if you didn't have the salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>

1013
00:48:46.901 --> 00:48:49.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the reasons why it was.</v>

1014
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.793
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was one of the most valuable </v>
<v Speaker 5>things in the world at one point in </v>

1015
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:53.374
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is crazy now when you think about </v>

1016
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:56.280
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 5>And everything you ate must've had salty</v>
<v Speaker 5>a shit.</v>

1018
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 5>People must just get used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Taste is salt.</v>

1019
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.653
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking that salt causes high blood </v>

1020
00:49:07.061 --> 00:49:10.770
<v Speaker 5>pressure and then it doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

1021
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.880
<v Speaker 5>it's a mineral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like you're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have too much of it,</v>

1023
00:49:14.111 --> 00:49:17.800
<v Speaker 5>but like that's not what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what else is going on?</v>

1024
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:20.380
<v Speaker 5>And then there was this study that came </v>
<v Speaker 5>out recently,</v>

1025
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.240
<v Speaker 5>a paper that came out recently that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>pointing to the sugar industry,</v>

1026
00:49:25.241 --> 00:49:30.020
<v Speaker 5>accepting bribes or giving bribes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists in the 1950.</v>

1027
00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.213
<v Speaker 5>Just do that to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to push the blame away from sugar and </v>

1028
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.253
<v Speaker 5>saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amount of heart disease that it </v>

1029
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:39.400
<v Speaker 5>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no sugar is.</v>

1030
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.460
<v Speaker 5>It has become the new salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's become the new cholesterol.</v>

1031
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:46.120
<v Speaker 5>It's become the new everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's everybody's saying is fear.</v>

1032
00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's everybody's fear now.</v>

1033
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:48.933
<v Speaker 5>Wha Wha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do salt and sugar prevent microbial </v>

1034
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 5>spoilage says they use sugar and salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the name way to Cerner to.</v>

1035
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:00.430
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

1036
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it tastes better that way probably.</v>

1037
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1038
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 5>so it says protection of foods from </v>
<v Speaker 5>microbial spoilage,</v>

1039
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 5>using salt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually sodium chloride or sugar.</v>

1040
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 5>Usually sucrose has ancient roots and is</v>
<v Speaker 5>often referred to assaulting salt.</v>

1041
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:16.684
<v Speaker 5>Curing corning or sugar curing pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 5>rock salt used for curing are sometimes </v>

1042
00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:23.860
<v Speaker 5>called corns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hence the name.</v>

1043
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 5>Corned beef was wonder why they call it </v>
<v Speaker 5>the corned.</v>

1044
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.560
<v Speaker 5>No Shit.</v>

1045
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:32.810
<v Speaker 4>That's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>

1046
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's it shut?</v>

1047
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it say?</v>

1048
00:50:36.321 --> 00:50:37.960
<v Speaker 4>Where it goes several ways here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1049
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:38.953
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's several ways in which salt and </v>

1050
00:50:40.341 --> 00:50:41.174
<v Speaker 5>sugar inhibit microbial growth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most notable is simple osmosis or </v>

1051
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 5>dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>salt or sugar,</v>

1052
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.793
<v Speaker 5>whether in solid or equias form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Attempts to reach equilibrium with the </v>

1053
00:50:53.211 --> 00:50:58.211
<v Speaker 5>salt or sugar content of the food </v>
<v Speaker 5>product with which it is in contact.</v>

1054
00:50:58.401 --> 00:50:59.234
<v Speaker 5>This has the effect of drawing available</v>
<v Speaker 5>water from within the food to the </v>

1055
00:51:01.701 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 5>outside and inserting salt or sugar </v>
<v Speaker 5>molecules into the food interior.</v>

1056
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:12.010
<v Speaker 5>The result is a reduction of the so </v>
<v Speaker 5>called water activity measure of unbound</v>

1057
00:51:13.671 --> 00:51:14.504
<v Speaker 5>free water molecules in the food that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary for microbial survival and </v>

1058
00:51:19.161 --> 00:51:21.290
<v Speaker 5>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is fucking fast.</v>

1059
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1060
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:25.670
<v Speaker 4>I never thought about how because I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about when I put salt on my food.</v>

1061
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.863
<v Speaker 4>It seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with seesaw where they would </v>

1062
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:28.874
<v Speaker 4>sit there so big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the particles that you don't just get </v>

1063
00:51:31.491 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't spread,</v>

1064
00:51:33.411 --> 00:51:34.244
<v Speaker 4>but they would eat the food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say you put it in your mashed </v>

1065
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:37.000
<v Speaker 4>potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1066
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.203
<v Speaker 4>It spreads really evenly throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mashed potatoes that it realizes all </v>

1067
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:41.624
<v Speaker 4>that chemical reactions going on between</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the cells in the potatoes and the </v>

1068
00:51:45.831 --> 00:51:46.664
<v Speaker 4>salt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind.</v>

1069
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 4>It's flowing back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean think about how difficult it must</v>

1071
00:51:54.761 --> 00:51:59.390
<v Speaker 5>have been to get fresh food to a city in</v>
<v Speaker 5>1700.</v>

1072
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:02.603
<v Speaker 5>Throwing salt on everything and packing </v>
<v Speaker 5>things in salt and taking them down the </v>

1073
00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:09.360
<v Speaker 5>road on the back of wagons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being pulled by horses</v>

1074
00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:10.283
<v Speaker 4>with Ms Dot added control mosquitoes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>flies on everything that was for so </v>

1075
00:52:16.571 --> 00:52:19.990
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How people lived for so long.</v>

1076
00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:20.853
<v Speaker 4>Open wagons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no like air tight </v>

1077
00:52:23.441 --> 00:52:25.480
<v Speaker 4>compartments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1078
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean I bet kings that's a pretty dope </v>
<v Speaker 4>compartments.</v>

1079
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 5>Like in game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those like sitting there like just chill</v>

1081
00:52:32.121 --> 00:52:32.954
<v Speaker 5>and how long is this ride?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The horses are pulling the wagon along </v>

1082
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:39.130
<v Speaker 5>that fan themselves and shit that hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to.</v>

1083
00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.800
<v Speaker 5>It was like the real pimps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you were a dude,</v>

1084
00:52:41.801 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 5>you could pick a checkup and take her to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the back of the the carriage.</v>

1085
00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:46.660
<v Speaker 5>She'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1086
00:52:46.661 --> 00:52:48.030
<v Speaker 5>You have your own character?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Baby carriage.</v>

1088
00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.520
<v Speaker 5>And you have hepatitis this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they have hepatitis back then?</v>

1089
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.070
<v Speaker 5>Was Him the first VD came into play?</v>

1090
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:59.563
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>syphilis was probably the first one I </v>

1091
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.740
<v Speaker 4>read about it in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1092
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syphilis was all over the place.</v>

1093
00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.093
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1094
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they call it.</v>

1095
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 4>I think they call it syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

1096
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.830
<v Speaker 4>didn't I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at the clap,</v>

1097
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.430
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think syphilis is the clap.</v>

1098
00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.430
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that happens in animals?</v>

1099
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:19.860
<v Speaker 5>Do you think animals give each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1100
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I haven't thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friends got a herpes blister,</v>

1101
00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 4>but it busts</v>

1102
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.010
<v Speaker 1>out like every couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just showed me this morning,</v>

1103
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a kiss.</v>

1104
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Things the size of a dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it on her lip?</v>

1105
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get those.</v>

1106
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 1>It's such a shame because she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

1107
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.970
<v Speaker 1>She changed her diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that Koalas have chlamydia or do they</v>

1108
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 1>are known for having.</v>

1109
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:42.391
<v Speaker 5>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you say it?</v>

1110
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:46.980
<v Speaker 5>Looking at me like it doesn't count if </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a stuffed animal.</v>

1111
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1112
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.090
<v Speaker 1>They all have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a.</v>

1113
00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:56.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing I thought I heard like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread stds.</v>

1114
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.463
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks good.</v>

1115
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Article Says Koala,</v>

1116
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:02.220
<v Speaker 5>chlamydia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the std threatening and Australian icon.</v>

1117
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Didn't aids come from a monkey or is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that A.</v>

1118
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.353
<v Speaker 5>is that a myth that man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could remember exactly how to </v>

1119
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:14.910
<v Speaker 5>answer this because I listened to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>radio lab podcast called patient zero,</v>

1120
00:54:14.911 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 5>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was all about this.</v>

1121
00:54:16.981 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 5>They were trying to figure out who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first person that contracted the HIV</v>

1122
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:21.444
<v Speaker 5>virus and it did have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with someone who was tending to meet </v>

1123
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:33.530
<v Speaker 5>that he had killed of a chimpanzee and </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe perhaps had an open cut.</v>

1124
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:36.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the speculations,</v>

1125
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:39.870
<v Speaker 5>which of course turned into somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up monkey.</v>

1126
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.680
<v Speaker 5>That's just the American translation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>facts.</v>

1127
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.550
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking natural one with people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome dude.</v>

1128
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Fuck the monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How else do you get an std?</v>

1129
00:54:50.131 --> 00:54:50.964
<v Speaker 5>From a monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta fucking see that Chappelle </v>

1130
00:54:52.891 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1131
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:54.683
<v Speaker 5>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chappelle had one of the funniest bits </v>

1132
00:54:56.281 --> 00:54:57.180
<v Speaker 5>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1133
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 5>do you know how hard it would be to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>a monkey?</v>

1134
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Once he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1135
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.030
<v Speaker 5>I never even thought of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine the battle right there.</v>

1136
00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:10.620
<v Speaker 5>You would have to go through to actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck a monkey.</v>

1137
00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:11.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.480
<v Speaker 1>How do you just think it's a given?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1139
00:55:13.481 --> 00:55:13.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1140
00:55:13.901 --> 00:55:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have some dry days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>

1141
00:55:15.611 --> 00:55:16.630
<v Speaker 1>fuck a monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1142
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Not so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.860
<v Speaker 5>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do a bit of my act.</v>

1144
00:55:20.861 --> 00:55:25.000
<v Speaker 5>That's true about my cat biting me in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hand and me getting pissed at him.</v>

1145
00:55:25.001 --> 00:55:26.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck dude?</v>

1146
00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:29.320
<v Speaker 5>And he's looking at me and his ears are </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulled back.</v>

1147
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:35.390
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a cat is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a fucking powerful little animal,</v>

1148
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.173
<v Speaker 5>but it's nothing compared to a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monkeys throw themselves through the </v>

1149
00:55:39.941 --> 00:55:41.050
<v Speaker 5>air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1150
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.800
<v Speaker 5>Little tiny body swings itself to the or</v>
<v Speaker 5>catches itself,</v>

1151
00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:45.663
<v Speaker 5>throws his to the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can do ridiculous shit with their </v>

1152
00:55:48.701 --> 00:55:51.370
<v Speaker 5>bodies and you got to think they get a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hold of you.</v>

1153
00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:54.370
<v Speaker 5>If that thing bites your face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it gets a hold of your neck,</v>

1154
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.680
<v Speaker 5>it might look a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1155
00:55:56.681 --> 00:55:59.130
<v Speaker 5>especially if it's a champ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like oh,</v>

1156
00:55:59.131 --> 00:55:59.964
<v Speaker 5>like a little baby champ we had on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>set of news radio and it was like a two </v>

1157
00:56:03.191 --> 00:56:06.520
<v Speaker 5>year old chimp and this thing slapped me</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my back.</v>

1158
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:07.683
<v Speaker 5>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it Kinda like when you let them climb </v>

1159
00:56:10.421 --> 00:56:11.254
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you kind of does whatever he wants </v>

1160
00:56:11.861 --> 00:56:13.690
<v Speaker 5>because he's a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't trying to hurt me,</v>

1161
00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:18.040
<v Speaker 5>but first of all he felt like he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>made out of corrugated,</v>

1162
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:21.280
<v Speaker 5>would just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like a wooden animal,</v>

1163
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.020
<v Speaker 5>like his.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might've been like this,</v>

1164
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 5>like you could kind</v>

1165
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 1>of pick them up and carry him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he felt like nothing,</v>

1166
00:56:27.161 --> 00:56:27.994
<v Speaker 1>like a person feels like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just solid muscle and he just </v>

1167
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:33.503
<v Speaker 1>slapped me on the back and all I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of is like a big one of these </v>

1168
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:38.203
<v Speaker 1>appeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full grown one of these things and they </v>

1169
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:43.230
<v Speaker 1>get a great shit around people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we were down in A.</v>

1170
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:44.083
<v Speaker 1>we're in South Africa and Cape Town and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were taking a walk down to the Cape </v>

1171
00:56:47.531 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 1>of good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no Cape of whatever at the tip,</v>

1172
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:50.824
<v Speaker 1>the very tip of South Africa and is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>field that you walked through with the </v>

1173
00:56:54.191 --> 00:56:55.024
<v Speaker 1>path and the deranged is came up to us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my son was about maybe about three </v>

1174
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 1>years old and they said to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1175
00:57:01.781 --> 00:57:02.531
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

1176
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Want to hold him the whole time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

1177
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like chimps.</v>

1178
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Chimps will take them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll just come down and grab them.</v>

1179
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll steal your kid and he.</v>

1180
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that?</v>

1182
00:57:13.961 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 1>You go on a trip with your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he come back with no kid and you watched</v>

1183
00:57:18.371 --> 00:57:19.260
<v Speaker 1>your kid get taken.</v>

1184
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1185
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Where's your son?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baboons to there.</v>

1186
00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Another animal will do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:27.903
<v Speaker 1>They'll go after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I might be thinking of </v>

1188
00:57:28.901 --> 00:57:30.070
<v Speaker 1>baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1189
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.490
<v Speaker 1>that makes more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was bare bones.</v>

1190
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:33.383
<v Speaker 1>It makes more sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there have been stories of chimps </v>

1191
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 1>doing it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1193
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:37.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the woman?</v>

1194
00:57:37.691 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I got a face bitten off by a chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1195
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:43.630
<v Speaker 1>but the one woman who was a most </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

1196
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:44.583
<v Speaker 1>her friend had this pet chimp and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was given xanax and wine and maybe </v>

1197
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:53.050
<v Speaker 1>sucking stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he xanax?</v>

1198
00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 1>If if she's sucking his Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell's he need?</v>

1199
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine being so fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

1200
00:57:58.341 --> 00:58:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you have a 200 pound ship </v>
<v Speaker 1>living with Xanax?</v>

1201
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she gave it the Xanax so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he'd be more pliable?</v>

1202
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I think she was just banging this </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey.</v>

1203
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I think she live with this monkey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was banging it.</v>

1204
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.323
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really think that because I shouldn't </v>

1205
00:58:14.921 --> 00:58:15.760
<v Speaker 1>say monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a champ.</v>

1206
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:16.603
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was living with this chimp and </v>

1207
00:58:18.791 --> 00:58:21.940
<v Speaker 1>banging it and so her friend came over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a chip.</v>

1208
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Chip used to dress up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's inhuman.</v>

1209
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.740
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1210
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:28.830
<v Speaker 1>That was the lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

1211
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:31.480
<v Speaker 1>That was his girlfriend man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think initiated?</v>

1212
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 1>The first time she got a pet chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She raised it.</v>

1213
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a dick.</v>

1214
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.493
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>couple of glasses of red wine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipped,</v>

<v Speaker 1>way and that's his girlfriend now and </v>

1221
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:56.170
<v Speaker 1>this lady came over and she interrupted </v>
<v Speaker 1>his fun time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They bite your fingers off.</v>

1226
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 1>He's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was 200 pounds.</v>

1227
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Gets big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overfed chimpanzee.</v>

1228
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Super ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ungodly strong.</v>

1229
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.560
<v Speaker 1>No foreplay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Get fucked.</v>

1231

<v Speaker 5>Naked bubble is going to fuck you.</v>

1232
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 5>You have your period.</v>

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.180
<v Speaker 5>Try to keep that chip off eye.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're menstruating.</v>

1234
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:33.283
<v Speaker 5>A police officer who responded to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scene of the attack shot and killed </v>

1235
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 5>travis when he clawed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>opened the cops cruiser door and flashed</v>

1236
00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:43.970
<v Speaker 5>his bloody teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

1237
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He opened the fucking door.</v>

1238
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.670
<v Speaker 5>The cop was shooting it as it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling the door open,</v>

1239
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000
<v Speaker 5>flashing it's bloody teeth looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tear him apart to holy fuck,</v>

1240
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:57.463
<v Speaker 5>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if that was you and you didn't </v>

1241
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:04.850
<v Speaker 5>have a gun and you weren't a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just pulled up and you saw some chimp</v>

1242
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 5>tearing apart a lady and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

1243
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:07.873
<v Speaker 5>And the chimp just scores running </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards you and decides he's going to </v>

1244
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:13.780
<v Speaker 5>open up your fucking door now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's flashing his bloody teeth after</v>

1245
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.410
<v Speaker 5>just ate some lady's face.</v>

1246
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where was this?</v>

1247
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.963
<v Speaker 5>I love this part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Investigators later speculated that a </v>

1248
01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:26.801
<v Speaker 5>dose of Xanax caused the chimp to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>preserve a look at that face.</v>

1249
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.590
<v Speaker 5>Looks like now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1250
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.660
<v Speaker 5>Her face transplant was being rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my gosh.</v>

1251
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.533
<v Speaker 5>Surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that mean like she's going out to </v>

1252
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:42.530
<v Speaker 5>meet guys and she's being rejected?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1253
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:43.364
<v Speaker 5>her body rejects face transplants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any kind of transplants are notoriously </v>

1254
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 5>tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently.</v>

1255
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.270
<v Speaker 5>Poor Lady.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God said,</v>

1256
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:52.910
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where's it say that she was fucking him?</v>

1257
01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.340
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's mine part.</v>

1258
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.540
<v Speaker 5>I added the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1259
01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:57.980
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were serious.</v>

1260
01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.420
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what they're doing.</v>

1261
01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's totally plausible,</v>

1262
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:07.760
<v Speaker 5>it's completely plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I absolutely made it up for regarded</v>

1263
01:01:07.761 --> 01:01:09.260
<v Speaker 5>as her son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1264
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:10.094
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she didn't fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think a woman could get pregnant </v>

1265
01:01:12.591 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 5>from a monkey?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Depends on the woman.</v>

1266
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:17.790
<v Speaker 5>Depends on the monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1267
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 5>Some super smart monkey and really </v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid person who knows.</v>

1268
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1269
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.530
<v Speaker 5>there's some hybrids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1270
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.050
<v Speaker 5>That uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that wind up being viable.</v>

1271
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.320
<v Speaker 5>That's all like new species get </v>
<v Speaker 5>developed sometimes,</v>

1272
01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.490
<v Speaker 5>but most of the time it doesn't like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lagger,</v>

1273
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 5>but they can't make babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1274
01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:36.260
<v Speaker 5>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can make a baby lion and a tiger can</v>

1275
01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 5>breed and make a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that baby can make babies.</v>

1276
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.500
<v Speaker 5>So I wonder man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what was it,</v>

1277
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:44.420
<v Speaker 5>if you believe in evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

1278
01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:45.853
<v Speaker 5>What was it in history like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was it like when there was a bunch </v>

1279
01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:50.084
<v Speaker 5>of different species of humans because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they think there's a bunch now they've </v>

1280
01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 5>documented how many have documented now </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they keep finding new ones.</v>

1281
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 5>Like they found some new one in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>

1282
01:01:59.010 --> 01:01:59.541
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1283
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.010
<v Speaker 5>all the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1284
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:05.780
<v Speaker 5>that tweeted at me and sent me messages </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have fucked up and said,</v>

1285
01:02:05.781 --> 01:02:09.500
<v Speaker 5>facility Lowman Chenko is Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's actually from the Ukraine.</v>

1286
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:12.980
<v Speaker 5>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am a retarded American.</v>

1287
01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.173
<v Speaker 5>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody who's over there in that spot </v>

1288
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:17.410
<v Speaker 5>who talks like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1289
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.380
<v Speaker 5>that's how the Russian dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1290
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1291
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>that I understand that people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1292
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that give you an out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1293
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>because I had a buddy of mine growing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's Ukrainian.</v>

1294
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>He always regarded himself as Ukrainian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never thought of himself as Russian.</v>

1295
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>So I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1296
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like if we were America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>

1297
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Mexico,</v>

1298
01:02:36.661 --> 01:02:37.900
<v Speaker 1>we're all just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1299
01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you're from that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1300
01:02:39.151 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1301
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:40.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm from America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

1302
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from this spot,</v>

1303
01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1304
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>as far as the cave men go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>They didn't used to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neanderthal man and sapient's existed at</v>

1306
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at a timeline of cave</v>

1307
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make it seem like one ended in the,</v>

1308
01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>one just fucking started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a year,</v>

1309
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:00.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3000 bc all sudden they just changed </v>

1310
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:04.740
<v Speaker 1>3000 BC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>

1311
01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:05.574
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

1312
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a lot more than that.</v>

1313
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I think when they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people living alongside Neanderthal,</v>

1314
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I think they're talking about like 40 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>

1315
01:03:15.631 --> 01:03:16.640
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1317
01:03:18.391 --> 01:03:21.120
<v Speaker 1>they coexisted and they say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

1318
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>because neanderthal man was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>

1319
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.433
<v Speaker 1>Totally different kind of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally different than sap and came </v>

1320
01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:28.434
<v Speaker 1>along and sapient was much smarter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way he was the one that </v>

1321
01:03:33.901 --> 01:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>survived over neanderthal would show me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that again,</v>

1322
01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:37.464
<v Speaker 1>they were able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were able to out hunting out kill </v>

1323
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 1>or we fucked them all and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>interbreed with them.</v>

1324
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.750
<v Speaker 1>That probably might have happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1325
01:03:45.751 --> 01:03:46.501
<v Speaker 1>What does it say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1326
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>It says a guy is trying to make a hybrid</v>
<v Speaker 1>between a chimp.</v>

1327
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>

1328
01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me guess.</v>

1329
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wild group of 13 female chimpanzees to</v>

1330
01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>bring back to primary research facility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sucky me.</v>

1331
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:05.430
<v Speaker 1>The female chimpanzees were repeatedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>injected with human male sperm,</v>

1332
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 1>but none became pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rumored that Ivonne have used his</v>

1333
01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>own sperm or that of his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but few people believe on.</v>

1334
01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Can we come downstairs for a minute?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1335
01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>where else is he going to get come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to go for a hard to get come.</v>

1336
01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:24.240
<v Speaker 8>He tried to get a female volunteers to </v>
<v Speaker 8>get injected with a male chimpanzees and</v>

1337
01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:28.150
<v Speaker 8>how many did it rumored that it only </v>
<v Speaker 8>happened once,</v>

1338
01:04:28.151 --> 01:04:33.100
<v Speaker 8>but apparently he got arrested and sent </v>
<v Speaker 8>away to work in a veterinary station and</v>

1339
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:37.050
<v Speaker 8>stand and died two years later.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But note,</v>

1340
01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.090
<v Speaker 8>no pregnancy actually happened,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but maybe he actually did do it.</v>

1341
01:04:40.091 --> 01:04:40.860
<v Speaker 8>Who knows?</v>

1342
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>The rumor was the pregnancy actually did</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1343
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:43.764
<v Speaker 1>Did Not deny.</v>

1344
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:48.280
<v Speaker 8>There's a rumor that he did actually </v>
<v Speaker 8>inject a woman with sperm.</v>

1345
01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.990
<v Speaker 1>This story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of this was like the beginning</v>

1346
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>of like some crazy superhero x men type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1347
01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll have some new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new.</v>

1348
01:04:57.921 --> 01:04:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of Wolverine,</v>

1349
01:04:59.121 --> 01:04:59.954
<v Speaker 1>some man champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some hybrid like wolverine looked like </v>

1350
01:05:03.141 --> 01:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of a man champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hybrid.</v>

1351
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Real Wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like from the comic books,</v>

1352
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:09.920
<v Speaker 1>he was hairy looking half human looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1353
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:11.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis did all kinds of shit like </v>

1354
01:05:12.591 --> 01:05:13.424
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1355
01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Taking heads off one animal and trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put them on other</v>

1356
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.813
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

1357
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:22.720
<v Speaker 5>But how many find this out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

1358
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 5>Find out when did human beings and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>endo talls coexist.</v>

1359
01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 5>How long ago was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or how about this?</v>

1360
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 5>How long ago did neanderthals go </v>
<v Speaker 5>extinct?</v>

1361
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Because that's what would tell us a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you had to guess,</v>

1362
01:05:37.631 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 5>what are you going to get Craig?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd say yeah.</v>

1363
01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 5>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>sounds bonus.</v>

1364
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:42.101
<v Speaker 5>Say for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1365
01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:42.934
<v Speaker 5>I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neanderthals went extinct in Europe </v>

1366
01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:45.880
<v Speaker 5>about 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

1367
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.360
<v Speaker 5>Giving them millennia to coexist with </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern humans culturally and sexually.</v>

1368
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:53.883
<v Speaker 5>New findings suggest the research also </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggests that modern humans did not </v>

1369
01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.740
<v Speaker 5>cause neanderthals to rapidly go </v>
<v Speaker 5>extinct.</v>

1370
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:04.160
<v Speaker 5>As some researchers have previously </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggested they killed the.</v>

1371
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of people that did.</v>

1372
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 5>There was one guy that had a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking theory.</v>

1373
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 5>That's probably absolutely not true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but his theory was that they didn't look</v>

1374
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 5>like people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His theory,</v>

1375
01:06:16.391 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 5>we don't know what their soft tissue </v>
<v Speaker 5>looked like.</v>

1376
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.360
<v Speaker 5>So his tea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had this idea of a really intelligent</v>

1377
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:26.110
<v Speaker 5>apelike creature because he compared </v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you remember?</v>

1378
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Speaker 5>That whole guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his whole thing,</v>

1379
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:32.180
<v Speaker 5>he made like an animated video of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>it looked like.</v>

1380
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.590
<v Speaker 5>It was terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like gorilla looking thing.</v>

1381
01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like heavily muscled because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were only like five,</v>

1382
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:43.450
<v Speaker 5>two or five three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were like 205 pounds with giant</v>

1383
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.630
<v Speaker 5>boulders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sized bones in their body.</v>

1384
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 5>They had way different bone structure </v>
<v Speaker 5>than we do.</v>

1385
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.070
<v Speaker 5>And they were supposed to be like </v>
<v Speaker 5>freakishly strong.</v>

1386
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:51.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1387
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:55.170
<v Speaker 4>But I think they were sorta like on all </v>
<v Speaker 4>fours and standing upright,</v>

1388
01:06:55.171 --> 01:06:58.440
<v Speaker 4>but then really sapiens stood upright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>

1389
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.810
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there was a difference in the way</v>

1390
01:07:00.811 --> 01:07:04.140
<v Speaker 4>they moved that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sapiens were faster but they weren't</v>

1391
01:07:04.141 --> 01:07:04.974
<v Speaker 4>as strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if they got into any kind of a </v>

1392
01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:07.920
<v Speaker 4>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were fucking dead.</v>

1393
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.890
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1394
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.020
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1395
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.630
<v Speaker 4>I read sapiens.</v>

1396
01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.073
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what they absolutely think that </v>

1397
01:07:17.481 --> 01:07:19.220
<v Speaker 5>they looked like the neanderthals looked</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1398
01:07:19.221 --> 01:07:20.054
<v Speaker 5>but there was a guy had some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>alternative theory that was probably </v>

1399
01:07:23.991 --> 01:07:28.991
<v Speaker 5>horseshit that I want to focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably totally fake,</v>

1400
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:34.880
<v Speaker 5>but it was like his theories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what if she would have neanderthal,</v>

1401
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.833
<v Speaker 5>didn't look anything like us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what if deanna tall like had </v>

1402
01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:43.570
<v Speaker 5>gorilla like skin and was just just </v>
<v Speaker 5>hooking scary looking fanged up,</v>

1403
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:47.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>jacked humanoid kind of ape.</v>

1404
01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows,</v>

1405
01:07:49.371 --> 01:07:50.204
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was definitely like a bunch of </v>

1406
01:07:51.951 --> 01:07:53.880
<v Speaker 5>different kinds of people though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They keep</v>

1407
01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:55.043
<v Speaker 4>did more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more evidence of new teeth and </v>

1408
01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:58.070
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1409
01:07:58.071 --> 01:08:01.280
<v Speaker 4>But the evolution was so slow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we think about things.</v>

1410
01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.910
<v Speaker 4>The way evolution happens for us today </v>
<v Speaker 4>is technological.</v>

1411
01:08:04.911 --> 01:08:07.760
<v Speaker 4>So we see shit happened from decade to </v>
<v Speaker 4>decade.</v>

1412
01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The end.</v>

1413
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:12.410
<v Speaker 4>It's all profile was super predator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in this video,</v>

1414
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:13.910
<v Speaker 4>when you're looking at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all,</v>

1415
01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.120
<v Speaker 4>he's got like gorilla look</v>

1416
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:16.953
<v Speaker 5>and scan or these big crazy eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a terrifying looking beast as </v>

1417
01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:22.214
<v Speaker 5>opposed to the way we always project </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and he bases it on like the shape </v>

1418
01:08:26.421 --> 01:08:31.421
<v Speaker 5>of their head and like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a gorilla's head longer jaw mean.</v>

1419
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:32.733
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause we don't know what their soft </v>

1420
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:34.874
<v Speaker 5>tissue looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you give them a gorilla nose </v>

1421
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 5>instead of a human nose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they look way fucking scarier.</v>

1422
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:41.833
<v Speaker 5>And his argument was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have no idea what their nose look </v>

1423
01:08:43.351 --> 01:08:44.940
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are we giving them a human nose?</v>

1424
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:46.583
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if that flies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if anthropologists are getting </v>

1425
01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 5>angry right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were some vicious motherfucker.</v>

1426
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Look at the way that thing looked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's what it looked like.</v>

1427
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.410
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he looks up right now though.</v>

1428
01:08:57.411 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 4>I guess they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were partly on all fours.</v>

1429
01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:01.640
<v Speaker 4>Ended up right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they were upright.</v>

1430
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.760
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm pretty sure neanderthals </v>
<v Speaker 4>were completely upright.</v>

1431
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1432
01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they were a type of human.</v>

1433
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just weren't Homo Sapiens,</v>

1434
01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:11.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1435
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.240
<v Speaker 4>So I'm so stupid to have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations.</v>

1436
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.733
<v Speaker 4>I'm so stupid because I read an entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>book about sapiens and this whole </v>

1437
01:09:19.011 --> 01:09:22.730
<v Speaker 4>transformation and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is I read when I go to sleep</v>

1438
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.910
<v Speaker 4>and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so fucking tired.</v>

1439
01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all goes through me the next night.</v>

1440
01:09:26.361 --> 01:09:27.194
<v Speaker 4>I can't even find out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even find where I left off on </v>

1441
01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:29.744
<v Speaker 4>the book is in reading at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the best way to fucking fall </v>

1442
01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:32.750
<v Speaker 4>asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1443
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.580
<v Speaker 4>It makes you go to sleep so much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Like something about reading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just conk dude.</v>

1445
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 4>My wife opens up our book at night every</v>
<v Speaker 4>night and she,</v>

1446
01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:46.270
<v Speaker 4>she does not get to the second page and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's sitting upright and I can hear her</v>

1447
01:09:46.521 --> 01:09:49.400
<v Speaker 4>breathing change and she's asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1448
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:53.210
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take a sleeping pill every night.</v>

1449
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:58.690
<v Speaker 4>Take Asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taking a Lunesta and the side effects.</v>

1450
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:03.230
<v Speaker 4>I think a loss of memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what it is.</v>

1451
01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:06.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking the sleep pill and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading and uh,</v>

1452
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.320
<v Speaker 4>nothing sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But otherwise I can't sleep.</v>

1453
01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:10.610
<v Speaker 4>My mother and brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same way.</v>

1454
01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:11.444
<v Speaker 4>We cannot sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just our minds fucking race and I'll </v>

1455
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:16.620
<v Speaker 4>lay there for hours and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1456
01:10:16.621 --> 01:10:17.454
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather be a little groggy in the </v>

1457
01:10:20.331 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 4>morning then then be exhausted in five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you tried any kind of meditation or</v>

1458
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.780
<v Speaker 4>anything to calm your mind for you when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you started meditating?</v>

1459
01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 4>But I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only started meditating like two years</v>

1460
01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:31.760
<v Speaker 4>ago and I've been taking the sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>pills for probably like four,</v>

1461
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.370
<v Speaker 4>so I should try to get off of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's stupid,</v>

1462
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.800
<v Speaker 4>but I think if you get off those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where it gets hairy.</v>

1463
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:37.993
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.340
<v Speaker 4>So if you start going crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>call me up so I know,</v>

1465
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.713
<v Speaker 4>I'll know.</v>

1466
01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Just say just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1467
01:10:44.981 --> 01:10:47.410
<v Speaker 5>I tried going off these fucking sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 5>pills.</v>

1468
01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:48.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gotcha.</v>

1469
01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Failure.</v>

1470
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:52.080
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need you to do my 10:20</v>

1471
01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.170
<v Speaker 4>spot at the laugh factory tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1472
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.820
<v Speaker 5>when you get off those things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleeping pills,</v>

1473
01:10:57.030 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 5>they have a real bizarre reaction some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people have to them or they'll do things</v>

1474
01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.453
<v Speaker 5>and wake up in the middle of doing them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>driving down the highway in a shootout </v>

1475
01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:07.500
<v Speaker 5>with the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that kind of Shit,</v>

1476
01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:10.840
<v Speaker 5>like you wake up in the middle of an act</v>
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>

1477
01:11:10.841 --> 01:11:11.674
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why you're on sleeping while you're on </v>

1478
01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.200
<v Speaker 5>certain</v>

1479
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.070
<v Speaker 1>sleeping pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1480
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:15.933
<v Speaker 1>Ambien is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I ran out and I took a friend's </v>

1481
01:11:18.171 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>ambien recently and I had the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane dreams.</v>

1482
01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard.</v>

1483
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1484
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people who love that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1485
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno why Ambien is prescribed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with opioids.</v>

1486
01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they still prescribing this shit</v>

1487
01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.354
<v Speaker 1>when it's so addictive and so dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people want to be able to make </v>

1488
01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>their own choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1489
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:38.694
<v Speaker 1>And if you could go to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're informed correctly and you go </v>

1490
01:11:41.401 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>to a doctor and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1491
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a fucking ambient.</v>

1492
01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's bad for my sleep.</v>

1493
01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to go to sleep.</v>

1494
01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:53.813
<v Speaker 1>If you're a grown adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel you should be able to make that </v>

1495
01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:57.474
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

1496
01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.400
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come you can make that decision?</v>

1497
01:11:59.401 --> 01:12:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And drank a fucking bottle of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1498
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:02.423
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron White's tequila a night if you so </v>

1499
01:12:04.501 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 1>choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you decide to take an ambient?</v>

1500
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.850
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

1501
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.923
<v Speaker 1>is it really worse than getting hammered</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody gets hammered and there's </v>

1502
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:14.010
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people getting hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1503
01:12:14.011 --> 01:12:14.844
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like with all the options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know with Lunesta I don't have </v>

1504
01:12:17.581 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>these side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1505
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1506
01:12:20.191 --> 01:12:21.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1507
01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:22.283
<v Speaker 1>there's no side effects with luminess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a paid spokesman for Lunesta by </v>

1508
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:26.514
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just found that I did take ambien </v>

1509
01:12:28.501 --> 01:12:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like tripping.</v>

1510
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So lunesta does it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lunesta works.</v>

1511
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:34.583
<v Speaker 1>Joe Lunesta works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done anything like </v>

1512
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Melatonin or have you tried like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Melatonin?</v>

1513
01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Melatonin works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>

1514
01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

1515
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:43.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1516
01:12:43.951 --> 01:12:45.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just try that then?</v>

1517
01:12:45.301 --> 01:12:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Since it's a natural migration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to get addicted to things.</v>

1518
01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I put the booze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I drink.</v>

1519
01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:53.910
<v Speaker 1>And what is this shit you gave me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caveman coffee,</v>

1520
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a nice little kick.</v>

1521
01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It's got a hell of a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a hell of a kick to it is.</v>

1522
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.030
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of mainly because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste that good.</v>

1523
01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.253
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1524
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like black coffee.</v>

1525
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1526
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Like when I say it doesn't taste that </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1527
01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't taste like a Caramel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Macchiato,</v>

1528
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1529
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:13.583
<v Speaker 1>that tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what every slurpee like this is </v>

1530
01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:18.090
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's full of sugar.</v>

1531
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 1>This tastes like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're calling it like a Guinness.</v>

1532
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.753
<v Speaker 1>Guinness have coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got this weird sort of acquired </v>

1533
01:13:25.231 --> 01:13:28.380
<v Speaker 1>taste for a little fuzziness to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nice.</v>

1534
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Nitrogenated.</v>

1535
01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it works.</v>

1536
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:33.900
<v Speaker 1>More gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're more fucked up.</v>

1537
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got 270 milligrams caffeine.</v>

1538
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a caffeine freak.</v>

1539
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I drink a lot of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1540
01:13:41.431 --> 01:13:42.264
<v Speaker 1>but that one's manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does caffeine never really derails your </v>

1541
01:13:44.971 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 1>judgment to manageable addiction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he got to like a legit addiction,</v>

1542
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.250
<v Speaker 1>caffeine is not a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1543
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.040
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one you can kind of.</v>

1544
01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 1>You could skate by with that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes is going to get.</v>

1545
01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:57.144
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that's gonna get you </v>

1546
01:13:58.530 --> 01:13:59.363
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the worst thing you can be </v>

1547
01:14:00.511 --> 01:14:01.344
<v Speaker 1>addicted to then heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like pills might be worse than </v>

1548
01:14:04.321 --> 01:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes because you can make rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions when you're on cigarettes.</v>

1549
01:14:07.741 --> 01:14:10.770
<v Speaker 1>The problem is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the health consequences of cigarettes or</v>

1550
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>almost</v>

1551
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.993
<v Speaker 9>inescapable.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We've just made an irrational decision </v>

1552
01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:16.200
<v Speaker 9>if you're lighting a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

1553
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:21.550
<v Speaker 9>so it's got you in a point of addiction </v>
<v Speaker 9>where you are literally killing yourself</v>

1554
01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.393
<v Speaker 5>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of amazing that it's still </v>

1555
01:14:23.331 --> 01:14:25.280
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing really.</v>

1556
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:28.520
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm 100 percent in favor of people doing</v>

1557
01:14:28.521 --> 01:14:31.700
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were informed and you go,</v>

1558
01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:33.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want a fucking cigarette,</v>

1559
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:36.530
<v Speaker 5>you should be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So by that hand,</v>

1560
01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.440
<v Speaker 5>if you could do that with booze,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you could do that.</v>

1561
01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:42.260
<v Speaker 5>When we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think freedom is best.</v>

1562
01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.140
<v Speaker 5>It's best to have people figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 5>on their own.</v>

1563
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.830
<v Speaker 5>It's best to decide for people what they</v>
<v Speaker 5>can and can't do.</v>

1564
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:50.763
<v Speaker 9>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it's the same with raising a </v>

1565
01:14:51.841 --> 01:14:53.040
<v Speaker 9>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1566
01:14:53.041 --> 01:14:55.020
<v Speaker 9>I try to give my kids a lot of free </v>
<v Speaker 9>freedom,</v>

1567
01:14:55.021 --> 01:14:56.280
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I informed them,</v>

1568
01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:59.430
<v Speaker 9>I reign them in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I try to shepherd them,</v>

1569
01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.410
<v Speaker 9>but I don't ride them,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1570
01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.100
<v Speaker 9>and when they make mistakes I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't overly punish,</v>

1571
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:06.263
<v Speaker 9>I just try to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I tell them I'm disappointed and that </v>

1572
01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:09.990
<v Speaker 9>means a lot to them,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I think that,</v>

1573
01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:11.490
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

1574
01:15:11.491 --> 01:15:12.324
<v Speaker 9>this year your kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they need to internalize responsibility </v>

1575
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.943
<v Speaker 9>and the earlier they do it the better </v>
<v Speaker 9>because then the process of </v>

1576
01:15:19.351 --> 01:15:20.184
<v Speaker 9>internalizing responsibility should </v>
<v Speaker 9>start as in in whatever ways you can </v>

1577
01:15:24.271 --> 01:15:25.104
<v Speaker 9>parcel it out from a young age.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's how you got to do it because by </v>

1578
01:15:27.001 --> 01:15:29.670
<v Speaker 9>the time they move out,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1579
01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:34.050
<v Speaker 9>it's like you're not going to be there </v>
<v Speaker 9>to make these decisions for them.</v>

1580
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1581
01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.053
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the task of raising human is probably </v>

1582
01:15:40.501 --> 01:15:44.760
<v Speaker 5>one of the most important things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the most impossible to correct.</v>

1583
01:15:44.761 --> 01:15:45.594
<v Speaker 5>Once you fucked it up and it's put in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hands of everybody who is most </v>

1584
01:15:50.281 --> 01:15:52.290
<v Speaker 5>likely raised incorrectly themselves.</v>

1585
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.491
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the hope is,</v>

1586
01:15:55.491 --> 01:15:58.150
<v Speaker 9>is more therapy than there was today.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's more literature,</v>

1587
01:15:58.151 --> 01:16:01.750
<v Speaker 9>there's more studies and I do think </v>
<v Speaker 9>we're more informed about what we do.</v>

1588
01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.660
<v Speaker 9>I think we're more vigilant about it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think men,</v>

1589
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.523
<v Speaker 9>the fact that I just said that to </v>
<v Speaker 9>another man that wouldn't have happened </v>

1590
01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:12.040
<v Speaker 9>25 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no guy would talk about parenting in any</v>

1591
01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:13.390
<v Speaker 9>deep way to another man.</v>

1592
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.460
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was kinda almost gay.</v>

1593
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.980
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was.</v>

1594
01:16:18.981 --> 01:16:21.140
<v Speaker 9>It was not,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was not your role to do that.</v>

1595
01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:23.390
<v Speaker 9>And now pay parents.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a partnership,</v>

1596
01:16:23.391 --> 01:16:26.120
<v Speaker 9>the mother and the father because the </v>
<v Speaker 9>worst thing,</v>

1597
01:16:26.121 --> 01:16:29.930
<v Speaker 9>and I know a couple that's like this </v>
<v Speaker 9>where they're never on the same page and</v>

1598
01:16:29.931 --> 01:16:33.320
<v Speaker 9>their kids are all fucked up and neither</v>
<v Speaker 9>one of them is a bad parent.</v>

1599
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 9>They're just doing it in opposite ways,</v>
<v Speaker 9>ways.</v>

1600
01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.350
<v Speaker 9>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's very like,</v>

1601
01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.980
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1602
01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:43.910
<v Speaker 9>checked out in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but like in the way,</v>

1603
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:49.010
<v Speaker 9>not in a healthy way,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I describe the hands off is still caring</v>

1604
01:16:49.011 --> 01:16:51.770
<v Speaker 9>and controlling and supporting his is a </v>
<v Speaker 9>little bit more,</v>

1605
01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.990
<v Speaker 9>a little bit more like I can't handle </v>
<v Speaker 9>this.</v>

1606
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:55.183
<v Speaker 9>Hers is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>she's super eight type personality and </v>

1607
01:16:57.771 --> 01:17:00.700
<v Speaker 9>she's trying to drive the kids to be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1608
01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:02.180
<v Speaker 9>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 9>their best potential,</v>

1609
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:04.040
<v Speaker 9>which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>A little bit of that is good.</v>

1610
01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.900
<v Speaker 9>And little bit of what he's doing is </v>
<v Speaker 9>good,</v>

1611
01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:10.490
<v Speaker 9>but they're both polar opposites and not</v>
<v Speaker 9>really their strategies</v>

1612
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 5>will either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

1613
01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:13.713
<v Speaker 9>I really think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the main thing is that your kids can't </v>

1614
01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:18.130
<v Speaker 9>feel like they're getting two different </v>
<v Speaker 9>messages at the same time.</v>

1615
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:21.680
<v Speaker 5>Time for Mommy and daddy can't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're being smothered either.</v>

1616
01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:22.880
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1617
01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:26.280
<v Speaker 5>one of the things about kids that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>find out real early,</v>

1618
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.120
<v Speaker 5>if you tell them not to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they want to do.</v>

1619
01:17:29.121 --> 01:17:32.360
<v Speaker 5>They don't want you telling them what to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do because they're little people.</v>

1620
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.473
<v Speaker 5>Even though they might be five or six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's still little people and people </v>

1621
01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:41.930
<v Speaker 5>don't like you telling them what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to explain to them,</v>

1622
01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:42.764
<v Speaker 5>it's much better to explain to them why </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's important that you do the thing </v>

1623
01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:48.430
<v Speaker 5>that you don't want to do and why it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good thing.</v>

1624
01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:50.210
<v Speaker 5>You've got to change the way you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

1625
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Don't think about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1626
01:17:51.621 --> 01:17:53.330
<v Speaker 5>it's this chore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about it.</v>

1627
01:17:53.331 --> 01:17:54.164
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just a thing that I have to do </v>

1628
01:17:55.761 --> 01:17:56.594
<v Speaker 5>right now and I'm so lucky in so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>ways and that's how I should look at </v>

1629
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:03.500
<v Speaker 5>life and that jumped on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't just get annoyed at things.</v>

1630
01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:06.110
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to go to bed,</v>

1631
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.630
<v Speaker 5>go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to get sleep.</v>

1632
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't want to go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

1633
01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:11.953
<v Speaker 5>I feel the same way all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as a person who's in charge of your </v>

1634
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 5>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that you're not quite wise enough</v>

1635
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:19.040
<v Speaker 5>to make the decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to be healthy.</v>

1636
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Your little kids need to get like 10 to </v>
<v Speaker 5>12 hours sleep.</v>

1637
01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.153
<v Speaker 9>How do you get to tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Give them the association that they're </v>

1638
01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:29.180
<v Speaker 9>making choices and that their choices </v>
<v Speaker 9>have ramifications.</v>

1639
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:30.014
<v Speaker 9>You're going to wake up to you that </v>
<v Speaker 9>sometimes it's hard for me to wake you </v>

1640
01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:35.000
<v Speaker 9>up and it hurts in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Will they won't be that way.</v>

1641
01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:37.690
<v Speaker 9>If you go to sleep now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you'll wake up and you'll feel good.</v>

1642
01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:40.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's man.</v>

1643
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:43.350
<v Speaker 5>That is the fucking biggest difference </v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

1644
01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:46.200
<v Speaker 5>when I had day jobs and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1645
01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:47.123
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like for years I had sleep deprivation </v>

1646
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:53.820
<v Speaker 5>because I was getting up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 5>for delivering the newspapers and it was</v>

1647
01:18:53.821 --> 01:18:54.654
<v Speaker 5>trying to go back to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I always stayed up at night because </v>

1648
01:18:55.921 --> 01:18:58.740
<v Speaker 5>I was doing stand up and like for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>longest time,</v>

1649
01:18:58.741 --> 01:19:02.190
<v Speaker 5>like I was really screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then once I quit doing that,</v>

1650
01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:03.083
<v Speaker 5>once I just started doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stand up and I started getting </v>

1651
01:19:05.431 --> 01:19:06.264
<v Speaker 5>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I go to bed after the clubs and I </v>

1652
01:19:09.061 --> 01:19:13.560
<v Speaker 5>would get up at 11,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wake up and I felt so good.</v>

1653
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:15.270
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God.</v>

1654
01:19:15.271 --> 01:19:16.590
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything feels great.</v>

1655
01:19:16.591 --> 01:19:19.740
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't feel like I'm constantly at</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lack.</v>

1656
01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.660
<v Speaker 5>That feeling that you have when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>tired all the time.</v>

1657
01:19:21.661 --> 01:19:22.494
<v Speaker 5>When you work too many hours you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>get enough sleep because that fucking </v>

1658
01:19:25.501 --> 01:19:29.610
<v Speaker 5>feeling like you're always at a lack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always like a hole in your,</v>

1659
01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:32.830
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your biological game as it were.</v>

1660
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ugh.</v>

1661
01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.860
<v Speaker 5>Just trying to be left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1662
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:37.650
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just don't.</v>

1663
01:19:37.651 --> 01:19:40.860
<v Speaker 5>But if you can get that solid eight to </v>
<v Speaker 5>10 hours sleep,</v>

1664
01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:44.970
<v Speaker 5>that goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you can get 10,</v>

1665
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:48.690
<v Speaker 5>but he could only get eight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's worth so much,</v>

1666
01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.200
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.700
<v Speaker 5>So fucking value through it.</v>

1668
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:52.810
<v Speaker 9>Throw a 20 minute meditation on top of </v>
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

1669
01:19:52.811 --> 01:19:53.644
<v Speaker 9>The next day around 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 9>in the afternoon when you're crashing </v>

1670
01:19:56.081 --> 01:19:56.950
<v Speaker 9>out after lunch</v>

1671
01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.980
<v Speaker 5>if you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good move.</v>

1672
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could just sit down.</v>

1673
01:20:00.571 --> 01:20:03.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean the meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the,</v>

1674
01:20:03.561 --> 01:20:04.394
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the word meditation is so loaded you </v>

1675
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 5>because it has</v>

1676
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.850
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a sort of like A.</v>

1677
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of us I think have this idea about</v>

1678
01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:14.130
<v Speaker 3>people meditate is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1679
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:15.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just trying to find some spiritual </v>

1680
01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:18.204
<v Speaker 3>peace and this is like some masturbatory</v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdness and you stand in front of </v>

1681
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:24.510
<v Speaker 3>fucking incense and pretend you're from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a different culture.</v>

1682
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.240
<v Speaker 3>But I think that just being alone with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your thoughts and just your thoughts and</v>

1683
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.393
<v Speaker 3>just concentrating on just thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about as little as possible was just </v>

1684
01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:36.810
<v Speaker 3>thinking maybe even just about </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing.</v>

1685
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm breathing in and breathing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just that alone is a form of meditation.</v>

1686
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:43.100
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

1687
01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.410
<v Speaker 9>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's a guided sleep.</v>

1688
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:47.120
<v Speaker 9>Think of it as taking a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1689
01:20:47.121 --> 01:20:49.340
<v Speaker 9>Eckhart tolle talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1690
01:20:49.341 --> 01:20:50.450
<v Speaker 9>with,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with meditation,</v>

1691
01:20:50.451 --> 01:20:51.284
<v Speaker 9>it's just really,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's reminding you to not think about </v>

1692
01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:54.950
<v Speaker 9>the past to the future for a little </v>
<v Speaker 9>while.</v>

1693
01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:55.784
<v Speaker 9>It's about just thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 9>breathing that's happening right now or </v>

1694
01:20:58.281 --> 01:21:01.910
<v Speaker 9>the mantra that's happening right now </v>
<v Speaker 9>and when you come out of it,</v>

1695
01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:03.770
<v Speaker 9>you're not going to stay in that state </v>
<v Speaker 9>all day,</v>

1696
01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:08.480
<v Speaker 9>but you will have brought yourself back </v>
<v Speaker 9>to that point if only for 20 minutes and</v>

1697
01:21:08.481 --> 01:21:09.314
<v Speaker 9>that will sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that will guide you for the rest of the </v>

1698
01:21:11.391 --> 01:21:12.224
<v Speaker 9>day.</v>

1699
01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:13.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the momentum of most people's </v>

1700
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:19.260
<v Speaker 3>lives is so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mine included,</v>

1701
01:21:19.261 --> 01:21:24.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure yours included that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes you just get caught up in how</v>

1702
01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:28.320
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking or how you're behaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>or what you're doing.</v>

1703
01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:30.510
<v Speaker 3>You just get caught up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just like,</v>

1704
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:33.300
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like pushing you from behind and if</v>

1705
01:21:33.301 --> 01:21:38.301
<v Speaker 3>you can just stop as often as possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and do nothing for an hour and breathe,</v>

1706
01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.093
<v Speaker 3>just do nothing but think and breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come out of it with a more balanced </v>

1707
01:21:44.221 --> 01:21:45.060
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

1708
01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.160
<v Speaker 9>You make better decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're not reacting to things</v>

1709
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>

1710
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.213
<v Speaker 3>You're not being pushed from behind by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the momentum of everything you've </v>

1711
01:21:53.011 --> 01:21:55.350
<v Speaker 3>experienced over the last x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1712
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:59.790
<v Speaker 3>You get a fresh restart to contemplate </v>
<v Speaker 3>your existence.</v>

1713
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1714
01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:01.503
<v Speaker 3>we can't do anything about the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's where we are right now and </v>

1715
01:22:03.331 --> 01:22:04.380
<v Speaker 3>this is what we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1716
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Now I've decided that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on that,</v>

1717
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.033
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to concentrate on this and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>give yourself like a chance to almost </v>

1718
01:22:10.861 --> 01:22:15.400
<v Speaker 3>give yourself a little personal seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give yourself a little garlic will.</v>

1719
01:22:15.401 --> 01:22:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you happy about this?</v>

1720
01:22:17.011 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you were giving yourself advice,</v>

1721
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:21.240
<v Speaker 3>he'd probably be way different than what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually do.</v>

1722
01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:25.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought that if I was giving</v>

1723
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:27.290
<v Speaker 3>myself advice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how,</v>

1724
01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how brutal would I be with myself?</v>

1725
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would I be with myself?</v>

1726
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.530
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's why you're supposed to set goals,</v>

1727
01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:36.790
<v Speaker 9>because goals are you sitting down in a </v>
<v Speaker 9>cold calculating way and saying,</v>

1728
01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:39.850
<v Speaker 9>where do I want to be in a year?</v>
<v Speaker 9>What are the steps that I need to get to</v>

1729
01:22:39.851 --> 01:22:40.684
<v Speaker 9>that and then setting small goals to get</v>
<v Speaker 9>you there because day to day you're </v>

1730
01:22:43.481 --> 01:22:44.314
<v Speaker 9>reacting to people are codependent with </v>
<v Speaker 9>their wives or their kids instead of </v>

1731
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:48.183
<v Speaker 9>reacting to that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're wondering if your phone's going </v>

1732
01:22:50.061 --> 01:22:50.894
<v Speaker 9>to ring.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're wondering what people are saying </v>

1733
01:22:51.641 --> 01:22:52.474
<v Speaker 9>on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's so many dynamics that have you </v>

1734
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:58.570
<v Speaker 9>spinning around and not in your own </v>
<v Speaker 9>space.</v>

1735
01:22:58.571 --> 01:22:59.404
<v Speaker 9>So that said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's what I love the beginning of the </v>

1736
01:23:01.061 --> 01:23:01.894
<v Speaker 9>year.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I love sitting down and setting up some </v>

1737
01:23:02.921 --> 01:23:04.150
<v Speaker 9>new goals.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

1738
01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 9>you and I just talked a couple of nights</v>
<v Speaker 9>ago</v>

1739
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.933
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your goal is to sort of try to not </v>

1740
01:23:09.191 --> 01:23:11.950
<v Speaker 1>get off social media more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Answer your phone all day.</v>

1741
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Mine cast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay off my phone for many,</v>

1742
01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:15.400
<v Speaker 1>many hours at a time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I'm just thinking about the amount </v>

1744
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:21.220
<v Speaker 1>of time that I spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just looking for something interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like Zach Galifianakis,</v>

1842
01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.273
<v Speaker 4>Sarah Silverman and know Andy Kindler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they went up and they didn't know </v>

1843
01:27:59.001 --> 01:27:59.834
<v Speaker 4>who Joey Diaz was and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had him go on like second just to </v>

1844
01:28:03.801 --> 01:28:04.634
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to raise the bar and everybody </v>

1845
01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:06.764
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

1846
01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.813
<v Speaker 4>And he went up there and he's doing this</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole bit about having some chick piss </v>

1847
01:28:12.651 --> 01:28:17.651
<v Speaker 4>in his mouth in a bathtub and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking it like a soldier and uh,</v>

1848
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.980
<v Speaker 4>and the place they don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make of him.</v>

1849
01:28:21.981 --> 01:28:22.814
<v Speaker 4>At first it takes some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes them like a good two minutes </v>

1850
01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.520
<v Speaker 4>for them to just pick their jaws up off </v>
<v Speaker 4>the table,</v>

1851
01:28:28.521 --> 01:28:29.354
<v Speaker 4>put the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put the job back in their head and then </v>

1852
01:28:30.861 --> 01:28:35.861
<v Speaker 4>start to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you just saw them convulsed and</v>

1853
01:28:36.231 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 4>in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah and all them,</v>

1854
01:28:37.581 --> 01:28:39.680
<v Speaker 4>they're going like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is this guy?</v>

1855
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.570
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

1856
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:43.730
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking Joey Diaz.</v>

1857
01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:46.640
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know when.</v>

1858
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:49.310
<v Speaker 4>How long ago was this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two years ago.</v>

1859
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not know who Joey d is,</v>

1860
01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:55.460
<v Speaker 4>is because he doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he works the Improv.</v>

1861
01:28:55.461 --> 01:28:56.294
<v Speaker 4>Does he have a different comic knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you hear about like a guy like you </v>

1862
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 4>always hear about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I heard about big Jay oakerson</v>

1863
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.903
<v Speaker 3>before I saw him.</v>

1864
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.530
<v Speaker 9>You gotta see this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's very foreign.</v>

1865
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:06.910
<v Speaker 9>I think maybe there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1866
01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.300
<v Speaker 9>splintered comedy world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Exact doesn't do a ton of stand up and I</v>

1867
01:29:10.301 --> 01:29:10.991
<v Speaker 9>think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1868
01:29:10.991 --> 01:29:11.824
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sarah,</v>

1869
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:14.040
<v Speaker 9>Sarah works the comedy store sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sometimes.</v>

1870
01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:16.540
<v Speaker 9>I've seen her there a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not as often as she should.</v>

1871
01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.660
<v Speaker 9>What are you judging?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1872
01:29:19.661 --> 01:29:21.190
<v Speaker 9>she needs you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She needs that,</v>

1873
01:29:21.191 --> 01:29:22.810
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think some comics they work,</v>

1874
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 9>they'll work largo a lot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I think it,</v>

1875
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:28.180
<v Speaker 9>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can draw your own crowd,</v>

1876
01:29:28.450 --> 01:29:29.283
<v Speaker 9>but she's like a real comic.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She can play in a room like the store </v>

1877
01:29:32.261 --> 01:29:33.094
<v Speaker 9>where they didn't all come to see her </v>
<v Speaker 9>and she can fucking prove something to </v>

1878
01:29:35.711 --> 01:29:38.530
<v Speaker 9>people that maybe don't know what a good</v>
<v Speaker 9>comic she is.</v>

1879
01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:39.820
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Well I would agree with you that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's one of the best comics live.</v>

1881
01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

1882
01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:47.110
<v Speaker 3>she killed at the comedy store last time</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw her,</v>

1883
01:29:47.111 --> 01:29:49.390
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was quite awhile ago.</v>

1884
01:29:49.391 --> 01:29:51.520
<v Speaker 3>It might've been a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter of fact,</v>

1885
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:53.740
<v Speaker 3>sometime between now and a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1886
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:57.160
<v Speaker 3>she destroyed and I was laughing really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

1887
01:29:57.410 --> 01:30:00.520
<v Speaker 3>There was some funny shit in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the other hand,</v>

1888
01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.000
<v Speaker 3>she's obviously got money and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously comfortable,</v>

1889
01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.990
<v Speaker 3>so she should do whatever the fuck she </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants.</v>

1890
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:07.833
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean there's guys like Paul f </v>

1891
01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:11.530
<v Speaker 9>Tompkins,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that dude,</v>

1892
01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:15.220
<v Speaker 9>I haven't seen him in a comedy club in </v>
<v Speaker 9>10 years,</v>

1893
01:30:15.490 --> 01:30:18.550
<v Speaker 9>but he does his show at Largo.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know how often and he does.</v>

1894
01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:21.160
<v Speaker 9>He'll go to San Francisco and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 9>sellout cobb's.</v>

1895
01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.860
<v Speaker 9>The guy's got his circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's got his crowd.</v>

1896
01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:24.843
<v Speaker 9>I think it makes a very nice living and </v>
<v Speaker 9>I think he does the style of comedy he </v>

1897
01:30:28.421 --> 01:30:31.750
<v Speaker 9>does,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is a little bit more storytelling.</v>

1898
01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:32.643
<v Speaker 9>It's a little slower,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a little more esoteric may not work in </v>

1899
01:30:35.081 --> 01:30:36.910
<v Speaker 9>the other kinds of clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So yeah,</v>

1900
01:30:36.911 --> 01:30:37.744
<v Speaker 9>maybe it fosters his ability to go </v>
<v Speaker 9>deeper into what he's doing by playing </v>

1901
01:30:41.531 --> 01:30:42.520
<v Speaker 9>select clubs.</v>

1902
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess it's all in whether or </v>

1903
01:30:44.691 --> 01:30:48.500
<v Speaker 3>not what you enjoy doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it fits in with clubs.</v>

1904
01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because some people it just doesn't.</v>

1905
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Some people they don't enjoy just always</v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

1906
01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:56.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always going for the laugh always.</v>

1907
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:59.300
<v Speaker 3>You know like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our style Boston style,</v>

1908
01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:01.460
<v Speaker 3>like Boston styles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like punchline set up,</v>

1909
01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:02.294
<v Speaker 3>punchline set up punchline and to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>build punchlines and some people have </v>

1910
01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:06.494
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to tell you a story that </v>

1911
01:31:08.541 --> 01:31:09.374
<v Speaker 3>happens to be humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be confined by this </v>

1912
01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:13.940
<v Speaker 3>idea that it has to be set up punchline </v>
<v Speaker 3>set up punchline.</v>

1913
01:31:13.941 --> 01:31:16.280
<v Speaker 3>So it is sorta stand up and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>

1914
01:31:16.281 --> 01:31:19.100
<v Speaker 3>but in a lot of ways it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're,</v>

1915
01:31:19.101 --> 01:31:21.500
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being an orator,</v>

1916
01:31:21.501 --> 01:31:23.240
<v Speaker 3>a narrator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're telling stories,</v>

1917
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:25.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is cool too,</v>

1918
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:26.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a lot of people who like </v>

1919
01:31:28.671 --> 01:31:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Henry Rollins is a great example.</v>

1920
01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:33.530
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't say that necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he does is stand up.</v>

1921
01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.990
<v Speaker 3>You would say it's a spoken word thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1922
01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.850
<v Speaker 3>But what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's telling stories,</v>

1923
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:39.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're just,</v>

1924
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.823
<v Speaker 3>they have punchlines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like very clear setup and </v>

1925
01:31:42.441 --> 01:31:43.274
<v Speaker 3>punchlines that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess obviously he knows where the </v>

1926
01:31:44.781 --> 01:31:47.780
<v Speaker 3>funny parts are so he's kind of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>

1927
01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:48.973
<v Speaker 3>but he's doing it his fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if a lot of people really liked </v>

1928
01:31:53.001 --> 01:31:53.834
<v Speaker 3>that is what my point is like and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to go see him try to do a 15 </v>

1929
01:31:58.371 --> 01:31:59.204
<v Speaker 3>minute set at the.</v>

1930
01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:00.653
<v Speaker 9>It can change.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like I find that if I go through a run </v>

1931
01:32:02.901 --> 01:32:07.740
<v Speaker 9>of clubs that are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm like say Florida.</v>

1932
01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:12.540
<v Speaker 9>It changes the way I'm doing standup </v>
<v Speaker 9>because in Florida you've got.</v>

1933
01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:13.673
<v Speaker 9>It's just a schizo side crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You've got rednecks mixed in with old </v>

1934
01:32:17.311 --> 01:32:18.144
<v Speaker 9>people mixed in with Latino's mixed in </v>
<v Speaker 9>with fucking spring breakers or </v>

1935
01:32:21.241 --> 01:32:23.430
<v Speaker 9>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's never one crowd.</v>

1936
01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:25.470
<v Speaker 9>You have no fucking idea who you're </v>
<v Speaker 9>applying to.</v>

1937
01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.760
<v Speaker 9>So you're up there for an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 9>you're just.</v>

1938
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:29.820
<v Speaker 9>It's a drunk and knife fight in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>alleys.</v>

1939
01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:32.760
<v Speaker 9>You're just trying to fucking keep your </v>
<v Speaker 9>spinning plates.</v>

1940
01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:35.320
<v Speaker 9>You're trying to keep this guy happy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This guy's Hecklin,</v>

1941
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:36.303
<v Speaker 9>they're not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I find that like it makes my act </v>

1942
01:32:39.361 --> 01:32:43.830
<v Speaker 9>worse because I'm not getting in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>pocket and doing what I want to do.</v>

1943
01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:46.470
<v Speaker 9>I'm pleasing because I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 9>survive.</v>

1944
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:47.383
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then you go to a club like fucking </v>

1945
01:32:49.471 --> 01:32:54.090
<v Speaker 9>Austin Cap City and Austin,</v>

01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:16.300
<v Speaker 3>What the hell is that theater there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it acme theater?</v>

1955
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:17.800
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I make that up?</v>

1956
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:19.470
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Acme is in Minneapolis.</v>

1957
01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:21.940
<v Speaker 9>It means the comedy club in Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

1958
01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:27.240
<v Speaker 3>The theater in Madison or film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1959
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I had a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fucking lost.</v>

1960
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:33.880
<v Speaker 3>There's an orpheum there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's where I went.</v>

1961
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:35.570
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a great little city.</v>

1962
01:33:35.571 --> 01:33:37.430
<v Speaker 9>It's a college town.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's where I went.</v>

1963
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:39.950
<v Speaker 9>Good food is really only one block </v>
<v Speaker 9>though.</v>

1964
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:41.270
<v Speaker 9>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not a lot.</v>

1965
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:43.790
<v Speaker 9>It's psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's a block that goes from the State</v>

1966
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:46.460
<v Speaker 9>House to the university and there's not </v>
<v Speaker 9>much often,</v>

1967
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:48.453
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those places where people </v>

1968
01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:54.830
<v Speaker 3>that are living in a place where it gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1969
01:33:54.831 --> 01:33:57.950
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fucking cold theater family.</v>

1970
01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:01.640
<v Speaker 3>That's where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people are hardier like that thing</v>

1971
01:34:01.641 --> 01:34:02.750
<v Speaker 3>that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:34:02.751 --> 01:34:05.060
<v Speaker 3>This idea that you might not make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>home tonight.</v>

1973
01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.193
<v Speaker 3>There's a god blizzard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might get stuck in the side of the </v>

1974
01:34:07.401 --> 01:34:11.030
<v Speaker 3>road and you see flashing like a light </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the side of the road.</v>

1975
01:34:11.031 --> 01:34:11.864
<v Speaker 3>Like someone's hazard lights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pulled over like a lot of times </v>

1976
01:34:14.691 --> 01:34:16.940
<v Speaker 3>people help because that person might </v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

1977
01:34:16.941 --> 01:34:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a difference between like </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you see somebody on the four,</v>

1978
01:34:19.971 --> 01:34:20.804
<v Speaker 3>oh five and they were pulled over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever even think for a fucking </v>

1979
01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.920
<v Speaker 3>second pulling over and helping them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1980
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.903
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you were driving down a snowy </v>

1981
01:34:27.051 --> 01:34:27.884
<v Speaker 3>road in New Hampshire and you saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone pull over the side of the road </v>

1982
01:34:29.781 --> 01:34:32.390
<v Speaker 3>and you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if that's a mom with her kids?</v>

1983
01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.910
<v Speaker 9>What did she think?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's great.</v>

1984
01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:36.880
<v Speaker 9>It totally fosters community when you </v>
<v Speaker 9>live in a harsher,</v>

1985
01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:37.714
<v Speaker 9>whether you have a trust and there's </v>
<v Speaker 9>like a symbiotic relationship with your </v>

1986
01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:42.750
<v Speaker 9>neighbors and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

1987
01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:43.584
<v Speaker 9>I think that like you think about people</v>
<v Speaker 9>that live up in Alaska and how they </v>

1988
01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:47.374
<v Speaker 9>share supplies and fucking in the spring</v>
<v Speaker 9>help rebuild a barn and you know that </v>

1989
01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:53.380
<v Speaker 9>that's community that's living.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

1990
01:34:53.381 --> 01:34:58.381
<v Speaker 9>in La our needs is so easily met.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It just don't have any fucking.</v>

1991
01:34:58.590 --> 01:35:02.570
<v Speaker 9>Our roof doesn't go bad because it rains</v>
<v Speaker 9>three days a year and you know,</v>

1992
01:35:02.571 --> 01:35:03.404
<v Speaker 9>you can take an uber here and you could </v>
<v Speaker 9>get a fucking yelp review on the Sushi </v>

1993
01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:07.550
<v Speaker 9>play.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's all easy.</v>

1994
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:09.650
<v Speaker 9>It all comes to you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's no sense of,</v>

1995
01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:10.970
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't need to help you.</v>

1996
01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:11.890
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if I hang out with you,</v>

1997
01:35:11.891 --> 01:35:14.250
<v Speaker 9>it's because I want to hang out with you</v>
<v Speaker 9>there.</v>

1998
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:17.060
<v Speaker 9>You hang out with your neighbor because </v>
<v Speaker 9>you're fucking surviving together.</v>

1999
01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.113
<v Speaker 5>We were all hanging out in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedy store last night and we were </v>

2000
01:35:20.191 --> 01:35:21.024
<v Speaker 5>all stoned and we're all laughing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>giggling and joking around and I was </v>

2001
01:35:25.411 --> 01:35:26.244
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

2002
01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:31.340
<v Speaker 5>like what a great place this is to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like at the sunset strip in Hollywood in</v>

2003
01:35:31.531 --> 01:35:35.060
<v Speaker 5>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then all I could think of because of</v>

2004
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:39.540
<v Speaker 5>the pod probably was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if an asteroid,</v>

2005
01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:42.300
<v Speaker 5>just not even a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a pretty big one.</v>

2006
01:35:42.630 --> 01:35:47.070
<v Speaker 5>Just slammed into downtown La Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not enough to kill me,</v>

2007
01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.070
<v Speaker 5>but enough for me to just feel the </v>
<v Speaker 5>impact.</v>

2008
01:35:50.071 --> 01:35:50.904
<v Speaker 5>See that thing flying through the sky </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hear the people scream and run for </v>

2009
01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:55.254
<v Speaker 5>the hills and realize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I realized at that moment because I was </v>

2010
01:35:58.711 --> 01:35:59.760
<v Speaker 5>so high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2011
01:35:59.761 --> 01:36:04.200
<v Speaker 5>how fragile is this existence that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>think is so concrete.</v>

2012
01:36:04.201 --> 01:36:05.034
<v Speaker 5>We think it's so locked in and permanent</v>
<v Speaker 5>and secure and all we take is one </v>

2013
01:36:09.781 --> 01:36:14.550
<v Speaker 5>fucking rock that comes from this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom in the downtown La.</v>

2014
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Kill a half a million people and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>the rest of us at beaches,</v>

2015
01:36:18.941 --> 01:36:20.790
<v Speaker 5>shit in our pants and terror</v>

2016
01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:24.170
<v Speaker 9>on highway goes out in la,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're fucked.</v>

2017
01:36:24.171 --> 01:36:26.710
<v Speaker 9>Fucked because there's only two roads </v>
<v Speaker 9>downtown.</v>

2018
01:36:26.711 --> 01:36:28.430
<v Speaker 9>There's the 10 and the four.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh five.</v>

2019
01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.360
<v Speaker 9>And if those go either one of those go.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The city shuts down to.</v>

2020
01:36:32.361 --> 01:36:33.194
<v Speaker 9>This is such a stupid place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There was three earthquakes last night </v>

2021
01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 9>too.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2022
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three earthquakes.</v>

2023
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 5>A pretty big one on the Nevada border.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five point seven.</v>

2024
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:44.180
<v Speaker 5>That's a pretty big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a,</v>

2025
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:46.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a one like a,</v>

2026
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:47.630
<v Speaker 5>the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>90 whatever the fuck.</v>

2027
01:36:47.631 --> 01:36:50.840
<v Speaker 5>It was one which was a lot higher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was more than seven,</v>

2028
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 5>but this was a significant earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five point seven is a pretty good shock,</v>

2029
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:57.223
<v Speaker 9>but that's what's so weird about.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean you talk about it being tenuous </v>

2030
01:36:59.571 --> 01:37:04.040
<v Speaker 9>and all that is that that shit can fuck </v>
<v Speaker 9>things up bad and people go,</v>

2031
01:37:04.041 --> 01:37:07.820
<v Speaker 9>oh we do,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but we just elected an earthquake</v>

2032
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:09.663
<v Speaker 5>we chose</v>

2033
01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:14.520
<v Speaker 9>was a fucking tragedy to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And if you're a trump supporter,</v>

2034
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:17.820
<v Speaker 9>go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You fucked us.</v>

2035
01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.040
<v Speaker 9>Can I?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Thanks for coming.</v>

2036
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 5>These liberals in Hollywood that think </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can talk down to you,</v>

2037
01:37:24.321 --> 01:37:27.290
<v Speaker 5>the good people of trump landia you just</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch.</v>

2038
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:28.363
<v Speaker 5>I am not on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not support any of the statements </v>

2039
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.433
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's about time we showed a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little respect for the office of </v>

2040
01:37:36.921 --> 01:37:41.120
<v Speaker 5>Commander in chief.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he will rise to the job.</v>

2041
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 5>He could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

2042
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.900
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we can get him some mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he will have a,</v>

2043
01:37:46.901 --> 01:37:47.734
<v Speaker 5>a revelation while he's in office that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this has achieved the highest </v>

2044
01:37:50.721 --> 01:37:53.000
<v Speaker 5>achievement than any human being can </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever attain.</v>

2045
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 5>That he has won the race and now and</v>

2046
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.903
<v Speaker 1>maybe he will change his entire cabinet </v>
<v Speaker 1>appointments that he's made over the </v>

2047
01:38:00.330 --> 01:38:01.163
<v Speaker 1>last month and like Bill Gates dedicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the remaining years of his life to </v>

2048
01:38:03.361 --> 01:38:04.980
<v Speaker 1>philanthropy work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2049
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2050
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.020
<v Speaker 1>my attitude towards this year was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be positive and you just saw</v>

2051
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:12.970
<v Speaker 1>an example of negativity come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

2052
01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go negative on it.</v>

2053
01:38:15.691 --> 01:38:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I can be vigilant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can keep an eye on what he does.</v>

2054
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:20.183
<v Speaker 1>My wife has this app where every day she</v>
<v Speaker 1>can call or write a congressmen or a </v>

2055
01:38:23.911 --> 01:38:24.744
<v Speaker 1>cause or a place you can donate money so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you feel like every day what's the </v>

2056
01:38:28.081 --> 01:38:28.914
<v Speaker 1>APP called you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2057
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:30.090
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out.</v>

2058
01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy could find it,</v>

2059
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:36.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's a way of not feeling alienated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not feeling isolated and like you're</v>

2060
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.180
<v Speaker 1>doing something whether or not it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>a difference.</v>

2061
01:38:39.181 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if everybody reacts that way,</v>

2062
01:38:42.241 --> 01:38:43.110
<v Speaker 1>it makes a difference.</v>

2063
01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:43.953
<v Speaker 1>It's really sheer numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have used it on as an example on </v>

2064
01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:48.234
<v Speaker 1>the show before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you remember when the United States </v>

2065
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:50.394
<v Speaker 1>had that I'm the president had the press</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference where Obama was saying that </v>

2066
01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.730
<v Speaker 1>we're probably going to go to war with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria and America was like,</v>

2067
01:38:56.731 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a unanimous across the board.</v>

2068
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:00.421
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And left.</v>

2069
01:39:00.421 --> 01:39:01.254
<v Speaker 1>So when he said that he drew a line in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sand about if they use chemical </v>

2070
01:39:03.181 --> 01:39:04.350
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd go to war.</v>

2071
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something along those lines.</v>

2072
01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was a fucking blatant rejection</v>

2073
01:39:10.801 --> 01:39:12.510
<v Speaker 1>by the American people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very obvious.</v>

2074
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Very vocal and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no commentators though,</v>

2075
01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:18.330
<v Speaker 1>right or left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're saying this is a good idea,</v>

2076
01:39:18.331 --> 01:39:19.164
<v Speaker 1>like this is a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to another fucking </v>

2077
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:24.690
<v Speaker 1>unwinnable war in Syria and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>

2078
01:39:24.970 --> 01:39:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stopped.</v>

2079
01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:26.843
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it's a terrible fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and you know that it's terrible </v>

2080
01:39:31.021 --> 01:39:32.670
<v Speaker 1>videos that are coming out of there </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

2081
01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:36.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a salient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking wiped out to insane.</v>

2082
01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

2083
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard for us to even imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it would be like to be living there</v>

2084
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:46.680
<v Speaker 1>living over here and fucking Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 1>where everything's perfect.</v>

2085
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what it's like to be someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>just buy a bad roll the dice.</v>

2086
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.970
<v Speaker 1>You were born over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had parts of Africa,</v>

2087
01:39:53.971 --> 01:39:54.804
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south Sudan and Congo and places were </v>

2088
01:39:57.630 --> 01:39:58.463
<v Speaker 1>places where people are giving their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in the street because there were </v>

2089
01:40:01.641 --> 01:40:05.530
<v Speaker 1>voted discrepancies that ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

2090
01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.930
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are letting themselves be shot in public</v>

2091
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:13.190
<v Speaker 1>squares because they're demonstrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>

2092
01:40:13.450 --> 01:40:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

2093
01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

2094
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:18.653
<v Speaker 1>there's pockets of the world that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>living a sophisticated version of the </v>

2095
01:40:22.201 --> 01:40:24.270
<v Speaker 1>way people were living six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>700 years.</v>

2096
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just living a more sophisticated</v>

2097
01:40:26.701 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 1>version of using cell phones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2098
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:29.783
<v Speaker 1>but they have almost the same mindset as</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who lived hundreds and hundreds </v>

2099
01:40:32.221 --> 01:40:33.054
<v Speaker 1>of years ago for good and for bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found an uncontacted tribe in the </v>

2100
01:40:37.081 --> 01:40:37.591
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2101
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saw the pictures.</v>

2102
01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking.</v>

2103
01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:41.773
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to figure out where like </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if there was a way where you </v>

2104
01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:48.090
<v Speaker 1>could infiltrate those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't let.</v>

2105
01:40:48.091 --> 01:40:49.680
<v Speaker 1>You would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would not.</v>

2106
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:53.770
<v Speaker 1>The only way to really know how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived would be to become one of them.</v>

2107
01:40:53.890 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

2108
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:54.963
<v Speaker 5>you really couldn't figure out how they </v>
<v Speaker 5>lived by you going in there as Greg </v>

2109
01:40:58.210 --> 01:40:59.540
<v Speaker 5>Fitzsimmons because they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

2110
01:40:59.730 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have clothes,</v>

2111
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's that thing on your wrist?</v>

2112
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:06.790
<v Speaker 5>It tells the time why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you need to know what time it is?</v>

2113
01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:07.840
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be.</v>

2114
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.913
<v Speaker 5>It would be amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you would be to affected like you </v>

2115
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.330
<v Speaker 5>would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would affect them rather,</v>

2116
01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.600
<v Speaker 9>whereas I think you might kill them </v>
<v Speaker 9>because very often people,</v>

2117
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.633
<v Speaker 9>people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>anthropologist tried to go in there and </v>

2118
01:41:18.731 --> 01:41:21.850
<v Speaker 9>study and they give them a disease and </v>
<v Speaker 9>they wiped.</v>

2119
01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:22.693
<v Speaker 9>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's been cases where they wiped out </v>

2120
01:41:23.951 --> 01:41:25.420
<v Speaker 9>entire tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:41:25.421 --> 01:41:26.130
<v Speaker 9>There's a guy named</v>

2122
01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:28.340
<v Speaker 5>Dan Flores who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2123
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:30.860
<v Speaker 5>he wrote a paper about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2124
01:41:31.290 --> 01:41:35.670
<v Speaker 5>the bisons and a bison diplomacy bison </v>
<v Speaker 5>ecology,</v>

2125
01:41:35.671 --> 01:41:36.504
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things he was talking </v>

2126
01:41:38.011 --> 01:41:38.844
<v Speaker 5>about was the amount of native Americans</v>
<v Speaker 5>that were wiped out just because of </v>

2127
01:41:43.441 --> 01:41:47.070
<v Speaker 5>diseases by settlers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was some insane number,</v>

2128
01:41:47.071 --> 01:41:49.500
<v Speaker 5>like high 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2129
01:41:49.501 --> 01:41:51.000
<v Speaker 5>down in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>

2130
01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.073
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what percentage of native Americans </v>

2131
01:41:55.111 --> 01:41:58.380
<v Speaker 5>Google this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what percentage of native Americans</v>

2132
01:41:59.010 --> 01:41:59.843
<v Speaker 11>where</v>

2133
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 5>killed by diseases from European </v>
<v Speaker 5>settlers,</v>

2134
01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.140
<v Speaker 9>because I know the Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when they,</v>

2135
01:42:06.170 --> 01:42:09.380
<v Speaker 9>when they came into Central America,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they fucking so many</v>

2136
01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 5>people died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Diseases.</v>

2137
01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:12.243
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was equating it to the boom and the </v>

2138
01:42:13.571 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 5>buffalo herd sizes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

2139
01:42:15.821 --> 01:42:16.600
<v Speaker 5>she was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2140
01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.230
<v Speaker 5>he was saying that when the native </v>
<v Speaker 5>Americans contacted the Europeans,</v>

2141
01:42:20.231 --> 01:42:22.270
<v Speaker 5>they got these horses from them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2142
01:42:22.271 --> 01:42:24.610
<v Speaker 5>What does it say here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ninety percent.</v>

2143
01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 5>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When Europeans arrived carrying germs,</v>

2144
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:33.850
<v Speaker 5>which thrived on a dense semi urban </v>
<v Speaker 5>populations,</v>

2145
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.760
<v Speaker 5>the indigenous people of the Americas </v>
<v Speaker 5>were effectively doomed.</v>

2146
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:40.510
<v Speaker 5>They had never experienced smallpox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>measles or flu before,</v>

2147
01:42:40.511 --> 01:42:42.760
<v Speaker 5>and the viruses tore through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>continent,</v>

2148
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:45.880
<v Speaker 5>killing an estimated 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 5>native Americans.</v>

2149
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:50.930
<v Speaker 9>Hey Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Holy Shit.</v>

2150
01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:54.640
<v Speaker 9>Sent and then we went to war against the</v>
<v Speaker 9>remaining 10 percent.</v>

2151
01:42:54.641 --> 01:42:57.670
<v Speaker 9>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's located them and push them around.</v>

2152
01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:00.370
<v Speaker 9>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>God Damn.</v>

2153
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:02.350
<v Speaker 9>And we wonder why they drink?</v>

2154
01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:05.800
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean</v>

2155
01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:12.200
<v Speaker 5>the same thing that I said about those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that tribe that lived in the jungle</v>

2156
01:43:12.201 --> 01:43:13.034
<v Speaker 5>like I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love if there was a way where </v>

2157
01:43:15.231 --> 01:43:16.064
<v Speaker 5>you could somehow or another be amongst </v>
<v Speaker 5>them without them knowing it so you </v>

2158
01:43:19.071 --> 01:43:19.904
<v Speaker 5>could really truly see how they behave </v>
<v Speaker 5>and exist unaffected by a person like </v>

2159
01:43:25.161 --> 01:43:25.994
<v Speaker 5>you or personally me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That obviously doesn't does it wasn't </v>

2160
01:43:27.921 --> 01:43:28.754
<v Speaker 5>born there.</v>

2161
01:43:30.090 --> 01:43:31.990
<v Speaker 9>There was this documentary about this </v>
<v Speaker 9>guy from the,</v>

2162
01:43:32.150 --> 01:43:34.220
<v Speaker 9>from Greenwich Village,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it was a gay guy,</v>

2163
01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:39.760
<v Speaker 9>and he went down to this village in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>might've been Columbia and he lived with</v>

2164
01:43:41.451 --> 01:43:46.451
<v Speaker 9>them on the river for 20 years and they </v>
<v Speaker 9>were gay.</v>

2165
01:43:46.521 --> 01:43:48.680
<v Speaker 9>The tribe was not,</v>
<v Speaker 9>their tribe wasn't gay,</v>

2166
01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:51.380
<v Speaker 9>but they didn't delineate between gay </v>
<v Speaker 9>sex,</v>

2167
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:52.243
<v Speaker 9>straight sex.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was just all kind of fluidly would </v>

2168
01:43:53.691 --> 01:43:57.110
<v Speaker 9>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so he had this boyfriend basically,</v>

2169
01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.393
<v Speaker 9>but the boyfriend had a wife and kids,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but he slept with the guy for 20 years </v>

2170
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 9>and then he left and he was gone for </v>
<v Speaker 9>like 15 years.</v>

2171
01:44:05.751 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 9>I forget why he didn't go back.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2172
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.193
<v Speaker 9>I think he didn't go back as like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they eventually attacked him and they </v>

2173
01:44:11.571 --> 01:44:13.010
<v Speaker 9>were going to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He realized,</v>

2174
01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:13.761
<v Speaker 9>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know.</v>

2175
01:44:13.761 --> 01:44:16.310
<v Speaker 9>It was one night he realized that they </v>
<v Speaker 9>were cannibals.</v>

2176
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:18.260
<v Speaker 9>They went and they attacked another </v>
<v Speaker 9>tribe.</v>

2177
01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:18.861
<v Speaker 9>They,</v>
<v Speaker 9>all of a sudden,</v>

2178
01:44:18.861 --> 01:44:21.670
<v Speaker 9>one night it had never happened before </v>
<v Speaker 9>and all of the years he was there,</v>

2179
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:22.910
<v Speaker 9>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe it's only 10 years.</v>

2180
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 9>They all put on paints and they went to </v>
<v Speaker 9>the next village and they killed.</v>

2181
01:44:28.191 --> 01:44:30.860
<v Speaker 9>And then they ate flesh and the guy just</v>
<v Speaker 9>went,</v>

2182
01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:32.480
<v Speaker 9>I'm fucking out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Where's my,</v>

2183
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:34.400
<v Speaker 9>where's my return ticket?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And he left.</v>

2184
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:36.163
<v Speaker 9>And so he came back to the village and </v>
<v Speaker 9>he wrote about it and he lectured about </v>

2185
01:44:39.201 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 9>it and then he went back like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

2186
01:44:41.061 --> 01:44:45.260
<v Speaker 9>like 15 years later he goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 9>finds the dude.</v>

2187
01:44:45.261 --> 01:44:46.094
<v Speaker 9>And this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that I think the movie might </v>

2188
01:44:47.701 --> 01:44:49.310
<v Speaker 9>have been called keep the river on your </v>
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

2189
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.473
<v Speaker 9>And he went back and he found the dude </v>
<v Speaker 9>and they like rekindled their </v>

2190
01:44:53.931 --> 01:44:54.610
<v Speaker 9>relationship.</v>

2191
01:44:54.610 --> 01:44:56.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was incredible.</v>

2192
01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.960
<v Speaker 5>Keep the river on your right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

2193
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm writing that down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to see the.</v>

2194
01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2195
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.903
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that the incidences of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cannibalism were so prevalent among </v>

2196
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:14.480
<v Speaker 5>native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would occasionally do that.</v>

2197
01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.373
<v Speaker 5>Like the Nez perce apparently they had </v>
<v Speaker 5>occasionally catch people and kill them </v>

2198
01:45:18.261 --> 01:45:19.094
<v Speaker 5>and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:23.000
<v Speaker 5>Especially people like they'd catch you </v>
<v Speaker 5>had your brain,</v>

2200
01:45:23.001 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that eat your whole body.</v>

2201
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:26.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But probably your brain</v>

2202
01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:27.650
<v Speaker 9>do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But think about it.</v>

2203
01:45:27.651 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 9>I mean it's very symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You conquer and you consume.</v>

2204
01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

2205
01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.020
<v Speaker 5>it's the thing that freaks us out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most,</v>

2206
01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.740
<v Speaker 5>the idea being just reduced to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2207
01:45:41.290 --> 01:45:42.123
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by someone just with a bigger </v>

2208
01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:46.040
<v Speaker 5>Tomahawk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2209
01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:46.913
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or do to got to you before you get to </v>

2210
01:45:48.651 --> 01:45:51.380
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no like real serious weapons.</v>

2211
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bows and arrows and spears and,</v>

2212
01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.540
<v Speaker 9>and it's really a fight to exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 9>See who lasts the longest</v>

2213
01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.940
<v Speaker 5>mark or the capture you if you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get away from them.</v>

2214
01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:03.110
<v Speaker 5>But in their case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2215
01:46:03.111 --> 01:46:03.944
<v Speaker 5>do you imagine if you and your people </v>
<v Speaker 5>had lived in this one patch of land for </v>

2216
01:46:07.781 --> 01:46:08.890
<v Speaker 5>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>

2217
01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.113
<v Speaker 5>then all of a sudden these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>demons carrying death in their breath </v>

2218
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:16.383
<v Speaker 5>and they're very touch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like just getting in contact with a </v>

2219
01:46:18.641 --> 01:46:23.530
<v Speaker 5>makes all of your relatives wilt away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kills 90 percent of the people you know,</v>

2220
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:24.423
<v Speaker 5>just them being around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Forget about all the shit they </v>

2221
01:46:26.201 --> 01:46:27.034
<v Speaker 5>killed with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the people they probably shot and </v>

2222
01:46:29.081 --> 01:46:31.630
<v Speaker 5>killed because just emanating evil and </v>
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>

2223
01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:32.230
<v Speaker 5>Think about that.</v>

2224
01:46:32.230 --> 01:46:35.770
<v Speaker 9>And then they ran you up like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 9>cattle and they rape your women.</v>

2225
01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.990
<v Speaker 9>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

2226
01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:41.210
<v Speaker 9>enough can't be said people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

2227
01:46:41.211 --> 01:46:44.080
<v Speaker 9>are already fucking liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're in about the native Americans.</v>

2228
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:45.163
<v Speaker 9>It was pretty bad.</v>

2229
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:46.513
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know how bad it was until I </v>

2230
01:46:48.051 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 5>read a priest's account</v>

2231
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:55.070
<v Speaker 3>of Columbus is men interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>native Americans and it is horrific.</v>

2232
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:56.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This a religious guy went with them on </v>

2233
01:46:59.491 --> 01:47:00.324
<v Speaker 3>one of the voyages and wrote books about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they would hack off guys arms and </v>

2234
01:47:04.381 --> 01:47:05.214
<v Speaker 3>they would tell them to bring them gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to bring their weight in gold </v>

2235
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:08.304
<v Speaker 3>and if they didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would hack off one of their arms </v>

2236
01:47:09.521 --> 01:47:11.730
<v Speaker 3>and they do it in front of everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else to freak them out.</v>

2237
01:47:11.731 --> 01:47:12.564
<v Speaker 3>And at first the natives were very </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly and once they realize that the </v>

2238
01:47:15.691 --> 01:47:18.100
<v Speaker 3>natives were friendly and the natives </v>
<v Speaker 3>were sort of weak,</v>

2239
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.133
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started taking advantage of them </v>

2240
01:47:20.311 --> 01:47:25.311
<v Speaker 3>and brutalizing them and getting them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>acquire gold and they would smash babies</v>

2241
01:47:25.651 --> 01:47:28.090
<v Speaker 3>on rocks like this priest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2242
01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.090
<v Speaker 3>it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horrible,</v>

2243
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:33.660
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Priest wrote about this.</v>

2244
01:47:33.661 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 3>So when we think of Christopher </v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbus,</v>

2245
01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.193
<v Speaker 3>we think of this noble Spanish gentleman</v>
<v Speaker 3>who came over and landed in America and </v>

2246
01:47:41.251 --> 01:47:42.084
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked regal as he got off with fucking </v>

2247
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:47.520
<v Speaker 3>rosy cheeks and walked amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and declared this American,</v>

2248
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 3>all that bullshit and made friends with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Indians,</v>

2249
01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:52.710
<v Speaker 3>but they were a horrible band of </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

2250
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:53.633
<v Speaker 9>They also stopped in the Caribbean on </v>
<v Speaker 9>the way here and they literally </v>

2251
01:47:57.541 --> 01:48:00.720
<v Speaker 9>committed genocide on an entire fucking </v>
<v Speaker 9>island of people.</v>

2252
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 9>They work them to death.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Same thing like a lot of these people,</v>

2253
01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:04.644
<v Speaker 9>gold didn't mean anything to them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like it was something that they used to </v>

2254
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.190
<v Speaker 9>decorate or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but there was no value the way there was</v>

2255
01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 9>in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they gave it to them.</v>

2256
01:48:12.841 --> 01:48:13.261
<v Speaker 9>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

2257
01:48:13.261 --> 01:48:15.600
<v Speaker 9>you want the gold fucking just right </v>
<v Speaker 9>over there and grab the gold.</v>

2258
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.880
<v Speaker 9>And then when they.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And once they took all that,</v>

2259
01:48:17.881 --> 01:48:19.470
<v Speaker 9>then they made them start working for </v>
<v Speaker 9>it.</v>

2260
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:22.190
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like also like these tribes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they encounter,</v>

2261
01:48:22.191 --> 01:48:23.110
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2262
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:24.103
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any concept of large </v>
<v Speaker 3>scale slave labor like the Europeans </v>

2263
01:48:27.551 --> 01:48:29.320
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Europeans were like,</v>

2264
01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:30.213
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just get you to work for us or </v>

2265
01:48:31.121 --> 01:48:34.420
<v Speaker 3>we'll kill you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that was like a thing that</v>

2266
01:48:34.421 --> 01:48:35.254
<v Speaker 3>native Americans were known for and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say probably there probably are </v>

2267
01:48:37.721 --> 01:48:38.830
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing here?</v>

2268
01:48:38.831 --> 01:48:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Why we keep digging for gold?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is going on here?</v>

2269
01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:45.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they had weird concepts in terms of</v>

2270
01:48:45.641 --> 01:48:46.474
<v Speaker 3>like what is possession?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't have the same sort of </v>

2271
01:48:48.761 --> 01:48:51.820
<v Speaker 3>concepts of this being yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you left something there,</v>

2272
01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:52.893
<v Speaker 3>he would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone would just take it because it </v>

2273
01:48:54.271 --> 01:48:56.080
<v Speaker 3>would do well that's the thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

2274
01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:56.973
<v Speaker 3>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm just going to take that </v>

2275
01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:58.700
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody's.</v>

2276
01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:01.450
<v Speaker 3>Nobody owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it confused the shit out of them when</v>

2277
01:49:01.451 --> 01:49:05.650
<v Speaker 3>they would get accused of stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a whole different in,</v>

2278
01:49:05.710 --> 01:49:08.530
<v Speaker 3>in many of these inner encounters </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently there was a whole different,</v>

2279
01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:11.590
<v Speaker 3>like not just a language barrier but a </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture barrier.</v>

2280
01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Like understanding what these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy white assholes we're doing.</v>

2281
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:17.860
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But the whole concept that you still see</v>

2282
01:49:17.861 --> 01:49:18.694
<v Speaker 9>in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in a lot of like Middle Eastern </v>

2283
01:49:19.481 --> 01:49:20.680
<v Speaker 9>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is the,</v>

2284
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:25.390
<v Speaker 9>the idea of giving to as a host,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know when you come,</v>

2285
01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:31.240
<v Speaker 9>when you come to somebody's home,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you give them your bed and you give them</v>

2286
01:49:31.241 --> 01:49:32.074
<v Speaker 9>food and date.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You would never ask them to leave as </v>

2287
01:49:34.391 --> 01:49:35.224
<v Speaker 9>long as they want to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And it's all about generosity and with </v>

2288
01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:43.270
<v Speaker 9>the western mentality is more about </v>
<v Speaker 9>collecting and owning.</v>

2289
01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

2290
01:49:45.681 --> 01:49:46.514
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that also what we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about before that a long time ago is a </v>

2291
01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 3>lot like living in a place that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably harsh winters.</v>

2292
01:49:55.340 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 3>A long time ago you're faced with danger</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time and you had to make bonds.</v>

2293
01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.950
<v Speaker 3>They had to be important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if you came over to my house,</v>

2294

<v Speaker 3>I'm here with you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to form these community bonds today.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and everybody would be on the lookout </v>

2305
01:50:31.631 --> 01:50:32.464
<v Speaker 3>for some people that we didn't know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be sneaking over the top of the </v>

2306

2324
01:51:18.301 --> 01:51:19.134
<v Speaker 3>in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird process that's been going </v>

2325
01:51:22.021 --> 01:51:26.820
<v Speaker 3>on for hundreds and hundreds of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're just at the end of it.</v>

2326
01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.013
<v Speaker 3>We're obviously not at the end end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're at the front of the line as </v>

2327
01:51:30.451 --> 01:51:32.820
<v Speaker 3>far as all the history of it all pushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind us.</v>

2328
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.863
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for us to appreciate how weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must have been to be our parents or </v>

2329
01:51:37.111 --> 01:51:37.944
<v Speaker 3>to be our parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parents already come here from another </v>

2330
01:51:39.961 --> 01:51:44.961
<v Speaker 3>country or to be someone who existed </v>
<v Speaker 3>back when you only live 30 years old and</v>

2331
01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:49.050
<v Speaker 3>you die of old age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a heart attack at 30 or you'd catch</v>

2332
01:51:49.051 --> 01:51:50.850
<v Speaker 3>a disease or someone would shoot you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Arrow.</v>

2333
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.863
<v Speaker 3>That was like a giant panda brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sisters died from shit like smallpox or </v>

2334
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.883
<v Speaker 3>in the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get in a boat and leave Spain and head </v>

2335
01:52:02.701 --> 01:52:06.330
<v Speaker 3>across the fucking ocean and land in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bahamas.</v>

2336
01:52:07.170 --> 01:52:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Those are marauders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people.</v>

2337
01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:12.410
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I just think about landing even even,</v>

2338
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 9>you know later to like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2339
01:52:14.051 --> 01:52:16.900
<v Speaker 9>the beginning of the 19th century when </v>
<v Speaker 9>people were,</v>

2340
01:52:17.190 --> 01:52:18.023
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>or the 20th century when people coming </v>

2341
01:52:19.271 --> 01:52:21.720
<v Speaker 9>over from Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you landed in,</v>

2342
01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.600
<v Speaker 9>in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2343
01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:23.433
<v Speaker 9>Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you've got a burlap sack with some </v>

2344
01:52:25.691 --> 01:52:29.470
<v Speaker 9>clothes on it and an address of a </v>
<v Speaker 9>fucking second cousin out in Brooklyn.</v>

2345
01:52:29.710 --> 01:52:33.220
<v Speaker 9>You don't know how to get to Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You don't speak the native language.</v>

2346
01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:38.080
<v Speaker 9>You speak in Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Italians are fucking hated when you land</v>

2347
01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:40.480
<v Speaker 9>your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Nobody wants to help you.</v>

2348
01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:43.830
<v Speaker 3>People don't realize that today because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stigma's kind of gone away.</v>

2349
01:52:44.130 --> 01:52:45.920
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather used to about all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time</v>

2350
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:46.641
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2351
01:52:46.641 --> 01:52:47.474
<v Speaker 5>he came over from Italy and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>grandmother came over from Italy on my </v>

2352
01:52:49.191 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 5>mom's side and they would talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

2353
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:54.680
<v Speaker 5>How horrible was kids would call them </v>
<v Speaker 5>Guinea Wasps,</v>

2354
01:52:55.210 --> 01:52:56.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he would be,</v>

2355
01:52:56.601 --> 01:53:00.650
<v Speaker 5>you would be treated as like a saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lower level person,</v>

2356
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:02.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're Italian.</v>

2357
01:53:02.511 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 5>But then suddenly it went away.</v>

2358
01:53:06.670 --> 01:53:11.660
<v Speaker 9>Jersey shore brought a passion real </v>
<v Speaker 9>housewives.</v>

2359
01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.520
<v Speaker 9>They're getting lops yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they,</v>

2360
01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:15.440
<v Speaker 9>they're the real housewives of New </v>
<v Speaker 9>Jersey.</v>

2361
01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:16.480
<v Speaker 9>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:21.320
<v Speaker 9>It is funny because like the Italians </v>
<v Speaker 9>are in some ways,</v>

2363
01:53:21.321 --> 01:53:22.570
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you think about the,</v>

2364
01:53:22.571 --> 01:53:24.050
<v Speaker 9>the holy Roman Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

2365
01:53:24.051 --> 01:53:28.550
<v Speaker 9>you and I were both in Rome this summer </v>
<v Speaker 9>and it's mind blowing that,</v>

2366
01:53:28.610 --> 01:53:30.740
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>irrigation started there.</v>

2367
01:53:30.741 --> 01:53:33.680
<v Speaker 9>Every major thing started there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Demark.</v>

2368
01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:35.780
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess to her he was Greek or Roman,</v>

2369
01:53:36.850 --> 01:53:38.030
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Didn't they have that first?</v>

2370
01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:38.470
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who,</v>

2371
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:39.230
<v Speaker 9>who,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who,</v>

2372
01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:43.010
<v Speaker 9>who created democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it was the Greeks.</v>

2373
01:53:43.590 --> 01:53:46.100
<v Speaker 9>That's a Greek word,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but uh,</v>

2374
01:53:46.330 --> 01:53:49.280
<v Speaker 9>but just what you get blown away by what</v>
<v Speaker 9>the Italians are capable of.</v>

2375
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:50.114
<v Speaker 9>You see the craftsmanship of marble work</v>
<v Speaker 9>in this country that the Italians </v>

2376
01:53:53.841 --> 01:53:55.560
<v Speaker 9>brought over and the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

2377
01:53:55.570 --> 01:53:59.090
<v Speaker 9>the opera and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then you see Jersey.</v>

2378
01:53:59.091 --> 01:53:59.924
<v Speaker 9>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's such a fucking weird dichotomy of </v>

2379
01:54:02.271 --> 01:54:07.271
<v Speaker 9>Italians can be so fucking dumb and </v>
<v Speaker 9>materialistic and yet they are the,</v>

2380
01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:11.540
<v Speaker 9>the fucking high point of culture and </v>
<v Speaker 9>civilization.</v>

2381
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.500
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in some ways,</v>

2382
01:54:13.501 --> 01:54:16.230
<v Speaker 5>but there were also fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:17.093
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a big part of what they did </v>

2384
01:54:19.231 --> 01:54:20.064
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2385
01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:24.870
<v Speaker 5>They did that along with make incredible</v>
<v Speaker 5>architecture.</v>

2386
01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:26.280
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Art,</v>

2387
01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:31.200
<v Speaker 5>incredible buildings filled with statues</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are just beyond compare,</v>

2388
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:35.790
<v Speaker 5>an incredible artistic expression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but rampant kid.</v>

2389
01:54:35.791 --> 01:54:36.624
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

2391
01:54:40.551 --> 01:54:41.300
<v Speaker 9>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the.</v>

2392
01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:42.740
<v Speaker 5>We both grew up Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2393
01:54:42.741 --> 01:54:44.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we knew Catholics.</v>

2394
01:54:44.511 --> 01:54:45.830
<v Speaker 5>Our family was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were all Catholic.</v>

2395
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:48.230
<v Speaker 5>Everyone around us was Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:52.340
<v Speaker 5>We all knew a priest that tried to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>a kid or a kid.</v>

2397
01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you heard about a priest.</v>

2398
01:54:53.401 --> 01:54:54.600
<v Speaker 5>You fucked a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:54:55.110 --> 01:54:57.170
<v Speaker 5>Or My,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my friend was um,</v>

2400
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:59.560
<v Speaker 5>he went away to some fucking camp in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2401
01:54:59.590 --> 01:55:04.040
<v Speaker 5>The priest like climbed into bed with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and was trying to grab his hand and</v>

2402
01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:04.874
<v Speaker 5>shove it down his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was like literally fighting the </v>

2403
01:55:06.291 --> 01:55:07.970
<v Speaker 5>guy off and running away from him.</v>

2404
01:55:09.490 --> 01:55:11.530
<v Speaker 9>It was a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

2405
01:55:11.531 --> 01:55:12.460
<v Speaker 9>what?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2406
01:55:12.461 --> 01:55:13.294
<v Speaker 9>the Catholics.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think there's a work ethic that comes </v>

2407
01:55:15.251 --> 01:55:18.580
<v Speaker 9>with it and a service of God thing and a</v>
<v Speaker 9>Christian soldier thing.</v>

2408
01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:19.713
<v Speaker 9>And then there's also all the repression</v>
<v Speaker 9>and shame about sexuality that plays </v>

2409
01:55:22.781 --> 01:55:23.614
<v Speaker 9>out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The Irish are the same way the Irish </v>

2410
01:55:25.061 --> 01:55:25.894
<v Speaker 9>have,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2411
01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:26.763
<v Speaker 9>they saved the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's this book called how the Irish </v>

2412
01:55:30.101 --> 01:55:33.910
<v Speaker 9>saved civilization and when the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 9>empire was being destroyed,</v>

2413
01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:36.430
<v Speaker 9>they were burning every single Bible in </v>
<v Speaker 9>Europe,</v>

2414
01:55:36.431 --> 01:55:37.264
<v Speaker 9>like they literally destroyed all the </v>
<v Speaker 9>bibles and in Ireland there were the </v>

2415
01:55:40.301 --> 01:55:41.980
<v Speaker 9>monks that were like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2416
01:55:41.981 --> 01:55:42.814
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2417
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.591
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2418
01:55:43.591 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 9>what are those scrolls called in Dublin,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm the,</v>

2419
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:51.570
<v Speaker 9>whatever they're called,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but they were hand writing bibles by the</v>

2420
01:55:51.571 --> 01:55:55.950
<v Speaker 9>fucking thousands and that's what saved </v>
<v Speaker 9>Christianity.</v>

2421
01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:57.540
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so,</v>

2422
01:55:57.541 --> 01:55:59.160
<v Speaker 9>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then you get into the poets,</v>

2423
01:55:59.161 --> 01:56:01.110
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yates and Eugene O'neill and,</v>

2424
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 9>and you think about what the Irish have </v>
<v Speaker 9>offered to this place,</v>

2425
01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:07.500
<v Speaker 9>but the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Massive kid fuckers.</v>

2426
01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

2427
01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:09.793
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of people throughout history </v>

2428
01:56:11.201 --> 01:56:14.290
<v Speaker 3>that were kid fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what was really weird.</v>

2429
01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:17.260
<v Speaker 3>It was like if you go through history </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2430
01:56:17.261 --> 01:56:18.094
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pet arrestees that would you call it up </v>

2431
01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:22.570
<v Speaker 3>the technical word for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it having sex with underage boys?</v>

2432
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 3>But it's really common like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like throughout human history throughout</v>

2433
01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:33.781
<v Speaker 3>Rome and the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so many fucking instances of</v>

2434
01:56:34.211 --> 01:56:38.170
<v Speaker 3>great men threw in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't socrates a kid fucker.</v>

2435
01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:38.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2436
01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:39.663
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2437
01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean like how many people quote </v>
<v Speaker 3>socrates and then have that caveat,</v>

2438
01:56:43.391 --> 01:56:45.410
<v Speaker 3>but it also fucked kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2439
01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:48.400
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't give them a pass on that.</v>

2440
01:56:48.670 --> 01:56:50.620
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know you weren't supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck kids back then.</v>

2441
01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Cause people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people probably fuck them too.</v>

2442
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:54.303
<v Speaker 3>It was probably sexual exchanges were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we a bunch less rigid idea of what </v>

2443
01:56:59.411 --> 01:57:02.830
<v Speaker 3>sexual exchanges were acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not that long ago.</v>

2444
01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:03.773
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that hundreds of years ago </v>

2445
01:57:05.021 --> 01:57:07.960
<v Speaker 3>people were just fucking fucking animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I'd fuck a kid.</v>

2446
01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:09.993
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that would probably be good to </v>

2447
01:57:12.011 --> 01:57:12.844
<v Speaker 3>fuck right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a horse would probably fight </v>

2448
01:57:15.191 --> 01:57:17.350
<v Speaker 3>back the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

2449
01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't fuck her horse because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they kick you,</v>

2450
01:57:19.151 --> 01:57:20.650
<v Speaker 3>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2451
01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:23.980
<v Speaker 3>They decided they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to be cool about it.</v>

2452
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:25.180
<v Speaker 3>That I can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2453
01:57:25.181 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 3>go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finish.</v>

2454
01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:27.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take you off of him.</v>

2455
01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:29.720
<v Speaker 9>He want a fat,</v>
<v Speaker 9>lazy animal.</v>

2456
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.883
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You don't want death by female horse or </v>

2457
01:57:32.821 --> 01:57:34.550
<v Speaker 9>a male horse if you're into that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 9>shit.</v>

2458
01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:39.120
<v Speaker 9>Probably had,</v>
<v Speaker 9>she seems she's pretty popular show.</v>

2459
01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2460
01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:42.260
<v Speaker 3>that would definitely be the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2461
01:57:42.261 --> 01:57:43.094
<v Speaker 3>it's weird that it's illegal to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals when you are going to do </v>

2462
01:57:48.321 --> 01:57:52.480
<v Speaker 3>anything but eat them like um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's illegal.</v>

2463
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:56.500
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal to fuck animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't fuck them,</v>

2464
01:57:56.710 --> 01:57:58.270
<v Speaker 3>but you can kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2465
01:57:58.330 --> 01:57:59.710
<v Speaker 3>you can eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't fuck them.</v>

2466
01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't do a dual purpose.</v>

2467
01:58:01.931 --> 01:58:03.130
<v Speaker 3>You can't kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them.</v>

2468
01:58:03.131 --> 01:58:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Then eat them because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dead animal and that's gross.</v>

2469
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:10.980
<v Speaker 9>Illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it's more illegal to fuck a dead</v>

2470
01:58:10.981 --> 01:58:11.814
<v Speaker 9>animal than a live animal.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That makes sense because what are you </v>

2471
01:58:13.831 --> 01:58:14.191
<v Speaker 9>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Then?</v>

2472
01:58:14.191 --> 01:58:15.024
<v Speaker 9>You're really just masturbating because </v>
<v Speaker 9>there's not a living thing in your </v>

2473
01:58:16.801 --> 01:58:19.230
<v Speaker 9>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It can't be rape if it's debt,</v>

2474
01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:20.293
<v Speaker 3>but you notice how there's like stages </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like how you feel about the dead </v>

2475
01:58:22.551 --> 01:58:24.560
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one stage.</v>

2476
01:58:24.561 --> 01:58:26.240
<v Speaker 3>One is the live animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2477
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:27.610
<v Speaker 3>If you fucking alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anima,</v>

2478
01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.453
<v Speaker 3>you crazy asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you subject to that animal to </v>

2479
01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:31.910
<v Speaker 3>stage two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking a dead animal.</v>

2480
01:58:31.911 --> 01:58:33.470
<v Speaker 3>Like what is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>

2481
01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:34.633
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want to fuck this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about whether you should be able </v>

2482
01:58:37.551 --> 01:58:40.640
<v Speaker 3>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you kill it and then eat it,</v>

2483
01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's</v>

2484
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.140
<v Speaker 5>fine with that because that's like what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to do,</v>

2485
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:45.303
<v Speaker 5>but you can't fuck it's body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what if you just jerked off with a </v>

2486
01:58:48.161 --> 01:58:49.890
<v Speaker 5>chicken cutlet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you took a chicken,</v>

2487
01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 5>he wrapped around your Dick and someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>came in the room like,</v>

2488
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:53.920
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Greg?</v>

2489
01:58:53.921 --> 01:58:54.311
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2490
01:58:54.311 --> 01:58:55.144
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you it sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it feels so good and I just cleaned </v>

2491
01:58:57.341 --> 01:59:00.910
<v Speaker 5>it up and then I eat it for dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes a bite.</v>

2492
01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:04.630
<v Speaker 5>What's this nice cream sauce?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dare you.</v>

2493
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.450
<v Speaker 5>Now that you say fucking a chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>cutlet,</v>

2494
01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:10.770
<v Speaker 5>it's all I can think about it because he</v>
<v Speaker 5>had slippery.</v>

2495
01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:14.650
<v Speaker 5>It's soft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When those gmo chickens would wrap right</v>

2496
01:59:14.651 --> 01:59:19.300
<v Speaker 5>around your heart and it's a breast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You thinking about it being at your tit.</v>

2497
01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:20.213
<v Speaker 5>Fucking it.</v>

2498
01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.090
<v Speaker 5>You know what you would do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would take a bag,</v>

2499
01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:27.270
<v Speaker 5>like a Ziploc storage bags?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2500
01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:32.280
<v Speaker 5>the chicken cutlet in the bag and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>heat up some water to about a 99 degrees</v>

2501
01:59:32.710 --> 01:59:37.360
<v Speaker 5>and then you dunk the chicken cutlet in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the water so that it heats up.</v>

2502
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:38.340
<v Speaker 5>It gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2503
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:41.950
<v Speaker 5>like a body skin temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you just covered that bitch with.</v>

2504
01:59:42.450 --> 01:59:44.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just lather it in there.</v>

2505
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:49.350
<v Speaker 5>And then you put an oven Mitt on cutlet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wrapped that color on your shaft.</v>

2506
01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:55.290
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crimes against humanity.</v>

2507
01:59:55.300 --> 02:00:00.300
<v Speaker 5>Never felt so good and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can eat it.</v>

2508
02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:05.440
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna Cook that Shit because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've tenderized it.</v>

2509
02:00:05.530 --> 02:00:08.350
<v Speaker 5>Especially like you don't have to use in</v>
<v Speaker 5>edible oil.</v>

2510
02:00:08.351 --> 02:00:12.280
<v Speaker 5>You could jerk off with a nice avocado </v>
<v Speaker 5>oil or coconut oil.</v>

2511
02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:14.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>avocado oil has a high flash point.</v>

2512
02:00:14.921 --> 02:00:17.560
<v Speaker 5>It's good oil to jerk off with because </v>
<v Speaker 5>then after you're done,</v>

2513
02:00:17.561 --> 02:00:19.510
<v Speaker 5>as long as you don't come on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken.</v>

2514
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:20.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2515
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.070
<v Speaker 5>you pull out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's gross.</v>

2516
02:00:22.090 --> 02:00:22.923
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to come on your food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that way it will be like really </v>

2517
02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:27.820
<v Speaker 5>green multiple uses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

2518
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.863
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't accept the fact that we </v>

2519
02:00:29.551 --> 02:00:30.850
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want pleasure.</v>

2520
02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.290
<v Speaker 5>You know that we want pleasure from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fleshlight is gross.</v>

2521
02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:37.570
<v Speaker 5>You want to fuck that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2522
02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:38.553
<v Speaker 5>that's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That we want pleasure from a chicken </v>

2523
02:00:40.931 --> 02:00:41.764
<v Speaker 5>cutlet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Using an animal flesh as a masturbation </v>

2524
02:00:45.341 --> 02:00:46.174
<v Speaker 5>tool will eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will sink our teeth into it and </v>

2525
02:00:48.101 --> 02:00:53.101
<v Speaker 5>swallow it belong as you interested in </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal will eat a cow's fucking milk.</v>

2526
02:00:53.630 --> 02:00:54.790
<v Speaker 5>Leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's rule so we.</v>

2527
02:00:54.791 --> 02:00:55.624
<v Speaker 5>Here's the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>According to section 69 of the sexual </v>

2528
02:00:57.941 --> 02:00:58.774
<v Speaker 5>offenses act of 2003 69 commits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a person commits an offense of </v>

2529
02:01:04.181 --> 02:01:09.181
<v Speaker 5>intercourse with an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a he unintentionally or intentionally</v>

2530
02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:10.720
<v Speaker 5>intentionally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

2531
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:14.020
<v Speaker 5>performs an act of penetration which is </v>
<v Speaker 5>penis be.</v>

2532
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:18.070
<v Speaker 5>What is penetrated is the vagina or anus</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a living animal.</v>

2533
02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:22.030
<v Speaker 5>So blow jobs are afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's not intercourse with an animal</v>

2534
02:01:22.031 --> 02:01:25.920
<v Speaker 5>and blow jobs are free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But notice how both of them are heat.</v>

2535
02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:32.440
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to he doing it,</v>

2536
02:01:32.590 --> 02:01:35.260
<v Speaker 5>they're not referring to a chick fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>a horse.</v>

2537
02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:37.440
<v Speaker 5>That chick fucking a horse seems totally</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal.</v>

2538
02:01:37.450 --> 02:01:38.920
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't be a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking a chick though.</v>

2539
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 5>Not the chick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck No.</v>

2540
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.020
<v Speaker 5>That dirty bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She shows that horse what's up?</v>

2541
02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:44.840
<v Speaker 5>She backs up to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keeps them stuck in that stall.</v>

2542
02:01:44.841 --> 02:01:47.330
<v Speaker 5>He can't back up or go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally against as well.</v>

2543
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:49.570
<v Speaker 8>It has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2544
02:01:49.690 --> 02:01:53.620
<v Speaker 8>David Cameron and the prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think of what the UK or Britain,</v>

2545
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:56.170
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just just talking about if he could have</v>

2546
02:01:56.171 --> 02:01:57.004
<v Speaker 8>gotten in trouble if something happened </v>
<v Speaker 8>with some allegations of something in </v>

2547
02:01:58.781 --> 02:02:02.380
<v Speaker 8>some memoirs about something that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>not reading all of the article.</v>

2548
02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:03.214
<v Speaker 8>I was just reading them</v>

2549
02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 5>his penis in a dead pig head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>

2550
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:09.020
<v Speaker 5>And that's what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the allegation.</v>

2551
02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.950
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he was in a university.</v>

2552
02:02:11.250 --> 02:02:11.941
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>

2553
02:02:11.941 --> 02:02:14.700
<v Speaker 8>but it was breaking down if what he did </v>
<v Speaker 8>is actually illegal or not.</v>

2554
02:02:14.701 --> 02:02:17.610
<v Speaker 8>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it has to be a dead animal or this was a</v>

2555
02:02:17.611 --> 02:02:19.200
<v Speaker 8>dead animal in this court in this case.</v>

2556
02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:22.270
<v Speaker 5>So for the live animal it's sex with an </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal.</v>

2557
02:02:22.450 --> 02:02:24.070
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if it's dead animals,</v>

2558
02:02:24.071 --> 02:02:24.600
<v Speaker 5>no big deal.</v>

2559
02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:25.433
<v Speaker 8>And then I broke it down that it would </v>
<v Speaker 8>have mattered where it happened and if </v>

2560
02:02:28.201 --> 02:02:29.700
<v Speaker 8>someone would have taken a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

2561
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:34.260
<v Speaker 5>if there's no picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're fine.</v>

2562
02:02:34.261 --> 02:02:36.090
<v Speaker 5>If it happened in public,</v>

2563
02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:37.670
<v Speaker 8>you're also maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2564
02:02:37.730 --> 02:02:38.563
<v Speaker 5>that is fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How weird is it that we have rules on </v>

2565
02:02:41.271 --> 02:02:44.750
<v Speaker 5>what we allow you to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can kill them and eat them,</v>

2566
02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:45.673
<v Speaker 5>but you can't just kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can only kill them if you're going </v>

2567
02:02:47.651 --> 02:02:48.484
<v Speaker 5>to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can't just shoot a cow in the </v>

2568
02:02:49.951 --> 02:02:50.784
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leave it to rot even though that's like </v>

2569
02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:54.620
<v Speaker 5>the natural processes of animal falls </v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

2570
02:02:54.621 --> 02:02:55.880
<v Speaker 5>Cro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>start eating it.</v>

2571
02:02:55.910 --> 02:03:00.230
<v Speaker 5>Rats eating the grass devours it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets,</v>

2572
02:03:00.231 --> 02:03:02.060
<v Speaker 5>you know it decays and goes into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground,</v>

2573
02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:05.160
<v Speaker 5>but you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will shoot if you are,</v>

2574
02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.313
<v Speaker 5>unless you strap a bit and it's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sit on it and whip it around a fucking </v>

2575
02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:11.030
<v Speaker 5>to Deauville track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do that.</v>

2576
02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:12.530
<v Speaker 5>Then he breaks his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you can kill.</v>

2577
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:14.360
<v Speaker 5>Shoot him in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dentist fair.</v>

2578
02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.253
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weird rules with how we interact with </v>

2579
02:03:16.731 --> 02:03:17.930
<v Speaker 5>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

2580
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:21.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm definitely not saying you should go </v>
<v Speaker 5>around fucking animals.</v>

2581
02:03:21.141 --> 02:03:21.974
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you should be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you should hope nobody </v>

2582
02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:25.130
<v Speaker 5>interprets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we're saying is that.</v>

2583
02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:29.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it is weird that we make</v>
<v Speaker 5>rules about things like that,</v>

2584
02:03:29.871 --> 02:03:32.240
<v Speaker 5>like who was fucking these animals to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the point where they're like,</v>

2585
02:03:32.241 --> 02:03:33.074
<v Speaker 5>we gotta write this down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm surprised there's not more animal </v>

2586
02:03:36.801 --> 02:03:37.634
<v Speaker 5>fucking because think about how horny </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are and you think about people </v>

2587
02:03:42.981 --> 02:03:45.530
<v Speaker 5>that can't get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2588
02:03:45.710 --> 02:03:48.280
<v Speaker 5>And I just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems incredible to me that,</v>

2589
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:50.780
<v Speaker 5>that you don't hear all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it just does.</v>

2590
02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:51.793
<v Speaker 5>People don't find out maybe this more </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal fucking going on than we really </v>

2591
02:03:54.411 --> 02:03:58.100
<v Speaker 5>are aware of how many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many people's lives alone with a fucking</v>

2592
02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:00.740
<v Speaker 5>giant dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2593
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:03.440
<v Speaker 5>Like one of those big fucking sheep </v>
<v Speaker 5>dogs.</v>

2594
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.030
<v Speaker 5>That's weird that a guy would live with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that because he's fucking it.</v>

2595
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:10.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh Greg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so not true.</v>

2596
02:04:10.221 --> 02:04:11.054
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they just have a nice pet dog </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they love them and they give him a </v>

2597
02:04:13.521 --> 02:04:17.060
<v Speaker 5>kiss on the face and they throw the ball</v>
<v Speaker 5>for him and he's a wonderful companion,</v>

2598
02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:22.400
<v Speaker 5>but at least a few guys are out there </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now while I'm talking.</v>

2599
02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.910
<v Speaker 5>Three hundred million people in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>country plus Mexicans.</v>

2600
02:04:26.130 --> 02:04:27.920
<v Speaker 5>What's that number?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three 50.</v>

2601
02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:30.050
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't even know what the number is.</v>

2602
02:04:30.051 --> 02:04:32.450
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we don't want to say plus Mexicans.</v>

2603
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:34.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're welcome here.</v>

2604
02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:36.170
<v Speaker 5>I say he could stay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I was.</v>

2605
02:04:36.171 --> 02:04:36.801
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2606
02:04:36.801 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 5>let stay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She still fuck</v>

2607
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:38.933
<v Speaker 1>the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is at a 300 plus </v>

2608
02:04:41.641 --> 02:04:42.474
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's at least one person right now </v>

2609
02:04:43.921 --> 02:04:44.754
<v Speaker 1>who has his balls covered in whip cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His dog is sucking on his balls and so </v>

2610
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:50.340
<v Speaker 1>many more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2611
02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>At least one though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has super confident.</v>

2612
02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Like if I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they said Mr Rogan,</v>

2613
02:04:54.541 --> 02:04:57.480
<v Speaker 1>would you like to bet $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that being true?</v>

2614
02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2615
02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:04.170
<v Speaker 1>That's good money right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of $300 million has whipped cream on</v>

2616
02:05:04.171 --> 02:05:06.230
<v Speaker 1>his balls and he's jerking off while his</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs looking.</v>

2617
02:05:06.231 --> 02:05:07.061
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

2618
02:05:07.061 --> 02:05:07.894
<v Speaker 1>the map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the spots on the map where it's </v>

2619
02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>happening and it would be like those </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump states just like,</v>

2620
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you know when you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they're all red.</v>

2621
02:05:13.770 --> 02:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like that's what it'd be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2622
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:16.853
<v Speaker 1>like the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a constellation in the entire </v>

2623
02:05:19.590 --> 02:05:20.423
<v Speaker 1>country would light up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like 3000 people at the same </v>

2624
02:05:22.711 --> 02:05:24.450
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's too much.</v>

2625
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2626
02:05:25.590 --> 02:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that's probably not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says right here that uh,</v>

2627

<v Speaker 1>there's beastiality is legal in </v>

<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>

2629
02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2630

<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas Jersey does permit civil unions.</v>

2631
02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:40.673

<v Speaker 1>You can have a civil union with your </v>

2632
02:05:43.351 --> 02:05:46.860

02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Gay People can't get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the way.</v>

2656
02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:59.760
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we let that stay on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

2657
02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:02.370
<v Speaker 1>like everybody needs to sit down and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>

2658
02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this.</v>

2659
02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to fuck his sheep dog?</v>

2660
02:07:06.361 --> 02:07:09.280
<v Speaker 1>But these two lesbians that can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>married out here,</v>

2661
02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of the way.</v>

2662
02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Boys that insult and get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's national.</v>

2663
02:07:13.741 --> 02:07:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Now gay marriage is legal in all states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

2664
02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2665
02:07:18.751 --> 02:07:19.584
<v Speaker 1>I mean it'll be challenged once trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in is illegal and all states </v>

2666
02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>federally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

2667
02:07:23.431 --> 02:07:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a a year ago.</v>

2668
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:26.693
<v Speaker 1>I think it's federally illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the states that have issues </v>

2669
02:07:28.711 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2670
02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:31.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the opposite of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with marijuana.</v>

2671
02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana being legal in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

2672
02:07:34.081 --> 02:07:37.330
<v Speaker 1>but federally illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weird system.</v>

2673
02:07:37.630 --> 02:07:38.463
<v Speaker 1>Never get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the issue with that lady in </v>

2674
02:07:39.671 --> 02:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't.</v>

2675
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:41.583
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't personally wouldn't issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>the marriage license and so that's </v>

2676
02:07:43.741 --> 02:07:44.381
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

2677
02:07:44.381 --> 02:07:45.214
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2678
02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:47.710

<v Speaker 1>That was that crazy lady for Jesus.</v>

2679
02:07:48.190 --> 02:07:49.023
<v Speaker 1>Jesus don't want no clear cut each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>off onto the power of government and </v>

2680
02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>they brought it to the convention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republican convention.</v>

2681
02:07:57.821 --> 02:07:59.410
<v Speaker 1>She was a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A goddamn here.</v>

2682
02:07:59.411 --> 02:08:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

2683
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:03.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what I love is the trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inauguration.</v>

2684
02:08:03.461 --> 02:08:05.530
<v Speaker 1>He see what he's got lined up for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent so far.</v>

2685
02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Mormon Tabernacle choir and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockettes.</v>

2686
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of them won't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2687
02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the Democrats I heard,</v>

2688
02:08:14.411 --> 02:08:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this confirmed that the Democrats are</v>

2689
02:08:16.751 --> 02:08:21.751
<v Speaker 1>putting on a concert that same night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got springsteen Lady Gaga,</v>

2690
02:08:23.470 --> 02:08:24.303
<v Speaker 1>fucking Jay z and beyonce like literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 15 of the biggest names in </v>

2691
02:08:29.951 --> 02:08:32.230
<v Speaker 1>entertain and trump is such a star </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>

2692
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:33.303
<v Speaker 1>This is kill it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Weird the Democrats are doing </v>

2693
02:08:36.191 --> 02:08:38.650
<v Speaker 1>something on the inauguration night like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2694
02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Why did that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not that night,</v>

2695
02:08:40.601 --> 02:08:43.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's around then maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to fuck with them.</v>

2696
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

2697
02:08:45.281 --> 02:08:46.114
<v Speaker 1>Fucking with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's raising awareness that we </v>

2698
02:08:48.341 --> 02:08:50.620
<v Speaker 1>have to stay vigilant that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2700
02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:58.360
<v Speaker 1>but I think that we should make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the constitution is being honored.</v>

2701
02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the big question right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

2702
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:05.020
<v Speaker 1>how does a guy go from being a reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>star to being the president?</v>

2703
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost beyond imagination,</v>

2704
02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:14.440
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that it's real and I keep </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like has been cheated on her cook.</v>

2727
02:10:07.610 --> 02:10:10.960
<v Speaker 1>she came out of the originally from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn,</v>

2728
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:12.263
<v Speaker 1>a phrase cuckold in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a guy fucks your wife in </v>

2729
02:10:15.041 --> 02:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>front of you and you'll go like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like watching.</v>

2730
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to Shakespeare.</v>

2731
02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

2732
02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>they changed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how is it that they're maligning her</v>

2733
02:10:25.271 --> 02:10:29.830
<v Speaker 1>for her husband cheating when trump has </v>
<v Speaker 1>had three wives.</v>

2734
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>But wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>

2735
02:10:31.410 --> 02:10:33.500
<v Speaker 1>who's the deed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2736
02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a big generalization?</v>

2737
02:10:35.650 --> 02:10:37.330
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they went after they brought,</v>

2738
02:10:37.331 --> 02:10:39.070
<v Speaker 9>they brought out,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2739
02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:44.071
<v Speaker 9>all of all of Clinton's ex mistresses at</v>
<v Speaker 9>the Republican convention.</v>

2740
02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:45.811
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

2741
02:10:45.811 --> 02:10:46.644
<v Speaker 1>All people that he allegedly sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>assaulted this a little stronger than </v>

2742
02:10:48.781 --> 02:10:50.390
<v Speaker 1>just mistresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2743
02:10:50.730 --> 02:10:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best stuff.</v>

2744
02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:53.933
<v Speaker 1>I think the all stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were women that were accusing him </v>

2745
02:10:55.831 --> 02:10:56.760
<v Speaker 1>of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't they?</v>

2746
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Were they all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2747
02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>It was in the or accusing him of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault and weren't.</v>

2748
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:04.560
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the big deal was it wasn't just</v>

2749
02:11:04.561 --> 02:11:06.320
<v Speaker 1>that he had affairs with these women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2750
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:08.310
<v Speaker 1>it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like some allegations,</v>

2751
02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:11.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>

2752
02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it was,</v>

2753
02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:14.273
<v Speaker 1>but it is amazing how much that was used</v>
<v Speaker 1>against her list of sexual advances and </v>

2754
02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexual advances is,</v>

2755
02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:23.390
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different than sexual assault.</v>

2756
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Groping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>groping,</v>

2757
02:11:24.570 --> 02:11:25.950
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forcibly kissing.</v>

2758
02:11:26.190 --> 02:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>So when you say sexual advances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's always like,</v>

2759
02:11:28.381 --> 02:11:30.000
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he talk to her?</v>

2760
02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Probably like grabbing pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>

2761
02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

2762
02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:41.460
<v Speaker 9>What is weird is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>without permission,</v>

2763
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:44.100
<v Speaker 9>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not defending trump on this one,</v>

2764
02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:48.480
<v Speaker 9>but the first move your first move,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can either go,</v>

2765
02:11:48.481 --> 02:11:51.430
<v Speaker 9>you can go hard or you can be Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 9>Gentlemen.</v>

2766
02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:53.820
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and not too many guys are saying,</v>

2767
02:11:53.821 --> 02:11:54.654
<v Speaker 9>may I kiss you?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You usually just go in and try to kiss </v>

2768
02:11:56.641 --> 02:11:57.570
<v Speaker 9>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

2769
02:11:57.571 --> 02:11:59.790
<v Speaker 9>Which is what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not only that,</v>

2770
02:12:00.330 --> 02:12:03.720
<v Speaker 9>can you go in and grab a woman's Vagina </v>
<v Speaker 9>as your first move?</v>

2771
02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:04.673
<v Speaker 9>Can you cut the third?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Can you steal first and second and go </v>

2772
02:12:06.421 --> 02:12:08.520
<v Speaker 9>right to third.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Who says you can't?</v>

2773
02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:10.860
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if it worked,</v>

2774
02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:12.870
<v Speaker 9>it will be a fucking bold move.</v>

2775
02:12:13.150 --> 02:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he say they let you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that one of the sun?</v>

2776
02:12:17.230 --> 02:12:20.080
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And he's talking about crazy groupies.</v>

2777
02:12:20.110 --> 02:12:22.360
<v Speaker 9>I don't want to defend it because this </v>
<v Speaker 9>is a way to do it.</v>

2778
02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:23.343
<v Speaker 9>Like if you're sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like I remember when I was a teenager </v>

2779
02:12:25.301 --> 02:12:27.700
<v Speaker 9>there was a girl driving a car and I </v>
<v Speaker 9>didn't know her that well,</v>

2780
02:12:27.970 --> 02:12:32.290
<v Speaker 9>but we were like 16 or 17 and while she </v>
<v Speaker 9>was driving I put my hand.</v>

2781
02:12:32.291 --> 02:12:33.124
<v Speaker 9>There were like three kids in the back </v>
<v Speaker 9>and everybody's getting high and I put </v>

2782
02:12:36.161 --> 02:12:38.650
<v Speaker 9>my hand on her knee and I kind of worked</v>
<v Speaker 9>at.</v>

2783
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:41.320
<v Speaker 9>I worked at down the thigh slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 9>slowly.</v>

2784
02:12:41.710 --> 02:12:43.420
<v Speaker 9>Is it okay not saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's,</v>

2785
02:12:43.630 --> 02:12:44.800
<v Speaker 9>it's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's quiet.</v>

2786
02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:46.360
<v Speaker 9>And I got,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I got to her,</v>

2787
02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:50.050
<v Speaker 9>I got her vagina and I massaged it while</v>
<v Speaker 9>she drove.</v>

2788
02:12:51.190 --> 02:12:55.150
<v Speaker 9>And then we got to where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I got out of the car and I never saw her</v>

2789
02:12:55.151 --> 02:13:00.151
<v Speaker 9>again.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Was that in fact Joe Rogan immoral?</v>

2790
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Not In my eyes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she might've called her friends over and</v>

02:13:23.241 --> 02:13:24.074
<v Speaker 1>Now coast host of NBC today show I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use some tic tacs just in case I </v>

2800
02:13:27.231 --> 02:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>start kissing her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump says.</v>

2801
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>And when you're a star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let you do it.</v>

2802
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Trump says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab them by the Pussy.</v>

2803
02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Trump says you can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's being funny.</v>

2804
02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:39.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfortunate that,</v>

2805
02:13:39.331 --> 02:13:41.220
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2806
02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:44.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people like making this,</v>

2807
02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:47.990
<v Speaker 3>this thing about it being a locker room </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk is inexcusable.</v>

2808
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:48.833
<v Speaker 3>You can't say it's locker room talk like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't expect someone's words when </v>

2809
02:13:53.761 --> 02:13:54.594
<v Speaker 3>it's two guys talking shit to each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that to be transferred literally </v>

2810
02:13:58.890 --> 02:13:59.880
<v Speaker 3>onto like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2811
02:13:59.910 --> 02:14:00.743
<v Speaker 3>like when you're reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're reading it out and you're not </v>

2812
02:14:02.611 --> 02:14:03.444
<v Speaker 3>taking into account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are two guys sitting next to each </v>

2813
02:14:04.951 --> 02:14:05.784
<v Speaker 3>other on the bus talking shit being </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny and that one of them is a fucking </v>

2814
02:14:09.301 --> 02:14:10.134
<v Speaker 3>renowned entertainer and his whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is about him being this braggadocious </v>

2815
02:14:15.391 --> 02:14:17.460
<v Speaker 3>winter and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2816
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:21.570
<v Speaker 3>he's obviously playing it up and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing it up to an audience of one,</v>

2817
02:14:21.571 --> 02:14:22.404
<v Speaker 3>not to audience of 80 million or however</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people found out about it or more </v>

2818
02:14:25.841 --> 02:14:27.360
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the hell it was that read </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2819
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:32.050
<v Speaker 9>But can you see that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>as sort of an insight into his character</v>

2820
02:14:32.051 --> 02:14:32.884
<v Speaker 9>in terms of showing women from a power </v>
<v Speaker 9>structure of him having the power in </v>

2821
02:14:36.071 --> 02:14:36.904
<v Speaker 9>them not.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And will that affect how he leads the </v>

2822
02:14:38.861 --> 02:14:39.940
<v Speaker 9>country?</v>
<v Speaker 9>For sure.</v>

2823
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:45.490
<v Speaker 3>That is absolutely a way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another way to look at it is he was used</v>

2824
02:14:45.711 --> 02:14:50.600
<v Speaker 3>to groupies that wanted to do and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them probably did.</v>

2825
02:14:50.601 --> 02:14:53.090
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>billionaire,</v>

2826
02:14:53.150 --> 02:14:55.100
<v Speaker 9>when you're powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 9>forget the money.</v>

2827
02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a multibillionaire.</v>

2828
02:14:58.611 --> 02:15:03.260
<v Speaker 3>He has many billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The type of gold digging holes,</v>

2829
02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:05.510
<v Speaker 3>the muzzle launch themselves in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

2830
02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean it must be like they must have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight them off like,</v>

2831
02:15:09.710 --> 02:15:11.690
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hoard and Lord of the rings.</v>

2832
02:15:11.691 --> 02:15:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2833
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:15.343
<v Speaker 3>he's worth a lot of fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Gal could just sneak in and take a </v>

2834
02:15:18.351 --> 02:15:19.184
<v Speaker 3>piece of that.</v>

2835
02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.980
<v Speaker 9>You think he's peeled off a million here</v>
<v Speaker 9>and there for women.</v>

2836
02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:24.660
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't hurt them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think it wouldn't hurt them.</v>

2837
02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Maybe take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get some nice good at a gift shop.</v>

2838
02:15:28.351 --> 02:15:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Get yourself settled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does not.</v>

2839
02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:35.560
<v Speaker 3>He's not a Marauder of business marauder</v>
<v Speaker 3>because just because he likes money.</v>

2840
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:37.183
<v Speaker 3>Like he likes the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes all of the above and that's </v>

2841
02:15:40.471 --> 02:15:43.350
<v Speaker 3>part of all of the above,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the massive success.</v>

2842
02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:45.570
<v Speaker 3>He can do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He flies in his jet.</v>

2843
02:15:45.571 --> 02:15:48.210
<v Speaker 3>He's got billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got this super hot wife,</v>

2844
02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.073
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2845
02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:51.780
<v Speaker 3>he's the president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's doing what I mean,</v>

2846
02:15:51.781 --> 02:15:55.050
<v Speaker 3>that's standard for his operational </v>
<v Speaker 3>procedure.</v>

2847
02:15:55.051 --> 02:15:56.430
<v Speaker 3>He does whatever the fuck he want.</v>

2848
02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:57.913
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's kind of animalistic because if you </v>

2849
02:15:59.241 --> 02:16:00.860
<v Speaker 9>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know the,</v>

2850
02:16:01.250 --> 02:16:02.083
<v Speaker 9>the re procreating is the most important</v>
<v Speaker 9>thing and you get to do that as a male </v>

2851
02:16:06.861 --> 02:16:09.860
<v Speaker 9>when you are the most powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So in the animal kingdom,</v>

2852
02:16:10.190 --> 02:16:13.820
<v Speaker 9>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>everything translates into being able to</v>

2853
02:16:13.821 --> 02:16:16.700
<v Speaker 9>fuck the female.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so for a guy like that,</v>

2854
02:16:17.090 --> 02:16:17.923
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to be the most powerful man in his own </v>

2855
02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:21.700
<v Speaker 9>mind means this despoiled</v>

2856
02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:23.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the winner goes the spoils.</v>

2857
02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Plus he's heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that boils it down.</v>

2858
02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Heterosexual man with a massive amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of money and power and you know,</v>

2859
02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:35.410
<v Speaker 3>and now he's the president with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

2860
02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.140
<v Speaker 3>We'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be interesting.</v>

2861
02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:39.193
<v Speaker 3>The interesting thing to me is now </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy who has been literally </v>

2862
02:16:43.271 --> 02:16:45.280
<v Speaker 3>paying off politicians for the longest </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2863
02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Giving massive campaign contributions.</v>

2864
02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:48.873
<v Speaker 3>Now he's the president himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's he going to do when it gets in </v>

2865
02:16:51.371 --> 02:16:51.821
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2866
02:16:51.821 --> 02:16:52.654
<v Speaker 3>he's even talked himself about how the </v>
<v Speaker 3>electoral college is stupid and he's </v>

2867
02:16:55.781 --> 02:16:56.171
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2868
02:16:56.171 --> 02:16:58.000
<v Speaker 3>well we probably should go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular vote.</v>

2869
02:16:58.390 --> 02:17:00.670
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a different race though.</v>

2870
02:17:00.730 --> 02:17:01.563
<v Speaker 3>I didn't try to win the race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like saying that she won the electoral </v>

2871
02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:05.313
<v Speaker 3>vote or that she won the popular vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he won the electoral college vote </v>

2872
02:17:08.801 --> 02:17:12.160
<v Speaker 3>and she won the popular vote by many </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands.</v>

2873
02:17:12.810 --> 02:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Three was he drew three or 4 million</v>

2874
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:18.290
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was saying,</v>

2875
02:17:18.291 --> 02:17:21.140
<v Speaker 3>well that's a different race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could do a popular vote.</v>

2876
02:17:21.141 --> 02:17:23.180
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually be an easier race,</v>

2877
02:17:23.630 --> 02:17:24.463
<v Speaker 3>but it's a different race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to win the electoral </v>

2878
02:17:25.851 --> 02:17:27.140
<v Speaker 3>college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to win those states.</v>

2879
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:28.123
<v Speaker 3>It's just how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he figured it out and he did it and </v>

2880
02:17:29.931 --> 02:17:33.880
<v Speaker 3>she even avoided those states to Bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton's fucking angst.</v>

2881
02:17:33.890 --> 02:17:34.723
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he was furious that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>some story that he threw a cell phone </v>

2882
02:17:37.131 --> 02:17:39.380
<v Speaker 3>down and he was yelling at her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to go to these places.</v>

2883
02:17:39.590 --> 02:17:40.720
<v Speaker 3>You've got a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

2884
02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:42.200
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those aren't my people.</v>

2885
02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Like too many liberals thought they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the bag.</v>

2886
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Too many liberals thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2887
02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:49.010
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks the way I think and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody I know thinks this.</v>

2888
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Trump can be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people just all throughout those</v>

2889
02:17:52.671 --> 02:17:57.140
<v Speaker 3>cornfields just was so happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so happy when he got an office man.</v>

2890
02:17:57.470 --> 02:17:59.360
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of instagram posts that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow.</v>

2891
02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:00.433
<v Speaker 3>Instagram pages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to people's pages and it's all </v>

2892
02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag Maga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag make America great again.</v>

2893
02:18:07.370 --> 02:18:09.410
<v Speaker 3>He gives me my pickup truck and my make </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

2894
02:18:09.690 --> 02:18:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I would have talked to every one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers in two years.</v>

2895
02:18:12.361 --> 02:18:13.194
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to all of you face to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and how do you account for </v>

2896
02:18:16.051 --> 02:18:16.884
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say that because then they're </v>

2897
02:18:18.211 --> 02:18:19.044
<v Speaker 1>going to blame the liberals and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the liberal conspiracy and the </v>

2898
02:18:21.361 --> 02:18:22.194
<v Speaker 1>reason why trump wasn't successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the liberal back Congress tried </v>

2899
02:18:25.971 --> 02:18:29.190
<v Speaker 1>to interrupt the power structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberals don't back Congress.</v>

2900
02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

2901
02:18:30.781 --> 02:18:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] DOT com.</v>

2902
02:18:34.050 --> 02:18:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republicans have the right idea.</v>

2903
02:18:39.470 --> 02:18:44.470
<v Speaker 1>If he is not successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got the Senate and Congress and the</v>

2904
02:18:45.690 --> 02:18:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Supreme Court and the Uber Guide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gubernatorial control.</v>

2905
02:18:48.570 --> 02:18:50.860
<v Speaker 1>He's got it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Chris's agenda,</v>

2906
02:18:50.861 --> 02:18:53.490
<v Speaker 1>doesn't go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cannot blame liberals.</v>

2907
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping with great sincerity that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly phase out.</v>

2908
02:18:58.261 --> 02:18:59.094
<v Speaker 1>The idea of having one individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>president I think is ridiculous and I </v>

2909
02:19:02.941 --> 02:19:03.774
<v Speaker 1>think it goes back to the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking primates and their alpha male </v>

2910
02:19:06.631 --> 02:19:07.464
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think families occupy that one thrown </v>

2911
02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:14.760
<v Speaker 1>too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many bushes,</v>

2912
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:16.650
<v Speaker 1>too many Clinton's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stop,</v>

2913
02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:20.490
<v Speaker 1>stop and would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Donald Trump wins and then you know,</v>

2914
02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:22.350
<v Speaker 1>few years down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son gets in,</v>

2915
02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:24.630
<v Speaker 1>what if they're the next empire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That easily could happen.</v>

2916
02:19:24.690 --> 02:19:25.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2917
02:19:25.530 --> 02:19:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2918
02:19:27.470 --> 02:19:28.520
<v Speaker 1>The idea</v>

2919
02:19:28.670 --> 02:19:29.503
<v Speaker 3>was great when we first started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea was great to have one person </v>

2920
02:19:32.421 --> 02:19:34.910
<v Speaker 3>who is really exceptional and have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one person lead,</v>

2921
02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:36.133
<v Speaker 3>but I think at this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the collective strength of human beings </v>

2922
02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 3>has been demonstrated really clearly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this world.</v>

2923
02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:45.440
<v Speaker 3>The collective strength is far greater </v>
<v Speaker 3>when everyone contributes,</v>

2924
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:46.663
<v Speaker 3>when it's a collective group of minds </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and communicating about things </v>

2925
02:19:50.691 --> 02:19:51.530
<v Speaker 3>and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well,</v>

2926
02:19:51.531 --> 02:19:52.364
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's going to want their way and </v>

2927
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:56.300
<v Speaker 3>we have to realize like what's the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>way?</v>

2928
02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.313
<v Speaker 3>Like there's too much debate back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth about what's the left and what's </v>

2929
02:19:59.631 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 3>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the healthy way,</v>

2930
02:20:01.701 --> 02:20:02.534
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the correct way for like the </v>

2931
02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:05.903
<v Speaker 3>society to be even and smooth and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids be able to walk to school in the </v>

2932
02:20:09.621 --> 02:20:11.990
<v Speaker 3>morning without worrying about someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking them and eating them.</v>

2933
02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:14.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was this fucking guy,</v>

2934
02:20:14.871 --> 02:20:15.704
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson that I had on recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was talking about these posters that </v>

2935
02:20:18.231 --> 02:20:20.950
<v Speaker 3>they put up in Russia in the 19 thirties</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying don't eat</v>

2936
02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:21.913
<v Speaker 1>children</v>

2937
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:28.470
<v Speaker 3>who's talking about Marxism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism and where,</v>

2938
02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:32.900
<v Speaker 3>where can go awful and where a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ridiculous posturing intellectuals</v>

2939
02:20:32.901 --> 02:20:33.734
<v Speaker 3>that claimed to be Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand the consequences </v>

2940
02:20:35.061 --> 02:20:37.730
<v Speaker 3>of Marxism and he does really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really well.</v>

2941
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:38.780
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2942
02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:39.613
<v Speaker 3>you talked about the Gulag archipelago </v>
<v Speaker 3>and reading about all the different </v>

2943
02:20:41.481 --> 02:20:42.314
<v Speaker 3>things that had happened to people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had become indoctrinated into these </v>

2944
02:20:46.521 --> 02:20:47.354
<v Speaker 3>ideologies and then started carrying out</v>
<v Speaker 3>these horrific crimes in the name of </v>

2945
02:20:50.421 --> 02:20:51.440
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fuck,</v>

2946
02:20:51.441 --> 02:20:52.274
<v Speaker 3>it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finding all the people who died because </v>

2947
02:20:53.991 --> 02:20:54.870
<v Speaker 3>of communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2948
02:20:55.850 --> 02:20:56.683
<v Speaker 3>like we look at human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a bunch of people getting </v>

2949
02:20:58.191 --> 02:20:59.024
<v Speaker 3>jacked.</v>

2950
02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:01.210
<v Speaker 9>Well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so you're saying that there shouldn't be</v>

2951
02:21:01.211 --> 02:21:02.044
<v Speaker 9>a strong leader?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Are there shit because Marxism is </v>

2952
02:21:03.341 --> 02:21:04.170
<v Speaker 9>without a strong</v>

2953
02:21:04.170 --> 02:21:05.003
<v Speaker 3>later then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't think there should be one </v>

2954
02:21:06.901 --> 02:21:09.660
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think we should figure out who the</v>

2955
02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:14.661
<v Speaker 3>top minds as far as people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contribute who the top minds are and vet</v>

2956
02:21:14.851 --> 02:21:19.110
<v Speaker 3>them out and have a whole goddamn panel </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people like,</v>

2957
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:20.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

2958
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:23.520
<v Speaker 3>what superhero movies would they go to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>

2959
02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:27.020
<v Speaker 3>like Captain America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a council of elders or something.</v>

2960
02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2961
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:29.023
<v Speaker 3>we always have the hose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a bunch of wise men sitting </v>

2962
02:21:30.841 --> 02:21:32.400
<v Speaker 3>around there would be glowing from </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind,</v>

2963
02:21:32.610 --> 02:21:34.230
<v Speaker 3>like some thor type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2964
02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:35.910
<v Speaker 3>It's literally what we need.</v>

2965
02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:38.910
<v Speaker 9>But the elders is the problem because a </v>
<v Speaker 9>lot,</v>

2966
02:21:38.911 --> 02:21:42.510
<v Speaker 9>a lot of times these oligarchies become </v>
<v Speaker 9>old people.</v>

2967
02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:44.850
<v Speaker 9>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like Congress before,</v>

2968
02:21:44.851 --> 02:21:48.540
<v Speaker 9>before Johnson came in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Congress was literally seniority.</v>

2969
02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:52.470
<v Speaker 9>Every committee in Congress was based on</v>
<v Speaker 9>seniority.</v>

2970
02:21:52.471 --> 02:21:53.304
<v Speaker 9>The oldest motherfucker ran things and </v>
<v Speaker 9>so crazy and it was crazy and it gets </v>

2971
02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.420
<v Speaker 9>totally backlogged.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Any legislation.</v>

2972
02:22:00.421 --> 02:22:02.370
<v Speaker 9>And he came in and he,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he broke that up.</v>

2973
02:22:02.371 --> 02:22:05.340
<v Speaker 9>So he's alive the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He knows the old ways,</v>

2974
02:22:05.370 --> 02:22:06.350

<v Speaker 1>I was coming up the hill.</v>

3019

3021
02:23:53.071 --> 02:23:54.960
<v Speaker 1>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that the other day in my house.</v>

3022
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little squirt and what she's as </v>

3023
02:23:58.021 --> 02:23:58.854
<v Speaker 1>Christ feels like such a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had some good farts before the </v>

3024
02:24:02.310 --> 02:24:03.140
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3025
02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I got motivated because I had from you </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

3026
02:24:06.110 --> 02:24:10.500
<v Speaker 1>You were on a roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rumblers was Jesus and it was just me.</v>

3027
02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I wish I didn't have to cover them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

3028
02:24:12.471 --> 02:24:17.471
<v Speaker 1>so I was pausing and leaning into them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just a little fuck,</v>

3029
02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:22.290
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch the shower.</v>

3030
02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was really interesting because as</v>

3031
02:24:24.421 --> 02:24:25.254
<v Speaker 1>soon as I got on the bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I had explosive </v>

3032
02:24:27.661 --> 02:24:28.470
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea.</v>

3033
02:24:28.470 --> 02:24:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where was this?</v>

3034
02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:30.893
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that some diarrhea was </v>

3035
02:24:33.211 --> 02:24:34.044
<v Speaker 1>looming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile that's holiday eating </v>

3036
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:37.770
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3037
02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:38.633
<v Speaker 1>Well dreams and shit was also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go off the Diet and I started eating </v>

3038
02:24:41.191 --> 02:24:45.000
<v Speaker 1>like Pumpkin Pie and ice cream and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>did all the cream.</v>

3039
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of bread.</v>

3040
02:24:47.491 --> 02:24:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich</v>
<v Speaker 1>last night,</v>

3041
02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:51.593
<v Speaker 1>but as the ultimate failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your job as a human is to </v>

3042
02:24:54.151 --> 02:24:56.270
<v Speaker 1>provide for your family and not shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pants.</v>

3043
02:24:57.150 --> 02:25:00.120
<v Speaker 1>You think about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you fart,</v>

3044
02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3045
02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:03.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a little moment where you weigh </v>
<v Speaker 1>in on it.</v>

3046
02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You feel it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel your intestines,</v>

3047
02:25:06.151 --> 02:25:06.984
<v Speaker 1>you fill your anus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a judgment call and you let it </v>

3048
02:25:09.091 --> 02:25:10.140
<v Speaker 1>rip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting,</v>

3049
02:25:10.141 --> 02:25:10.974
<v Speaker 1>if you think about how tuned in you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the sensations you get from your </v>

3050
02:25:14.461 --> 02:25:16.920
<v Speaker 1>inner colon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's times you know like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Coming home from the comedy store,</v>

3103
02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:48.500
<v Speaker 5>it's like God damn that song was.</v>

<v Speaker 4>soul and funk and bring it together.</v>

3106
02:27:57.031 --> 02:27:58.920
<v Speaker 4>That to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about it last night.</v>

3107
02:27:58.921 --> 02:28:02.490
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to Dean del Ray about soul</v>

<v Speaker 4>them when they're pound in that fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>seventies,</v>

<v Speaker 3>much music that we're constantly </v>

<v Speaker 8>I think I've mentioned it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's almost like a funk album now.</v>

3123
02:28:50.650 --> 02:28:51.483
<v Speaker 8>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People were expecting a hip hop album </v>

3124
02:28:52.871 --> 02:28:54.130
<v Speaker 8>from because that's what he does </v>
<v Speaker 8>usually,</v>

3125
02:28:54.131 --> 02:28:58.840
<v Speaker 8>but it's a lot of like funkadelic will </v>
<v Speaker 8>basically what you're describing.</v>

3126
02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:00.190
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's really good.</v>

02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:02.340
<v Speaker 8>We sober,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's the concert.</v>

3128
02:29:02.350 --> 02:29:05.860

<v Speaker 8>But I,</v>

02:29:06.130 --> 02:29:08.590
<v Speaker 8>I got the CD recently.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I bought it for my mom for Christmas.</v>

3130
02:29:08.591 --> 02:29:11.590
<v Speaker 8>Do you understand what he just said?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Twelve hundred milligrams of edibles.</v>

3131
02:29:11.591 --> 02:29:12.820
<v Speaker 8>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How much?</v>

3132
02:29:12.850 --> 02:29:15.670
<v Speaker 8>How much is a gummy bear?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I like 20.</v>

3133
02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:18.490
<v Speaker 8>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Up At old Brownie.</v>

3134
02:29:18.491 --> 02:29:20.770
<v Speaker 8>That was a thousand because I knew it </v>
<v Speaker 8>was going to be a crazy concert.</v>

3135
02:29:20.771 --> 02:29:23.290
<v Speaker 8>They did this three d experience,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I was.</v>

3136
02:29:23.291 --> 02:29:24.124
<v Speaker 8>I was going to go in and fight at any </v>
<v Speaker 8>point or it was all was waiting for it </v>

3137
02:29:27.911 --> 02:29:29.530
<v Speaker 8>to hit it never hit.</v>

3138
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:30.600
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the deal.</v>

3139
02:29:30.660 --> 02:29:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Jamie has some weird constitution were </v>
<v Speaker 3>edible.</v>

3140
02:29:33.691 --> 02:29:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Weed doesn't work on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3141
02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agent ever hit?</v>

3142
02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:40.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3143
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>

3144
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:42.570
<v Speaker 3>He's always a little high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

3145
02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:45.660
<v Speaker 3>It was like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his constitution is like a dude who's on</v>

3146
02:29:45.661 --> 02:29:46.494
<v Speaker 3>a low dose of edibles all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think when you give Jamie a high </v>

3147
02:29:49.561 --> 02:29:51.230
<v Speaker 3>dose of vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his body goes,</v>

3148
02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:54.630
<v Speaker 3>I know want to do with this and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body just clears it out of the way.</v>

3149
02:29:54.730 --> 02:29:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work on him.</v>

3150
02:29:56.340 --> 02:29:57.173
<v Speaker 3>He's an alien.</v>

3151
02:29:58.570 --> 02:30:00.160
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He'll be fine.</v>

3152
02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:03.820
<v Speaker 8>Take more than Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's given me plenty and I've done it.</v>

3153
02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:05.950
<v Speaker 8>I like I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he gave me 800 during a show when he was</v>

3154
02:30:05.951 --> 02:30:09.190
<v Speaker 8>on here and I didn't know whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nothing happened.</v>

3155
02:30:09.220 --> 02:30:10.570
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He never gets too high.</v>

3156
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:12.010
<v Speaker 8>But.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But here's the thing.</v>

3157
02:30:12.011 --> 02:30:15.250
<v Speaker 8>He gets high when he smokes it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Super.</v>

3158
02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:16.970
<v Speaker 8>You have to smoke a lot to get high.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3159
02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:17.813
<v Speaker 8>not necessarily.</v>

3160
02:30:18.210 --> 02:30:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Totally normal in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3161
02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:21.353
<v Speaker 3>Like normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we were all sitting around </v>

3162
02:30:22.351 --> 02:30:23.184
<v Speaker 3>passing a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would hit it the same amount as </v>

3163
02:30:24.421 --> 02:30:25.254
<v Speaker 3>everybody else would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just we all be looking at each other </v>

3164
02:30:26.191 --> 02:30:27.024
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3165
02:30:27.570 --> 02:30:30.030
<v Speaker 3>there's been many a podcast we've done </v>
<v Speaker 3>including the beginning of this one.</v>

3166
02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:32.040
<v Speaker 3>More as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it starts out,</v>

3167
02:30:32.041 --> 02:30:32.581
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

3168
02:30:32.581 --> 02:30:34.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if I should be talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

3169
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:35.833
<v Speaker 3>I'm barely holding out of the words as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're coming out of my mouth and </v>

3170
02:30:39.210 --> 02:30:43.410
<v Speaker 3>forming them in the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like their little fucking clay kids</v>

3171
02:30:43.411 --> 02:30:45.370
<v Speaker 3>that are running out of my mouth and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to like form.</v>

3172
02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:46.320
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put your hat on.</v>

3173
02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:53.040
<v Speaker 3>So barbecued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you upside down this new weed?</v>

3174
02:30:53.191 --> 02:30:56.670
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be getting stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This a la speed.</v>

3175
02:30:56.671 --> 02:30:58.830
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what's going on.</v>

3176
02:30:58.970 --> 02:31:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Like since legalization hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like the weed went up a bump,</v>

3177
02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:03.760
<v Speaker 3>like pumped</v>

3178
02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:06.740
<v Speaker 8>or maybe ask for less,</v>
<v Speaker 8>less than strong lead.</v>

3179
02:31:06.741 --> 02:31:09.410
<v Speaker 8>Like I wanted back in like whatever I </v>
<v Speaker 8>was getting back in Ohio,</v>

3180
02:31:09.411 --> 02:31:10.930
<v Speaker 8>like middle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mid,</v>

3181
02:31:10.970 --> 02:31:13.700
<v Speaker 8>we'd call mids.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just wanted to go back to the middle.</v>

3182
02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:15.920
<v Speaker 8>He just gave me something that was like </v>
<v Speaker 8>$5 cheaper.</v>

3183
02:31:15.921 --> 02:31:16.221
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3184
02:31:16.221 --> 02:31:18.580
<v Speaker 8>that's not what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wanted what your shit.</v>

3185
02:31:18.581 --> 02:31:19.620
<v Speaker 8>He basically</v>

3186
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:21.110
<v Speaker 5>mild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even have it.</v>

3187
02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:22.001
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3188
02:31:22.001 --> 02:31:22.834
<v Speaker 5>you just got to take a little baby hits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is everybody likes </v>

3189
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:27.420
<v Speaker 5>taking a couple of hits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I that's part of the fun.</v>

3190
02:31:27.700 --> 02:31:28.533
<v Speaker 5>She'll take a couple hits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like last night at the comedy store </v>

3191
02:31:31.871 --> 02:31:34.170
<v Speaker 5>I went way too far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Way Too.</v>

3192
02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:35.490
<v Speaker 5>How many hits is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only.</v>

3193
02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:36.383
<v Speaker 5>I never get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try not to get too high before the </v>

3194
02:31:37.921 --> 02:31:40.440
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I never get as high as I got before</v>

3195
02:31:40.441 --> 02:31:41.274
<v Speaker 5>this show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Before I stand up show I'd like to be </v>

3196
02:31:43.020 --> 02:31:43.853
<v Speaker 5>right where I am now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I was high a couple of hours ago </v>

3197
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:48.660
<v Speaker 5>and then go on stage if that's the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best way to do it.</v>

3198
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:51.750
<v Speaker 5>But afterwards everybody was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>passing joints around.</v>

3199
02:31:51.751 --> 02:31:52.584
<v Speaker 5>It's just since it's legal now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody just goes out and they're all </v>

3200
02:31:54.571 --> 02:31:55.770
<v Speaker 5>just passing joints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey man,</v>

3201
02:31:55.771 --> 02:31:56.710

<v Speaker 5>And Ron White with his contraptions.</v>

3203
02:31:59.850 --> 02:32:02.010
<v Speaker 5>He's got the fucking pen.</v>

3277
02:35:01.210 --> 02:35:04.330

<v Speaker 5>You have to like review stats and stuff?</v>

3278
02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Most of the prep I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just do naturally,</v>

3279
02:35:06.910 --> 02:35:07.743
<v Speaker 5>believe it or not because I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 5>curious about the fights because I know </v>

3280
02:35:09.461 --> 02:35:12.120
<v Speaker 5>they're coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like we did a breakdown show on,</v>

3281
02:35:12.121 --> 02:35:13.690
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monday.</v>

3282
02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:15.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on Monday we did a breakdown show.</v>

3283
02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:18.580
<v Speaker 5>We went over the card and I'll do more </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that on my own,</v>

3284
02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:21.900
<v Speaker 5>but it's not like anybody asked me to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it's not like I'm,</v>

3285
02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:23.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing it because I want to do it.</v>

3286
02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:24.633
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing it because it enhances my </v>

3287
02:35:25.631 --> 02:35:28.810
<v Speaker 5>appreciation of the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find out a little bit about each dude,</v>

3288
02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:30.820
<v Speaker 5>watch a few of his old fights go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

3289
02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:32.920
<v Speaker 5>I like how he does this or look how she </v>
<v Speaker 5>does that.</v>

3290
02:35:32.921 --> 02:35:34.510
<v Speaker 5>Or Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's got a good one,</v>

3291
02:35:34.511 --> 02:35:35.590
<v Speaker 5>good position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you get,</v>

3292
02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:37.340
<v Speaker 5>he gets you in this position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He finished his guys.</v>

3293
02:35:38.050 --> 02:35:40.480
<v Speaker 5>So it's fun to do it from that </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective.</v>

3294
02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:42.400
<v Speaker 5>So then when I'm watching the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3295
02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:43.243
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got a kind of an understanding of </v>

3296
02:35:44.291 --> 02:35:45.880
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least how they used to move,</v>

3297
02:35:45.881 --> 02:35:47.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six months ago or a year ago.</v>

3298
02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:51.610
<v Speaker 5>People get better quick too is the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird thing about this world.</v>

3299
02:35:52.090 --> 02:35:52.923
<v Speaker 5>The MMA world is changing so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The like the level of athlete is moving </v>

3300
02:35:55.931 --> 02:35:56.764
<v Speaker 5>in such a fast direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guys keep getting better and </v>

3301
02:35:58.301 --> 02:36:01.330
<v Speaker 5>better and better and better and better </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're all getting better,</v>

3302
02:36:01.331 --> 02:36:02.164
<v Speaker 5>so it's hard to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you can pair like a top level </v>

3303
02:36:04.811 --> 02:36:07.630
<v Speaker 5>athlete of today versus a top level </v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete have,</v>

3304
02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:09.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 years ago,</v>

3305
02:36:09.341 --> 02:36:12.790
<v Speaker 5>that's when you see these stark gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 5>differences.</v>

3306
02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:14.013
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the UFC started in [inaudible] 93 </v>

3307
02:36:15.341 --> 02:36:19.690
<v Speaker 5>in comparison to 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just stark crazy differences,</v>

3308
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:23.170
<v Speaker 5>which you're not going to see guys stay </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the top as long you think,</v>

3309
02:36:23.350 --> 02:36:25.420
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some guys or some girls can,</v>

3310
02:36:25.421 --> 02:36:26.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on how good they are,</v>

3311
02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:29.860
<v Speaker 5>some people just have massive advantages</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are very difficult to overcome.</v>

3312
02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:31.750
<v Speaker 5>Like Anderson Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was in his prime,</v>

3313
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:33.063
<v Speaker 5>Anderson Silva had a massive advantage </v>
<v Speaker 5>in timing and speed and creativity and </v>

3314
02:36:36.671 --> 02:36:37.504
<v Speaker 5>striking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas he could defend himself on the </v>

3315
02:36:39.131 --> 02:36:39.964
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was difficult to take down and when </v>

3316
02:36:41.171 --> 02:36:42.004
<v Speaker 5>he got him down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's pretty good defensively with his </v>

3317
02:36:43.001 --> 02:36:46.270
<v Speaker 5>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but standing up he's a goddamn genius.</v>

3318
02:36:46.271 --> 02:36:50.130
<v Speaker 5>He was a virtuoso and he would just like</v>
<v Speaker 5>move on you and do weird shit to you.</v>

3319
02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:53.610
<v Speaker 5>And then blam catch you with a front </v>
<v Speaker 5>kick to the face or something.</v>

3320
02:36:54.450 --> 02:36:55.283
<v Speaker 5>He would time you figure you out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find your distance and then land some </v>

3321
02:36:58.091 --> 02:36:59.470
<v Speaker 5>crazy shit on you and fuck you up.</v>

3322
02:36:59.470 --> 02:37:00.303
<v Speaker 5>And it did it to so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when a guy like that I was at the </v>

3323
02:37:02.381 --> 02:37:03.214
<v Speaker 5>top,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's so truly exceptional at one </v>

3324
02:37:05.021 --> 02:37:07.300
<v Speaker 5>particular aspect of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the game.</v>

3325
02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:09.490
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times they can go on a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>run,</v>

3326
02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:11.291
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

3327
02:37:11.291 --> 02:37:12.880
<v Speaker 5>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for people to go on a run like</v>

3328
02:37:12.881 --> 02:37:13.714
<v Speaker 5>demetrius mighty mouse Johnson's </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably on like the longest run as a </v>

3329
02:37:16.191 --> 02:37:20.000
<v Speaker 5>champion now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think on the longest run the most wins</v>

3330
02:37:20.001 --> 02:37:20.920
<v Speaker 5>as a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's,</v>

3331
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:25.400
<v Speaker 5>he might be like right up there with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Anderson in the most wins.</v>

3332
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:26.960
<v Speaker 5>And then maybe John Jones is in there </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

3333
02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:27.953
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is he?</v>

3334
02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:30.320
<v Speaker 5>He's the smallest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's won 25.</v>

3335
02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:32.010
<v Speaker 5>He's a flyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's a,</v>

3336
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:33.163
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's the best pound for pound guy </v>

3337
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:36.103
<v Speaker 5>because if you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely smaller than the other </v>

3338
02:37:38.391 --> 02:37:39.224
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't move differently because </v>

3339
02:37:39.981 --> 02:37:42.020
<v Speaker 5>he's not so way down by gravity.</v>

3340
02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:42.853
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult to like look at his </v>

3341
02:37:44.151 --> 02:37:47.680
<v Speaker 5>movements and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you could compare him to a guy like</v>

3342
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:49.580
<v Speaker 5>for Overdo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was 240 pounds,</v>

3343
02:37:49.581 --> 02:37:52.550
<v Speaker 5>like for Breesa was just more hampered </v>
<v Speaker 5>down by gravity.</v>

3344
02:37:52.551 --> 02:37:55.100
<v Speaker 5>Like his body just has to push around so</v>
<v Speaker 5>much more.</v>

3345
02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:56.113
<v Speaker 5>There's no way he can move with the kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fluidity that I got like mighty </v>

3346
02:37:58.491 --> 02:37:59.324
<v Speaker 5>mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ken.</v>

3347
02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:02.600
<v Speaker 5>And what's the biggest guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That mighty mouse will fight?</v>

3348
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:03.463
<v Speaker 5>Anderson Silva 10 fight win streak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Demetrius Johnson is at eight right </v>

3349
02:38:06.321 --> 02:38:08.570
<v Speaker 5>below George St Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is at nine at night now.</v>

3350
02:38:08.571 --> 02:38:10.310
<v Speaker 5>I think this is as of July.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh okay.</v>

3351
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:12.440
<v Speaker 5>So Demetrius defended his title again </v>
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>

3352
02:38:12.441 --> 02:38:14.570
<v Speaker 5>So he's tied with George St Pierre for </v>
<v Speaker 5>second place.</v>

3353
02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:18.260
<v Speaker 5>So that's like a guy like Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect example,</v>

3354
02:38:18.261 --> 02:38:19.700
<v Speaker 5>super tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Jones,</v>

3355
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:20.930
<v Speaker 5>another one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect example.</v>

3356
02:38:20.931 --> 02:38:21.764
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones is a ridiculously talented </v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete and so like when you have these </v>

3357
02:38:25.041 --> 02:38:25.874
<v Speaker 5>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really talented guys like extreme </v>

3358
02:38:27.231 --> 02:38:28.370
<v Speaker 5>outliers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3359
02:38:28.371 --> 02:38:31.430
<v Speaker 5>they tend to be able to go on roles also</v>
<v Speaker 5>because when you fight them,</v>

3360
02:38:31.431 --> 02:38:32.264
<v Speaker 5>it's terrifying because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're stepping in there with the Alpha </v>

3361
02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:35.653
<v Speaker 5>who's stepping in there with Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 5>Silva and his prime and he bows to you </v>

3362
02:38:37.761 --> 02:38:39.230
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

3363
02:38:39.231 --> 02:38:40.970
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck have I gotten myself into?</v>

3364
02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:43.190
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3365
02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:46.070
<v Speaker 5>you can pump yourself up for it and get </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself thinking like,</v>

3366
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:47.023
<v Speaker 5>I'm the fucking man now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like when you actually across the </v>

3367
02:38:49.041 --> 02:38:52.400
<v Speaker 5>street from the man and you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>at each other eye to eye and you realize</v>

3368
02:38:52.401 --> 02:38:56.780
<v Speaker 5>like that's Anderson motherfucking Silva</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm about to step into the ring,</v>

3369
02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:00.170
<v Speaker 5>step into the octagon rather with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best ever.</v>

3370
02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:02.660
<v Speaker 5>He do enhanced sit on the edge of a tall</v>
<v Speaker 5>building,</v>

3371
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:05.023
<v Speaker 5>so it's hard for them to get over that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes a super strong mind just to be </v>

3372
02:39:08.061 --> 02:39:12.050
<v Speaker 5>able to fight at your best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not your best is good enough.</v>

3373
02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:12.973
<v Speaker 5>That's another aspect of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not your best is good enough </v>

3374
02:39:16.011 --> 02:39:19.340
<v Speaker 5>is really secondary because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be able to be at your best.</v>

3375
02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.130
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be so freaked out and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking nervous.</v>

3376
02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:23.600
<v Speaker 5>Your timing's going to be off.</v>

3377
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:26.180
<v Speaker 5>Your adrenaline is going to be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>pumping through your veins.</v>

3378
02:39:26.181 --> 02:39:27.014
<v Speaker 5>You might get an adrenaline dump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you might tie her out in the second </v>

3379
02:39:28.641 --> 02:39:31.190
<v Speaker 5>round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to manage your resources.</v>

3380
02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:35.200
<v Speaker 5>You got to manage your anxiety and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>facing a goddamned engine,</v>

3381
02:39:35.390 --> 02:39:36.223
<v Speaker 5>like a real live superhero character and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's seeing all of those weaknesses in </v>

3382
02:39:40.641 --> 02:39:42.410
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He sees everything.</v>

3383
02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:45.230
<v Speaker 5>He sees everything too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you start moving around,</v>

3384
02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:46.513
<v Speaker 5>when you would move around with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had moved around with you and he </v>

3385
02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:50.330
<v Speaker 5>would see how you move,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether they move slow,</v>

3386
02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:51.433
<v Speaker 5>like he would take his time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would take his time and then just </v>

3387
02:39:53.061 --> 02:39:55.730
<v Speaker 5>open up on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating to watch him,</v>

3388
02:39:55.731 --> 02:39:57.530
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he would dissect guys.</v>

3389
02:39:57.740 --> 02:39:58.573
<v Speaker 5>You'd see him dissect and guys he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>bouncing around and move and he would </v>

3390
02:40:00.891 --> 02:40:01.724
<v Speaker 5>change his footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would like throw a little fake your </v>

3391
02:40:03.261 --> 02:40:05.000
<v Speaker 5>way and see how you react to you.</v>

3392
02:40:05.010 --> 02:40:06.590
<v Speaker 5>I could have hit you right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3393
02:40:06.890 --> 02:40:07.723
<v Speaker 5>I see what's going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you do some stuff at him and </v>

3394
02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:09.910
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3395
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:10.743
<v Speaker 5>not today with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you would see him doing all these </v>

3396
02:40:13.891 --> 02:40:14.724
<v Speaker 5>calculations in his mind and setting up </v>
<v Speaker 5>traps and then somewhere in the second </v>

3397
02:40:18.421 --> 02:40:21.090
<v Speaker 5>round he would attack and when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 5>his prime,</v>

3398
02:40:21.091 --> 02:40:24.360
<v Speaker 5>it was just stunning to behold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here he is right now,</v>

3399
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:27.090
<v Speaker 5>hood a standing in front of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hands down,</v>

3400
02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:29.140
<v Speaker 5>and he just barely moves his head out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way.</v>

3401
02:40:29.141 --> 02:40:29.974
<v Speaker 5>It's just timing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to figure out then Plop </v>

3402
02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:35.970
<v Speaker 5>pop some with a jab and drops him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3403
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.730
<v Speaker 5>you're watching all this in slow motion </v>
<v Speaker 5>to unfortunately,</v>

3404
02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:40.840
<v Speaker 5>but this was when he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should Okami.</v>

3405
02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:43.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was just an assassin back </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

3406
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:44.063
<v Speaker 5>He was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when he was the middleweight </v>

3407
02:40:45.270 --> 02:40:48.990
<v Speaker 5>champion and he was just a lighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>people up in there.</v>

3408
02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:51.140
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're a guy guy,</v>

3409
02:40:51.250 --> 02:40:54.300
<v Speaker 5>get up because he's better on his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't give a fuck dude.</v>

3410
02:40:54.450 --> 02:40:56.670
<v Speaker 5>Go to Anderson Silva highlight reel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if you could find that.</v>

3411
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.943
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give a fuck if you were on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your feet like you were going to get </v>

3412
02:41:00.181 --> 02:41:02.970
<v Speaker 5>knocked out against him in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's his attitude.</v>

3413
02:41:02.971 --> 02:41:04.620
<v Speaker 5>He would stand with anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3414
02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:07.560
<v Speaker 5>his standup was so exceptional,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's still fighting.</v>

3415
02:41:07.710 --> 02:41:08.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's still fighting,</v>

3416
02:41:08.491 --> 02:41:13.050
<v Speaker 5>but he's 40,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40 or 41 now and that's the only fucking</v>

3417
02:41:13.051 --> 02:41:15.000
<v Speaker 5>thing in the world that's undefeated.</v>

02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:21.440

<v Speaker 5>just slides out of the way and drops out</v>

3420
02:41:21.991 --> 02:41:25.740
<v Speaker 5>dude with a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he just had a way of moving.</v>

3421
02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:30.030
<v Speaker 5>Let's just see if you have a like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>highlight reel.</v>

3422
02:41:30.031 --> 02:41:32.420

3425
02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:37.950

<v Speaker 5>times in a row.</v>

3426
02:41:38.250 --> 02:41:40.950
<v Speaker 5>This guy had a real good chance to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>some travis luder.</v>

3427
02:41:41.490 --> 02:41:42.840
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of people that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>fought.</v>

3428
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:45.630
<v Speaker 5>They're showing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was so goddamn good.</v>

3429
02:41:45.631 --> 02:41:48.180
<v Speaker 5>That's Travis Luder caught in a triangle</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting elbowed in the head.</v>

3430
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:54.120
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at that time in particular,</v>

3431
02:41:54.121 --> 02:41:54.954
<v Speaker 5>he was the next level of striking </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we had never seen anybody who </v>

3432
02:41:59.251 --> 02:42:04.251
<v Speaker 5>had like real world class striking </v>
<v Speaker 5>skills in the middleweight division like</v>

3433
02:42:05.341 --> 02:42:06.540
<v Speaker 5>Anderson did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just had,</v>

3434
02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:08.560
<v Speaker 5>especially in particularly in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>striking,</v>

3435
02:42:08.570 --> 02:42:13.570
<v Speaker 5>just grounded his balance is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While he was just exceptional,</v>

3436
02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:17.130
<v Speaker 5>truly exceptional and physically strong </v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

3437
02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:20.340
<v Speaker 5>But the big thing about Anderson wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>like how big he was.</v>

3438
02:42:20.341 --> 02:42:23.670
<v Speaker 5>It was just how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how technical it was and how,</v>

3439
02:42:23.671 --> 02:42:25.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how brilliant his uh,</v>

3440
02:42:25.681 --> 02:42:26.860
<v Speaker 5>ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3441
02:42:26.910 --> 02:42:27.743
<v Speaker 5>figure guys out was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was the guy he fought named Lee </v>

3442
02:42:31.330 --> 02:42:32.163
<v Speaker 5>Marie Lee Marie is the guy who put on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest bank robbery in the history </v>

3443
02:42:34.981 --> 02:42:35.814
<v Speaker 5>of the great of Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy stole hundreds of millions of </v>

3444
02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:40.013
<v Speaker 5>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>allegedly from a bank and is in jail I </v>

3445
02:42:41.971 --> 02:42:44.250
<v Speaker 5>think in Morocco now because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

3446
02:42:44.251 --> 02:42:46.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was an assassin to and they to meetup</v>

3447
02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:48.660
<v Speaker 5>and Anderson Silva lit them on fire.</v>

3448
02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:51.390
<v Speaker 5>Just fucked him up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just stood right in front of them.</v>

3449
02:42:51.450 --> 02:42:52.770
<v Speaker 5>Lead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kick the shit out of him,</v>

3450
02:42:52.980 --> 02:42:54.510
<v Speaker 5>beat his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>took his best shots.</v>

3451
02:42:54.930 --> 02:42:57.210
<v Speaker 5>He was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you friends with Silva?</v>

3452
02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I know him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see him.</v>

3453
02:42:58.291 --> 02:42:59.124
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't speak English that good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I always give him a hug when I see </v>

3454
02:43:01.201 --> 02:43:02.130
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a very nice guy.</v>

3455
02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

3456
02:43:04.141 --> 02:43:06.780
<v Speaker 5>it's the greatest of all time if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>a fan of the sport in my opinion,</v>

3457
02:43:06.781 --> 02:43:08.940
<v Speaker 5>like that guy when he was in his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whatever.</v>

3458
02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 5>There's like a few year period where </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone exist at the highest</v>

3459
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:15.010
<v Speaker 3>of our pms and when he was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest of our pms,</v>

3460
02:43:15.011 --> 02:43:15.844
<v Speaker 3>the argument is really between him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe fate or a million Eiko who fought </v>

3461
02:43:19.481 --> 02:43:21.190
<v Speaker 3>in pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3462
02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I think fate or is a real possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could,</v>

3463
02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I definitely could see the argument that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was number one instead of Anderson.</v>

3464
02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:30.513
<v Speaker 3>But it's really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows they play on </v>

3465
02:43:31.810 --> 02:43:33.760
<v Speaker 3>different organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different people,</v>

3466
02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:34.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

3467
02:43:34.611 --> 02:43:38.140
<v Speaker 3>the talent level probably a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>better in the UFC,</v>

3468
02:43:38.141 --> 02:43:42.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's arguable that it wasn't because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was fighting cro cop in his prime and</v>

3469
02:43:42.731 --> 02:43:43.564
<v Speaker 3>Nogueira in his prime and he it fade or </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought some of the all time greats at </v>

3470
02:43:47.181 --> 02:43:48.014
<v Speaker 3>their best and beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's arguable that he fought a </v>

3471
02:43:50.561 --> 02:43:51.394
<v Speaker 3>tougher range of opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe it's arguable that fate or his </v>

3472
02:43:54.251 --> 02:43:55.084
<v Speaker 3>accomplishments or more impressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the opposition he fought was </v>

3473
02:43:57.881 --> 02:43:59.350
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more dangerous.</v>

3474
02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:01.120
<v Speaker 3>And I fought cro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cop cro,</v>

3475
02:44:01.121 --> 02:44:02.730
<v Speaker 3>cop was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an assassin,</v>

3476
02:44:02.750 --> 02:44:03.583
<v Speaker 3>just smashing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocking everybody dead and he walked </v>

3477
02:44:05.261 --> 02:44:09.700
<v Speaker 3>him down and out kickbox them mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's mostly what the fight was about.</v>

3478
02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:10.753
<v Speaker 4>So when you get to know these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm sure you're more friendly with </v>

3479
02:44:13.011 --> 02:44:16.880
<v Speaker 4>some than others do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that hard to affect your,</v>

3480
02:44:16.881 --> 02:44:19.350
<v Speaker 4>the way you call the fights in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3481
02:44:20.140 --> 02:44:20.973
<v Speaker 4>being critical?</v>

3482
02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:23.840
<v Speaker 3>It can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try not to make it though.</v>

3483
02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:28.570
<v Speaker 3>I try really hard to be as objective as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>

3484
02:44:28.571 --> 02:44:29.404
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying and sometimes people</v>
<v Speaker 3>get upset like that I'm friends with </v>

3485
02:44:31.850 --> 02:44:32.683
<v Speaker 3>because I'm talking about things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing wrong or things that are </v>

3486
02:44:34.971 --> 02:44:35.804
<v Speaker 3>going wrong for them and so they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that I'm rooting against them and </v>

3487
02:44:39.411 --> 02:44:39.801
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3488
02:44:39.801 --> 02:44:41.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll say something to you back.</v>

3489
02:44:41.430 --> 02:44:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have conversations with them.</v>

3490
02:44:42.621 --> 02:44:43.071
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3491
02:44:43.071 --> 02:44:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I am not rooting against like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm seeing.</v>

3492
02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:47.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing this like I'm seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3493
02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I know you're thinking that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning this part of the fight or you're</v>

3494
02:44:50.511 --> 02:44:53.120
<v Speaker 3>thinking that I'm being hypercritical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to say it.</v>

3495
02:44:53.121 --> 02:44:57.770
<v Speaker 3>If I'm seeing it and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try really hard to have a point like I</v>

3496
02:44:57.771 --> 02:44:59.270
<v Speaker 3>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a critical person.</v>

3497
02:44:59.270 --> 02:45:04.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm like mocking someone for no reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>or did a talking in a negative way about</v>

3498
02:45:05.721 --> 02:45:08.210
<v Speaker 3>their technique for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only because it's not,</v>

3499
02:45:08.330 --> 02:45:09.163
<v Speaker 3>it's not happening and I want everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>to know the momentum of the fight and </v>

3500
02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:14.630
<v Speaker 3>also I want to know what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong.</v>

3501
02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Like so because your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your job as a commentator is not just to</v>

3502
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:22.490
<v Speaker 3>to say what's happening and talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening,</v>

3503
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:23.623
<v Speaker 3>but in mma it's also to explain things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have to explain certain things </v>

3504
02:45:27.890 --> 02:45:32.480
<v Speaker 3>like that are critical in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like save someone gets kicked in the leg</v>

3505
02:45:32.481 --> 02:45:34.400
<v Speaker 3>really hard a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see them start to limp on it.</v>

3506
02:45:34.401 --> 02:45:36.440
<v Speaker 3>I have to point out that I see him </v>
<v Speaker 3>limping now.</v>

3507
02:45:36.441 --> 02:45:37.274
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he tries to shoot in or if he wants </v>

3508
02:45:39.561 --> 02:45:41.630
<v Speaker 3>to move away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to hinder his mobility.</v>

3509
02:45:41.630 --> 02:45:44.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the people at home now they go,</v>

3510
02:45:44.121 --> 02:45:45.410
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that makes sense.</v>

3511
02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:46.011
<v Speaker 3>Oh Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3512
02:45:46.011 --> 02:45:47.600
<v Speaker 3>that guy is limping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

3513
02:45:47.601 --> 02:45:49.820
<v Speaker 3>He got hit in that same spot again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's on the ground again.</v>

3514
02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't get up.</v>

3515
02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:52.020
<v Speaker 3>I see it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3516
02:45:52.350 --> 02:45:55.160
<v Speaker 3>you know you're a storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also,</v>

3517
02:45:55.730 --> 02:45:56.563
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a mathematical </v>

3518
02:45:58.281 --> 02:46:01.340
<v Speaker 3>problem essentially a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's being duped out.</v>

3519
02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Like there's literally like force </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

3520
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:08.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like this versus this and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get there.</v>

3521
02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:12.050
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to hit harder in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>better positions,</v>

3522
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:13.003
<v Speaker 3>so like the geometry of the human body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to accelerate towards the </v>

3523
02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:19.790
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable areas and do it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are the best ways to do that?</v>

3524
02:46:19.791 --> 02:46:23.420
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a science and art </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind doing it in the best way.</v>

3525
02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:27.740
<v Speaker 3>And it's my job to explain that science </v>
<v Speaker 3>and art to the best.</v>

3526
02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I can live in motion while it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

3527
02:46:31.180 --> 02:46:34.250
<v Speaker 3>I can't be biased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try very hard to not be,</v>

3528
02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:35.433
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's really important that I </v>

3529
02:46:35.961 --> 02:46:36.794
<v Speaker 3>point out both sides and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who accuse you of it and I swear </v>

3530
02:46:39.561 --> 02:46:40.121
<v Speaker 3>to God if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3531
02:46:40.121 --> 02:46:43.550
<v Speaker 3>if you do feel that I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is absolutely not intentional.</v>

3532
02:46:43.730 --> 02:46:44.563
<v Speaker 3>I try very hard to try to be as balanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>and unbiased as I can walk splaining </v>

3533
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:53.150
<v Speaker 3>exactly what I see playing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with my friends.</v>

3534
02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll see my friend getting fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and I'm like,</v>

3535
02:46:56.261 --> 02:46:57.530
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't drop that right hand.</v>

3536
02:46:57.710 --> 02:46:58.543
<v Speaker 3>He's driving that right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy stepping to the right and he's </v>

3537
02:47:00.141 --> 02:47:01.340
<v Speaker 3>going to catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>

3538
02:47:01.341 --> 02:47:02.690
<v Speaker 3>when they catch them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fuck,</v>

3539
02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:06.080
<v Speaker 3>like you see it happening sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they can see it.</v>

3540
02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Does that ever affect how close you let </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself get to a fighter?</v>

3541
02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:10.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3542
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:12.710
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I respect them all very deeply.</v>

3543
02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:13.311
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3544
02:47:13.311 --> 02:47:14.000
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3545
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:14.833
<v Speaker 3>I'm really good friends with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and I want the best for all of </v>

3546
02:47:18.231 --> 02:47:19.550
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that sounds contradictory.</v>

3547
02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:20.384
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone will think like if they </v>

3548
02:47:22.101 --> 02:47:25.130
<v Speaker 3>fight that person and they hate that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and you like that person,</v>

3549
02:47:25.131 --> 02:47:26.540
<v Speaker 3>but you like them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

3550
02:47:26.610 --> 02:47:28.360
<v Speaker 3>you're a trader or something or like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3551
02:47:28.430 --> 02:47:30.920
<v Speaker 3>How can you talk to that person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you talk to him?</v>

3552
02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.900
<v Speaker 3>He's my mortal enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>

3553
02:47:32.901 --> 02:47:33.734
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the fact that you guys are </v>

3554
02:47:35.121 --> 02:47:36.860
<v Speaker 3>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of is real,</v>

3555
02:47:36.861 --> 02:47:40.460
<v Speaker 3>how much of it you do it for press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not happy with it.</v>

3556
02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:42.770
<v Speaker 3>But I liked the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a good guy.</v>

3557
02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:44.150
<v Speaker 3>The guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be friends with,</v>

3558
02:47:44.151 --> 02:47:45.380
<v Speaker 3>somebody that you're not friends with.</v>

3559
02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have some guy that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>

3560
02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:49.820
<v Speaker 3>you would have to have a good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3561
02:47:49.821 --> 02:47:52.220
<v Speaker 3>like somebody fucked you over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't be like a competitive reason.</v>

3562
02:47:52.221 --> 02:47:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Like two guys who fought and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitter about it,</v>

3563
02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if it was like if you told me about</v>

3564
02:47:56.841 --> 02:47:59.330
<v Speaker 3>some guy fucked you over and a business </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal or something like that,</v>

3565
02:47:59.331 --> 02:48:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well fuck that guy.</v>

3566
02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:03.110
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy did something wrong.</v>

3567
02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:04.133
<v Speaker 3>It's just a competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that fucking guy I tried to follow </v>

3568
02:48:06.611 --> 02:48:08.420
<v Speaker 3>in Miami and I bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck him.</v>

3569
02:48:08.421 --> 02:48:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3570
02:48:09.430 --> 02:48:10.690
<v Speaker 3>like I kicked your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3571
02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:12.170
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's with a lot of fighters,</v>

3572
02:48:12.171 --> 02:48:13.004
<v Speaker 3>they develop these very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these deeply sort of conflicting </v>

3573
02:48:18.741 --> 02:48:19.574
<v Speaker 3>relationships with fellow fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't get too close to them </v>

3574
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:23.510
<v Speaker 3>because then you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight them or.</v>

3575
02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys don't give a fuck.</v>

3576
02:48:25.401 --> 02:48:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Some guys become friends with guys than </v>
<v Speaker 3>wind up fighting him.</v>

3577
02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:29.173
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is there any shay stories of that </v>

3578
02:48:31.041 --> 02:48:32.210
<v Speaker 3>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys,</v>

3579
02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:33.073
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys have done a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started out friends and then </v>

3580
02:48:35.421 --> 02:48:38.310
<v Speaker 3>because they had a fight each other like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones and Rashad Evans,</v>

3581
02:48:38.311 --> 02:48:40.910
<v Speaker 3>that was a big story like Rashad Evans </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like Jon Jones,</v>

3582
02:48:40.911 --> 02:48:41.744
<v Speaker 3>bigger older brother and they were real </v>
<v Speaker 3>close and then when John fought for the </v>

3583
02:48:45.531 --> 02:48:46.364
<v Speaker 3>title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fought for the title because Rashad </v>

3584
02:48:47.090 --> 02:48:50.690
<v Speaker 3>was injured and John won the title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John stepped in on short notice,</v>

3585
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:51.783
<v Speaker 3>one the title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it became a possibility of one </v>

3586
02:48:53.631 --> 02:48:54.464
<v Speaker 3>day Rashad fighting John for the title </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they wound up getting super </v>

3587
02:48:58.671 --> 02:49:00.980
<v Speaker 3>bitter about it and not liking each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other anymore.</v>

3588
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:02.840
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting to watch,</v>

3589
02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:06.290
<v Speaker 3>but that's just one example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guys who are close,</v>

3590
02:49:06.350 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 3>close guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're buddies</v>

3591
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:08.813
<v Speaker 5>with each other and they get in there </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they beat the fuck out of each </v>

3592
02:49:09.871 --> 02:49:10.650
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3593
02:49:10.650 --> 02:49:13.710
<v Speaker 9>it's crazy and not get close.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like with Comedians,</v>

3594
02:49:13.711 --> 02:49:14.544
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you talked about hanging out at the </v>

3595
02:49:14.851 --> 02:49:15.720
<v Speaker 9>store.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

3596
02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:19.500
<v Speaker 9>I can't talk like somebody was telling </v>
<v Speaker 9>me about,</v>

3597
02:49:19.501 --> 02:49:22.140
<v Speaker 9>like he hates being called a legend who </v>
<v Speaker 9>said that.</v>

3598
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:24.540
<v Speaker 9>I'm not gonna say Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 9>zero legend.</v>

3599
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:26.880
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh Dawn Gavin.</v>

3600
02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:28.820
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

3601
02:49:29.070 --> 02:49:32.760
<v Speaker 9>and the point was,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well I don't want to know,</v>

3602
02:49:32.850 --> 02:49:35.280
<v Speaker 9>just telling me it was Ron White,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh ha.</v>

3603
02:49:35.410 --> 02:49:37.700
<v Speaker 9>And I and he is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he's alleging is legit,</v>

3604
02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:38.573
<v Speaker 9>but I think he got,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he got an intro of being a legend the </v>

3605
02:49:40.291 --> 02:49:43.320
<v Speaker 9>other night you were saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I fucking hate that because you know,</v>

3606
02:49:43.350 --> 02:49:45.510
<v Speaker 9>I'm in here scrap and like everybody </v>
<v Speaker 9>else,</v>

3607
02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:47.250
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>these lineups are killed.</v>

3608
02:49:47.251 --> 02:49:48.780
<v Speaker 9>Like the lineup the other night was </v>
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>

3609
02:49:48.990 --> 02:49:49.823
<v Speaker 9>it was like Dalea and you and him and a </v>
<v Speaker 9>nick and succeed and it's like on any </v>

3610
02:49:55.411 --> 02:49:56.244
<v Speaker 9>given night you don't want to be called </v>
<v Speaker 9>the legend because that's just </v>

3611
02:49:57.721 --> 02:50:01.140
<v Speaker 9>immediately puts you on a shelf instead </v>
<v Speaker 9>of in the fight.</v>

3612
02:50:01.770 --> 02:50:04.830
<v Speaker 9>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he said that to me and the reason I want</v>

3613
02:50:04.831 --> 02:50:09.060
<v Speaker 9>to say it is I could see somebody taking</v>
<v Speaker 9>that into context and going like,</v>

3614
02:50:09.210 --> 02:50:11.010
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you hate being called alleged.</v>

3615
02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:12.113
<v Speaker 9>But it's like I can.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've been called that by young comics </v>

3616
02:50:14.851 --> 02:50:15.684
<v Speaker 9>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>don't call me a fucking legend because </v>

3617
02:50:18.270 --> 02:50:18.841
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>first of all,</v>

3618
02:50:18.841 --> 02:50:20.100
<v Speaker 9>I didn't earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And second of all,</v>

3619
02:50:20.101 --> 02:50:24.300
<v Speaker 9>like I'm still playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm still on the roster here,</v>

3620
02:50:25.650 --> 02:50:26.483
<v Speaker 9>but I was just thinking like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 9>have that conversation with somebody </v>

3621
02:50:28.321 --> 02:50:32.790
<v Speaker 9>who's not doing what we do because it </v>
<v Speaker 9>would almost sound like a,</v>

3622
02:50:33.090 --> 02:50:36.000
<v Speaker 9>like you're full of yourself and it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>same thing with fighters.</v>

3623
02:50:36.001 --> 02:50:39.690
<v Speaker 9>It's probably things that they can only </v>
<v Speaker 9>talk to each other about that they could</v>

3624
02:50:39.691 --> 02:50:42.630
<v Speaker 9>never talk to straight people about it </v>
<v Speaker 9>because they just haven't been there.</v>

3625
02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:43.733
<v Speaker 9>Oh for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So how do you not get close to other </v>

3626
02:50:44.791 --> 02:50:46.650
<v Speaker 9>fighters that you might have to have to </v>
<v Speaker 9>fight one day?</v>

3627
02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:49.020
<v Speaker 5>Especially when there's a lot of guys in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same way,</v>

3628
02:50:49.021 --> 02:50:49.854
<v Speaker 5>in the same camp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is very beneficial because if you </v>

3629
02:50:52.161 --> 02:50:52.994
<v Speaker 5>get a bunch of like really good guy like</v>
<v Speaker 5>team Alpha male is a perfect example of </v>

3630
02:50:55.191 --> 02:50:56.024
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all these guys that are around </v>

3631
02:50:58.100 --> 02:51:01.160
<v Speaker 5>the 135,</v>
<v Speaker 5>255 pound weight class,</v>

3632
02:51:01.161 --> 02:51:03.500
<v Speaker 5>but it's like really elite Guy in 1:25</v>
<v Speaker 5>even.</v>

3633
02:51:03.650 --> 02:51:04.483
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of elite guys in the lower </v>
<v Speaker 5>weight classes and they all train </v>

3634
02:51:06.351 --> 02:51:07.580
<v Speaker 5>together but they never fight each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

3635
02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:08.453
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they had a big falling out </v>

3636
02:51:09.741 --> 02:51:13.310
<v Speaker 5>because Tj dillashaw won the title and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then he left team Alpha male and went to</v>

3637
02:51:13.311 --> 02:51:15.500
<v Speaker 5>Denver and now they don't like each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other like this.</v>

3638
02:51:15.501 --> 02:51:17.910
<v Speaker 5>There's so much camaraderie and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3639
02:51:17.930 --> 02:51:18.763
<v Speaker 5>and teams and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like there's this weird sort of </v>

3640
02:51:20.721 --> 02:51:21.554
<v Speaker 5>tribal bond that goes with teams and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>teams that compete against other teams </v>

3641
02:51:25.521 --> 02:51:28.760
<v Speaker 5>and they're like gangs and a lot of way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of ways,</v>

3642
02:51:28.940 --> 02:51:31.040
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not,</v>

3643
02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:32.113
<v Speaker 5>they're not criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just a bunch of dudes that are </v>

3644
02:51:33.651 --> 02:51:34.400
<v Speaker 5>bonded together.</v>

3645
02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:38.510
<v Speaker 5>And women too fucking serious hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 5>women in the sport.</v>

3646
02:51:38.511 --> 02:51:41.720
<v Speaker 5>Now there's like Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world champion,</v>

3647
02:51:41.721 --> 02:51:42.554
<v Speaker 5>she's the first openly gay MMA fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a champion rather first openly gay </v>

3648
02:51:46.851 --> 02:51:50.690
<v Speaker 5>MMA champion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's the women's 135 pound fighter.</v>

3649
02:51:50.691 --> 02:51:52.100
<v Speaker 5>She's the one who's going gonna Fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ronda Rousey.</v>

3650
02:51:52.150 --> 02:51:54.320
<v Speaker 5>Where is she from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's from Brazil.</v>

3651
02:51:54.350 --> 02:51:57.050
<v Speaker 5>That she lives in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Strains at American top team.</v>

3652
02:51:57.051 --> 02:51:57.884
<v Speaker 5>Just like the big camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a few big camps all </v>

3653
02:52:01.911 --> 02:52:02.744
<v Speaker 5>throughout the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when it comes to like elite level </v>

3654
02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:05.973
<v Speaker 5>MMA fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like who's got the biggest amount of </v>

3655
02:52:07.511 --> 02:52:10.060
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's between Jackson's in Albuquerque,</v>

3656
02:52:10.061 --> 02:52:13.960
<v Speaker 5>New Mexico and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Miami American top team.</v>

3657
02:52:13.961 --> 02:52:15.880
<v Speaker 5>They just have so many fucking elite </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighters.</v>

3658
02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:17.273
<v Speaker 5>Tough for her to train with people if </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's that good to find somebody who's </v>

3659
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:21.240
<v Speaker 5>appear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now she,</v>

3660
02:52:21.570 --> 02:52:24.670
<v Speaker 5>she fucking fights with dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dudes.</v>

3661
02:52:24.671 --> 02:52:26.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that a lot of them do.</v>

3662
02:52:26.260 --> 02:52:29.650
<v Speaker 5>Almost all women spar with dudes at </v>
<v Speaker 5>least somewhat.</v>

3663
02:52:29.950 --> 02:52:30.783
<v Speaker 5>And that's the most of the dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least in high level camps are very </v>

3664
02:52:35.381 --> 02:52:36.760
<v Speaker 5>respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're not,</v>

3665
02:52:36.850 --> 02:52:38.530
<v Speaker 5>they're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try to hurt a woman.</v>

3666
02:52:38.970 --> 02:52:42.370
<v Speaker 5>The best people in the best camps now </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize the,</v>

3667
02:52:42.371 --> 02:52:44.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the damage that you take.</v>

3668
02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:44.913
<v Speaker 5>Inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a frequent conversation now </v>

3669
02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:47.733
<v Speaker 5>it's like to not spar hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like sparring should almost be like </v>

3670
02:52:50.530 --> 02:52:53.080
<v Speaker 5>technical and playing and like very </v>
<v Speaker 5>light.</v>

3671
02:52:53.230 --> 02:52:56.310
<v Speaker 5>So you're not damaging your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not taking unnecessary shots.</v>

3672
02:52:56.390 --> 02:52:58.220
<v Speaker 5>Taking people to the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3673
02:52:58.221 --> 02:52:59.950
<v Speaker 5>you kick them a little bit in the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not bad,</v>

3674
02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:02.830
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the real problem.</v>

3675
02:53:03.130 --> 02:53:04.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even kicking him in the leg,</v>

3676
02:53:04.691 --> 02:53:06.820
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no reason to kick someone full blast.</v>

3677
02:53:06.850 --> 02:53:08.380
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you kicked the bag full blast.</v>

3678
02:53:08.381 --> 02:53:09.910
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to kick a person full </v>
<v Speaker 5>blast.</v>

3679
02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:11.193
<v Speaker 5>And so these big teams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more talent you get in like one </v>

3680
02:53:15.431 --> 02:53:16.264
<v Speaker 5>weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you get a bunch of sharks </v>

3681
02:53:18.161 --> 02:53:20.900
<v Speaker 5>circling the same seal or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you,</v>

3682
02:53:21.430 --> 02:53:23.650
<v Speaker 5>whatever the analogy would want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you get better,</v>

3683
02:53:23.651 --> 02:53:24.484
<v Speaker 5>more competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you better interaction as long as </v>

3684
02:53:26.951 --> 02:53:28.870
<v Speaker 5>there's a good comradery between all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighters,</v>

3685
02:53:29.050 --> 02:53:29.883
<v Speaker 5>but it's so hard to maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost always wind up getting mad at </v>

3686
02:53:32.441 --> 02:53:33.274
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So many fucking hit somebody after </v>

3687
02:53:35.291 --> 02:53:36.880
<v Speaker 5>practice and some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3688
02:53:36.881 --> 02:53:38.530
<v Speaker 5>there's always some thing where they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have to fight.</v>

3689
02:53:38.531 --> 02:53:41.950
<v Speaker 5>Some days they talk shit to each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>and know well also,</v>

3690
02:53:41.951 --> 02:53:44.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm sure you know a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 5>about this than I do,</v>

3691
02:53:44.561 --> 02:53:45.394
<v Speaker 5>but the people that will be drawn to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sport like this might be contentious </v>

3692
02:53:50.021 --> 02:53:50.854
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might be people that have pretty </v>

3693
02:53:52.271 --> 02:53:53.104
<v Speaker 5>good size egos and are maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>confrontational and so those people </v>

3694
02:53:57.281 --> 02:53:59.680
<v Speaker 5>aren't going to necessarily always </v>
<v Speaker 5>interact that well with others.</v>

3695
02:53:59.710 --> 02:54:01.900
<v Speaker 5>Quite a few of them for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you'd be amazed.</v>

3696
02:54:01.901 --> 02:54:03.910
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the more fascinating things </v>
<v Speaker 5>about mma.</v>

3697
02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:06.160
<v Speaker 5>You'd be amazed at how many college </v>
<v Speaker 5>educated,</v>

3698
02:54:06.161 --> 02:54:06.994
<v Speaker 5>very reasonable rational people just </v>
<v Speaker 5>view it as the ultimate extreme </v>

3699
02:54:10.511 --> 02:54:11.740
<v Speaker 5>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it be,</v>

3700
02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:12.574
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>riding a fucking snowboard off the top </v>

3701
02:54:14.771 --> 02:54:17.500
<v Speaker 5>of a mountain and you get dropped off in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a helicopter and you go down the side of</v>

3702
02:54:17.501 --> 02:54:19.780
<v Speaker 5>a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's those kinds of people.</v>

3703
02:54:19.810 --> 02:54:21.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like those kinds of extreme athlete.</v>

3704
02:54:21.341 --> 02:54:22.174
<v Speaker 5>People that might've gotten into BMX </v>
<v Speaker 5>riding or might've gotten into a lot of </v>

3705
02:54:24.731 --> 02:54:29.170
<v Speaker 5>things that we don't think of as being </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a violent aggressive,</v>

3706
02:54:29.230 --> 02:54:30.063
<v Speaker 5>but they're ultra risk taking sports and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reward that comes from doing like a </v>

3707
02:54:34.451 --> 02:54:36.330
<v Speaker 5>flip when when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3708
02:54:36.370 --> 02:54:38.890
<v Speaker 5>bmx jumping and you flipped through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>air and land on your feet.</v>

3709
02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:42.700
<v Speaker 5>Like that's I'm cheating death thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those same people.</v>

3710
02:54:42.701 --> 02:54:45.430
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of like elite ones are </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting.</v>

3711
02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:46.353
<v Speaker 5>They're getting interested in possibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing in MMA and taking that risk </v>

3712
02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:54.520
<v Speaker 5>and challenging themselves in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you see a lot of very smart people,</v>

3713
02:54:54.521 --> 02:54:55.800
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3714
02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:59.470
<v Speaker 5>and I think that at the highest level </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be smart like you.</v>

3715
02:54:59.471 --> 02:55:00.304
<v Speaker 5>We've talked to a guy like John Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might make some poor decisions with </v>

3716
02:55:02.531 --> 02:55:04.010
<v Speaker 5>his life because parties aligned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of</v>

3717
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:05.720
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's very smart.</v>

3718
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:07.850
<v Speaker 3>When you talked to them and you look in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his eyes,</v>

3719
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.983
<v Speaker 3>you know whether or not he has access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same vocabulary as Christopher </v>

3720
02:55:11.691 --> 02:55:13.150
<v Speaker 3>hitchens did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3721
02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:15.410
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's a fucking genius.</v>

3722
02:55:15.411 --> 02:55:17.720
<v Speaker 3>And fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows how to figure people out.</v>

3723
02:55:17.721 --> 02:55:20.660
<v Speaker 3>He knows how to fight under pressure is </v>
<v Speaker 3>good as anybody alive.</v>

3724
02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:23.450
<v Speaker 3>And when you talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very engaging.</v>

3725
02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.350
<v Speaker 3>He's not in any way stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very smart guy.</v>

3726
02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:28.813
<v Speaker 3>He has his interest in his focus and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>he is his focus and his interests were </v>

3727
02:55:32.181 --> 02:55:33.980
<v Speaker 3>an intellectual pursuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he,</v>

3728
02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:37.040
<v Speaker 3>if that was really what stimulated him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and made him want to,</v>

3729
02:55:37.041 --> 02:55:37.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3730
02:55:37.730 --> 02:55:39.050
<v Speaker 3>to follow through on something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3731
02:55:39.230 --> 02:55:40.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he'd be really good in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3732
02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:41.733
<v Speaker 3>I would think it's real easy for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of discredit someone and </v>

3733
02:55:45.141 --> 02:55:45.974
<v Speaker 3>someone's intellectual capacity just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I wasn't talking about </v>

3734
02:55:47.751 --> 02:55:48.210
<v Speaker 3>intellect.</v>

3735
02:55:48.210 --> 02:55:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking about in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alpha status,</v>

3736
02:55:50.541 --> 02:55:51.374
<v Speaker 3>that it is hard to put a bunch of Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 3>people near each other without a little </v>

3737
02:55:54.051 --> 02:55:55.400
<v Speaker 3>bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3738
02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:56.750
<v Speaker 3>banging elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3739
02:55:56.810 --> 02:55:57.643
<v Speaker 3>But my point is that less than you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it would be much more comradery </v>

3740
02:56:02.391 --> 02:56:03.224
<v Speaker 3>and much more social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very reasonable interaction </v>

3741
02:56:06.530 --> 02:56:08.600
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen interaction than you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine.</v>

3742
02:56:08.690 --> 02:56:10.060
<v Speaker 3>There's much more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3743
02:56:10.130 --> 02:56:10.963
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is a guy like conor </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcgregor comes along and he talks mad </v>

3744
02:56:13.581 --> 02:56:14.414
<v Speaker 3>shit and he likes the world on fire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to talk shit now and I </v>

3745
02:56:17.811 --> 02:56:18.830
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3746
02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sells,</v>

3747
02:56:19.790 --> 02:56:21.980
<v Speaker 3>it sells paper view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good for the sport.</v>

3748
02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:26.140
<v Speaker 3>They more money if they talk shit food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just released this thing on a.</v>

3749
02:56:26.210 --> 02:56:28.550
<v Speaker 3>someone did it on how much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conor mcgregor.</v>

3750
02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:33.760
<v Speaker 3>He sold more paper views in a year than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire roster combined.</v>

3751
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:37.663
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You compare all the other fights of </v>

3752
02:56:39.951 --> 02:56:41.900
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget how it was dealt with.</v>

3753
02:56:41.901 --> 02:56:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Brendan Schaub sent it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sent it to you,</v>

3754
02:56:44.390 --> 02:56:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw.</v>

3755
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:48.740
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to find out what kind of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>are we talking about.</v>

3756
02:56:48.860 --> 02:56:50.780
<v Speaker 3>I got it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he gets paid.</v>

3757
02:56:50.810 --> 02:56:51.643
<v Speaker 3>I don't under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much he gets per paper </v>

3758
02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:54.493
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at us.</v>

3759
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:59.210
<v Speaker 3>The entire roster drew three point three</v>
<v Speaker 3>to three point two.</v>

3760
02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three to three point $2 million in 2014.</v>

3761
02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Conor mcgregor drew double that on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>own in 12 months.</v>

3762
02:57:06.890 --> 02:57:07.723
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>GSP holds the record for the most pay </v>

3763
02:57:08.661 --> 02:57:12.710
<v Speaker 3>per view buys in total because he had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of paper reviews more than connor.</v>

3764
02:57:12.711 --> 02:57:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Connor holds basically every other paper</v>
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>

3765
02:57:14.901 --> 02:57:15.734
<v Speaker 3>Record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor has drawn an insane six point </v>

3766
02:57:18.860 --> 02:57:22.550
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>5 million buys and just 15 months.</v>

3767
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3768
02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Twice as many buys in one year than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire UFC roster in 2014.</v>

3769
02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:36.440
<v Speaker 3>Just his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whereas a run see making.</v>

3770
02:57:36.890 --> 02:57:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like um,</v>

3771
02:57:39.470 --> 02:57:42.850
<v Speaker 3>he was saying recently that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't fight unless it's a,</v>

3772
02:57:43.250 --> 02:57:47.660
<v Speaker 3>well actually nate Diaz was saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't fight rather,</v>

3773
02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:50.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was his opponent in the last,</v>

3774
02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:53.870
<v Speaker 3>not this last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a Eddie Alvarez,</v>

3775
02:57:54.020 --> 02:57:55.880
<v Speaker 3>but the fight before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a rematch with nate.</v>

3776
02:57:55.881 --> 02:57:56.714
<v Speaker 3>Nate beat him in the first five and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a real close fight in the second </v>

3777
02:57:59.301 --> 02:58:00.134
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Connor wanted decision and nate </v>

3778
02:58:01.381 --> 02:58:02.214
<v Speaker 3>saying that he won't fight unless he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets 20 million bucks and a lot of </v>

3779
02:58:03.871 --> 02:58:05.580
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's too much.</v>

3780
02:58:05.730 --> 02:58:08.700
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to get paid that I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much.</v>

3781
02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much money is there?</v>

3782
02:58:10.510 --> 02:58:11.343
<v Speaker 3>Like let's look at it this way to be 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million in purse or in endorsements or </v>

3783
02:58:15.271 --> 02:58:17.200
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be perse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's.</v>

3784
02:58:17.220 --> 02:58:19.210
<v Speaker 3>And paper you is separate than purse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3785
02:58:20.070 --> 02:58:20.441
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3786
02:58:20.441 --> 02:58:22.590
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no paper views based on pers.</v>

3787
02:58:22.810 --> 02:58:23.643
<v Speaker 3>Pers is based on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you get points or you get a piece </v>

3788
02:58:26.341 --> 02:58:28.260
<v Speaker 3>of the action or you can get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guarantee,</v>

3789
02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:29.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it's going to be guaranteed,</v>

3790
02:58:29.791 --> 02:58:32.400
<v Speaker 3>like say if that's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And obviously I'm not a mathematician,</v>

3791
02:58:32.401 --> 02:58:33.234
<v Speaker 3>we know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3792
02:58:33.330 --> 02:58:36.630
<v Speaker 3>So if he said 20 million bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he wants to fight for them.</v>

3793
02:58:37.020 --> 02:58:38.700
<v Speaker 3>If paper view is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$60,</v>

3794
02:58:38.730 --> 02:58:40.740
<v Speaker 3>how much does it cost?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it's 60 and they,</v>

3795
02:58:40.741 --> 02:58:42.240
<v Speaker 3>let's say they sell a million paper </v>
<v Speaker 3>reviews,</v>

3796
02:58:42.241 --> 02:58:44.480
<v Speaker 3>which is an excellent number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's $60.</v>

3797
02:58:44.481 --> 02:58:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3798
02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3799
02:58:47.070 --> 02:58:47.903
<v Speaker 3>so $60,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants a third of that right off the </v>

3800
02:58:49.801 --> 02:58:52.650
<v Speaker 3>top and then you would got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well who's going to fight?</v>

3801
02:58:52.651 --> 02:58:53.484
<v Speaker 3>Conor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conor is going to take a third of that </v>

3802
02:58:54.151 --> 02:58:55.020
<v Speaker 3>to write it.</v>

3803
02:58:55.020 --> 02:58:57.150
<v Speaker 3>At least he's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to take less than me.</v>

3804
02:58:57.780 --> 02:59:00.390
<v Speaker 3>What's up nate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's gonna fight conor.</v>

3805
02:59:00.810 --> 02:59:01.643
<v Speaker 3>So if he's gonna fight connor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connor's going to take probably even </v>

3806
02:59:03.241 --> 02:59:04.500
<v Speaker 3>more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3807
02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:06.840
<v Speaker 3>So it's 20 and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five.</v>

3808
02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:10.890
<v Speaker 3>So there's less for the UFC then those </v>
<v Speaker 3>two guys.</v>

3809
02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:11.873
<v Speaker 3>Well that's how it is in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how it is in like if you look at </v>

3810
02:59:14.850 --> 02:59:15.683
<v Speaker 3>the person's for like a lot of boxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>matches the way they have it described </v>

3811
02:59:18.601 --> 02:59:19.434
<v Speaker 3>as like the big guys like floyd </v>
<v Speaker 3>mayweather get the lion's share of the </v>

3812
02:59:21.181 --> 02:59:24.220
<v Speaker 3>purse and then everybody else gets less </v>
<v Speaker 3>including the promoter.</v>

3813
02:59:24.221 --> 02:59:25.054
<v Speaker 3>So ticket sales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably just a couple of </v>

3814
02:59:26.601 --> 02:59:27.434
<v Speaker 3>million ticket sales are probably pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>substantial or anywhere it is to get </v>

3815
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:32.610
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 17 point 7 million.</v>

3816
02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:33.473
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventeen point 7 million in Madison </v>

3817
02:59:35.190 --> 02:59:36.023
<v Speaker 3>Square Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3818
02:59:36.090 --> 02:59:41.090
<v Speaker 3>And then what about that giant Vegas </v>
<v Speaker 3>place that the t mobile arena in Vegas,</v>

3819
02:59:41.491 --> 02:59:42.690
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot more people.</v>

3820
02:59:42.690 --> 02:59:43.900
<v Speaker 3>When that sells out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

3821
02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:47.070
<v Speaker 3>You're saying $70 million for one ticket</v>
<v Speaker 3>sales.</v>

3822
02:59:47.080 --> 02:59:49.110
<v Speaker 3>That's the square garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3823
02:59:49.111 --> 02:59:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you've got merchandise,</v>

3824
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:53.460
<v Speaker 3>but that's theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3825
02:59:53.470 --> 02:59:54.303
<v Speaker 3>Because it's about the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the fighter like I don't </v>

3826
02:59:56.311 --> 02:59:58.470
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe if the fighter is selling,</v>

3827
02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:00.180
<v Speaker 3>they're selling conor mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 3>merchandise.</v>

3828
03:00:00.181 --> 03:00:01.500
<v Speaker 3>That's a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3829
03:00:01.501 --> 03:00:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Then they should definitely get a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>chunk of that.</v>

3830
03:00:03.751 --> 03:00:04.584
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much they get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this isn't including </v>

3831
03:00:05.671 --> 03:00:07.140
<v Speaker 3>sponsorships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3832
03:00:07.141 --> 03:00:08.580
<v Speaker 3>there's no sponsors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3833
03:00:08.610 --> 03:00:11.100
<v Speaker 3>The UFC has some sponsors in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>octagon.</v>

3834
03:00:11.160 --> 03:00:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have some movie sponsors and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

3835
03:00:13.141 --> 03:00:13.974
<v Speaker 3>but as for the fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's really no sponsors that they </v>

3836
03:00:15.691 --> 03:00:17.910
<v Speaker 3>carry into the octagon with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only sponsors,</v>

3837
03:00:17.911 --> 03:00:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Reebok and some people have a deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster energy drink.</v>

3838
03:00:20.970 --> 03:00:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting hats on after they went.</v>

3839
03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:25.073
<v Speaker 3>Not always in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely in beltour or unless they </v>

3840
03:00:26.971 --> 03:00:28.350
<v Speaker 3>have a monster energy drink deal.</v>

3841
03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:31.190
<v Speaker 3>So UFC also has a deal with but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3842
03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:32.520
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real weird.</v>

3843
03:00:32.521 --> 03:00:34.650
<v Speaker 3>For the longest time they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had it all over their shorts.</v>

3844
03:00:34.651 --> 03:00:35.484
<v Speaker 3>They would wear whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would wear tee shirts coming into </v>

3845
03:00:37.351 --> 03:00:38.184
<v Speaker 3>the octagon based on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they signed this deal with </v>

3846
03:00:40.321 --> 03:00:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Reebok and a lot of people are upset </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3847
03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:44.730
<v Speaker 3>They have to wear reebok stuff now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3848
03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:47.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a hot point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

3849
03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:48.690
<v Speaker 3>A lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3850
03:00:48.750 --> 03:00:49.583
<v Speaker 3>it is for a lot of fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of fighters it's like it was </v>

3851
03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:53.940
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>

3852
03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:56.520
<v Speaker 3>so in terms of like how much money is </v>
<v Speaker 3>left then,</v>

3853
03:00:56.700 --> 03:00:59.620
<v Speaker 3>how much does it cost to run a global </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization like that?</v>

3854
03:00:59.621 --> 03:01:02.560
<v Speaker 3>How much does it cost to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure alive?</v>

3855
03:01:02.561 --> 03:01:05.140
<v Speaker 3>How much does it cost to upload </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything to review,</v>

3856
03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:07.450
<v Speaker 3>how much does it cost to hire all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

3857
03:01:07.570 --> 03:01:09.910
<v Speaker 3>How much does it cost to put that </v>
<v Speaker 3>production together?</v>

3858
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:11.623
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it's only 60 million bucks and </v>

3859
03:01:13.151 --> 03:01:16.450
<v Speaker 3>then 15 million bucks from obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3860
03:01:16.451 --> 03:01:19.720
<v Speaker 3>And there's got to be international shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>too because they sell it internationally</v>

3861
03:01:19.721 --> 03:01:21.850
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the UFC is everywhere.</v>

3862
03:01:21.970 --> 03:01:22.803
<v Speaker 3>So a big fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate Diaz and conor mcgregor doesn't </v>

3863
03:01:25.031 --> 03:01:27.220
<v Speaker 3>just sell in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sells everywhere.</v>

3864
03:01:27.221 --> 03:01:28.054
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's all included.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they work that shit </v>

3865
03:01:29.501 --> 03:01:30.334
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is when someone says he </v>

3866
03:01:32.231 --> 03:01:33.064
<v Speaker 3>wants $20,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might make sense or that may may </v>

3867
03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:38.770
<v Speaker 3>not make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know what the numbers are.</v>

3868
03:01:39.010 --> 03:01:41.890
<v Speaker 3>And also you gotta pay taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're making all that money,</v>

3869
03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:43.930
<v Speaker 3>if you're bringing it all that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to pay taxes on that money.</v>

3870
03:01:43.931 --> 03:01:44.764
<v Speaker 3>Who pays the taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does UFC pay the taxes first and then </v>

3871
03:01:46.721 --> 03:01:48.070
<v Speaker 3>pay the fighters out of what's left?</v>

3872
03:01:48.490 --> 03:01:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Do they all act as private contractors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

3873
03:01:51.460 --> 03:01:52.293
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as far as like how much money </v>

3874
03:01:54.581 --> 03:01:56.770
<v Speaker 3>they're making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for a guy like conor mcgregor,</v>

3875
03:01:56.771 --> 03:01:58.920
<v Speaker 3>the correct answer would be a fuckload </v>

03:02:44.841 --> 03:02:49.280
<v Speaker 9>and granted nfl or NBA has a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 9>revenue coming in,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3935

<v Speaker 9>they're getting a regular massage from a</v>
<v Speaker 9>woman and it's a good massage.</v>

<v Speaker 9>You can tell that these are like </v>
<v Speaker 9>practice misuses,</v>

3938
03:04:54.130 --> 03:04:55.790

03:05:02.501 --> 03:05:03.334
<v Speaker 9>the woman's face and above and below and</v>
<v Speaker 9>usually somewhere else and they keep it </v>

3942
03:05:07.241 --> 03:05:08.074
<v Speaker 9>on the face.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can see the eyes open and kind of </v>

3943
03:05:10.211 --> 03:05:14.320
<v Speaker 9>look around and I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>fucking Mia Farrow,</v>

3944
03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:15.993
<v Speaker 9>who's a great actress.</v>
<v Speaker 9>A Jane Fonda couldn't portray the Sufi </v>

3945
03:05:20.411 --> 03:05:21.244
<v Speaker 9>dunaway.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Faye dunaway could not portray the </v>

3946
03:05:23.531 --> 03:05:28.531
<v Speaker 9>subtle nuances of coming around to being</v>
<v Speaker 9>suddenly fingered by.</v>

3947
03:05:29.291 --> 03:05:30.060
<v Speaker 9>I'm assuming.</v>

3948
03:05:30.060 --> 03:05:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you think it's real.</v>

3949
03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:35.220
<v Speaker 4>I defy anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>

3950
03:05:35.370 --> 03:05:38.850
<v Speaker 4>I will send you clips that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>undeniable.</v>

3951
03:05:39.180 --> 03:05:41.880
<v Speaker 4>I think you should take that and run </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

3952
03:05:42.180 --> 03:05:44.970
<v Speaker 4>Just don't look at anything that points </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the contrary.</v>

3953
03:05:44.980 --> 03:05:46.320
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would I?</v>

3954
03:05:46.350 --> 03:05:48.960
<v Speaker 4>Why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What his line of perception.</v>

3955
03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:52.440
<v Speaker 4>It's not reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not empowering to think that that's</v>

3956
03:05:52.441 --> 03:05:53.274
<v Speaker 4>staged and you're just being tricked by </v>
<v Speaker 4>some unenthusiastic people didn't need </v>

3957
03:05:56.461 --> 03:05:57.300
<v Speaker 4>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3958
03:05:57.301 --> 03:05:59.040
<v Speaker 4>You want to think that this is a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>massage.</v>

3959
03:05:59.041 --> 03:06:01.280
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Realize finger in her completely.</v>

03:06:02.540 --> 03:06:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Heck no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't watch those.</v>

3961
03:06:04.380 --> 03:06:06.920
<v Speaker 4>You don't want something because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems rapey rapey.</v>

3962
03:06:07.380 --> 03:06:09.750
<v Speaker 4>But what if the guy's laying down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grill just starts sucking his dick.</v>

3963
03:06:09.770 --> 03:06:13.500
<v Speaker 4>Now that's from a girl and guy gets a </v>
<v Speaker 4>massage from a girl.</v>

3964
03:06:13.501 --> 03:06:15.060
<v Speaker 4>She just starts blowing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3965
03:06:15.061 --> 03:06:15.894
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3966
03:06:16.260 --> 03:06:18.030
<v Speaker 4>a woman is pleasuring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another woman.</v>

3967
03:06:18.090 --> 03:06:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You like it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3969
03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:21.180
<v Speaker 4>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You want to see everyone had a good day.</v>

3971
03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Everybody had a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the [inaudible] is getting paid</v>

3972
03:06:25.741 --> 03:06:27.450
<v Speaker 4>handsomely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She knows she's on camera.</v>

3973
03:06:27.720 --> 03:06:30.690
<v Speaker 4>Plus they're lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think most women are.</v>

3974
03:06:30.691 --> 03:06:32.520
<v Speaker 4>They don't get a chance to explore it as</v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

3975
03:06:32.610 --> 03:06:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strong words for some hidden cameras and</v>

3976
03:06:34.801 --> 03:06:37.050
<v Speaker 4>they're receiving what really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe he's saying that.</v>

3977
03:06:38.340 --> 03:06:42.820
<v Speaker 4>I believe that all women have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>propensity for lesbians,</v>

3978
03:06:42.821 --> 03:06:45.990
<v Speaker 4>lesbianism because it's soft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're being touched in a gentle way.</v>

3979
03:06:48.090 --> 03:06:52.320
<v Speaker 4>Not The way I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do my lesbian and stuff.</v>

3980
03:06:52.830 --> 03:06:54.480

<v Speaker 1>What style of fucking do you employ?</v>
