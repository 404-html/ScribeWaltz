00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:13.000

<v Speaker 1>He let it go for a long time and he just</v>

5
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>started just being a guy on stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about shit.</v>

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the people weren't into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

9
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>which is what I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen him,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he was so nice.</v>

16
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:38.921
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

21
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually put their feet on the fire </v>

22
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>and they had to hire me.</v>

23
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

24
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>don't take the first money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell him no,</v>

26
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.663
<v Speaker 1>I tell him no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they came back with more and </v>

27
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.740
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was great.</v>

28
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

29
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.293
<v Speaker 1>So then he calls what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know they're going to want </v>

30
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you to do the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay doing the voice?</v>

31
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>And I go for the amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>snickers is paying.</v>

32
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I will fuck a snickers behind camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

33
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:16.981
<v Speaker 1>I should say it's a really big candy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's my all time favorite.</v>

34
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

35
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I said I was going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

36
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.583
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll address a little bit and talk </v>

37
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:23.691
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>robin had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>has his coroner's report came out and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had lewy body dementia and that is a,</v>

40
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.003
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of dementia that is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rarely ever discovered when someone's </v>

41
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

42
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>It's usually discovered in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a autopsy.</v>

43
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>So he had this form of dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed it.</v>

44
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>It was missed a diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's.</v>

45
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

46
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.033
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed this eye witnesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing reality completely different </v>

47
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>than the way every body else does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What causes it?</v>

48
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it's a gene or what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it,</v>

50
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadly,</v>

51
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>his brain was riddled with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I think about that,</v>

52
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I think about how strong he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:18.671
<v Speaker 1>you would have like some days you'd have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of days where he was doing kind of</v>

54
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>ocd stuff and processing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrectly,</v>

55
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>but then you'd have a day where he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

56
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>So you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well maybe set a bad day or no,</v>

57
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the Parkinson's drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've got to get those dialed in.</v>

58
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

59
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>he was going to doctors use in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing,</v>

60
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason I talk about that is,</v>

61
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 1>is his brain was giving him </v>
<v Speaker 1>misinformation,</v>

62
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>completeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information.</v>

63
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And I don't if some people die from </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and uh,</v>

64
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>and my heart goes out to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what killed him.</v>

65
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

66
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.333
<v Speaker 1>he really was getting misinformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his own brain and was suffering </v>

67
00:02:58.761 --> 00:02:59.594
<v Speaker 1>from disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just put that out there because I </v>

68
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.280
<v Speaker 1>folks know that we were friends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

69
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.980
<v Speaker 1>They'll ask me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

70
00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:07.814
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would like a spotlight put on the </v>

71
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:11.764
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually in my mind was what was </v>

72
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:18.150
<v Speaker 1>responsible for its demise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

73
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say,</v>

74
00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>did he ever talk about suicide ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comics,</v>

75
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.190
<v Speaker 1>we talked about suicide for 33 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

76
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.420
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we talk about other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.150
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations on the ASCA.</v>

78
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

79
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>How would you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

80
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I think a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>but I just say that because he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do.</v>

83
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it comic,</v>

84
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fight depression.</v>

85
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Things don't add up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

86
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>this world doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd go out and we spew,</v>

87
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I feel better on a selfish level.</v>

88
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't really give a rat's ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I vent and I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

90
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he fought it.</v>

91
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't depression.</v>

92
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

93
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd been sober most of his adult life,</v>

94
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

95
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.993
<v Speaker 1>so it was very disturbing to me that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people were trying to attribute </v>

96
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of reasons for why he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even there was a lot of like,</v>

97
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:14.014
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the main thing is rights </v>

98
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>groups that were attributing it to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce settlements.</v>

99
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.154
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole thing where this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing this video and I even talked </v>

101
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.284
<v Speaker 1>to him about it.</v>

102
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.010
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

103
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.053
<v Speaker 1>he had a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a disease that caused dementia </v>

104
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>that I witnessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have anybody.</v>

105
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him and text and every day I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a buddy that I talked to him</v>

107
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to be,</v>

108
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

109
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.410
<v Speaker 1>it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't as family.</v>

110
00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the same agent.</v>

111
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.573
<v Speaker 1>So like when this guy was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the reason why it pissed </v>

112
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>me off because he's guy was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113

<v Speaker 1>he's in financial ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

114
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't.</v>

115
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was wealthy.</v>

116
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.850
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>because we as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to make sense of,</v>

122
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

123
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>of why w why that happened and why that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in my opinion,</v>

124
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.143
<v Speaker 1>which is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was his brain was who would know more </v>

125
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>than you?</v>

126
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>It was his brain was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>misinformation and he was processing </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality completely wrong.</v>

128
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I W I won't go into details,</v>

129
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but I did witness him thinking things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weren't real or happening and to me</v>

130
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only thing.</v>

131
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.461
<v Speaker 1>Like people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

132
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't in the same bedroom as his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

133
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:47.621
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

134
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>because he was having seizures and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like to wake her up.</v>

135
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.783
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a question of somebody not </v>

136
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>getting along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to get so personal.</v>

137
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.123
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean to talk about about </v>

138
00:05:59.181 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

139
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his home life because you know,</v>

140
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Susan's a wonderful Gal and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

141
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's just sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

142
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

143
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the one of the scariest things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to someone who's,</v>

144
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a loved one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a father,</v>

145
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.790
<v Speaker 1>mother that's losing their grip.</v>

146
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think people were s they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>courteous to a point,</v>

147
00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.550
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take his,</v>

148
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.103
<v Speaker 1>his kids and the consideration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and people worked with them for </v>

149
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:34.830
<v Speaker 1>all these years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I can't expect them to,</v>

150
00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:35.664
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure I've taken shots at </v>

151
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:39.540
<v Speaker 1>people when they pass away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

152
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like people would come up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

153
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>did you hear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you,</v>

154
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:45.540
<v Speaker 1>what rush limbaugh said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

155
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.823
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with people who dealt well </v>

156
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.630
<v Speaker 1>then we had a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

157
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this impulse that people have to</v>

158
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.790
<v Speaker 1>denigrate people right after they die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like everyone else is,</v>

159
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.373
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I saw a lot of that with prince </v>

160
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>when it was revealed that prince was </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering through opiate addiction.</v>

161
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

162
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.440
<v Speaker 1>well there was like even gene Simmons </v>
<v Speaker 1>said some crazy shit.</v>

163
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And he had to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd seen some other people say too,</v>

164
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like it's a crunch,</v>

165
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.380
<v Speaker 1>a contrarian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone else is saying,</v>

166
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>oh you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost his genius.</v>

167
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Well you get heat from it and I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Gene Simmons is,</v>

168
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a jealousy thing,</v>

169
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

170
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I used to say outrageous things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and,</v>

171
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and this bomb will go off and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

172
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I would get some heat and now I get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>buzz and I stopped doing that.</v>

173
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I made a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:48.670
<v Speaker 1>realizing that these weren't just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmless things I was saying.</v>

175
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

176
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.141
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

177
00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

179
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.523
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there are a lot of that when Kurt </v>

180
00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:58.024
<v Speaker 1>cobain died too.</v>

181
00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.461
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:03.660
<v Speaker 1>and that's the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't best these with Kurt,</v>

183
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but I did know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I toured with Nirvana,</v>

184
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.463
<v Speaker 1>Kurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my standup and asked me to go on </v>

185
00:08:08.731 --> 00:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>the road with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a bunch of date.</v>

186
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it.</v>

187
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.013
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

188
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like the situation was wrong,</v>

189
00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:16.104
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did have times in my life where I </v>

190
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>spent hours with Kurt when no one else </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting around talking and laughing,</v>

191
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why we want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

193
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we try to make sense of it.</v>

194
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Trying to make sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

195
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies come from.</v>

196
00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:38.664
<v Speaker 1>I think when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone who's in our mind reached </v>

197
00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:42.364
<v Speaker 1>the American dream and then they die or </v>
<v Speaker 1>look or con or take their life or </v>

198
00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 1>overdose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to say,</v>

199
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:50.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had it all.</v>

200
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we believe is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fulfillment and happiness.</v>

201
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:55.584
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is like People's Republic of </v>

202
00:08:57.351 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>spring break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

203
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>No one's pursuing fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's pursuing happiness.</v>

204
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two different things.</v>

205
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm really fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I happy?</v>

206
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Am I laughing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I might know.</v>

207
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>But you're happy sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy a lot of the time.</v>

208
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

209
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not top here.</v>

210
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't know that you're this nuance</v>

211
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.584
<v Speaker 1>guy that's very thoughtful and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of opinions and you're always </v>

212
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>considering all sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I just took like if I tried to form a</v>

213
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 1>view of you based on you and I talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always laughing.</v>

214
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say bobcat.</v>

215
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>So jolly every toddler talking to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>like laughs and hugs and,</v>

216
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 1>but it is true and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's uh,</v>

217
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we never see each other before </v>

218
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>noon.</v>

219
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

220
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a daily reprieve.</v>

221
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a daily decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

222
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the squirrels are up before I do and I,</v>

223
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>and I beat him down and then it turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I'm directing on a set,</v>

224
00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:57.114
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can react and fear or I can just sit </v>

225
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>here for a second or two and it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's usually works out.</v>

226
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely do I have to say no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

227
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you just sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so much of show business,</v>

228
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 1>everything's based on fear and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking someone's going to say,</v>

229
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:13.284
<v Speaker 1>you screwed up or you didn't do it right</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you didn't get extra takes and all </v>

230
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

231
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:21.951
<v Speaker 1>my job is really not to to freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy right now.</v>

232
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] okay.</v>
