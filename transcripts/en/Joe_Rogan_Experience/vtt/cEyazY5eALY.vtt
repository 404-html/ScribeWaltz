00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.171
<v Speaker 1>Try my day.</v>

2
00:00:01.171 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Now when you guys watch MMA and you see someone like Stephen Thompson that has</v>

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>a few elements of Moitai he uses,</v>

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>but he uses a lot of sport karate,</v>

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.500
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

8
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>a completely different stance,</v>

10
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>a completely different style.</v>

11
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on that when you watch that or what his style or when they,</v>

12
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>this style is Moitai well,</v>

13
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>they definitely don't really,</v>

14
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>well leg kicks and some techniques,</v>

16
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but essentially he's doing a sport karate style.</v>

17
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:35.491
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

19
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of the same thing with Anderson Silva.</v>

20
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like just cause someone's throwing an elbow,</v>

21
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>just because somebody has a clinch doesn't necessarily make it [inaudible].</v>

22
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of arts that have those things.</v>

23
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.571
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

24
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to view him as a Muay Thai fight.</v>

25
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I think of Anderson is a motif.</v>

26
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I am not at all.</v>

27
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 1>He thought of himself as a [inaudible].</v>

28
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.273
<v Speaker 1>Well that's okay,</v>

29
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.001
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

30
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't view him as of when we tie fighter at all.</v>

31
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I knew him as an MMA.</v>

32
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Anything he did was very moist.</v>

33
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Even his clinch was,</v>

34
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>that's such a fundamental,</v>

36
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>basic clinch,</v>

37
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.900
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

38
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>That's just because everyone else was so terrible at it.</v>

39
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like grab the neck,</v>

40
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>like you don't see that in high level Muay Thai guys going up and grabbing each</v>

41
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>other by the neck.</v>

42
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It's in transition and one of the hurt people when they get tired very,</v>

43
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 1>it's very much a,</v>

44
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 1>us of struggling for dominance over under those kinds of things like big,</v>

46
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:22.201
<v Speaker 1>sloppy,</v>

47
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

48
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Armbar yeah,</v>

49
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.031
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

50
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

51
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>like it's like,</v>

52
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>that's like day one more time.</v>

53
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>So when you saw that like the rich Franklin fight</v>

54
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>in the fuck,</v>

55
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>like how did he not learn this as first day in training and what was even worse</v>

56
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

57
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend that I trained with that went out to help him for the second one</v>

59
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and he just didn't want to hear it.</v>

60
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Like they did not want to hear that.</v>

61
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

62
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.121
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

63
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're doing at all.</v>

64
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Because as well we talked about earlier,</v>

65
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>these guys get to a high level and think that they're,</v>

66
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll tie you technique is good.</v>

68
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:54.421
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

69
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:54.631
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

70
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you are like a kindergartener.</v>

71
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know what you're doing at all whatsoever.</v>

72
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to listen,</v>

73
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

74
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

75
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

76
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.873
<v Speaker 1>That look,</v>

77
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>so w who was it that went out with him?</v>

78
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

79
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.403
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Brown,</v>

80
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>all the trading partner of mine.</v>

81
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And he was specifically brought there because of his Moitai.</v>

82
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

83
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

84
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

85
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:14.641
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>

86
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>why would you bring me in if you're not going to use me?</v>

87
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:17.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

88
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I've been brought in for people to,</v>

89
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>and why wouldn't you use what you've brought me in here to do?</v>

90
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

91
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Like you brought me in for my Muay Thai for my knowledge in this thing.</v>

92
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>And you just want to keep doing what you're good at.</v>

93
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.281
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

94
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:29.881
<v Speaker 1>why am I here?</v>

95
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:30.714
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>

96
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunate.</v>

97
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>He's such a nice guy and such a smart guy.</v>

98
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>He was a math teacher without a doubt.</v>

99
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>How do you not see the math of that?</v>

100
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It's when people aren't,</v>

101
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>people have a false sense of where they're at in the sport and what they can do.</v>

102
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

103
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you literally know nothing,</v>

104
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but you have this mentality that you're,</v>

105
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you're decent at standup,</v>

106
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>you're decent,</v>

107
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Emma.</v>

108
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>We tie and you're terrible compared to someone that really does know what</v>

109
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:56.994
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

110
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

111
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Most people's understanding is very elementary.</v>

112
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.764
<v Speaker 1>If that,</v>

113
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you take another person and I'm going to,</v>

115
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I could beat you without even like touching you.</v>

116
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.981
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

117
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:09.161
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

118
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>and just to let you mess yourself up because you don't really know what you're</v>

119
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.484
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

120
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

121
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy to think that someone could reach the world championship level and</v>

122
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>something that involves more Moitai,</v>

123
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.630
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many variables that come be,</v>

124
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>there's wrestling,</v>

125
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.361
<v Speaker 1>there's two shits is,</v>

126
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.021
<v Speaker 1>there's always things.</v>

127
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

128
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with a lot more like the striking and MMA you can get away with</v>

129
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>because of those variables,</v>

130
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>because of the smaller gloves,</v>

131
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>because of the take downs,</v>

132
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you put that person in the ring with even a moderately good muay Thai person,</v>

134
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 1>moderately good boxer,</v>

135
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get murdered.</v>

136
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.651
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

137
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

138
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

139
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

140
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Just like it can bring in like a really good point that I fire him but then</v>

141
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>don't have any wrestling,</v>

142
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>different defense or no digits.</v>

143
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.821
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to do it.</v>

144
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Be able to do.</v>

145
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

146
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.141
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

147
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:50.974
<v Speaker 1>Look like an idiot.</v>

148
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the appeals of MMA.</v>

149
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Is that the guy who wins is most likely the best fighter because if it was just</v>

151
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>more tie or if it was just wrestling or if it was just Jujitsu,</v>

152
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you would see someone who's the best at that.</v>

153
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>But when you throw everything in,</v>

154
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>like it's the kitchen sink,</v>

155
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>get in there and that's when you know,</v>

156
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you get to see like who's been,</v>

157
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was even more complex puzzle.</v>

158
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>That's why like I,</v>

160
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I've never really understood the argument of like pitting this person against</v>

161
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>that person or like who's got the best when we tighten them,</v>

162
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>

163
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.671
<v Speaker 1>we'll nobody,</v>

164
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>cause they're not doing Muay Thai,</v>

165
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.893
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

166
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

167
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.291
<v Speaker 1>that argument,</v>

168
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>that conversation is completely invalid.</v>

169
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

170
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

171
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>if you put this boxer and against this Muay Thai fighter,</v>

172
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>who's going to win?</v>

173
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what rules are they fighting under their fighting under mood.</v>

174
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Tyrell's east probably going to get crushed.</v>

175
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.443
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

176
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that a Wonderboy Thompson is going to fight Tyron Woodley,</v>

178
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>who's the UFC welterweight champion and who's just super powerful wrestler,</v>

179
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>but who's also training with Duke Roufus who's obviously very talented,</v>

180
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>knows a lot about Moitai great coach.</v>

181
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

182
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

183
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>when you see a guy like that?</v>

184
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

185
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I keep bringing up,</v>

186
00:04:58.721 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

187
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy styles because it's so unique.</v>

188
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:01.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

189
00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>we brought up Raymond Daniels in glory who is one of the only guys that has like</v>

190
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>that similar background.</v>

191
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And then Michael Page of course,</v>

192
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>in MMA who fights for belt or has a very similar style to that sport karate</v>

193
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

194
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>What are the holes in that style?</v>

195
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.501
<v Speaker 1>Like what's,</v>

196
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:17.600
<v Speaker 1>what's the pros and cons that you see as a fighter?</v>

197
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>What we were speaking of earlier,</v>

198
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

199
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

200
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>if you've never applied that in a fight,</v>

201
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>a real fight,</v>

202
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.031
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

203
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

204
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>not point sparring,</v>

205
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:26.891
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

206
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:27.131
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

207
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:27.341
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

208
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:27.821
<v Speaker 1>not that,</v>

209
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:28.654
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

210
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>There's certain techniques and things that are completely worthless.</v>

211
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately in a lot of those sports you are not,</v>

212
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't get exposed by that until it's way too late.</v>

213
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying these techniques that,</v>

214
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

216
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>a decent person just kind of walk right through because they look good and</v>

217
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>they're flashing and they're great on the pads and,</v>

218
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

219
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.451
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

220
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:49.691
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

221
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but when you have to damage someone,</v>

222
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.600
<v Speaker 1>obviously Thomson knows how to do that though.</v>

223
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's using techniques and,</v>

224
00:05:57.821 --> 00:05:58.090
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

225
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>but applying them in a,</v>

226
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>in a more fight,</v>

227
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

228
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>centric way and it's completely different thing.</v>

229
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>But when you see what I was trying to get at,</v>

230
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>is that such a weird style where you stand sideways and he leaps in and out and</v>

231
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>he moves back and forth from the waist,</v>

232
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:12.764
<v Speaker 1>like a snake.</v>

233
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

234
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.140
<v Speaker 1>he's got a lot of it.</v>

235
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness to the way he moves and it's very difficult to find</v>

236
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>anybody that has that level skill with a sport,</v>

237
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>karate,</v>

238
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.163
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing,</v>

239
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>but also has a really good wrestling base to,</v>

240
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

241
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the biggest things and why he's able to apply those</v>

243
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 1>things because,</v>

244
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.140
<v Speaker 1>because he can deal with the wrestling and everything else that goes in,</v>

245
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

246
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>so that's why you'll see him throw those techniques because he's not as worried</v>

247
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.950
<v Speaker 1>about it as someone who might be just as good as him with those things in,</v>

248
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and it has zero ground or wrestling where they're not going to throw it because</v>

249
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get taken down.</v>

250
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Crushed.</v>

251
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like we were talking about your experience in a taekwondo school that you</v>

253
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>went there the first day,</v>

254
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 1>start doing sparring you through a low kick,</v>

255
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:55.740
<v Speaker 1>and then like get outta here.</v>

256
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.133
<v Speaker 1>Tons of go.</v>

257
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.240
<v Speaker 1>So you'd do it.</v>

258
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Something to do effective.</v>

259
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

260
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>So being able to apply things in a real fight and being able to apply them in</v>

261
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the air is,</v>

262
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>is very different.</v>

263
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

264
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we see Thompson can apply them in a real fight.</v>

265
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing that you see that's different?</v>

266
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

267
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it's not a Moy Thai fighter,</v>

268
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>he's a kickboxer,</v>

269
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>but like when you see that stance,</v>

270
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>that weird stance,</v>

271
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>that sideways stance,</v>

272
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about that?</v>

273
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

274
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think much about it cause I don't watch a lot of MMA,</v>

275
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

276
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do a little bit better.</v>

277
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

278
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I follow it,</v>

279
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.051
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

280
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I watch it when it's on,</v>

281
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not the,</v>

282
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:32.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>like paying attention to the fighters are tracking them throughout the years.</v>

284
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>You know that much.</v>

285
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so curious because you are so Moitai you know your style,</v>

286
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>so more tie in.</v>

287
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously an expert at it.</v>

288
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm always curious as to like how a person,</v>

289
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:47.320
<v Speaker 1>like you observes a,</v>

290
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>an expert striker in sort of another realm.</v>

291
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

292
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an expert and he's become an expert striker and MMA.</v>

293
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:57.220
<v Speaker 1>So he's applying all the techniques that he know him.</v>

294
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.161
<v Speaker 1>He knows him.</v>

295
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha have worked for him and MMA.</v>

296
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's different than if he would get in the ring and do Moitai.</v>

297
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

298
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>How many fighters like him have done Moitai.</v>

299
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Raymond Daniels has done kickboxing and some you know and it,</v>

300
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's another one of those things where being able to apply the things from</v>

301
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>your other sport into that.</v>

302
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>So like we were talking about with the Raymond Daniels and Nikki Holt skin,</v>

303
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:23.160
<v Speaker 1>like he just walked him down.</v>

304
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>He was like Bop,</v>

305
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:25.330
<v Speaker 1>bop crushing the legs.</v>

306
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.333
<v Speaker 1>Tylene too.</v>

307
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 1>So at a certain level it Kinda,</v>

308
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.110
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose that like where you're,</v>

309
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>you're spinning flashy techniques are going to work against,</v>

310
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:35.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:35.481
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

312
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 1>those mid level guys.</v>

313
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>But you put them in there with the best in the world and a lot of that stuff</v>

314
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>gets exposed in is not working out so well.</v>

315
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And you think that essentially demonstrates the effectiveness of Moitai at the</v>

316
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:48.831
<v Speaker 1>highest levels.</v>

317
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:50.880
<v Speaker 1>You think it's the best demonstrates the,</v>

318
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:51.531
<v Speaker 1>the holes.</v>

319
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>And some of the stances in techniques.</v>

320
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

321
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not flinching on the things you do and don't really care so much about</v>

322
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>you hopping around and spin around,</v>

323
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm just walking you down,</v>

324
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.373
<v Speaker 1>crushing you.</v>

325
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

326
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's where that kind of gets exposed.</v>

327
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

328
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like putting a boxer into a Muay Thai fight I'm going to do is kick your</v>

329
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>legs and you can't punch me.</v>

330
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

331
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:12.541
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

332
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>But you take a boxer and teach them how to defend though those kicks and Stan</v>

333
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 1>and a little bit more of a squared up way and where I can't use you use your</v>

334
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>weakness against you as much.</v>

335
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have much better success even if you've never throw quick.</v>

336
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Now you just can take those kicks better and just kill me with your,</v>

337
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>your high level hands.</v>

338
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
