<v Speaker 2>that Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he a senator or congressman or some </v>

59
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy was an anti gay</v>

60
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.080
<v Speaker 3>crusader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We always,</v>

61
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.923
<v Speaker 3>my favorite dudes got caught in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bathroom stall in like Minneapolis and </v>

62
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:06.964
<v Speaker 3>he was doing that foot tapping thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like a code Morse code for </v>

63
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.134
<v Speaker 3>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tap your feet four times and dudes </v>

64
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 3>and let you into the stall and you suck </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other off.</v>

65
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.223
<v Speaker 3>Larry's grades are in the dude's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of dudes are into dudes when these </v>

66
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 3>kinds of dudes are in dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 3>But I think if I think it generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you watch modern family.</v>

68
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.043
<v Speaker 3>You ever watch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

69
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.323
<v Speaker 3>Do they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a few families and have a gay </v>

70
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.110
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

71
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 3>they have two dudes and they adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they adopted a girl.</v>

72
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 3>She's an Asian girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those guys,</v>

73
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:50.101
<v Speaker 3>there's been a couple episodes where </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is on ABC modern family where uh,</v>

74
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 3>the gay couple at some college boys move</v>
<v Speaker 3>in next door and then one of the guys is</v>

75
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:58.594
<v Speaker 3>like hanging out with them and he feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's in college again and he's </v>

76
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 3>partying with them and he kind of has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crush on one of the guys,</v>

77
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 3>like the main guy and his husband.</v>

78
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like you gotta crush blank they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about and he's like,</v>

79
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.631
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

80
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:11.464
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a crush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like it's obvious that he does and </v>

81
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

82
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.691
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

83
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it was a heterosexual couple,</v>

84
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.773
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would never be a situation like </v>

85
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:22.301
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

86
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.050
<v Speaker 3>they've done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a pilot,</v>

87
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.893
<v Speaker 3>a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a crush on someone's wife for </v>

88
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

89
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 3>A hot neighbor moves in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

90
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:33.934
<v Speaker 3>But it is like where the guys like </v>
<v Speaker 3>admitting that he has a crush on the </v>

91
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 3>neighbor's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like latently,</v>

92
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 3>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

93
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:41.690
<v Speaker 3>it's more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell there's,</v>

94
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a heterosexual couple in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sitcom and a bunch of girls move in next</v>

95
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:48.994
<v Speaker 3>door and then the guys hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the girls and he has a crush on one of </v>

96
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 3>the girls and it's okay with this wife.</v>

97
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 3>She thinks it's kind of cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

98
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would never happen.</v>

99
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the husband,</v>

100
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never watched the show.</v>

101
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 3>So help me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the husband gay?</v>

102
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a gay couple.</v>

103
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.254
<v Speaker 3>So it came up a gay cop and a young and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a young college kids move in next door </v>

104
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.773
<v Speaker 3>and one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the gay couples crushing on the </v>

105
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.414
<v Speaker 3>guys that were one of the guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved in next door and it's kind of a </v>

106
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 3>cutesy crush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

107
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.813
<v Speaker 3>And they're really blatant about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he comes over and there's like </v>

108
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.294
<v Speaker 3>these moments of like he's being </v>
<v Speaker 3>flustered and I have nothing against </v>

109
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:33.814
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying you would never see </v>

110
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 3>that in a heterosexual couple on ABC now</v>
<v Speaker 3>on ABC.</v>

111
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Well I think some hardcore stuff right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

112
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 3>I think even though a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

113
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.473
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times gay couples will take </v>

114
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 3>like traditional sort of almost husband </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wife type roles.</v>

115
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really common for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

116
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.093
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys makes all the money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other guy sorta stays at home and </v>

117
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>maybe they even adopted kid and he like </v>
<v Speaker 3>raises like a mom.</v>

118
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Like yeah,</v>

119
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.143
<v Speaker 2>like it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think ultimately we still accept </v>

120
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 2>that gay guys are guys and the guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to be different.</v>

121
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>The same as like two girls becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian.</v>

122
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.993
<v Speaker 2>They're not going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like people aren't asexual </v>

123
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>if they're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

124
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:15.644
<v Speaker 2>So people becoming lesbians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would probably have a different </v>

125
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 2>attitude about monogamy than people </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming gay.</v>

126
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I would just imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 2>It seems like overall lesbians are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

128
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 2>they're letting love in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're monogamous.</v>

129
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.533
<v Speaker 2>It seems that when it seems like gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes are like open about not being </v>

130
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 2>monogamous and Nicola [inaudible] I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know too much.</v>

131
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know too many lesbians that </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I've gone deep into their life.</v>

132
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 2>More monogamous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like generally lesbians or more</v>

133
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:44.774
<v Speaker 2>girly and monogamous love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like super weird about asking </v>

134
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 2>that kind of shit to a lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a gay dude.</v>

135
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I could ask a gay dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

136
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Justin Martindale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could ask that dude anything.</v>

137
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Generally wilder ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

138
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.583
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are like guys and girls are like </v>

139
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're lesbians or gay dudes.</v>

140
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.203
<v Speaker 2>You right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the girls like a super like </v>

141
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 2>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

142
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:07.780
<v Speaker 2>like a male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

143
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 2>butchy gay girls generally still don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel comfortable asking him.</v>

144
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 2>like how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might get offended.</v>

146
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>There's not lesbians meeting each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bathrooms.</v>

147
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not girls doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

148
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Generally it's usually these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they push each other into a stall and </v>

149
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 2>they started making out the heterosexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

150
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of strip clubs in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States are for men?</v>

151
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more [inaudible].</v>

152
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 2>There's like one chippendale's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the county shit.</v>

153
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.170
<v Speaker 2>You got to do some research and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're only open on,</v>

154
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta make your reservations and </v>

155
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>shit the fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different experience.</v>

156
00:07:56.181 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Like when girls go to see men strip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they scream,</v>

157
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 2>they scream and they throw money in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>air,</v>

158
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 2>they get crazy and they'll rub their </v>
<v Speaker 2>face on the dude's dicks.</v>

159
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Like girls at Bachelorette parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

160
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it because they don't go as much?</v>

161
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Like as often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 2>in the agreement they could go off on </v>
<v Speaker 2>bachelor parties and they're not.</v>

163
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to say shit.</v>

164
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like what happens at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bachelorette party stays there.</v>

165
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.833

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This dude,</v>

234
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 3>oh dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the fucking shit goes down,</v>

235
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 3>go to Darin crookshanks house and ask if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get it.</v>

236
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.320
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking look at another video </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

237
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.420
<v Speaker 3>he's got a picture of all these Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls staring at his package lasering in</v>

238
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 3>on his dick like agenda is what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

239
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Then he's killing it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

240
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a hilarious picture </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

241
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 3>He's a funny dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

242
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.063
<v Speaker 3>And I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the UFC figured out how </v>

243
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to recognize that.</v>

244
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:42.783
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how many dudes that you see fight </v>

245
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 3>or like kind of almost like the on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside it's like the bland,</v>

246
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 3>like everyone's the same because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get to know them.</v>

247
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.780
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to know like all their </v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdness.</v>

248
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's differently,</v>

249
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 3>it's flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's flat.</v>

250
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:00.994
<v Speaker 3>So you need a story but on a reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tune into the fight crunch has a </v>

251
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Speaker 3>great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great story man.</v>

252
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you think some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

253
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 3>had wore certain shorts and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize them by their shorts,</v>

254
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 3>like with soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rob,</v>

255
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 3>but he had the warrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flames and now,</v>

256
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.280
<v Speaker 3>now that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

257
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.240
<v Speaker 3>everybody's going to reebok,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes away some,</v>

258
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 3>a little value if what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

259
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:32.310
<v Speaker 3>If it said adding personality adds value</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the fighters,</v>

260
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 3>which adds value to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

261
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So actually letting them and encouraging</v>

262
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:38.890
<v Speaker 3>them and letting them get a rash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guards and shit.</v>

263
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:39.724
<v Speaker 3>You want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be the fight of the waiters </v>

264
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 3>or rash guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

265
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 3>it's not a problem in women's mma.</v>

266
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't see why it would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And men's MMA.</v>

267
00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 3>Tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show me the logic there.</v>

268
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.940
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should encourage fighters to,</v>

269
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.043
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where different Shit Melvin can imagine </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a big factor.</v>

275
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

276
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why they don't allow,</v>

277
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:11.584
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just haven't really thought about </v>

278
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's actually just sat them down.</v>

279
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 3>It's all the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Melvin manhoef when he fought k one,</v>

280
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.510
<v Speaker 3>he wore them gladiator type art and </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll go you one better.</v>

285
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Alexis Arguayo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

286
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 3>not a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stark whale.</v>

287
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>A Dennis Alexia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexia used to fight it.</v>

288
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 3>A grass skirt straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A straight up Hawaiian grass skirt.</v>

289
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald had like straight spartan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How bout,</v>

290
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.780
<v Speaker 3>how bout Shinay Yucky when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing them yellow tie to the rainbow.</v>

291
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:45.963
<v Speaker 3>He was known for a statue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't wait to see what's new about </v>

292
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.120
<v Speaker 3>collarbone and look that scary to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

293
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 2>shit allow that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't encourage that.</v>

294
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.630
<v Speaker 2>They're not cleaning product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dell had those blue shorts,</v>

295
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.150
<v Speaker 2>the iceman shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pink ones.</v>

296
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they wear uniforms,</v>

297
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to look more like every </v>
<v Speaker 2>other league though.</v>

298
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 2>But it's a man on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's personality on personality.</v>

299
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 2>It's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one dude.</v>

300
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.460
<v Speaker 2>So his personnel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one dude,</v>

301
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 2>that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's for dudes,</v>

302
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:16.750
<v Speaker 2>all their personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 2>once you get to know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become important,</v>

304
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.453
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the more you understand everybody in </v>

305
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>this case just to fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that making it,</v>

306
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you want to have a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sponsors it,</v>

307
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 2>that the two aren't mutually exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a company can't sponsor it</v>

308
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 2>and still have dope shorts that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different for each fighter.</v>

309
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:38.930
<v Speaker 2>We have someone design their own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have,</v>

310
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same like you have read and I have </v>

311
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 2>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why correct.</v>

312
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows you're you.</v>

313
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows you're you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

314
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Who are we confused?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do we,</v>

315
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 2>who's the Red Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right guy on top?</v>

316
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Who's the blue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The WHO's winning?</v>

317
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.033
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it takes away from the </v>

318
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:54.044
<v Speaker 2>sport when you make everyone looked the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same like in the nfl or something like </v>

319
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:57.554
<v Speaker 2>that total because what people buy into </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fighting and it's true with box and </v>

320
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:01.664
<v Speaker 2>it's true with mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to know why they should watch </v>

321
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:04.994
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you can put a fight on access tv </v>

322
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.230
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know nothing about them,</v>

323
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.040
<v Speaker 2>they don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get the ratings.</v>

324
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.690
<v Speaker 2>But he loves cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

325
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.630
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

326
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.080
<v Speaker 2>his story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his story.</v>

327
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:15.914
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know we know John Jones story now </v>

328
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 2>because this has been going through all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazy shit and we know cyborg story</v>

329
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.753
<v Speaker 2>and it could take to kick this thing off</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you want to talk about or not </v>

330
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 2>and you let me know.</v>

331
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.443
<v Speaker 2>But with Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine just put yourself in her shoes </v>

332
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:32.810
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine having the biggest fight of your</v>

333
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 2>life ever and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>

334
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.813
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's looking for a specialty or </v>
<v Speaker 2>female fighter because you get so much </v>

335
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:39.644
<v Speaker 2>notoriety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get all the camera's pointed at you </v>

336
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.163
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you finally get to hear your story and </v>

337
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 2>she has a great story and then he can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do interviews.</v>

338
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 2>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no promotion.</v>

339
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to show your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do interviews.</v>

340
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Speaker 2>There should be no open workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being her right now.</v>

341
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

342
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 2>the good news is she can concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight and just constant.</v>

343
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.443
<v Speaker 2>The the would always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that and the good news for </v>

344
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda is that she can also just </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate and the fight,</v>

345
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 2>but she doesn't have to do any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>

346
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I liked that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like is,</v>

347
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.333
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we have to respect what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion is and it doesn't matter if </v>

348
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you're the most famous person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still the champion.</v>

349
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.663
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are the champion of a giant </v>

350
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:29.021
<v Speaker 2>organization like the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how about she's the first openly gay</v>

351
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:32.520
<v Speaker 2>women's MMA champion ever or amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stolen champion.</v>

352
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:33.803
<v Speaker 2>I'm a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never been an openly gay mma </v>

353
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:36.644
<v Speaker 2>champion and she's fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like she doesn't have a </v>

354
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:40.994
<v Speaker 2>highlight reel and it's not like she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing a hold of these girls and just </v>

355
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:46.550
<v Speaker 2>sort of winning by staying on top and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

356
00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:48.950
<v Speaker 2>So there's no highlights you can pull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

357
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>she knocks girls out</v>

358
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 4>and choke them unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's very good.</v>

359
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 4>So it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an exciting technical match up.</v>

360
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 4>It's an exciting story with Ronda coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>back after being out for over a year.</v>

361
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.120
<v Speaker 4>There's so much exciting shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to concentrate only on one person to</v>

362
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 4>sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that that person is huge.</v>

363
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 4>I understand that person's the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

364
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 4>She's probably right up there with </v>
<v Speaker 4>connor.</v>

365
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 4>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They both go back and forth.</v>

366
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 4>What do you think conor is bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not an argument.</v>

367
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

368
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 4>I would agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

369
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.700
<v Speaker 4>I would lean towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point is let's,</v>

370
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.220
<v Speaker 4>with one victory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she could get launched right into that,</v>

371
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.310
<v Speaker 4>that place again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a weird thing,</v>

372
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're,</v>

373
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:35.601
<v Speaker 4>you're a super talented person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>also this giant personality figure.</v>

374
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

375
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 4>it's more than just a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

376
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 4>It becomes his personality figure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for common like that,</v>

377
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:45.204
<v Speaker 4>that his whole shit talking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>marketing and he sends out a tweet to </v>

378
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 4>sell the fight.</v>

379
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Part of being a fighter is selling the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

380
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 4>See what you want about floyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>mayweather.</v>

381
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.893
<v Speaker 4>There's not an interviewer camera heat </v>
<v Speaker 4>in it looked towards to sell that </v>

382
00:18:57.331 --> 00:19:00.550
<v Speaker 4>Pacquiao fight cause in the end it helps</v>
<v Speaker 4>the company helps.</v>

383
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.810
<v Speaker 4>It puts more money in your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it helps sponsorship everything.</v>

384
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.630
<v Speaker 4>You can't say anything about floyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you were one of those girls.</v>

385
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.830
<v Speaker 4>You smacked that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's part of the Gig.</v>

386
00:19:11.891 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to sell the fight.</v>

387
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:13.824
<v Speaker 4>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think Rhonda is the favorite in </v>

388
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:17.934
<v Speaker 4>this matchup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she has to create these scenarios </v>

389
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:23.250
<v Speaker 4>where it's me against the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's me against you.</v>

390
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 4>Sure she's creating and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a big marketing push.</v>

391
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 4>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

392
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.073
<v Speaker 4>this is the new owners of the UFC and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is this and this is the really </v>

393
00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:31.744
<v Speaker 4>banjo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is this really a cinematic </v>

394
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.120
<v Speaker 4>thing that we're missing the boat on.</v>

395
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 4>What would definitely mention the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers will prove it.</v>

396
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:41.940
<v Speaker 4>I bet you we'll definitely miss the boat</v>
<v Speaker 4>on promoting Amanda,</v>

397
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.030
<v Speaker 4>that that for a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't think it was like a pretty</v>

398
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 4>exciting promo piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw that Promo piece that got me fired</v>

399
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the good thing is that it's like</v>

400
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 4>it's really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very well done.</v>

401
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gift,</v>

402
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.370
<v Speaker 4>it's a garage door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think this fight has as much promos?</v>

403
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Speaker 4>Say UFC two oh five in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

404
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:02.723
<v Speaker 4>no I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or The conor fight cause I didn't know </v>

405
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:06.390
<v Speaker 4>because no one's doing interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

406
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.450
<v Speaker 4>no I 100% completely agree with you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that point but part of me likes,</v>

407
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.433
<v Speaker 4>I want to see what happens when the pay </v>
<v Speaker 4>per view numbers come out because part </v>

408
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 4>of me likes that the fighters aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be bothered.</v>

409
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you need to bother them as</v>
<v Speaker 4>much as they get bothered.</v>

410
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.773
<v Speaker 4>I think when connor was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was pissed off about it when all those </v>

411
00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:24.924
<v Speaker 4>pissed off button will always different </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters who were doing these crazy </v>

412
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 4>tours are pissed off about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>promotion thing.</v>

413
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:29.703
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea about it as you trying to get </v>

414
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:33.030
<v Speaker 4>the word out to as many people as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>

415
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.893
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know if like that the price </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they pay and being distracted from </v>

416
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Speaker 4>their training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's 100% worth it.</v>

417
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about a world tour where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

418
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:44.041
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

419
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:46.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm coming off the loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nate Diaz is a tough fight for me.</v>

420
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 4>One 70 I need everything</v>

421
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.963
<v Speaker 2>I can do to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get this fight and get my mind right </v>

422
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 2>with Rhonda helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that it helps these,</v>

423
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 2>these big promo tours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

424
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.770
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

425
00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.201
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

426
00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you need to go all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the frickin world and promote it,</v>

427
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.490
<v Speaker 2>but there needs to be some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

428
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.050
<v Speaker 2>publicity done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The for,</v>

429
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 2>for Rhonda especially,</v>

430
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 2>I think her as a role model for females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get kicked in the face,</v>

431
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:14.794
<v Speaker 2>take your ball and go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want our champ to be like connor or </v>

432
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 2>someone where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want back in there,</v>

433
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:21.380
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gimme gimme the fuck back in there.</v>

434
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.293
<v Speaker 2>I need this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's cool that obviously </v>

435
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda doesn't want all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's as famous as you can be.</v>

436
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.420
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone just said,</v>

437
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

438
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:35.260
<v Speaker 2>they'd let her just have her piece and </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on the fight.</v>

439
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I personally don't really watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>

440
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:39.844
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch that press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't even know how important it </v>

441
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I care about is that fight.</v>

442
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.010
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once the fight happens,</v>

443
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.810
<v Speaker 2>give me a little prod you a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>promo.</v>

444
00:21:46.811 --> 00:21:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Give me a little our promo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be like,</v>

445
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 2>you know anything fancy.</v>

446
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.350
<v Speaker 2>We're balls deep in it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the casual fan.</v>

447
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.543
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's a casual fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has no idea she was fighting this </v>

448
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

449
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 2>So for the casual fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I would think that it would</v>

450
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:02.734
<v Speaker 2>make a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will watch espn and well that </v>

451
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.510
<v Speaker 2>that's who buys paper views Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to get that,</v>

452
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 2>to get that 60 $70 and here casual fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to be sold on.</v>

453
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:12.904
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like you own a piece of the </v>

454
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:16.810
<v Speaker 2>UFC right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making good points.</v>

455

<v Speaker 2>Making very good points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being fun.</v>

456
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.001
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I hear you that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are making very good points.</v>

458
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.840
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my issue is in,</v>

459
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:25.690
<v Speaker 2>in Ron can do her thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't,</v>

460
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a conflict of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my,</v>

461
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 2>here's my cousin called me Gregor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

462
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Cause conor goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

465

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

466
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Ronnie goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing shit.</v>

467
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.693
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

468
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Different different owners now.</v>

469
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

470
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Different owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however different approach.</v>

471
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a different business and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of things are changing.</v>

472
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 2>They're changing the change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

473
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:53.570
<v Speaker 2>but also wme who owns the UFC manages </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey.</v>

474
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't manage conor mcgregor.</v>

475
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a conflict of interest there.</v>

476
00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

477
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.220
<v Speaker 2>it depends because it's just a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>

478
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.670
<v Speaker 2>The only people that should be upset or </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the other people,</v>

479
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.683
<v Speaker 2>what cody garbrandt and dominick Cruz </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't restricted from doing any </v>

480
00:23:08.001 --> 00:23:08.661
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

481
00:23:08.661 --> 00:23:10.370
<v Speaker 2>They're doing everything they can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell the fight.</v>

482
00:23:10.371 --> 00:23:11.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

483
00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:13.280
<v Speaker 2>They're going to sell them for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for fuck's sake.</v>

484
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I for Fox steep in it for short balls </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep.</v>

485
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.510
<v Speaker 2>The casual fans going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying,</v>

486
00:23:17.511 --> 00:23:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spend $70 for those small guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now to me it's the number one five.</v>

487
00:23:21.741 --> 00:23:22.574
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's the number one flight on the </v>

488
00:23:23.481 --> 00:23:24.314
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love cody is my number one fight </v>

489
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.200
<v Speaker 2>rendered wants his promos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

490
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 2>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>

491
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:29.651
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

492
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:30.810
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I what?</v>

493
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.770
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't added to the UFC to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing and uh,</v>

494
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.633
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes with the territory you got to </v>

495
00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:37.850
<v Speaker 2>sell yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you offer the fighters?</v>

496
00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll don't you think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>respecting their wishes like Rhonda just</v>

497
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is the exact reason why she's famous</v>

498
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 2>as she is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay</v>

499
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.620
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>

500
00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:49.454
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to only do press </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you were in camp like that media </v>

501
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 4>exists after the fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is easy for,</v>

502
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 4>for everybody just talk after the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>

503
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.603
<v Speaker 4>But during the training and preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a giant distraction is going to </v>

504
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:02.114
<v Speaker 4>take a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It did a decision if someone's as rich </v>

505
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:09.551
<v Speaker 4>and as famous as Rhonda is a decision to</v>
<v Speaker 4>favor performance over finances.</v>

506
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.943
<v Speaker 4>So like maybe she'll make less money but</v>
<v Speaker 4>she thinks that she'll be more focused </v>

507
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 4>on a performance would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

508
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 4>I love that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think really well when you're a really</v>

509
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:23.800
<v Speaker 4>wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful athlete like her,</v>

510
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 4>you can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

511
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.773
<v Speaker 4>I think when you get to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to decide whether you're going </v>

512
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:30.164
<v Speaker 4>to focus on making more money and </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly being less focused and </v>

513
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:34.244
<v Speaker 4>distracted and maybe tired or even maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>get sick cause you're doing a lot of </v>

514
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 4>traveling versus only dedicate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>to training.</v>

515
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 4>He do all the fucking videos you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put all the promos you want.</v>

516
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing shit for the next eight </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>

517
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:48.650
<v Speaker 4>So then where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to sell the fight?</v>

518
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:50.980
<v Speaker 4>If everyone has that mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that,</v>

519
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 4>is that the rule now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

520
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.773
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're saying because </v>

521
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 4>the old way is not the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do both ways.</v>

522
00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 4>You could do whatever way you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can go side.</v>

523
00:24:59.150 --> 00:24:59.983
<v Speaker 4>They could decide that they're a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>promo pieces that they could put </v>

524
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:05.240
<v Speaker 4>together without interviews are enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could fly.</v>

525
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.260
<v Speaker 4>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>

526
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 4>they could just fly to her for two days </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview or at our training camp.</v>

527
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 4>That's what they did for telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they take off.</v>

528
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Tony was in big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

529
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.470
<v Speaker 4>really never left big bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came to him.</v>

530
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.750
<v Speaker 4>It was no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

531
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.430
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she definitely could do that.</v>

532
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Or she could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

533
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I just want to completely focus and </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see how this works.</v>

534
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.910
<v Speaker 4>Her thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that she thinks the media backstabbed</v>

535
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.753
<v Speaker 4>her and that's why she won't do an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview like they turned on and when </v>

536
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:32.600
<v Speaker 4>she lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a very emotional person.</v>

537
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.360
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why she's so good.</v>

538
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.460
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she's a very emotional,</v>

539
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 4>to me it sounded like my voice was </v>
<v Speaker 4>cracking up.</v>

540
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 4>I swear it roadmap the Cryo or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation,</v>

541
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

542
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.680
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to me it's,</v>

543
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 4>if you're a a Rhonda Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you break the site down,</v>

544
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.620
<v Speaker 4>there's an that there's a huge x factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What frame of mind is Rhonda?</v>

545
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.770
<v Speaker 4>If she won't even face interview.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

546
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe that's,</v>

547
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.843
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe she's the most folks she's ever </v>

548
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:06.120
<v Speaker 4>been or maybe she just can't deal with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the question.</v>

549
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.300
<v Speaker 4>The Fra after the last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

550
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

551
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's the only one who knows,</v>

552
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like you said,</v>

553
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:17.930
<v Speaker 4>famous is fuck lives in a mansion a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Amanda.</v>

554
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about little for her?</v>

555
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 4>She should absolutely be able to do as </v>
<v Speaker 4>many interviews she won,</v>

556
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.490
<v Speaker 4>but she might not want to either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She might want to say,</v>

557
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

558
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to focus entirely on fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronda to look.</v>

559
00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:31.430
<v Speaker 4>This might be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be better this way.</v>

560
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.440
<v Speaker 4>It's just like we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight cutting before.</v>

561
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.780
<v Speaker 4>It might be better if people didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking cut way.</v>

562
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Look up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn good.</v>

<v Speaker 4>around like 176 pounds.</v>

566
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 2>He's not cutting shit and he looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking amazing.</v>

567
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 2>He's head kick in Matt Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know he's,</v>

568
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.460
<v Speaker 2>he's running through every book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony doesn't cut that much either.</v>

569
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor,</v>

570
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 2>55 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys,</v>

571
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an advantage.</v>

572
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.190
<v Speaker 2>That's a big acid vantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

573
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:01.741
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>

574
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree hugely,</v>

575
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think the way cut like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's benefits to it.</v>

576
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you're going to be bitter when</v>

577
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:09.444
<v Speaker 2>you get inside the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the performance hit that your body </v>

578
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 2>takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Its super arguable at a certain level.</v>

579
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a point of diminishing returns </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of these guys pass through,</v>

580
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 2>but then there's a few fucking examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Damien Maia,</v>

581
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia cuts a lot of weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just rushing people.</v>

582
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Johnson and Johnson's cutting </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much weight at two oh five bro.</v>

583
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I think he might be 10 15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Sir.</v>

584
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.190
<v Speaker 2>You're really good at two 22 two eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

585
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I think he looks really happy as Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's my offense as much.</v>

586
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:43.640
<v Speaker 2>For a big guy like that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for saying he's,</v>

587
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 pounds,</v>

588
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:45.234
<v Speaker 2>20 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 pounds is different when you're a </v>

589
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:48.340
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight for light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>

590
00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.630
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lean too.</v>

591
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's jacked.</v>

592
00:27:51.991 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Who's who's doing in March?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A flight and Damien Maia,</v>

593
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:55.824
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're waiting to see the </v>

594
00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:59.430
<v Speaker 2>shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woodley Woodley.</v>

595
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:01.140
<v Speaker 2>If Woodley and wonderboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a rematch.</v>

596
00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Woodley's campaigning for a fight with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz,</v>

597
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.490
<v Speaker 2>which I would love to see Woodley get </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking paid too.</v>

598
00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like what he's doing.</v>

599
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to get paid.</v>

600
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 2>She is just the big names to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see it happen.</v>

601
00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like his initiative.</v>

602
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

603
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:18.721
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

604
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:19.950
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

605
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

606
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.540
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are all fucking amazing fights.</v>

607
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to see him versus GSP.</v>

608
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell people to lose your number.</v>

609
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.133
<v Speaker 2>Tell them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lose your number if you don't want to </v>

610
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:36.770
<v Speaker 2>see that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't want to see that fight.</v>

611
00:28:36.771 --> 00:28:37.604
<v Speaker 2>That's the sport though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want the biggest name possible with </v>

612
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:40.104
<v Speaker 2>the highest pay day because either way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably getting punched in the </v>

613
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:42.370
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

614
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 2>but also I want to see the runnable </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderboy rematch.</v>

615
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.383
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do but I'm not upset with any of the </v>

616
00:28:47.191 --> 00:28:50.280
<v Speaker 2>other seds or GSP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>

617
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.143
<v Speaker 2>I'm even on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm even on Diaz GSP or the wonderboy </v>

618
00:28:54.061 --> 00:28:54.894
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't be mad at you and wonder boys </v>

619
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad motherfucker dude.</v>

620
00:28:57.091 --> 00:28:57.924
<v Speaker 2>And when he was in that guillotine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't and it looked like his head was </v>

621
00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>literally going to be body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

622
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.573
<v Speaker 2>He Ha maybe his neck is so small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what tyler was saying that his </v>

623
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>neck is so small you got to like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>squeeze it.</v>

624
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Someone else was saying that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his neck is so small.</v>

625
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.833
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he can like make more room because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's harder to get a really tight </v>

626
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:26.150
<v Speaker 2>squeeze on it cause Woodley had some big</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass arms make up for it.</v>

627
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Woodley also said that he's got a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>head so his head could pop out easier.</v>

628
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

629
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.843
<v Speaker 2>A small head myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an advantage not will not when you </v>

630
00:29:35.531 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 2>get punched in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got some crazy alex caceres do</v>

631
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 2>that has gotta be an advantage to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy hanging on for real.</v>

632
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:42.634
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean to Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you get Alex because Sarah's in</v>

634
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:45.724
<v Speaker 2>a canteen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of shit he's got to </v>

635
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 2>go through on a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like my head was like,</v>

636
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>growing the same kind of facial hair </v>

697
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he gets on top of you get to Zeke eal</v>

698
00:32:22.871 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

702
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.300
<v Speaker 2>does he rolled that up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a brown belt and he's huge.</v>

703
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:36.300
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] sec guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big fucking deal.</v>

704
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 2>He's not five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

705
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.880
<v Speaker 2>no giant dude sons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even bigger.</v>

706
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Does he put it in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

707
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.470
<v Speaker 2>like a chin been like a man bun thing?</v>

<v Speaker 2>you'd have to put like a thing over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

709
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe in underneath the chin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then again that would kind of get in</v>

710
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine the braids like could be</v>

711
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 2>avoided just like other kinds of braids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's Rondo biting his braids.</v>

<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

767
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:00.050
<v Speaker 2>but he was very good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>knows a lot of his Jujitsu brown belt,</v>

770
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.380

<v Speaker 2>who's the under the,</v>

771
00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:10.100
<v Speaker 2>under Cesar Gracie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

772
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's a legit,</v>

773
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.043
<v Speaker 2>one of the important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they train like Mccarthy's rolling all </v>

774
00:35:16.611 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 2>the time so they know what positions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look for.</v>

775
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:19.754
<v Speaker 2>Transitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny how those northern </v>

776
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:25.010
<v Speaker 2>California guys are known as like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard style Jujitsu guys.</v>

777
00:35:25.011 --> 00:35:25.844
<v Speaker 2>Like how Caesar and you know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start talking about like those </v>

778
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:30.014
<v Speaker 2>northern California Jujitsu schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how fun is always had a reputation of </v>

779
00:35:33.801 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 2>like if you go like a of frowning upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping,</v>

780
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.760
<v Speaker 2>you tapped in front of house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the story.</v>

781
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:43.620
<v Speaker 2>It can be totally blown out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion,</v>

782
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.670
<v Speaker 2>but US training down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

783
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 2>with Jacques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we heard,</v>

784
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.590
<v Speaker 2>we heard the crazy stories about how if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

785
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 2>that he looked down on tapping like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta you gotta escape.</v>

786
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about Dave [inaudible],</v>

<v Speaker 2>He came from that same camp that </v>

789
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 2>hardstyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a total myth though.</v>

790
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.601
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she hits it,</v>

809
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.560
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're hixon black </v>
<v Speaker 2>belts.</v>

810
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.670
<v Speaker 2>They're really game too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

811
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Like at the Gracie Academy of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Hixon guys go up there.</v>

812
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are game,</v>

813
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:58.550
<v Speaker 2>the chrome chrome's kicks and he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a cut above the elite.</v>

814
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.623
<v Speaker 2>Like Hixon is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone says when they rolled hixon or </v>

815
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day that they were just </v>

816
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 2>completely immobilized and dismantle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has their hixon story.</v>

817
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.060
<v Speaker 2>And you look at chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chrome,</v>

818
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:16.650
<v Speaker 2>very few Jujitsu players like crone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crone got a serious full guard,</v>

819
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:20.100
<v Speaker 2>serious guilt guillotine and his full </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard attacks.</v>

820
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:20.934
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that that much in </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling and the more someone with a </v>

821
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 2>full guard that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crohn's got that Crohn's,</v>

822
00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Crohn's or a little bit different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>your average elite.</v>

823
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.820
<v Speaker 2>You should see his workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was doing a,</v>

824
00:37:31.821 --> 00:37:32.654
<v Speaker 2>a grappling competition chromos on at </v>
<v Speaker 2>two so I trained with him for like a </v>

825
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:37.860
<v Speaker 2>week at a school in Culver City there.</v>

826
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do these two,</v>

827
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.510
<v Speaker 2>two and a half hour workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Cardio was insane.</v>

828
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 2>What kind of shit was he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would do this crazy warm up,</v>

829
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 2>crazy warm up and we go over position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

830
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:52.050
<v Speaker 2>position and then it was like a king of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hill.</v>

831
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.070
<v Speaker 2>We'd match up and however long it took </v>
<v Speaker 2>until someone got submitted,</v>

832
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.143
<v Speaker 2>then the two guys would be at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the rest of the map with stare and </v>

833
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 2>watch those two guys at the end.</v>

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.840

<v Speaker 2>He's the rare exception.</v>

863
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 2>He has the mentality because you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who though Chavez Jr.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that kind of pedigree,</v>

866
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 2>it usually doesn't correlate.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're usually like kind of soft or </v>

868
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>they're missing a few things there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The discipline was not just not there.</v>

869
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:25.450
<v Speaker 2>It just didn't quite have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline as his dad,</v>

870
00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:27.430
<v Speaker 2>but he was still talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to party though,</v>

<v Speaker 2>greatest,</v>

877
00:39:44.501 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 2>if not the greatest with Mexican boxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion of all time.</v>

878
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Julio Cesar Chavez is a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he fought Meldrick Taylor,</v>

879
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:52.723
<v Speaker 2>remember that fight man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meldrick Taylor was lightning limpic </v>

880
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:58.750
<v Speaker 2>gold medalist during the heyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mark Braelin heyday.</v>

881
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Remember those guys to that whole crew </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Olympic gold medals.</v>

882
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Pernell whitaker and Meldrick Taylor was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just lightning.</v>

883
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 2>So just hit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These ridiculous combinations.</v>

884
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:10.483
<v Speaker 2>Chavez just kept slugging away bobbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and weaving and rip it to the body and </v>

885
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:15.230
<v Speaker 2>slugging away.</v>

886
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Cause you ever see his fights outdoor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mexico?</v>

887
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen most of them.</v>

888
00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:19.323
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a fucking call a [inaudible] </v>

889
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Algun o in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back to the Meldrick Taylor fight.</v>

890
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I remember.</v>

891
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 2>This is what I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Controversy in the first fight.</v>

892
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 2>The end of the round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks,</v>

893
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.980
<v Speaker 2>it looks like Meldrick Taylor was </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning.</v>

894
00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:36.814
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was stealing the fight and then at </v>

895
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:41.410
<v Speaker 2>the end Chavez last round was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>him up,</v>

896
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:43.880
<v Speaker 2>had him against the ropes and the ref </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped it.</v>

897
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.420
<v Speaker 2>But that was only like two seconds left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Steele,</v>

898
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:47.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it go down like that?</v>

899
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:48.251
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

900
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:49.084
<v Speaker 2>Two seconds left to the 12th round and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he stopped the fight and he stopped the </v>

901
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:52.714
<v Speaker 2>fight because Malik went down hard and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got up and he was fucking out of it </v>

902
00:40:56.351 --> 00:40:58.690
<v Speaker 2>and still looked in his eyes and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>waved him off.</v>

903
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.310
<v Speaker 2>He said he would do it again too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

904
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if it's only two </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds off in the fight.</v>

905
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:03.004
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this guy is not fit to fight </v>

906
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

907
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 2>he got stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got him up.</v>

908
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:08.554
<v Speaker 2>He looked at his eyes and Mel Giotto was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at him and he asked him some </v>

909
00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 2>questions and Taylor wasn't answering </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he's like,</v>

910
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:13.474
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that in box elder cause beaten </v>

911
00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 2>him the whole fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in his credit,</v>

912
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Richard steals credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Myalgic tail was never the same again.</v>

913
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Never the same after that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was right.</v>

914
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.763
<v Speaker 2>He was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just was right in front of him </v>

915
00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 2>touching him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking him in the eye.</v>

916
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Cesar Chavez,</v>

917
00:41:30.401 --> 00:41:31.234
<v Speaker 2>Kaos Meldrick Taylor and this was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight where meldrick speed and footwork </v>

918
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 2>who he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was ahead.</v>

919
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:37.630
<v Speaker 2>It was a head on the scorecard.</v>

920
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.493
<v Speaker 2>He was getting the better of him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the fight that that ref </v>

921
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.810
<v Speaker 2>stop not fight in your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddie Roach talked about,</v>

922
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:42.644
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish my corner would have tossed in </v>

923
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:44.324
<v Speaker 2>the towel or the referee would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped in way sooner and a lot of my </v>

924
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:47.841
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

925
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:48.970
<v Speaker 2>well for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very loud.</v>

926
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Speaker 2>He took a lot of punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you asked him back then,</v>

927
00:41:51.681 --> 00:41:53.380
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted them to stop the fight,</v>

928
00:41:53.381 --> 00:41:54.214
<v Speaker 2>he might've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

929
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Look how good Chavez was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike God,</v>

930
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 2>he was so good with his angles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was our hero did.</v>

931
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.820
<v Speaker 2>He was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

932
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.733
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's the greatest Mexican boxer of all </v>

933
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:03.734
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

934
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:04.603
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was better than now where you could </v>

935
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:06.074
<v Speaker 2>learn so much watching his test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The greatest thing he throws in the </v>

936
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 2>thing he throws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like short and perfect.</v>

937
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 2>That was our chuck Norris.</v>

938
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 2>It was a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to fuck comparing Chuck Norris.</v>

939
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:17.714
<v Speaker 2>She was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a huge Chavez fan when he fought </v>

940
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Greg Haugen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy that said,</v>

941
00:42:23.361 --> 00:42:23.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

942
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:24.950
<v Speaker 2>he has got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause.</v>

943
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:29.951
<v Speaker 2>He was like a g tech drive is all his </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponents were taxi cab drivers.</v>

944
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His son has skills.</v>

945
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't have that it factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just not this guy.</v>

946
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.090
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

947
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:40.010
<v Speaker 2>the first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his son is a winger bombs,</v>

948
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:40.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a,</v>

949
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.510
<v Speaker 2>he's a hard striker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His son can fucking caissons.</v>

950
00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.080
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big boy.</v>

951
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 2>He's a Chavez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a different kind of fighter.</v>

952
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:49.184
<v Speaker 2>He was a much more volume fighter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>would throw perfect technique punches </v>

953
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.223
<v Speaker 2>and would never run out of fucking gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saint Lucie on you for 12 rounds </v>

954
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 2>throwing bombs on you and just never </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting up talking about it.</v>

955
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen his interviews?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

956
00:43:05.451 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 2>He's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty legit.</v>

957
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't speak Spanish.</v>

958
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:09.390
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard some here.</v>

959
00:43:09.391 --> 00:43:10.310
<v Speaker 2>It's with that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

960
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Take to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that left Hook,</v>

961
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

962
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.813
<v Speaker 2>let's get turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he turns him around and with that </v>

963
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 2>right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect right hand.</v>

964
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:18.583
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look Meldrick Taylor's down and the </v>

965
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.520
<v Speaker 2>referees counting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's eight,</v>

966
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.290
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

967
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

968
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.410
<v Speaker 2>These are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You okay?</v>

969
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 2>And he has no idea where he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won't respond.</v>

970
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Mel Gto doesn't know where he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Richard's still stops the fight.</v>

971
00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:34.640
<v Speaker 2>That is a correct call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great job.</v>

972
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.030
<v Speaker 2>We got mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're crazy.</v>

973
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:37.423
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause they thought he was gonna win the </v>

974
00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:39.500
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fight was over,</v>

975
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they let him hit him again,</v>

976
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Speaker 2>he might've died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously not make me.</v>

977
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be,</v>

978
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

979
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that comes from.</v>

980
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:50.383
<v Speaker 2>It comes from when a guy's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a boss who just died not just a </v>

981
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.580
<v Speaker 2>few months ago in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional boxer.</v>

982
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that they're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

983
00:43:58.431 --> 00:43:59.264
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to hbo commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like guys will be like hanging in there </v>

984
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:02.534
<v Speaker 2>in the fight and you'll heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max Kellerman say they could very </v>

985
00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:06.830
<v Speaker 2>reasonably make the case for stopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fight.</v>

986
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.090
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like he was just out class and he's </v>

998
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:30.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking done.</v>

1001
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about homeboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kell Brook.</v>

1002
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was getting,</v>

1003
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.780
<v Speaker 2>he was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't see out of his eye and his corn</v>

1004
00:44:40.781 --> 00:44:41.614
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 2>we was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golovkin yes,</v>

1006
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1007
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.300
<v Speaker 2>But to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1008
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.720
<v Speaker 2>the Kell Brook fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1009
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.573
<v Speaker 2>was a little bit controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Loma Chanko fight was much more </v>

1010
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:51.271
<v Speaker 2>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1011
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Where most people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>

1012
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he really was thinking,</v>

1013
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:55.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neglect.</v>

1014
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:56.663
<v Speaker 2>He just quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Nicholas Walters was undefeated </v>

1015
00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 2>before this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had,</v>

1016
00:44:59.160 --> 00:44:59.993
<v Speaker 2>he had taken some time off apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was supposed to be like a big </v>

1017
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:04.950
<v Speaker 2>test for limit Chenko and then even Max </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kellerman,</v>

1018
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 2>he goes in the ring and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1019
00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:09.600
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as a box in kind of sore,</v>

1020
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>usually go out on your shield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you really weren't getting hit.</v>

1021
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1022
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:15.264
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a left hand in that and that </v>

1023
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:17.210
<v Speaker 2>wobbled me.</v>

1024
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.671
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1025
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:18.610
<v Speaker 2>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1026
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.060
<v Speaker 2>can you give us the time round anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1027
00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:21.591
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1028
00:45:21.591 --> 00:45:22.321
<v Speaker 2>I was hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1029
00:45:22.321 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 2>That's why I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even,</v>

1030
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:25.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac telling me see how many boxes of </v>

1031
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:26.694
<v Speaker 2>matches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's the fucking Joe Rogan of </v>

1032
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1033
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:30.631
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

1034
00:45:30.631 --> 00:45:33.870
<v Speaker 2>this is going to hurt your career man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're saying all those years he put</v>

1035
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:34.704
<v Speaker 2>into finally establish himself and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fight and then you quit and then </v>

1036
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.580
<v Speaker 2>there's really no damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

1037
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.630
<v Speaker 2>it was like mighty mouse just all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1038
00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.320
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no answer and just like,</v>

1039
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to get embarrassed.</v>

1040
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I think he was getting hit a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than that.</v>

1041
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:51.263
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think Loma Chanko was really </v>

1042
00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:53.390
<v Speaker 2>laying into him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>

1043
00:45:53.391 --> 00:45:54.224
<v Speaker 2>Well what Brown did they stop at seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh round to fight the round before </v>

1044
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1045
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.820
<v Speaker 2>So it was at the end of the seventh how </v>
<v Speaker 2>does that work?</v>

1046
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Or is it the beginning of the seventh he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't come out to his corner.</v>

1047
00:46:02.311 --> 00:46:03.960
<v Speaker 2>So it a 77 answer the bell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1048
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:04.794
<v Speaker 2>For the seventh so it was the six round </v>
<v Speaker 2>Loma Chanko was just putting it to a </v>

1049
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.553
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just really getting on him and I </v>

1050
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:11.760
<v Speaker 2>think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw the end,</v>

1051
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1052
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.190
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even hit this guy.</v>

1053
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1054
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:16.554
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely never beating him as </v>

1055
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fighter.</v>

1056
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 2>And most other other fighters will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that guy.</v>

1057
00:46:21.031 --> 00:46:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have a fighter's heart that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be in there.</v>

1058
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1059
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I think both arguments could be made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1060
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:28.943
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1061
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I would lean more towards yours because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you never know.</v>

1062
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.101
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1063
00:46:32.101 --> 00:46:32.934
<v Speaker 2>Chavez is getting outclassed earlier in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight with Meldrick Taylor and he </v>

1064
00:46:35.641 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 2>never gave up.</v>

1065
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.133
<v Speaker 2>He kept chipping away and people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>define you based on how quickly you're </v>

1066
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:44.310
<v Speaker 2>willing to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the skill level,</v>

1067
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know who learned lemme?</v>

1068
00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:50.070

1069
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.830

1076
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:06.540
<v Speaker 2>it's more technical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more skilled for sure.</v>

1084
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 2>so hard for people to hit him clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just just so technical.</v>

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.083
<v Speaker 6>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where I could see your argument </v>

1094
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:45.330
<v Speaker 6>much more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1095
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 6>it's not like walters didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>occasionally connect.</v>

1096
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.053
<v Speaker 6>It's just for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Loma Chanko is connecting more than him </v>

1097
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.780
<v Speaker 6>walks up to him to make a decision to </v>
<v Speaker 6>just opt out to look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you can't say he's not getting hit.</v>

1100
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.560
<v Speaker 6>He's getting fucking hit.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Lemme Chanko is all over him here,</v>

1103
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:08.080
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it makes sense.</v>

1104
00:48:08.081 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 6>He was a medal winner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He sees the end man.</v>

1116
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 6>I see his point too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At the end he looked like he was getting</v>

1117
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:34.174
<v Speaker 6>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish you could've gotten into a </v>

<v Speaker 6>And then he knocked him through the </v>

1155
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 6>ropes with an Abrie much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

1156
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.031
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think,</v>

1157
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:09.070
<v Speaker 6>I think Hopkins has done cause that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>dangerous.</v>

1158
00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:12.610
<v Speaker 6>The way felt like that she fell and </v>
<v Speaker 6>landed on his fucking head man.</v>

1159
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.970
<v Speaker 6>And no wonder why he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

1160
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.290
<v Speaker 6>you can't hold him accountable for </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything he's saying right now.</v>

1161
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.153
<v Speaker 6>That guy clearly landed on his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>head after taking some really solid </v>

1162
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:24.070
<v Speaker 6>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You guys know the rule on that.</v>

1163
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 6>If he get knocked out of the ring?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1164
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:26.960
<v Speaker 6>22nd,</v>
<v Speaker 6>22nd.</v>

1165
00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To jump back</v>

1166
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.940
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

1167
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.710
<v Speaker 2>why did he have ropes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1168
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:31.544
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why don't have a mesh in between </v>

1169
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:34.760
<v Speaker 2>those ropes where that can't fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1170
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 2>But this guy never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it does happen.</v>

1171
00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 2>It's happened before it happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1172
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

1173
00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray Mercer fight.</v>

1174
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:43.063
<v Speaker 2>Remember when Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Morrison got tangled up in the </v>

1175
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:47.230
<v Speaker 2>ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his arms went through the ropes.</v>

1176
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.800
<v Speaker 2>You guys have fallen out of the ropes </v>
<v Speaker 2>before he's fallen out of the road.</v>

1177
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:54.040
<v Speaker 2>This isn't the first time a huge fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The camera man should be fired or beat </v>

1179
00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.433
<v Speaker 2>when he went backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people can fall through the </v>

1180
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:00.950
<v Speaker 2>ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't happen that often.</v>

1181
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 2>But when you get tagged like he did and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he stepped on his foot to Yo,</v>

1182
00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:05.260
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>

1183
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.160
<v Speaker 2>he was getting lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back on a 79 just calm.</v>

1184
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1185
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even see it unless I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>retarded.</v>

1186
00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:13.853
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1187
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.380
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

1188
00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1189
00:51:16.521 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1190
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 2>he didn't start charging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm retarded.</v>

1191
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I thought he stepped on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to pay attention to everything</v>

1192
00:51:21.351 --> 00:51:22.184
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was a vicious fucking </v>

1193
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:23.924
<v Speaker 2>combination and the reason why he went </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the ropes is because his legs </v>

1194
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:29.450
<v Speaker 2>were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave out when his butt was down and</v>

1195
00:51:29.451 --> 00:51:32.060
<v Speaker 2>then he got clipped again and his body </v>
<v Speaker 2>just went limp.</v>

1196
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:36.530
<v Speaker 2>He also went through the ropes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that left fucking hook from Rhode Island</v>

1197
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:40.430
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a pushover fascination.</v>

1198
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.273
<v Speaker 2>Not The way you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you the worst part about </v>

1199
00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 2>that was him fallen on his fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of it's,</v>

1200
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 2>that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible.</v>

1201
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:48.163
<v Speaker 2>How do they not have pads down there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they not have some sort of a </v>

1202
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that's possible.</v>

1203
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people fight on a platform,</v>

1204
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.030
<v Speaker 2>that's a bad at anything.</v>

1205
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have pads down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they should do.</v>

1206
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.940
<v Speaker 2>They should absolutely have like judo </v>
<v Speaker 2>crash pads.</v>

1207
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:03.680
<v Speaker 2>How hard would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1208
00:52:03.681 --> 00:52:06.320
<v Speaker 2>have that shit as a buffer in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tables.</v>

1209
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.213
<v Speaker 2>Have everybody pushed back a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck the fact that that can happen </v>

1210
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:14.540
<v Speaker 2>to a guy like hopkins has been fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as he is scary,</v>

1211
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:15.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:16.910
<v Speaker 2>He asked to be done now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1213
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Speaker 2>because that was his doors damage he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever taken.</v>

1214
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he's done.</v>

1215
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.710
<v Speaker 2>He was thinking that he's never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>

1216
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:22.643
<v Speaker 2>That exchange was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just for the punches because he </v>

1217
00:52:24.631 --> 00:52:25.464
<v Speaker 2>still takes a great fucking punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've went down from the punches </v>

1218
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:29.450
<v Speaker 2>and got up and even survive the round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True,</v>

1219
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.180
<v Speaker 2>but landed on your head like that is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bueno.</v>

1220
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's scary to watch him.</v>

1221
00:52:34.391 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 2>And he got a died there for sure.</v>

1222
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Damn as twice I brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So extreme punished.</v>

1223
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.073
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't stop being so extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that you guys care deeply </v>

1224
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:47.200
<v Speaker 2>about fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd love them.</v>

1225
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Well 51 year old fallen out of the ring </v>
<v Speaker 2>on concrete on his head and he's like,</v>

1226
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.020
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on Mount Rushmore for boxing.</v>

1227
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I think you gotta give him credit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking that fight because that guy,</v>

1228
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 2>he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1229
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.133
<v Speaker 2>He thought he saw something in him that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he might be able to exploit and he was </v>

1230
00:53:02.541 --> 00:53:03.374
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money did he get for that </v>

1231
00:53:04.101 --> 00:53:07.040
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>$7 72 like,</v>

1232
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:09.620
<v Speaker 2>like 5 million or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

1233
00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Cause you want me to a million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1 million.</v>

1234
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he has a deal with HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golden boy productions to right.</v>

1235
00:53:14.781 --> 00:53:18.740
<v Speaker 2>And he's a part of golden boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a promoter and he got 1 million.</v>

1236
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:20.460
<v Speaker 2>It's worth though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He may falls.</v>

1237
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.593
<v Speaker 2>Not if you've guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you made him a million to is a lot </v>

1238
00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 2>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be fine.</v>

1239
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:27.900
<v Speaker 6>But he already has millions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1240
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bernard is a wealthy guy still.</v>

1241
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 6>Even if it doesn't matter if he has 10 </v>
<v Speaker 6>million,</v>

1242
00:53:31.351 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 6>if he made a million for that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>him falling on his head like that,</v>

1243
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 6>but not if he's never the same again </v>
<v Speaker 6>Eddie,</v>

1244
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 6>if your brain trauma or $1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's like saying people would line up,</v>

1245
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:41.780
<v Speaker 6>say you've never done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>never had any brain trauma.</v>

1246
00:53:41.781 --> 00:53:44.460
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1247
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so no you haven't.</v>

1248
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 6>It leads to severe depression that </v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes people never get out of.</v>

1249
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.880
<v Speaker 6>There's all sorts of real huge issues </v>
<v Speaker 6>with your hormonal system.</v>

1250
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 6>Like you're essentially compromising the</v>
<v Speaker 6>quality of your life forever.</v>

1251
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:01.000
<v Speaker 6>I play peewee or certain circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that count 100% no,</v>

1252
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:01.853
<v Speaker 6>that was not Arizona with helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I know people that have been Kao </v>

1253
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:07.080
<v Speaker 6>that were essentially never the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

1254
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.130
<v Speaker 6>$800,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>he made one not that is,</v>

1255
00:54:10.131 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was worth,</v>

1256
00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 6>it was worth it.</v>

1257
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if that's the whole purse </v>
<v Speaker 6>because that might be just like dad paid</v>

1258
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 6>for the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of money,</v>

1259
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:17.484
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>

1260
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:18.543
<v Speaker 6>It might have got a percentage of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know the promotion because he's the </v>

1261
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:21.954
<v Speaker 6>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

1262
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 6>It's a Monterey.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even 2 million.</v>

1263
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 6>A guy like Bernard Hopkins is not worth </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1264
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.303
<v Speaker 6>The problem is the way landed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't just the punches that he took </v>

1265
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 6>because he's so skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's good at like moving.</v>

1266
00:54:30.751 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 6>Wish he was definitely going out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1267
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:34.920
<v Speaker 6>That left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his legs were going out.</v>

1268
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 6>He got clipped,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he got hit with hammers.</v>

1269
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.090
<v Speaker 6>He was going out using shots before that</v>
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

1270
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:41.070
<v Speaker 6>But if he went down in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ring,</v>

1271
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 6>we might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1272
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:43.464
<v Speaker 6>like maybe he could survive the round or</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe the referee is going to stop the </v>

1273
00:54:45.751 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He definitely wouldn't have taken that.</v>

1274
00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:50.940
<v Speaker 6>The real issue was his whole body was </v>
<v Speaker 6>limp when he fell.</v>

1275
00:54:50.941 --> 00:54:52.830
<v Speaker 6>He just went right through stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 6>watch.</v>

1276
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 6>That's awful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1277
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 6>Just put some netting in it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1278
00:54:56.881 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 6>Make it so that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1279
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:59.743
<v Speaker 6>But you remember how the Old School </v>
<v Speaker 6>Valley Tuto days used to have a net in </v>

1280
00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:03.020
<v Speaker 6>the bottom rope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.710
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was pretty dope.</v>

1282
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.693
<v Speaker 6>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't have to be that ridiculous </v>

1283
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:10.260
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause that was like the vans outside the</v>

1284
00:55:10.261 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 6>ring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like wwe,</v>

1285
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:14.170
<v Speaker 6>it seems like those ropes were a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>loose too.</v>

1286
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.230
<v Speaker 6>We could fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ropes were definitely loose.</v>

1287
00:55:16.231 --> 00:55:17.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not good.</v>

1288
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:17.963
<v Speaker 6>That's a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That might've been something that </v>

1289
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:19.944
<v Speaker 6>Bernard liked so he can move,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know like Bernard is really good at </v>

1290
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:27.750
<v Speaker 6>like moving away from Shit and if he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>contained up against like a hard rope,</v>

1291
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.390
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't have that ability to drill in</v>
<v Speaker 6>this stuff.</v>

1292
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.333
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know like the best fighters who </v>

1293
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:34.194
<v Speaker 6>are really good at like utilizing the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ropes would like lean back away from </v>

1294
00:55:37.771 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 6>punches on the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And again it's golden boy promotions.</v>

1295
00:55:41.761 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 6>So I'm sure he had some say in that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's good point.</v>

1296
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:48.150
<v Speaker 6>The kid is a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well he also thought his last fight,</v>

1297
00:55:48.151 --> 00:55:52.110
<v Speaker 6>he fought a cofa live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's taken on two killers in a row.</v>

1298
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:53.603
<v Speaker 6>Cova live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you really think you're going to </v>

1299
00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:55.784
<v Speaker 6>beat that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's why we love Bernard </v>

1300
00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:58.890
<v Speaker 6>Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But God,</v>

1301
00:55:58.980 --> 00:55:59.813
<v Speaker 6>that's just shows you where a champion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that guy is that he took those two </v>

1302
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:02.634
<v Speaker 6>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he decided to take the crusher and </v>

1303
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:07.470
<v Speaker 6>then this kid who is a relative unknown </v>
<v Speaker 6>to most people,</v>

1304
00:56:07.471 --> 00:56:10.140
<v Speaker 6>but super super.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who's got one?</v>

1305
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.500
<v Speaker 6>One?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1306
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.040
<v Speaker 6>he's super fucking name huge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's huge.</v>

1307
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:16.610
<v Speaker 6>And he throws bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I don't get it though,</v>

1308
00:56:16.611 --> 00:56:18.180
<v Speaker 6>cause it was a great job at Hbo.</v>

1309
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doing commentating.</v>

1310
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.890
<v Speaker 6>He's 51 what else do you need to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Roy Jones is the same.</v>

1311
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:25.000
<v Speaker 6>Roy Jones a flight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a Turkey,</v>

1312
00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 6>fine on some weird like live streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just get wax in the next week.</v>

1313
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 6>I think Roy Jones owes a lot of money in</v>
<v Speaker 6>taxes.</v>

1314
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.633
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I had read that he owed </v>

1315
00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 6>millions of dollars in taxes from when </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was champ.</v>

1316
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 6>Maybe he got bad financial advice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the instances were,</v>

1317
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.960
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's why he does it.</v>

1318
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a bummer.</v>

1319
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to balance because it's like,</v>

1320
00:56:49.481 --> 00:56:52.960
<v Speaker 6>why are you fighting this random Russian</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's in Russia now.</v>

1321
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.910
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he's a Russian citizen.</v>

1322
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.531
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:56:56.531 --> 00:56:59.710
<v Speaker 6>Roy Jones Jr is a Russian citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He lives in Florida too though.</v>

1324
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:01.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Might as well be Russia.</v>

1325
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:02.403
<v Speaker 6>They can have it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1326
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My sister lives there.</v>

1327
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.030
<v Speaker 6>Let's just do that on site.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hurl families there.</v>

1328
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.130
<v Speaker 6>It's just weird yet I do is fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1329
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:13.750
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kovalev is,</v>

1330
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:15.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's fucking district.</v>

1331
00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:16.750
<v Speaker 6>He's out of Florida too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's been trained.</v>

1332
00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 6>He actually didn't he train up here for </v>
<v Speaker 6>the last one?</v>

1333
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:20.410
<v Speaker 6>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he trained in Oxnard.</v>

1334
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.510
<v Speaker 6>Roy Jones Jr officially becomes Russian </v>
<v Speaker 6>citizen with Moscow passport ceremony.</v>

1335
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that crazy.</v>

1336
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:30.003
<v Speaker 6>You know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's probably just enjoying his life </v>

1337
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:33.250
<v Speaker 6>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Having a good time.</v>

1338
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.080
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just hard to see.</v>

1339
00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:36.123
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got to accept who he is now and </v>

1340
00:57:37.631 --> 00:57:40.810
<v Speaker 6>not think of who he is now versus who he</v>
<v Speaker 6>used to be.</v>

1341
00:57:40.811 --> 00:57:41.830
<v Speaker 6>Impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:42.664
<v Speaker 6>That's what it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because one of the things that like </v>

1343
00:57:44.291 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 6>disturbed me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy sounds so fucked up,</v>

1344
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:50.680
<v Speaker 6>disturb me about his last knockout loss </v>
<v Speaker 6>was how his body looked.</v>

1345
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.440
<v Speaker 6>I was looking at his body and I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1346
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.480
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is Roy Jones Jr.</v>

1347
00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:56.613
<v Speaker 6>He looked like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He looked like he was not fit and it's </v>

1348
00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:00.274
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not an age thing because Bernard </v>

1349
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 6>looked really fit when he fought Joe </v>
<v Speaker 6>Smith Jr Bernard look very fit.</v>

1350
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:08.190
<v Speaker 6>He didn't look like he did when he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>30 no,</v>

1351
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 6>but he looked very fit and he looked in </v>
<v Speaker 6>shape,</v>

1352
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like when we were looking at Chavez,</v>

1353
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:14.800
<v Speaker 6>Chavez never looked [inaudible].</v>

1354
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:15.663
<v Speaker 6>He never looked like Melvin manhoef.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know Julio Cesar Chavez was like </v>

1355
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.920
<v Speaker 6>fairly smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like this Jack Dude.</v>

1356
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's still murder guys.</v>

1357
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:27.850
<v Speaker 6>So I feel like what we saw with Roy </v>
<v Speaker 6>though was different thing.</v>

1358
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 6>It's like this can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he can't be working out like harsh,</v>

1359
00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.650
<v Speaker 6>just shown up and talking to Murk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These guys such so skilled and it's been</v>

1360
00:58:35.651 --> 00:58:36.484
<v Speaker 6>doing it for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he probably feels like he's got a </v>

1361
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:40.750
<v Speaker 6>certain amount of boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see that knockout wasn't good.</v>

1362
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.490
<v Speaker 6>And another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he fought,</v>

1363
00:58:42.491 --> 00:58:44.860
<v Speaker 6>he fought a fucking killer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He fought a straight up killer.</v>

1364
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:46.143
<v Speaker 6>See the UFC would never allow that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like say like if [inaudible] wanted to </v>

1365
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:51.730
<v Speaker 6>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No Sir.</v>

1366
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:52.623
<v Speaker 6>Well done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's one of the benefits of Dana </v>

1367
00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 6>being your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1368
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:57.130
<v Speaker 6>like Dana does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't want to have,</v>

1369
00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.740
<v Speaker 6>he just does not want to be a part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1370
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:01.240
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I care about him.</v>

1371
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't want him fighting again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's right.</v>

1372
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they'd let any of those </v>
<v Speaker 6>old timers come back to him.</v>

1373
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:07.211
<v Speaker 6>Well that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1374
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:10.720
<v Speaker 6>the problem is you can't tell someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>what they can and can't do.</v>

1375
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're grown ass man.</v>

1376
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.790
<v Speaker 6>But you also have to realize at a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain point in time,</v>

1377
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.983
<v Speaker 6>like fight that that ego that a fighter </v>
<v Speaker 6>has and it's hard to say who's who's </v>

1378
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 6>right</v>

1379
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.813
<v Speaker 2>and who's wrong because like they said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that about Bernard Hopkins when he </v>

1380
00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 2>fought Kelly Pavlik with fuck Kelly </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pavlik they said he was done.</v>

1381
00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:32.330
<v Speaker 2>That was such the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just such the exemption by alien.</v>

1382
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.280
<v Speaker 2>But because he was that exception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to watch some crazy fights.</v>

1383
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.173
<v Speaker 2>But think of now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think about the other exceptions </v>

1384
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:41.310
<v Speaker 2>that it never worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1385
00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.600
<v Speaker 2>the difference is also Bernard had never</v>
<v Speaker 2>been knocked out before.</v>

1386
00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.590
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a really skillful,</v>

1387
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 2>technically like really difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit,</v>

1388
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.300
<v Speaker 2>but it also would diminish the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your product,</v>

1389
00:59:50.301 --> 00:59:54.160
<v Speaker 2>like the UFC would never have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>coleman come back or Don Frye,</v>

1390
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I think of Joe Montana came back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shall pass.</v>

1391
00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 2>What about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like that spice huge.</v>

1392
01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was huge.</v>

1393
01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.750
<v Speaker 2>But you know that fight was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a man.</v>

1394
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.673
<v Speaker 2>It's like at a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to see a certain amount </v>

1395
01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:11.390
<v Speaker 2>of deterioration from your champs.</v>

1396
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see Jerry Rice catching </v>
<v Speaker 2>passes right now.</v>

1397
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:17.000
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking bad knees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All dudes fight.</v>

1398
01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not let them fire all?</v>

1399
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:21.410
<v Speaker 2>We're so worried about their distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to fight.</v>

1400
01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:22.244
<v Speaker 2>Let them fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember when Ray Mercer fought </v>

1401
01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Larry Holmes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitch,</v>

<v Speaker 2>lie homes was like 46 or some shit.</v>

1403
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:30.404
<v Speaker 2>Then we're not going to let you find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old Larry Holmes was when he fought </v>

1404
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:33.944
<v Speaker 2>ray mercer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is after Mike Tyson and marked </v>

1405
01:00:35.251 --> 01:00:36.084
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Mike Tyson burped him and then Mike </v>

1406
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Tyson went to jail and then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as that mother fuckers in jail,</v>

1409
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:50.710
<v Speaker 2>He was honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fuck the Kings in jail.</v>

1410
01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>They case the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well it was all here.</v>

1412
01:00:55.101 --> 01:00:55.934
<v Speaker 2>Everyone had when they fought Mike Tyson</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those early days I would have loved </v>

1413
01:01:00.141 --> 01:01:02.480
<v Speaker 2>to have seen Larry Holmes in his prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1414
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've got marlene,</v>

1415
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Psalm 42 oh that's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1416
01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:09.104
<v Speaker 2>That's a different 42 though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not like a 42 in 2016 that's in </v>

1417
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:16.811
<v Speaker 2>1992 42 zero new Mexican supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So totally different.</v>

1418
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's totally different deal set.</v>

1419
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 2>A 42 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heck crazy.</v>

1420
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.273
<v Speaker 2>We don't even think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I homes gotta be in his late </v>

1421
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.060
<v Speaker 2>sixties or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think he retired when he was like</v>

1422
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:31.903
<v Speaker 2>51 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had like a fight like in his </v>

1423
01:01:34.371 --> 01:01:37.340
<v Speaker 2>fifties but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry Holmes in his prime,</v>

1424
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>like the Larry Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucked up Muhammad Ali.</v>

1425
01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:42.910
<v Speaker 2>He would give anyone a run for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>money here.</v>

1426
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:47.070
<v Speaker 2>He helped big day where that was the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Muhammad Ali.</v>

1427
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.010
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're definitely right.</v>

1428
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:49.844
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about like a vintage or </v>

1429
01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you talked about fucking George Foreman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys are so big man.</v>

1430
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:59.600
<v Speaker 2>But you look at like Larry's body here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the same body that he had.</v>

1431
01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Like when he fought Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doughy or,</v>

1432
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:03.404
<v Speaker 2>and he had like a little bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually it doesn't look bad right </v>

1433
01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man doesn't look bad right here.</v>

1434
01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.590
<v Speaker 2>This looks like the Larry Holmes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought Mike Tyson,</v>

1435
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.130
<v Speaker 2>which was like hangs down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1436
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.250
<v Speaker 2>you look good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1437
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:14.084
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but little slower than he was when he </v>

1438
01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 2>was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray Mercer was always a fucking murderer</v>

1439
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:18.740
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1440
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 2>He was scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray Mercer</v>

1441
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 6>started late in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't he a military guy?</v>

1442
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:29.060
<v Speaker 6>He started in thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Olympic gold medalist and boxing and uh,</v>

1443
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 6>we did it from the army.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a bad motherfucker dude.</v>

1444
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 6>And he hit hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But Larry Holmes,</v>

1445
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 6>once the Fight War on got that Jab,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whenever I think back to these fights,</v>

1446
01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.053
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always think those guys hit so much </v>

1447
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:44.370
<v Speaker 6>harder than guys now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1448
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.180
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were knockout artists and,</v>

1449
01:02:46.181 --> 01:02:47.014
<v Speaker 6>and knock out artist like ray mercer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He could be a knockout RC in any </v>

1450
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 6>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Larry Holmes,</v>

1451
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 6>he would give fucking anybody today a </v>
<v Speaker 6>run for their money.</v>

1452
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.700
<v Speaker 6>Anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anthony,</v>

1453
01:02:56.701 --> 01:02:58.500

<v Speaker 6>he would fuck up a lot of these guys.</v>

1454
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:00.600
<v Speaker 6>Ben Klitschko,</v>

<v Speaker 6>which is like 80 today.</v>

1460
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.430
<v Speaker 6>Go full screen and then just go to like </v>
<v Speaker 6>the middle of the fight,</v>

1461
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:20.881
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

<v Speaker 6>good.</v>

1464
01:03:23.581 --> 01:03:24.870
<v Speaker 6>Larry Holmes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look back here,</v>

1465
01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:26.940

<v Speaker 6>I'll look at his movement.</v>

1466
01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:27.774
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

1467
01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.610

<v Speaker 6>way faster.</v>

1468
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.430
<v Speaker 6>And look at his head movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nasty Fucking Jab.</v>

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.030
<v Speaker 6>That's a different Muhammad Ali though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1470
01:03:34.031 --> 01:03:34.864
<v Speaker 6>it is different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Muhammad Ali and it's a different Larry </v>

1471
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:38.930
<v Speaker 6>Holmes till this is Larry Holmes who was</v>
<v Speaker 6>a punisher like look at he's,</v>

1472
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.773

<v Speaker 6>them with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Larry Holmes was a bad motherfucker </v>

1474

<v Speaker 6>And he fought smart too.</v>

1475
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:48.804
<v Speaker 6>I mean he respected Ali and just what </v>
<v Speaker 6>systematically beat him down and it was </v>

1476
01:03:52.081 --> 01:03:56.620
<v Speaker 6>hard to watch because Ali was way past </v>
<v Speaker 6>his prime way past his punch.</v>

1477
01:03:56.621 --> 01:03:59.910
<v Speaker 6>A bummer man.</v>

1478
01:03:59.911 --> 01:04:02.970
<v Speaker 6>were absolutely sure that Ali was </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He was built so weird and he went up to </v>

1494
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:48.774
<v Speaker 6>heavyweight after that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any fucked a lot of guys at five seven </v>

1495
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.510
<v Speaker 6>Dwight Kawi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure he's five seven.</v>

1496
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:55.231
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

1497
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:57.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe I'm exaggerating that.</v>

1498
01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:58.643
<v Speaker 6>I think he was literally an inch shorter</v>
<v Speaker 6>than me and he was fighting as a light </v>

1499
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.484
<v Speaker 6>motherfucking heavyweight and a </v>
<v Speaker 6>heavyweight and cruise cruiserweight is </v>

1500
01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:08.220
<v Speaker 6>really where it started.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One 95 but he was at tank.</v>

1501
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:12.180
<v Speaker 6>He's was like this fucking jacked up </v>
<v Speaker 6>looking who some are Paul Harris looking</v>

1502
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:13.680

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1503
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:14.370
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

1504
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:14.880
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1505
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.530
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it was supplements back </v>
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>

1506
01:05:16.531 --> 01:05:18.090
<v Speaker 6>I think five,</v>
<v Speaker 6>six years,</v>

1507
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.710
<v Speaker 2>five six that was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a short one.</v>

1508
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:23.110
<v Speaker 2>90 but wa watch him fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1509
01:05:23.111 --> 01:05:27.220
<v Speaker 2>It was just so weird because he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous big powerful guy.</v>

1510
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Look at Vendor Holyfield Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the lien of Ander.</v>

1511
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Holyfield coming out of the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunt yelling at him.</v>

1512
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different evander.</v>

1513
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 2>This was skinny young evander,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look at coffee man.</v>

1514
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:45.301
<v Speaker 2>Just just this tank of a dude short and </v>
<v Speaker 2>throws these looping over hand shots and</v>

1515
01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you're always punching down on and look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the size difference man and just hard</v>

1516
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>as nails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hard as nails.</v>

1517
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ball.</v>

1518
01:05:53.421 --> 01:05:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Just like fucking give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1519
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here to Slang Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sling some leather.</v>

1520
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Look at his socks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lesson,</v>

1521
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:08.970
<v Speaker 2>1990 sweat socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were killing it back then.</v>

1522
01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:09.853
<v Speaker 2>Cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a totally different approach </v>

1523
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 2>because he was so short for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>division.</v>

1524
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.360
<v Speaker 2>When you watched him fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like confusing.</v>

1525
01:06:15.361 --> 01:06:16.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't never seen this before.</v>

1526
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Like holy field was be like two feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>taller than him at points because cow.</v>

1527
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:22.294
<v Speaker 2>We also fought crouched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he had moved in tight guard crouched </v>

1528
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Tyson style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1529
01:06:28.661 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 2>he had his own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mad.</v>

1530
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:30.544
<v Speaker 2>A lot of bobbing and weaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have the same sort of </v>

1531
01:06:32.261 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 2>combination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruthless punching style that Tyson did.</v>

1532
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Tyson could just fuck you up with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot and he knew it.</v>

1533
01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:42.730
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] was like a Mauler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would maul you like that right there.</v>

1534
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 2>But he's fighting guys way bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1535
01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:48.670
<v Speaker 2>You know Tyson was probably like five 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1536
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.533
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere on there.</v>

1537
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still Short.</v>

1538
01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Still Short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still Short,</v>

1539
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 2>but a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1540
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:57.760

1543
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.793

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1544
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was huge.</v>

1551
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo and I both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1552
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:27.070
<v Speaker 2>we were huge boxing fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you're still,</v>

1553
01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.260
<v Speaker 2>he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1554
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I can't get [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stopped him,</v>

1555
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:34.600
<v Speaker 2>look at that and he stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been talking about boxing for an hour.</v>

1556
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Poli field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man in his prime,</v>

1557
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped.</v>

1558
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.180
<v Speaker 2>That was the second time they fought </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

1559
01:07:43.181 --> 01:07:45.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when Kylie was older.</v>

1560
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:46.743
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one was the revenge fight </v>

1561
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.010
<v Speaker 2>because in the first fight they went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>war and a cow.</v>

1562
01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:56.890
<v Speaker 2>We and Evander Holyfield went to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but cow,</v>

1563
01:07:56.891 --> 01:08:00.560
<v Speaker 2>we wound up losing the decision and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like a big fight for a vendor.</v>

1564
01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>So that was the second one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

1565
01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I thought I clicked too quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Tim Fighting George Foreman.</v>

1566
01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 2>George Foreman versus cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We how ridiculous is that?</v>

1567
01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.950
<v Speaker 2>So George Foreman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fod.</v>

1568
01:08:11.951 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Kali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kali was five six.</v>

1569
01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:16.610
<v Speaker 2>George Foreman's fucking hands were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot wide.</v>

1570
01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:20.630
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No thought he fought at 50 didn't me.</v>

1571
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won the title at 46 you know what to</v>

1572
01:08:23.301 --> 01:08:24.890
<v Speaker 2>say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Former hardest hitter of all time.</v>

1573
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that Michael's prime,</v>

1574
01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.860
<v Speaker 2>that you're forming fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

1575
01:08:29.861 --> 01:08:31.700
<v Speaker 2>So this is the first Gulf war with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>punch.</v>

1576
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 2>This was when Kylie was younger and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a really close fight.</v>

1577
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.553
<v Speaker 2>This is the different fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second fight of was just on a </v>

1578
01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:40.880
<v Speaker 2>totally different level and [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>was older,</v>

1579
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:43.790
<v Speaker 2>but [inaudible] he used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas his waist,</v>

1580
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:47.900
<v Speaker 2>his pants rather as his belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way the fuck up high.</v>

1581
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.590
<v Speaker 2>The straps of his shorts were like way </v>
<v Speaker 2>above his belly button.</v>

1582
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:54.710
<v Speaker 2>He looks like the blue guy or the green </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt from Monsters Inc.</v>

1583
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just the whole body then.</v>

1584
01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.080
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot to hit now and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little fire hydrant,</v>

1585
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 2>but this is like holy fields first big </v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

1586
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.040
<v Speaker 2>But see if you can go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1587
01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:06.290
<v Speaker 2>that other fight that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1588
01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Lean holyfield his man there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so skinny.</v>

1589
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:10.543
<v Speaker 2>What was the other five?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burke Cooper go holyfield burke coover </v>

1590
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.940
<v Speaker 2>holyfield burke hoover was crazy war and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like 1991,</v>

1591
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Burke Cooper was a bad mother fucker</v>

1592
01:09:22.981 --> 01:09:25.490
<v Speaker 2>smoking burt that go go deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight here.</v>

1593
01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Young Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of,</v>

1594
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1595
01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Eventually Kill Them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More rocked up here.</v>

1596
01:09:30.201 --> 01:09:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Son Per Cooper was a savage man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knocked motherfuckers out too.</v>

1597
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:37.370
<v Speaker 2>He's a vicious power puncher and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like a sort of a make or break fight</v>

1598
01:09:37.371 --> 01:09:38.204
<v Speaker 2>for him because a lot of people thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that burke crew like Burke Cooper could </v>

1599
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:43.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck it crack.</v>

1600
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:45.853
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people thought that Burke </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooper had a shot at being like one of </v>

1601
01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:48.914
<v Speaker 2>the top guys and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the fight that separated these </v>

1602
01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:53.240
<v Speaker 2>two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just an awesome fight,</v>

1603
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:54.060
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GRC,</v>

1604
01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.500
<v Speaker 2>some Jessia vantage crib in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a house.</v>

1605
01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.693
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tell her your campus like a </v>

<v Speaker 6>Southern Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ron White's pretty dirty.</v>

1674
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.000
<v Speaker 6>Ron White has this whole bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1675
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.200
<v Speaker 6>how when he was in the navy stationed in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hawaii,</v>

1676
01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.253
<v Speaker 6>he kept,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was getting his dick sucked by </v>

1677
01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:00.360
<v Speaker 6>hookers and you'd know they were girls.</v>

1678
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:01.583
<v Speaker 6>They were boys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He thought that there were girls the </v>

1679
01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:03.654
<v Speaker 6>whole time until like years later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was watching some show about during </v>

1680
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:11.520
<v Speaker 6>the 1970s when he was there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all these transvestite hookers that were</v>

1681
01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:15.630
<v Speaker 6>operating in this one block that he used</v>
<v Speaker 6>to go like every day to get my dentist.</v>

1682
01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:18.750
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got my dick sucked by about 150.</v>

1683
01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:19.584
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's talking about it last week on the </v>

1684
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:27.114
<v Speaker 6>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you haven't heard the Ron White </v>

1685
01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:28.950
<v Speaker 6>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen to that shit.</v>

1686
01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:31.050
<v Speaker 6>He's a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a brilliant story teller.</v>

1687
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:33.960
<v Speaker 6>He's from stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stand up and he's such a good dude.</v>

1688
01:13:33.961 --> 01:13:35.390
<v Speaker 6>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's uh,</v>

1689
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:37.170
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the blue country guy.</v>

1690
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a dirty country guy for sure,</v>

1691
01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:40.080
<v Speaker 6>but there's college.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those guys,</v>

1692
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.070
<v Speaker 6>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just I think um,</v>

1693
01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:46.350
<v Speaker 6>with when it comes to like what we think</v>
<v Speaker 6>of as country,</v>

1694
01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 6>like we think of as the south,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1695
01:13:48.211 --> 01:13:50.940
<v Speaker 6>I think people who live in cities are </v>
<v Speaker 6>very prejudiced of it.</v>

1696
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.660
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's the same thing today </v>
<v Speaker 6>as it was 20 years ago.</v>

1697
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:58.490
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows things now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1698
01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.680
<v Speaker 6>Everybody understands things way better </v>
<v Speaker 6>now than they ever did before.</v>

1699
01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.880
<v Speaker 6>Like if you lived in like a West </v>
<v Speaker 6>Virginia in the 1970s,</v>

1700
01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.670
<v Speaker 6>you probably,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you lived in a real rural coal mining</v>

1701
01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:09.660
<v Speaker 6>community or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1702
01:14:09.661 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good luck getting any sort of access</v>

1703
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 4>to any information other than what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>right in front of you in your town.</v>

1704
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:17.103
<v Speaker 4>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you've got a phone and everybody </v>

1705
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.880
<v Speaker 4>cell tells you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just check your phone and go,</v>

1706
01:14:21.881 --> 01:14:23.310
<v Speaker 4>well that's not really true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1707
01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 4>I just googled it and Stephen Hawkins </v>
<v Speaker 4>says that this,</v>

1708
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Ooh and you will these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can be way more informed today than</v>

1709
01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:31.384
<v Speaker 4>they were back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think when people think of the </v>

1710
01:14:32.831 --> 01:14:33.664
<v Speaker 4>rural south as being like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was a part of a problem </v>

1711
01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:36.664
<v Speaker 4>with this last election.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people thought like </v>

1712
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.433
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain people that live in </v>

1713
01:14:42.281 --> 01:14:45.220
<v Speaker 4>certain places that are just stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1714
01:14:45.221 --> 01:14:45.511
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1715
01:14:45.511 --> 01:14:49.180
<v Speaker 4>the red states and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people are ignorant who'd say,</v>

1716
01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.033
<v Speaker 4>and they proved it with the election.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the problem with even saying that </v>

1717
01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:58.021
<v Speaker 4>is people don't like when certain people</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk shit about them,</v>

1718
01:14:58.570 --> 01:14:59.403
<v Speaker 4>they don't like it.</v>

1719
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:00.460
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes them feel bad.</v>

1720
01:15:00.461 --> 01:15:02.380
<v Speaker 4>If you make fun of people live in West </v>
<v Speaker 4>Virginia,</v>

1721
01:15:02.381 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 4>like I just did people in West Virginia </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get pissed off right there.</v>

1722
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the same people anymore.</v>

1723
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:09.383
<v Speaker 4>Like our ideas of these like spots of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the country where they don't have </v>

1724
01:15:13.181 --> 01:15:15.580
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to let go of that idea.</v>

1725
01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:16.803
<v Speaker 4>Like there's depth there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely like leaning more right in </v>

1726
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:21.100
<v Speaker 4>some places than left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that makes sense.</v>

1727
01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:21.934
<v Speaker 4>But there's still a ton of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that get it in these places that </v>

1728
01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 4>didn't exist just 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah cause it,</v>

1729
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:31.940
<v Speaker 4>especially to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the smartphones,</v>

1730
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.800
<v Speaker 4>like everyone thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1731
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:35.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what's going on out there?</v>

1732
01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:37.240
<v Speaker 4>But they're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy.</v>

1733
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even bring up Google or whatever,</v>

1734
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.400
<v Speaker 4>any news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my dad and I,</v>

1735
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.273
<v Speaker 4>my dad's in town,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know argument and he's up against </v>

1736
01:15:43.551 --> 01:15:45.070
<v Speaker 4>some point and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh cool.</v>

1737
01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:46.510
<v Speaker 4>Just went on my phone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1738
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And end up discussion.</v>

1739
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:50.680
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know what you want to do.</v>

1740
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:53.703
<v Speaker 4>Well people just have these ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their head and they've had them for a </v>

1741
01:15:55.811 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1742
01:15:57.701 --> 01:16:00.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you live in a rural community and you</v>

1743
01:16:00.101 --> 01:16:00.934
<v Speaker 4>don't have the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just stick with those ideas </v>

1744
01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:03.424
<v Speaker 4>and those ideas will be transferred onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>your kids and transfer it onto their </v>

1745
01:16:05.981 --> 01:16:07.090
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

1746
01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:08.530
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>

1747
01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:09.364
<v Speaker 4>If you live in a tough spot like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you live in a bad place filled with </v>

1748
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:15.500
<v Speaker 4>dumb people and there's no new stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming in,</v>

1749
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:16.343
<v Speaker 4>you got to get the fuck out and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even know how you're going to get </v>

1750
01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:18.880
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you're,</v>

1751
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:22.600
<v Speaker 4>if you just don't have access like North</v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea and they just have no fucking clue</v>

1752
01:16:22.601 --> 01:16:23.434
<v Speaker 4>what's cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what they were making them do for </v>

1753

<v Speaker 4>North Korea with Kim Jong rooms making </v>
<v Speaker 4>them do on Christmas.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he makes people worship the mother of </v>

1755
01:16:30.341 --> 01:16:31.210
<v Speaker 4>the revolution.</v>

1756
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.343
<v Speaker 4>The his grandmother who was the wife of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first dictator of North Korea who </v>

1757
01:16:37.841 --> 01:16:38.674

<v Speaker 4>1949 and so like he is so anti </v>

1758

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.550
<v Speaker 4>the mother of the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fullest.</v>

1763
01:16:57.551 --> 01:16:58.384
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You estimate 18 Korean cities disappear </v>

1764
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 4>during that war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that and that's why he,</v>

1765
01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean 18 cities disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean the war</v>

1766
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.570
<v Speaker 3>on the Korean war between bombed 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities in the North Korea?</v>

1767
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the hole,</v>

1768
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.890
<v Speaker 3>that's when the regime started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1769
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:20.650
<v Speaker 3>the Korean War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1770
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:23.830

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1771
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>fifties in the 50s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some June does a weird war,</v>

1772
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people don't really talk about that</v>

1773
01:17:30.531 --> 01:17:31.600
<v Speaker 3>one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the,</v>

1774
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:33.200
<v Speaker 3>but they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1775
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.320
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a documentary about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1776
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 3>how doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1777
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 3>they're allowed to go into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1778
01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:39.933
<v Speaker 3>everyone's Korean and fix people's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give them like a month and these </v>

1779
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:43.993
<v Speaker 3>doctors from China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come in and they do the cataract </v>

1780
01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:49.640
<v Speaker 3>surgery and his assistant snuck in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a journalist.</v>

1781
01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:51.590
<v Speaker 3>She posed as an assistant just to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1782
01:17:51.591 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 3>just to get some footage of on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>

1783
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:55.340
<v Speaker 3>So it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1784
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:57.080
<v Speaker 3>it is fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And North Korea,</v>

1785
01:17:57.081 --> 01:17:59.630
<v Speaker 3>it's weird as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that guy is crazy as fuck.</v>

1786
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 3>But at the top of that documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was not pro North Korea,</v>

1787
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:06.170
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was anti North Korea.</v>

1788
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.153
<v Speaker 3>But at the very top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she's breaking down with the </v>

1789
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.310
<v Speaker 3>documentaries about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1790
01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:11.144
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she mentioned how 18 cities evaporated </v>

1791
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 3>in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's war son.</v>

1792
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.863
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wonder there's so much hate for the </v>

1793
01:18:20.031 --> 01:18:23.780
<v Speaker 3>fucking dus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What their issue is,</v>

1794
01:18:23.781 --> 01:18:24.614
<v Speaker 3>their issue was their dictator is </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruthless and is dominating them with </v>

1795
01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:29.330
<v Speaker 3>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He bases it on that,</v>

1796
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.510
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing it against his own people.</v>

1797
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:35.490
<v Speaker 3>What he's doing is imprisoning his </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire country.</v>

1798
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:40.100
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that bombing 18 cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking disgusting.</v>

1799
01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.930
<v Speaker 3>But think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just as bad,</v>

1800
01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 3>like it's almost like you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand it was an abused child.</v>

1801
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:48.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 sit q man's,</v>

1803
01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:57.050
<v Speaker 3>firebombed 18 of our major cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would we feel about that country?</v>

1804
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:58.303
<v Speaker 3>You would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be fucking lynched if you said </v>

1805
01:18:59.751 --> 01:19:02.280
<v Speaker 3>anything pro that country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be that kind of church.</v>

1806
01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 3>I go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Bet.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You'd just keep that shit to yourself.</v>

1809
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:10.634
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you ever talked to someone </v>

1810
01:19:11.361 --> 01:19:13.550

1811
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.830

<v Speaker 3>denier.</v>

1812
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:17.083
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of like that Armenian </v>
<v Speaker 3>genocide is a very rarely discussed </v>

<v Speaker 3>holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not,</v>

<v Speaker 3>not the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1815
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:28.610
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the use the word to describe</v>
<v Speaker 3>an atrocity,</v>

1816
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:31.280
<v Speaker 3>it was a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's deniers of that.</v>

1817
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 3>And when you find an Armenian and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to him about people that deny the</v>

<v Speaker 6>in Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not counting 32,557</v>

1834
01:20:17.671 --> 01:20:18.504
<v Speaker 6>tons of napalm compared to 503 tons in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the entire Pacific theater in World War </v>

1835
01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:28.650
<v Speaker 6>II.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At least 50% of 18 out of the north,</v>

1836
01:20:28.651 --> 01:20:33.390
<v Speaker 6>22 major cities were obliterated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

1837
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.570
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1838
01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 6>Was that right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1839
01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:39.600
<v Speaker 6>you're 100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is the Internet.</v>

1840
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:42.390
<v Speaker 6>Are we in the library?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you get that from library.com?</v>

1841
01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.910
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is terrifying.</v>

1842
01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.773
<v Speaker 6>Look at the images up there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Napalm bomb that you kind of look at </v>

1843
01:20:47.871 --> 01:20:52.410
<v Speaker 6>that in Joan will or whenever the book,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his name is as crazy as fuck for sure.</v>

1844
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.453
<v Speaker 6>But he caught you kind of understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>when someone's really crazy and they've </v>

1845
01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:57.870
<v Speaker 6>been abused and tortured as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

1846
01:20:57.890 --> 01:21:01.440
<v Speaker 6>you kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand what you're saying,</v>

1847
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:03.400
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't,</v>

1848
01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.750
<v Speaker 6>I guess the argument would be that if </v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't do it,</v>

1849
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:08.880
<v Speaker 6>what was the war over?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The war was over communism.</v>

1850
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:09.773
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the what happened at the end of the </v>

1851
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:14.220
<v Speaker 6>war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was it the two different countries?</v>

1852
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 6>They became North End,</v>
<v Speaker 6>South Korea.</v>

1853
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:18.480
<v Speaker 6>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the details of when was,</v>

1854
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.793
<v Speaker 6>I know it's probably fucked up the out </v>
<v Speaker 6>when will North Korea was a founded </v>

1855
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:27.630
<v Speaker 6>because this was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is like the takeover.</v>

1856
01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.130
<v Speaker 6>18 different cities destroyed out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

<v Speaker 6>formed.</v>

1860
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.083
<v Speaker 6>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when did it become like north and South </v>

1861
01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:42.580
<v Speaker 6>Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know?</v>

1862
01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.310
<v Speaker 6>In the 50 sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So before that it was just all Korea.</v>

1863
01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.353
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that much about why do I </v>

<v Speaker 6>That's devastating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.670
<v Speaker 6>We talk about all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1868
01:21:58.990 --> 01:22:01.120
<v Speaker 6>well I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>back then,</v>

1869
01:22:01.121 --> 01:22:01.954
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1870
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.863
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you never look in North Korea has a </v>

1871
01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.340
<v Speaker 6>history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>1945.</v>

1872
01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:09.843
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the partition of Korea at the end of </v>

1873
01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:12.990
<v Speaker 6>World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>

1874
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:17.130
<v Speaker 6>The creation of the communist aligned </v>
<v Speaker 6>Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</v>

1875
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kim Il Song in 1950 the Korean War broke</v>

1876
01:22:22.231 --> 01:22:27.231
<v Speaker 6>out so they broke off in 1945 and water </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be Communist.</v>

1877
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.330
<v Speaker 6>Five years later we were going to war </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them.</v>

1878
01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:34.050
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the history of it.</v>

1879
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:36.960
<v Speaker 6>I'd be talking shit if I said I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had an opinion on it,</v>

1880
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.340
<v Speaker 6>but it sounds pretty sure I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm guessing that we,</v>

1881
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:44.010
<v Speaker 6>we shouldn't have been up in there </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking mass.</v>

1882
01:22:44.011 --> 01:22:44.844
<v Speaker 6>That's less.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were worried that he was going to </v>

1883
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:47.004
<v Speaker 6>become another Hitler and that it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to become a just a further </v>

1884
01:22:50.161 --> 01:22:52.950
<v Speaker 6>extension of World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was going to move on Maria,</v>

1885
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:53.813
<v Speaker 6>history of world war two that is like we</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't really know the history of World </v>

1886
01:22:56.161 --> 01:22:56.970
<v Speaker 6>War Two.</v>

1887
01:22:56.970 --> 01:23:00.000
<v Speaker 6>There's that mainstream history and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the real shit.</v>

1888
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:01.283
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like world war one is very bizarre man.</v>

1890
01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:07.893
<v Speaker 6>When you go back and listen to Dan </v>
<v Speaker 6>Carlin talk about World War One and you </v>

1891
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.494
<v Speaker 6>realize how recent that was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where most of these guys were walking </v>

1892
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:15.610
<v Speaker 6>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>walking everywhere with guns,</v>

1893
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.713
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

<v Speaker 6>they walked with guns there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>walked across countries,</v>

1897
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:22.533
<v Speaker 6>braveheart with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is ridiculous when you realize like </v>

1898

<v Speaker 6>that was a hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go holy Shit.</v>

1899
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:31.480
<v Speaker 6>Like what has happened and now instead </v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>50 years after that,</v>

<v Speaker 6>closer to people.</v>

1905
01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:49.540

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:25:27.391 --> 01:25:32.080
<v Speaker 6>Well cause rats are sisters because </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're raised with that rat was clean.</v>

1949
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.270
<v Speaker 6>What if that route was trying to better </v>
<v Speaker 6>the rack community?</v>

1950
01:25:34.271 --> 01:25:35.104
<v Speaker 6>Would that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does that rat was a leader with </v>

1951
01:25:36.251 --> 01:25:38.590
<v Speaker 6>their rat was the one rat trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>elevate the other rats.</v>

1952
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:43.040
<v Speaker 6>They need to be eating garbage and </v>
<v Speaker 6>cannibalize each other to be better.</v>

1953
01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.400
<v Speaker 6>We need to build homes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We need to establish communities.</v>

1954
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:47.620
<v Speaker 6>We need to teach people about rat traps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like,</v>

1955
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.240
<v Speaker 6>I like rats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What am I supposed to survive on?</v>

1956
01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.880
<v Speaker 6>On rats and roaches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if we did that would fuck the,</v>

1957
01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.160
<v Speaker 6>the economy up when you all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>assholes that want to kill coyotes.</v>

1958
01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:01.750
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there wasn't for coyotes,</v>

1959
01:26:01.751 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 6>we'd have roaches or rats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Least everywhere.</v>

1960
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.510
<v Speaker 4>Rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rats.</v>

1961
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.051
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1962
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:07.910
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the main diet.</v>

1963
01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Their main dies like rats and rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chili's,</v>

1964
01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:12.040
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of coyotes to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1965
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.530
<v Speaker 4>they're already there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coyotes.</v>

1966
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Coyotes aren't like the city though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cities are in the city.</v>

1967
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:19.513
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coyotes are in every city in the </v>

1968
01:26:20.691 --> 01:26:21.524
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got done reading this book on </v>

1969
01:26:22.851 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coyote America.</v>

1970
01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Jamie wrote a whole book on Cody's crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

1971
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:31.190
<v Speaker 4>man by a guest that's coming on soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coyote turned up in middle village,</v>

1972
01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Queens and April 27 there's generally </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen as a freak.</v>

1973
01:26:33.771 --> 01:26:36.560
<v Speaker 4>It's inch in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't even the first sighting of</v>

1974
01:26:36.561 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 4>2015 there's many coyotes that live in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mass in um,</v>

1975
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:42.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>central park.</v>

1976
01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.480
<v Speaker 4>There's Kylie's it live in Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:26:44.481 --> 01:26:46.300
<v Speaker 4>They live all over Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1978
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.510
<v Speaker 4>they're going where the food's at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1979
01:26:47.511 --> 01:26:49.730
<v Speaker 4>They go everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all over the country.</v>

1980
01:26:49.731 --> 01:26:53.180
<v Speaker 4>There are small wolf that lives in every</v>
<v Speaker 4>single city,</v>

1981
01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.870
<v Speaker 4>every single state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the country and do we kit,</v>

1982
01:26:56.871 --> 01:26:58.430
<v Speaker 4>we really don't kill him.</v>

1983
01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.380
<v Speaker 4>We can't have tried to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did.</v>

1984
01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:05.381
<v Speaker 4>The biggest mass effort to eradicate a </v>
<v Speaker 4>species ever was on coyotes and wolves.</v>

1985
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:08.000
<v Speaker 4>First Forrest Wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was successful.</v>

1986
01:27:08.001 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 4>And then coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only does it not work,</v>

1987
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:13.040
<v Speaker 4>it has the opposite effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you hear coyote screaming,</v>

1988
01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:14.840
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing,</v>

1989
01:27:14.841 --> 01:27:16.190
<v Speaker 4>we'll call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just like,</v>

1990
01:27:16.191 --> 01:27:17.140
<v Speaker 4>who's here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's here?</v>

1991
01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:18.143
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1992
01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:19.053
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to find out who's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>attendance right after the attendance </v>

1993
01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:25.220
<v Speaker 4>calls over if ones missing or two's </v>
<v Speaker 4>missing up.</v>

1994
01:27:25.221 --> 01:27:28.910
<v Speaker 4>So they think someone's dead or gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The female has more babies.</v>

1995
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:33.290
<v Speaker 4>So the female will go from having four </v>
<v Speaker 4>puppies to having 10 or 15 and then they</v>

1996
01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:34.124
<v Speaker 4>also stretched the range out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Different than wolves in that wolves </v>

1997
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:37.394
<v Speaker 4>have to operate in packs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coyotes can operate as a singular or </v>

1998
01:27:40.491 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 4>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1999
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 4>what was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay roll call and then,</v>

2000
01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone was really attendance.</v>

2001
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:48.130
<v Speaker 4>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Mama starts making more babies.</v>

2002
01:27:48.131 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 4>They're missing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if someone's missing,</v>

2003
01:27:49.911 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 4>say if they have a pack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pack is like eight coyotes,</v>

2004
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 4>but one coyote gets jacked by a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>lion.</v>

2005
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:55.783
<v Speaker 4>They yell out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when they find out that that kid is </v>

2006
01:27:57.801 --> 01:27:58.634
<v Speaker 4>missing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the females say we need to make more </v>

2007
01:27:59.991 --> 01:28:02.690
<v Speaker 4>babies and it's like to keep their </v>
<v Speaker 4>species alive,</v>

2008
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:05.450
<v Speaker 4>they produce more offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they'll go from having,</v>

2009
01:28:05.451 --> 01:28:06.980
<v Speaker 4>so they have sex ups?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2010
01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:07.221
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2011
01:28:07.221 --> 01:28:08.054
<v Speaker 4>Their pups or larger groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So from four pups to having like 10 to </v>

2012
01:28:11.241 --> 01:28:15.500
<v Speaker 4>13 it's like the body produces more </v>
<v Speaker 4>babies.</v>

2013
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the smarter than the wolves.</v>

2014
01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just smaller.</v>

2015
01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Did there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking ridiculously smart.</v>

2016
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:23.703
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sneaky and they're smart enough </v>

2017
01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:27.380
<v Speaker 4>to know to not attack humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:29.960
<v Speaker 4>We'd leave them alone if we don't attack</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2019
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:30.933
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't hear a lot of coyote attacks </v>

2020
01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:34.360
<v Speaker 4>on dogs and shit around.</v>

2021
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:35.780
<v Speaker 4>It's cause they don't attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just happen.</v>

2022
01:28:35.781 --> 01:28:36.614
<v Speaker 4>Not Be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be scared if they weren't as good as </v>

2023
01:28:38.061 --> 01:28:39.500
<v Speaker 4>humans at attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be gone.</v>

2024
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:41.050
<v Speaker 4>This professor that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2025
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:43.070
<v Speaker 4>I've got coming on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the podcast,</v>

2026
01:28:43.071 --> 01:28:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Dan Flores,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who wrote that book,</v>

2027
01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:45.974
<v Speaker 4>Coyote America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he said is that coyotes when like </v>

2028
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.880
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the like a couple of hundred years ago,</v>

2029
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:56.780
<v Speaker 4>like they were only in the west coast </v>
<v Speaker 4>and as people push them away,</v>

2030
01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:57.913
<v Speaker 4>they started establishing new </v>
<v Speaker 4>territories like us making cities and </v>

2031
01:29:01.411 --> 01:29:02.244
<v Speaker 4>going after them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made them spread out across the whole </v>

2032
01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's us like an,</v>

2033
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.573
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that don't understand </v>

2034
01:29:09.661 --> 01:29:10.494
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he got approached by this one </v>

2035
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:12.750
<v Speaker 4>because people know he's a coyote </v>
<v Speaker 4>expert.</v>

2036
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 4>You got approached by these people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were doing this coyote a rescue mission.</v>

2037
01:29:17.011 --> 01:29:21.000
<v Speaker 4>Like we're here to save the coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the coyotes doing great.</v>

2038
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Like you're here to save it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>save it from what they're everywhere.</v>

2039
01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:25.733
<v Speaker 4>Like they literally have populated </v>
<v Speaker 4>quietly and sneakily the entire country </v>

2040
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:30.803
<v Speaker 4>and the efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all efforts to eradicate them failed </v>

2041
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.520
<v Speaker 4>when they let me have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See when they have male wolves,</v>

2042
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:36.533
<v Speaker 4>they can cyanide like a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take a horse and they'll shoot a </v>

2043
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:44.040
<v Speaker 4>male wolf and then they take his balls </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his dick and they rub is sent in his</v>

2044
01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:44.874
<v Speaker 4>glands all over this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this animal so that the other wolves </v>

2045
01:29:48.271 --> 01:29:51.990
<v Speaker 4>recognize that he's been there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they think it's safe to eat.</v>

2046
01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:56.130
<v Speaker 4>So they start eating this horse that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been cyanide and then they would all die</v>

2047
01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:57.600
<v Speaker 4>and so they would pop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would,</v>

2048
01:29:57.630 --> 01:30:02.040
<v Speaker 4>they would attack these packs of wolves </v>
<v Speaker 4>that way they would shoot the mail,</v>

2049
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.870
<v Speaker 4>they would take his sand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put on this meat,</v>

2050
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.070
<v Speaker 4>take a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot the horse,</v>

2051
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:06.023
<v Speaker 4>injecting with cyanide immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it went through his entire nervous </v>

2052
01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:11.280
<v Speaker 4>system where it's not just our </v>
<v Speaker 4>circulation system.</v>

2053
01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:13.560
<v Speaker 4>And so all the meat would be poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they did that.</v>

2054
01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:17.070
<v Speaker 4>And they eradicated walls throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire west coast until they brought him</v>

2055
01:30:17.071 --> 01:30:19.800
<v Speaker 4>back into yellowstone in the 1990s there</v>
<v Speaker 4>were like virtually</v>

2056
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.420
<v Speaker 2>actually gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes.</v>

2057
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Animal too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading the article that they're,</v>

2058
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:24.953
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking about building a bridge</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the four oh five and I didn't know </v>

2059
01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:29.250
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking mountain lines.</v>

<v Speaker 3>hunters hunters or did they,</v>

2099
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:11.703

<v Speaker 6>I had a friend who was cornered by </v>

2100
01:32:13.481 --> 01:32:14.314
<v Speaker 6>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They tried to take his elk and he wound </v>

2101
01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:16.864

2102
01:32:18.131 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 6>three wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they killed three,</v>

2103
01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 6>three wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would have told us the story again.</v>

2104
01:32:21.971 --> 01:32:24.250
<v Speaker 6>He had one friend with a rifle and him </v>
<v Speaker 6>with a bow.</v>

2105
01:32:24.251 --> 01:32:25.084
<v Speaker 6>He killed two of them with a bow and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>guy with them killed one of them with a </v>

2106
01:32:27.371 --> 01:32:28.204
<v Speaker 6>rifle and they were surrounding them and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were trying to get the elk away </v>

2107
01:32:30.971 --> 01:32:31.850
<v Speaker 6>from him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had shot him.</v>

2108
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.000
<v Speaker 6>They fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't know that.</v>

2109
01:32:34.001 --> 01:32:37.450
<v Speaker 6>They were like in the wolves' Den.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like that fucking the gray movie.</v>

2110
01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 6>Like they shot this elk like right near </v>
<v Speaker 6>the wolves' den and the wolves like,</v>

2111
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:42.830
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll take that dude.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:32:44.081 --> 01:32:47.350
<v Speaker 6>And they surrounded these dudes and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>started rushing them.</v>

2114
01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.110
<v Speaker 6>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a crazy car.</v>

2115
01:32:49.111 --> 01:32:51.130

<v Speaker 6>And then the other ones took off.</v>

2116
01:32:51.131 --> 01:32:51.970
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck this.</v>

2117
01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 6>The gun I think probably scare them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

2118
01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 6>oh this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these mother fuckers have guns.</v>

2119
01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.690
<v Speaker 6>And they did their call.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did their attendance called,</v>

2120
01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.520
<v Speaker 6>and they were surrounding them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they were,</v>

2121
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:03.610
<v Speaker 6>the wolves must've realized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh shit,</v>

2122
01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:06.220
<v Speaker 6>they killed two of us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's two that are gone.</v>

2123
01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:09.820
<v Speaker 6>And then the killed a third and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that's it now.</v>

2124
01:33:09.821 --> 01:33:10.654
<v Speaker 6>He said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had the Alpha male in his sight and </v>

2125
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:15.160
<v Speaker 6>he had his bow drawn back and the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 6>took off running.</v>

2126
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:17.530
<v Speaker 6>And when the wolf took off running,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the rest of the pack went to,</v>

2127
01:33:17.531 --> 01:33:18.341
<v Speaker 6>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck this.</v>

2128
01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:20.210
<v Speaker 6>They're lucky they had a gun and not </v>
<v Speaker 6>just those bones.</v>

2129
01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 6>So the patch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So lucky.</v>

<v Speaker 3>is it like a spiritual thing?</v>

2160
01:34:30.941 --> 01:34:32.570
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bogus story</v>

2161
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:34.820
<v Speaker 6>that I read online that I repeated on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the podcast for.</v>

2162
01:34:34.821 --> 01:34:36.260
<v Speaker 6>I looked it up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the book,</v>

2163
01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:41.130
<v Speaker 6>the book is that I'm pretty sure Adam </v>
<v Speaker 6>Carolla told me or some of them I don't,</v>

2164
01:34:41.131 --> 01:34:45.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember where I got it from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the bogus story was that before,</v>

2165
01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:46.970
<v Speaker 6>I don't think Adam Kroll believes this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

2166
01:34:47.210 --> 01:34:50.600
<v Speaker 6>before World War Two they used to attack</v>
<v Speaker 6>us,</v>

2167
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.823
<v Speaker 6>but then once a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they used to do target practice with </v>

2168
01:34:54.771 --> 01:34:57.680
<v Speaker 6>them from planes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Killer whale stopped us.</v>

2169
01:34:57.710 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 6>Turned out</v>

2170
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.590
<v Speaker 2>to not be a true story at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what a killer story.</v>

2171
01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:01.970
<v Speaker 2>What a great story it'd be if it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

2172
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like some place you used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck with us and they're like,</v>

2173

2254
01:38:22.861 --> 01:38:23.694
<v Speaker 3>Let's just communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime we see something like that in </v>

2255
01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:28.910
<v Speaker 3>quotes that go fake new sec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tricked by fake news,</v>

2256
01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.410
<v Speaker 3>people are going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2259
01:38:36.361 --> 01:38:37.081
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2260
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:37.914
<v Speaker 3>who's making these fake news sites and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't it be in the best interest </v>

2261
01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:42.450
<v Speaker 3>of the government to make fake news </v>
<v Speaker 3>sites of their own?</v>

2262
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:46.860
<v Speaker 3>So they all have a reason to not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake news sites around.</v>

2263
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.293
<v Speaker 3>But do you think they could literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop people from putting stuff out on </v>

2264
01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:54.721
<v Speaker 3>the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2265
01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:55.554
<v Speaker 3>if that's the ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now what they're doing is they're going </v>

2266
01:38:57.211 --> 01:38:58.610
<v Speaker 3>to censor the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2267
01:38:58.650 --> 01:39:01.410
<v Speaker 3>alternative media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new sites that going after them.</v>

2268
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a big trick saying like CNN,</v>

2269
01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:05.770
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2270
01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:06.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2271
01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:06.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2272
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Like breitbart or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2273
01:39:08.271 --> 01:39:10.830
<v Speaker 3>like drudge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infowars wars.</v>

2274
01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:14.670
<v Speaker 3>They're putting out the real shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they got control the media.</v>

2275
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:15.601
<v Speaker 3>So they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2276
01:39:15.601 --> 01:39:16.434
<v Speaker 3>that's fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that creating a fake news problem </v>

2277
01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:23.460
<v Speaker 3>that isn't there so that that can go in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sensor the real shit.</v>

2278
01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:26.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you see it on CNN,</v>

2279
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:29.760
<v Speaker 3>I called it every headline being tricked</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're gonna.</v>

2292
01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.980
<v Speaker 3>They're going to censor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Internet isn't going to work.</v>

2293
01:39:49.570 --> 01:39:52.590
<v Speaker 3>They're going to blacklist you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a new site that's credible and</v>

2294
01:39:52.591 --> 01:39:54.390
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking with the agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2295
01:39:54.391 --> 01:39:55.230
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2296
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 3>that's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2297
01:39:56.551 --> 01:39:57.384
<v Speaker 3>you're off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what there were in the middle of </v>

2298
01:39:58.801 --> 01:39:59.634
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're being assaulted with </v>

2299
01:40:01.201 --> 01:40:02.034
<v Speaker 3>people being tricked by fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When have you been tricked by fucking </v>

2300
01:40:04.771 --> 01:40:06.990
<v Speaker 3>fake and offices?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not tricking me.</v>

2301
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.863
<v Speaker 3>You settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can be tricked by fake news for </v>

2302
01:40:10.831 --> 01:40:13.120
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can be and if the the,</v>

2303
01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:14.003
<v Speaker 3>the question is who's actually doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the government doing it so they can </v>

2304
01:40:16.981 --> 01:40:21.480
<v Speaker 3>crack down on alternative controls </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying like Wiki leaks or anybody that's</v>

2305
01:40:21.481 --> 01:40:22.314
<v Speaker 3>putting out stuff that doesn't agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with her agenda or is there a real </v>

2306
01:40:25.801 --> 01:40:26.370
<v Speaker 3>issue?</v>

2307
01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:28.470
<v Speaker 3>There's a real issue and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I say.</v>

2308
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.000
<v Speaker 3>I say I say there's bulk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2309
01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:33.990
<v Speaker 3>I say the government for sure would </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit from there being less sources of</v>

2310
01:40:33.991 --> 01:40:34.824
<v Speaker 3>news and more that they can control and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to put the wraps on someone </v>

2311
01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:39.690
<v Speaker 3>like Edward Snowden and not allow that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>

2312
01:40:39.691 --> 01:40:41.460
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would definitely benefit from that,</v>

2313
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:45.270
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing some fake articles and they'd do</v>

2314
01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:46.104
<v Speaker 3>it for profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it for clicks is there was one </v>

2315
01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:49.080
<v Speaker 3>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

2316
01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:51.330
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He interviewed him and he was doing some</v>

2317
01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:52.620
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow Eddie,</v>

2318
01:40:52.621 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 3>please just be BHP</v>

2319
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 4>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've talking about stuff.</v>

2320
01:40:55.691 --> 01:40:57.540
<v Speaker 4>We're not disagreeing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll say you.</v>

2321
01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:58.653
<v Speaker 4>We're saying it's all the above.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm saying that people get paid to </v>

2322
01:41:02.501 --> 01:41:03.334
<v Speaker 4>write fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying they get money from ad </v>

2323
01:41:05.561 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 4>clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can make 10 $13,000</v>

2324
01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:08.614
<v Speaker 4>a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They interviewed this dude who did it </v>

2325
01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:11.290
<v Speaker 4>and he started getting out of control </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

2326
01:41:11.291 --> 01:41:12.124
<v Speaker 4>He did it to troll Republican people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you realize how much ad sends he </v>

2327
01:41:14.771 --> 01:41:18.940
<v Speaker 4>can make from doing that and he's making</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucking sizeable chunk of money,</v>

2328
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:20.283
<v Speaker 4>so there's those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there's also for sure there </v>

2329
01:41:23.051 --> 01:41:25.270
<v Speaker 4>would be government agencies that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost be,</v>

2330
01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.600
<v Speaker 4>it would be their responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 4>control information.</v>

2331
01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Like if you wanted to control </v>
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

2332
01:41:30.431 --> 01:41:33.820
<v Speaker 4>one of the best ways to do it would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>put out disinformation cloud.</v>

2333
01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:34.654
<v Speaker 4>The story that's subterfuge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's been going on in the CIA and the </v>

2334
01:41:38.741 --> 01:41:39.574
<v Speaker 4>NSA and this been going on and all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these like secretive intelligence </v>

2335
01:41:43.181 --> 01:41:45.070
<v Speaker 4>community groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do that forever.</v>

2336
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.903
<v Speaker 4>They like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you pay attention to what we </v>

2337
01:41:47.291 --> 01:41:50.290
<v Speaker 4>absolutely know about how they engage </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the enemy,</v>

2338
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.680
<v Speaker 4>they use every tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't not use deception.</v>

2339
01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:54.514
<v Speaker 4>They don't not use propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The the 450 million plus they spent on </v>

2340
01:41:58.631 --> 01:41:59.464
<v Speaker 4>those fake terrorist videos to know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they also had in their mind a </v>

2341
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:07.090
<v Speaker 4>legitimate reason for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they say.</v>

2342
01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.110
<v Speaker 4>Because you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

2343
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 4>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Eddie,</v>

2344
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:11.360
<v Speaker 4>but it could be both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See their,</v>

2345
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:13.720
<v Speaker 4>their legitimate reason is they have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>real player.</v>

2346
01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:15.850
<v Speaker 4>This is how you watch those videos or </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in a real player.</v>

2347
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 4>When you click into a real player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2348
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:20.110
<v Speaker 4>it checks your Ip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It knows your Ip,</v>

2349
01:42:20.111 --> 01:42:22.690
<v Speaker 4>so could figure out where you're coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>from so they can pocket.</v>

2350
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.823
<v Speaker 4>If they could target pockets of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in certain terrorist rich parts of the </v>

2351
01:42:27.011 --> 01:42:29.200
<v Speaker 4>world where they knew that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of uh,</v>

2352
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:30.670
<v Speaker 4>isis people or what have you.</v>

2353
01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.653
<v Speaker 4>If they put out some recruitment video </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can find that there's a lot of </v>

2354
01:42:34.031 --> 01:42:35.920
<v Speaker 4>people that are watching it in certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>

2355
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 4>they can sort of in their mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>triangulate where these terrorists could</v>

2356
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:41.770
<v Speaker 4>be loved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Idea.</v>

2357
01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:44.140
<v Speaker 4>It's the same I was reading Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's both end.</v>

2358
01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:45.470
<v Speaker 4>It's both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2359
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:47.320
<v Speaker 4>that's the cover story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2360
01:42:47.321 --> 01:42:48.400
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is bold.</v>

2361
01:42:48.730 --> 01:42:51.430
<v Speaker 4>Isis does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are bad people in the world.</v>

2362
01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:54.400
<v Speaker 4>There are terrorist in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kim John Owen is a real guy.</v>

2363
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:55.503
<v Speaker 4>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a dictator over his entire </v>

2364
01:42:56.801 --> 01:42:57.634
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of people in Isis that </v>

2365
01:42:59.201 --> 01:43:00.034
<v Speaker 4>have fucking billions of dollars that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are getting this money from is what I'm </v>

2366
01:43:03.461 --> 01:43:04.990
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They exist,</v>

2367
01:43:04.991 --> 01:43:06.610
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oil families.</v>

2368
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:08.430
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of sources,</v>

2369
01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:09.363
<v Speaker 4>a lot of motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you see who they're being </v>

2370
01:43:11.201 --> 01:43:12.034
<v Speaker 4>funded by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know like you ain't going to fall </v>

2371
01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:14.530
<v Speaker 4>for that cover story.</v>

2372
01:43:14.530 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 4>That's all bullshit that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you're right.</v>

2373
01:43:16.871 --> 01:43:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

2374
01:43:18.761 --> 01:43:22.330
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody's going after it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to stop by Esis,</v>

2375

<v Speaker 4>They need it.</v>

2378
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.233
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it say in case you didn't </v>

<v Speaker 3>shit about this murder,</v>

2402
01:44:15.051 --> 01:44:16.520
<v Speaker 3>that murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this racket,</v>

2403
01:44:16.521 --> 01:44:18.980
<v Speaker 3>that racket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this criminal activity.</v>

2404
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2405
01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 3>if he told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2406
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.173
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what other murder he was </v>

2407
01:44:24.381 --> 01:44:27.020
<v Speaker 3>involved in and you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no dude's going to say,</v>

2408
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now how do you know that's true?</v>

2409
01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.793
<v Speaker 3>How do you know that's true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the evidence that you probably </v>

2410
01:44:32.271 --> 01:44:34.130
<v Speaker 3>going to go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take his word for it.</v>

2411
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:36.140
<v Speaker 3>This guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a criminal.</v>

2412
01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.273
<v Speaker 3>He's fucked up all this other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he tells you about some new </v>

2413
01:44:39.921 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucked up.</v>

2414
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.340
<v Speaker 3>You're probably like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a normal God go.</v>

2415
01:44:43.341 --> 01:44:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if he's wrong.</v>

2416
01:44:44.931 --> 01:44:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still a criminal,</v>

2417
01:44:46.011 --> 01:44:49.990
<v Speaker 3>but probably I haven't looked into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like that when,</v>

2418
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.903
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you could follow the money so </v>

2419
01:44:51.771 --> 01:44:53.930
<v Speaker 3>easily and you just see the racket and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>

2420
01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:57.770
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I didn't follow what you were saying</v>

2422
01:45:04.071 --> 01:45:06.230
<v Speaker 3>there until you got to know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2423
01:45:06.231 --> 01:45:07.500
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2424
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:08.061
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2425
01:45:08.061 --> 01:45:08.894
<v Speaker 3>the government's reason for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for paying a UK publicity from $500 </v>

2426
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:17.690
<v Speaker 3>million to make fake isis and al Qaeda </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

2427
01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.280
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$500,000</v>

2428
01:45:19.281 --> 01:45:21.770
<v Speaker 3>or 500 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those 450,</v>

2429
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:22.663
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be in the wrong about </v>

2430
01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:24.170
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2431
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:26.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need wrong 500,000.</v>

2432
01:45:26.721 --> 01:45:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it's 500 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's thought it was 450 million.</v>

2433
01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.740
<v Speaker 3>So when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see that,</v>

2434
01:45:30.741 --> 01:45:32.720
<v Speaker 3>let's say you just saw that quote and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you believed it.</v>

2435
01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Let's say she's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2436
01:45:34.011 --> 01:45:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Just pretend she's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>

2437
01:45:35.710 --> 01:45:36.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2438
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:38.800
<v Speaker 3>that chick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Jill Jill Stein,</v>

2439
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:42.800
<v Speaker 3>she's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>andy is also funding the mujahideen,</v>

2440
01:45:43.130 --> 01:45:45.150
<v Speaker 3>which we were pretty open about when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were there willing.</v>

2441
01:45:45.151 --> 01:45:48.770
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what became the Islamic terrorist</v>

2442
01:45:48.771 --> 01:45:49.870
<v Speaker 3>of today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what we,</v>

2443
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:51.870
<v Speaker 3>none of the funding tennis customer </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians,</v>

2444
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:52.723
<v Speaker 3>let me finish real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see a statement like that and </v>

2445
01:45:54.891 --> 01:45:57.260
<v Speaker 3>there's many people saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a man,</v>

2446
01:45:57.261 --> 01:45:57.951
<v Speaker 3>there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2447
01:45:57.951 --> 01:45:58.784
<v Speaker 3>just say that's true what she just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you find out that the </v>

2448
01:46:02.211 --> 01:46:05.390
<v Speaker 3>government paid $500 million to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake isis videos,</v>

2449
01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:10.070
<v Speaker 3>the funding numb and then they're making</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake isis videos.</v>

2450
01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like they want to blow that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2451
01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:14.510
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you see the cover story,</v>

2452
01:46:14.511 --> 01:46:17.030
<v Speaker 3>when the government says the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>says the criminal says,</v>

2453
01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:20.000
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we were doing is we were making cds</v>

2454
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:20.834
<v Speaker 3>and we were like dispersing them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then so that people would get them and </v>

2455
01:46:23.721 --> 01:46:24.860
<v Speaker 3>then they would play them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2456
01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2457
01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.160
<v Speaker 3>we did only a terrorist would play that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cd,</v>

2458
01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:29.173
<v Speaker 3>so then we could track their ip address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that's like some serious horse </v>

2459
01:46:33.381 --> 01:46:34.280
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2460
01:46:34.281 --> 01:46:36.830
<v Speaker 3>but we do it the same with like in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug industry.</v>

2461
01:46:36.831 --> 01:46:37.664
<v Speaker 3>If they catch a drug dealer they they </v>
<v Speaker 3>flip him or use him for some to get to </v>

2462
01:46:40.911 --> 01:46:43.300
<v Speaker 3>the bigger play there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the drug kingpin.</v>

2463
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so same thing with this.</v>

2464
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:47.780
<v Speaker 3>They might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might fund those ridiculous videos.</v>

2465
01:46:47.781 --> 01:46:50.790
<v Speaker 3>You sounded like that the are criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>but no Eddie,</v>

2466
01:46:50.791 --> 01:46:53.610
<v Speaker 3>the problem is you think there's only </v>
<v Speaker 3>one way to this.</v>

2467
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.690
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lack of nuance in the,</v>

2468
01:46:57.691 --> 01:46:59.280
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of this.</v>

2469
01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:02.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for sure the government is going</v>

2470
01:47:02.861 --> 01:47:03.694
<v Speaker 3>to make some fake shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they told us they were going to </v>

2471
01:47:05.101 --> 01:47:07.080
<v Speaker 3>do it to fight the war on crime or in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight.</v>

2472
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:09.060
<v Speaker 3>The war on terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They told us they were going to do that.</v>

2473
01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:11.280
<v Speaker 3>They told us they were going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it in plain sight.</v>

2474
01:47:11.281 --> 01:47:12.114
<v Speaker 3>Then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course go along for sure 100% but </v>

2475
01:47:14.581 --> 01:47:15.414
<v Speaker 3>also there's also people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge of making sure it's not like </v>

2476
01:47:18.901 --> 01:47:19.734
<v Speaker 3>everybody who is in the CIA or the FBI </v>
<v Speaker 3>or any of these organizations is like a </v>

2477
01:47:23.881 --> 01:47:26.300
<v Speaker 3>part of some gigantic said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did I say that?</v>

2478
01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:29.140
<v Speaker 3>But never said okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only but the people.</v>

2479
01:47:29.310 --> 01:47:30.143
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the rest of them would know that </v>

2480
01:47:31.471 --> 01:47:33.300
<v Speaker 3>it's bullshit and that would go along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

2481
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.313
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what they're trying to do is </v>

2482
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:36.803
<v Speaker 3>figure out ways where they could locate </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists if they figured out a way </v>

2483
01:47:39.031 --> 01:47:39.864
<v Speaker 3>they could located terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's through Ip checking of people </v>

2484
01:47:42.121 --> 01:47:43.890
<v Speaker 3>who watched terrorist recruitment </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

2485
01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:45.053
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not get everybody and it might </v>

2486
01:47:48.181 --> 01:47:50.460
<v Speaker 3>not even work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a bad idea.</v>

2487
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.160
<v Speaker 3>They're doing a decent job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen now just switch subjects a</v>

2488
01:47:53.161 --> 01:47:54.480
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how have you seen on a second?</v>

2489
01:47:54.481 --> 01:47:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that there's a w there,</v>

2490
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:57.383
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be some way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there are legitimate terrorists in </v>

2491
01:47:59.491 --> 01:48:00.570
<v Speaker 3>the world and you're trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2492
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:02.880
<v Speaker 3>he's gotta be some way to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to find them.</v>

2493
01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:06.020
<v Speaker 3>I Ip addresses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're clicking on those videos,</v>

2494
01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:06.873
<v Speaker 3>funding them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would they try to find them really </v>

2495
01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:09.530
<v Speaker 3>who's going yet?</v>

2496
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:11.220
<v Speaker 3>He is at the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my point.</v>

2497
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:13.370
<v Speaker 3>Is it the same people that pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that does,</v>

2498
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.490
<v Speaker 3>that's one person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

2499
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:15.533
<v Speaker 3>this is the same people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge of making these videos to try to </v>

2500
01:48:20.041 --> 01:48:20.874
<v Speaker 3>find these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they the same people that are also </v>

2501
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:23.843
<v Speaker 3>completely aware that they're funding </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or is there a bunch of different </v>

2502
01:48:27.721 --> 01:48:31.770
<v Speaker 3>factions all working together and each </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them doesn't completely be honest</v>

2503
01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:33.030
<v Speaker 3>with the other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2504
01:48:33.031 --> 01:48:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I could see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely most of the CIA,</v>

2505
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.330
<v Speaker 3>most of the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

2506
01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:41.070
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardworking people.</v>

2507
01:48:41.071 --> 01:48:45.030
<v Speaker 3>It's just people keep people in certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>spots there.</v>

2508
01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:46.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're funding Isis.</v>

2509
01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:48.570
<v Speaker 3>That's just one quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's many,</v>

2510
01:48:48.571 --> 01:48:50.460
<v Speaker 3>many quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's just say that was true,</v>

2511
01:48:50.461 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 3>that quote that with that chick said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

2512
01:48:52.770 --> 01:48:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're funding CIC,</v>

2513
01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.310
<v Speaker 3>presidential candidate Jill Stein.</v>

2514
01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.590
<v Speaker 3>She's not the first one to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

2515
01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.240
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say what she,</v>

2516
01:49:02.250 --> 01:49:06.190
<v Speaker 3>that statement is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's true on Christmas,</v>

2517
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:09.390
<v Speaker 3>if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're funding Isis,</v>

2518
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.823
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably a low level people </v>

2519
01:49:11.881 --> 01:49:12.241
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

01:49:12.241 --> 01:49:13.074
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to stop isis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the overall agenda is not to stop </v>

2521
01:49:17.281 --> 01:49:19.140
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The overall they're funding it.</v>

2522
01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Why they going to stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to blow it up.</v>

2523
01:49:21.171 --> 01:49:24.000
<v Speaker 3>The funding it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd put two and two together though.</v>

2524
01:49:24.001 --> 01:49:24.661
<v Speaker 3>Crip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you on must saying like 1200 miles an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour is what there is.</v>

2628
01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:40.250
<v Speaker 3>What they're planning 500 miles an hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>aside to think what like a plane flies.</v>

2629
01:53:40.251 --> 01:53:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's any faster than a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane.</v>

2630
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I can go underground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2631
01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 500 miles an hour in a plane,</v>

2632
01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:51.313
<v Speaker 3>but it takes you five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is across the country for five </v>

2633
01:53:56.361 --> 01:53:57.520
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2634
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:59.120
<v Speaker 3>it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to do it.</v>

2635
01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be five hours now it's 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles,</v>

2636
01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:06.050
<v Speaker 3>1200 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably two and a half,</v>

2637
01:54:06.051 --> 01:54:09.220
<v Speaker 3>two and a half hours to get tenured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A long time to do a long time.</v>

2638
01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to fast.</v>

2639
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Comfortable too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you can walk around this tube,</v>

2640
01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:14.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big is this tube?</v>

2641
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Is it worse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it worse?</v>

2642
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:20.300
<v Speaker 3>This smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's farts in a tube going 500 miles</v>

2643
01:54:20.301 --> 01:54:24.080
<v Speaker 3>now on the ground or in a tube going 500</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour in the sky.</v>

2644
01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.340
<v Speaker 3>The Sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plan.</v>

2645
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:29.620
<v Speaker 3>How often do you just say fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot hold these motherfuckers.</v>

2646
01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:33.470
<v Speaker 3>You let him so fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit is so rude.</v>

2647
01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:34.304
<v Speaker 3>Cause most of the time you hold it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>right most of the time and try to time </v>

2648
01:54:36.581 --> 01:54:37.414
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a bathroom,</v>

2649
01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:39.260
<v Speaker 3>you gotta do right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got damn good.</v>

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Nailed it man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to go for it and </v>

2652
01:54:42.831 --> 01:54:44.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed.</v>

2653
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Put your eye shades on the tender </v>
<v Speaker 3>asleep.</v>

2654
01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:50.210
<v Speaker 3>They just let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dudes do that to me all the time.</v>

2655
01:54:51.970 --> 01:54:54.230
<v Speaker 3>This guy decided to just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2656
01:54:54.231 --> 01:54:55.064
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could either be this guy or that guy </v>

2657
01:54:56.571 --> 01:54:58.980
<v Speaker 3>that recycled air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking your world up.</v>

2658
01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:02.180
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be like a suction thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your and the seat.</v>

2659
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:04.560
<v Speaker 3>So like a little button you press and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>soaks.</v>

2660
01:55:05.850 --> 01:55:10.850
<v Speaker 3>It does help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit does help a lot.</v>

2661
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:13.880
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh it's pretty good.</v>

2662
01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:18.140
<v Speaker 3>It was probably for the farts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the fights.</v>

2663
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:19.093
<v Speaker 3>Probably broad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a fucking fat wherever in a </v>

2664
01:55:21.531 --> 01:55:23.150
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a fan blowing on you?</v>

2665
01:55:23.151 --> 01:55:24.710
<v Speaker 3>It blows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard.</v>

2666
01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:25.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to fix that problem and claim </v>

2667
01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:32.680
<v Speaker 3>for the farts and they never talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2668
01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.153
<v Speaker 3>Mark fans for 500% or you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back when people used to smoke on </v>

2669
01:55:40.701 --> 01:55:41.534
<v Speaker 3>planes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when they had them remember that </v>

2670
01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 3>these to smoke</v>

2671
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.100
<v Speaker 4>on planes and then it got to the point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you could only smoke in the back.</v>

2672
01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.140
<v Speaker 4>So they had a smoking section.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2673
01:55:49.141 --> 01:55:51.750
<v Speaker 4>I used to fly back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was crazy.</v>

2674
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:54.810
<v Speaker 4>You would?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be in those sections man.</v>

2675
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.420
<v Speaker 4>Cause I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be,</v>

2676
01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:58.110
<v Speaker 4>that's where he could buy tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just like,</v>

2677
01:55:58.111 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 4>they would say the only tickets that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>available,</v>

2678
01:55:59.761 --> 01:56:01.530
<v Speaker 4>the smoking section and it would cost </v>
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>

2679
01:56:01.930 --> 01:56:03.480
<v Speaker 4>You go into that fucking smoking </v>
<v Speaker 4>section,</v>

2680
01:56:03.481 --> 01:56:07.960
<v Speaker 4>just sit down people around your light </v>
<v Speaker 4>and home in a two.</v>

2681
01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile you come on the whole craze </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking cessation point though.</v>

2682
01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:14.213
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dice clay used to have a little bit </v>

2683
01:56:14.611 --> 01:56:16.330
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in a fucking toe.</v>

2684
01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:19.153
<v Speaker 4>Don't have to go back to everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing the same fucking hell bit </v>

2685
01:56:25.311 --> 01:56:27.000
<v Speaker 4>about a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking hilarious.</v>

2686
01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:28.193
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a weird time when people used to </v>

2687
01:56:29.071 --> 01:56:31.920
<v Speaker 4>go to smoke everywhere in restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Bar,</v>

2688
01:56:31.930 --> 01:56:32.763
<v Speaker 4>everywhere you went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would see people smoking movie </v>

2689
01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:35.253
<v Speaker 4>theaters.</v>

2690
01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:36.503
<v Speaker 4>Now I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tell you not to smoke in movie </v>

2691
01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:39.750
<v Speaker 4>theaters where people would do it all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2692
01:56:39.751 --> 01:56:41.100
<v Speaker 4>People get mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>

2693
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:44.860
<v Speaker 4>put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of those laws that was at,</v>

2694
01:56:44.970 --> 01:56:47.060
<v Speaker 4>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government work.</v>

2695
01:56:47.070 --> 01:56:49.510
<v Speaker 4>Totally Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2696
01:56:49.511 --> 01:56:51.600
<v Speaker 4>you know what was a good law?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

2697
01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:52.434
<v Speaker 4>Because people were filing lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people that worked inside </v>

2698
01:56:55.411 --> 01:56:57.390
<v Speaker 4>restaurants and bars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were getting cancer,</v>

2699
01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:01.290
<v Speaker 4>lung cancer from secondhand smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if your job was to be a waitress</v>

2700
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:03.700
<v Speaker 4>and you got to go to this fucking bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday people go,</v>

2701
01:57:03.701 --> 01:57:05.010
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gives you shoot booger.</v>

2702
01:57:05.150 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good job.</v>

2703
01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Why should you be subject to being </v>
<v Speaker 4>poisoned at a good job?</v>

2704
01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.310
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy,</v>

2705
01:57:11.311 --> 01:57:13.860
<v Speaker 4>it's not like drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're drinking and I'm not drinking,</v>

2706
01:57:13.861 --> 01:57:14.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm right next to you.</v>

2707
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:15.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't suffer anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2708
01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:16.793
<v Speaker 4>But if you're smoking right next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially if you work in a place </v>

2709
01:57:18.691 --> 01:57:20.490
<v Speaker 4>where everybody's smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2710
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.350
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strip club baby.</v>

2711
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:24.900
<v Speaker 4>I never got him to cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys are flipped with cigarettes.</v>

2712
01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've had them before.</v>

2713
01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Go on stage before with Tony </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hinchcliffe.</v>

2714
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.720
<v Speaker 4>I've taken a smacks snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

2715
01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:32.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fire you up dude.</v>

2716
01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:33.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gives you,</v>

2717
01:57:33.511 --> 01:57:34.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2718
01:57:34.441 --> 01:57:35.274
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very much like a nootropic really </v>

2719
01:57:36.901 --> 01:57:39.210
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very bad for your body for sure.</v>

2720
01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:44.370
<v Speaker 4>But stimulant in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like tobacco is a stimulant for sure.</v>

2721
01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:46.320
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>if you could chew,</v>

2723
01:57:47.611 --> 01:57:49.170

<v Speaker 4>move.</v>

2724
01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:52.320
<v Speaker 4>Like Donald gave me some of those chew </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was here and I was like,</v>

2725

<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2729

2787
01:59:58.031 --> 02:00:00.340
<v Speaker 2>specific buzz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just chemicals,</v>

<v Speaker 2>all that thick smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the smoke.</v>

2821
02:01:27.710 --> 02:01:32.230
<v Speaker 2>You can chew and like Donald has </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic cardio and he chews or dips.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dip paired the same thing.</v>

2824
02:01:36.101 --> 02:01:36.934
<v Speaker 2>But the shoe was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember those old school baseball </v>

2825
02:01:38.231 --> 02:01:39.830
<v Speaker 2>players look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2826
02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:40.120
<v Speaker 2>they have</v>

2827
02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:43.730
<v Speaker 4>that shit like Lenny Dykstra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2828
02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:44.631
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really crazy,</v>

2829
02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is probably very similar to what it</v>

2830
02:01:47.871 --> 02:01:50.240
<v Speaker 4>feels like when you're chewing cocoa </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaves.</v>

2831
02:01:50.690 --> 02:01:53.960
<v Speaker 4>But the coca leaves are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when those guys in Peru,</v>

2832
02:01:53.961 --> 02:01:57.350
<v Speaker 4>they take those coca leaves and they put</v>
<v Speaker 4>them in the side of their mouth and they</v>

2833
02:01:57.351 --> 02:01:58.910
<v Speaker 4>chew on them and they showed them all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2834
02:01:58.980 --> 02:01:59.813
<v Speaker 4>And you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you also get actual vitamins from the </v>

2835
02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 4>flavonoids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

2836
02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:06.440
<v Speaker 4>God Damn Cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that guy.</v>

2837
02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:08.120
<v Speaker 4>That many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2838
02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:10.550
<v Speaker 4>that's cat Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the wrong stuff.</v>

2839
02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:14.060
<v Speaker 4>You want to coca leaves that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's God.</v>

2840
02:02:14.061 --> 02:02:16.850
<v Speaker 4>That's a stimulant or a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a narcotic rather.</v>

2841
02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:19.610
<v Speaker 4>That cat stuff is very much like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a narcotic.</v>

2842
02:02:19.611 --> 02:02:21.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like meth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan's us.</v>

2843
02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes it crazy.</v>

2844
02:02:23.631 --> 02:02:26.900
<v Speaker 4>They do a lot of crazy shit on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this stuff is a coca leaves.</v>

2845
02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:27.913
<v Speaker 4>They take it and they pack their mouth </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it and they chew on it and it has </v>

2846
02:02:31.101 --> 02:02:32.930
<v Speaker 4>an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a stimulant effect.</v>

2847
02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:36.170
<v Speaker 4>It's similar to a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never done it,</v>

2848
02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:37.670
<v Speaker 4>but I have had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2849
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:40.750
<v Speaker 4>a tea that was made out of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Matteto [inaudible] tea.</v>

2850
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:43.220
<v Speaker 4>Crunk no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't shut the fuck up,</v>

2851
02:02:43.221 --> 02:02:44.880
<v Speaker 4>which is always a problem already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

2852
02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:47.660
<v Speaker 4>are awesome depending on what your job </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

2853
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:48.441
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't.</v>

2854
02:02:48.441 --> 02:02:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Coke was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't jacked.</v>

2855
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:51.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never done cuts.</v>

2856
02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Work coat comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2857
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2858
02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:57.440
<v Speaker 4>But it's chewing the leaves versus the </v>
<v Speaker 4>processed soup.</v>

2859
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:58.303
<v Speaker 4>It's like the difference between getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>your sugar from eating an orange versus </v>

2860
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:05.840
<v Speaker 4>eating like a couple of tablespoons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like real processed sugar.</v>

2861
02:03:05.841 --> 02:03:07.100
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your body's like,</v>

2862
02:03:07.101 --> 02:03:07.934
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where the hell is this shit coming </v>

2863
02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:12.440
<v Speaker 4>from body doesn't know what the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do with like a spoon of sugar.</v>

2864
02:03:12.441 --> 02:03:15.680
<v Speaker 4>It's like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is this alone?</v>

2865
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:18.830
<v Speaker 4>Where's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's all the fiber?</v>

2866
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:21.190
<v Speaker 4>Where's the fucking vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just shit.</v>

2867
02:03:21.191 --> 02:03:22.810
<v Speaker 4>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You crazy assholes.</v>

2868
02:03:22.811 --> 02:03:25.100
<v Speaker 4>That's what cocaine is and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can fuck with fruit.</v>

2869
02:03:25.101 --> 02:03:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Cause the fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2870
02:03:26.061 --> 02:03:26.894
<v Speaker 4>Cause they breaks down different and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I think these people that </v>

2871
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:30.343
<v Speaker 4>chew these cocoa leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get a totally different experience </v>

2872
02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:34.340
<v Speaker 4>than someone who does coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to try it though.</v>

2873
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:35.263
<v Speaker 4>I never chewed the leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be done with two popular to those </v>

2874
02:03:37.590 --> 02:03:40.130
<v Speaker 4>should be legal bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be 100% legal.</v>

2875
02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:42.120
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pride.</v>

2876
02:03:42.121 --> 02:03:42.954
<v Speaker 4>You can't even have those leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is you could take those </v>

2877
02:03:44.271 --> 02:03:45.800
<v Speaker 4>leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can process it into cocaine,</v>

2878
02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:51.040
<v Speaker 4>which by the way is an actual ingredient</v>
<v Speaker 4>and cocacola still cocaine is still,</v>

2879
02:03:51.621 --> 02:03:53.540
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes it is.</v>

2880
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:54.763
<v Speaker 4>They take coca leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they processed the coca leaves and they </v>

2881
02:03:57.741 --> 02:04:01.400
<v Speaker 4>make medical cocaine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the same plant that does this,</v>

2882
02:04:01.401 --> 02:04:06.020
<v Speaker 4>the same processing place it does this </v>
<v Speaker 4>ships the flavors of it to Coca Cola.</v>

2883
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:08.540
<v Speaker 4>So it's one of the main flavors they </v>
<v Speaker 4>use.</v>

2884
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:09.383
<v Speaker 4>Got Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola are two </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different tasting things I've </v>

2885
02:04:11.741 --> 02:04:12.574
<v Speaker 4>enclosed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons why they taste </v>

2886
02:04:13.521 --> 02:04:14.354
<v Speaker 4>different is coca cola used to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine in it and now it's flavored by </v>

2887
02:04:17.421 --> 02:04:18.254
<v Speaker 4>coca leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google that coke is so much better than </v>

2888
02:04:20.571 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Pepsi Cooler that they still look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2889
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:24.680
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To this day dude,</v>

2890
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:28.130
<v Speaker 4>coca extractions is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got cocaine free leaves are sold to</v>

2891
02:04:28.131 --> 02:04:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2892
02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:34.150
<v Speaker 4>So they take these cocoa leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the factory processes them,</v>

2893
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 4>turns him into medical cocaine and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of the shit that's processed</v>

2894
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:43.040
<v Speaker 2>without cocaine in it is shipped to Coca</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cola flavor knowledge.</v>

2895
02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:44.003
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the medical cocaine when it's medical </v>

2896
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:49.230
<v Speaker 2>lidacain um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is uh,</v>

2897
02:04:49.231 --> 02:04:52.050
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that they use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the gay cousin of cocaine they</v>

2898
02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:52.884
<v Speaker 2>use it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get you high but it numbs you </v>

2899
02:04:54.391 --> 02:04:55.950
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2900
02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2901
02:04:57.121 --> 02:05:01.800
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we took a lot of Coca Cola.</v>

2902
02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:04.560
<v Speaker 2>They must be making a lot of medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine man.</v>

2903
02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:05.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must be making ridiculous amounts </v>

2904
02:05:06.331 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much the actual flavor they</v>

2905
02:05:09.271 --> 02:05:12.660
<v Speaker 2>get out of the leaves versus actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

2906
02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:13.713
<v Speaker 2>It's probably taken a lot of leaves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get cocaine's last time you had like a </v>

2907
02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:17.880
<v Speaker 2>nice ice cold Coke Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink.</v>

2908
02:05:17.881 --> 02:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

2909
02:05:19.391 --> 02:05:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I had a diet coke last night though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's even worse.</v>

2910
02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:24.660

<v Speaker 2>That shit is rarely do.</v>

2911
02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:26.120
<v Speaker 2>But it said fuck it.</v>

2915
02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:36.533
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd wake up in the middle of the night </v>

2916
02:05:39.751 --> 02:05:40.584
<v Speaker 2>and run down to the 24 hour liquor store</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get a couple cans of coke and just </v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2970
02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.640
<v Speaker 6>engineer or a rather,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2971
02:07:57.670 --> 02:07:58.503
<v Speaker 6>executive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2972
02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:00.340
<v Speaker 6>you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll get the money line code.</v>

2973
02:08:00.341 --> 02:08:02.980
<v Speaker 6>He's not that big of an underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2974
02:08:02.981 --> 02:08:05.410
<v Speaker 6>cody's fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Super Dangerous.</v>

2975
02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.450
<v Speaker 6>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2976
02:08:06.451 --> 02:08:09.850
<v Speaker 6>is he ever faced anybody that moves the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way dominic does?</v>

2977
02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:10.713
<v Speaker 6>And we've seen with so many guys that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they have a really hard time hitting </v>

2978
02:08:13.511 --> 02:08:15.700
<v Speaker 6>dominic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a really hard time to hit.</v>

2979
02:08:15.701 --> 02:08:17.650
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so dominic is a two to one favorite,</v>

2980
02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:19.270
<v Speaker 6>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2981
02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.190
<v Speaker 6>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd say that's,</v>

2982
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:23.050
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cody's one 75,</v>

2983
02:08:23.051 --> 02:08:23.884
<v Speaker 6>so the real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the real spread is only 35 cents on a </v>

2984
02:08:26.921 --> 02:08:28.360
<v Speaker 6>dollar a dollar bet.</v>

2985
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:29.440
<v Speaker 6>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not crazy.</v>

2986
02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:29.861
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's swear.</v>

2987
02:08:29.861 --> 02:08:32.560
<v Speaker 6>She got good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dominic is what they're banking on.</v>

2988
02:08:32.561 --> 02:08:33.040
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2989
02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:35.920
<v Speaker 6>cody hasn't Mizzou.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] is best win,</v>

2990
02:08:36.810 --> 02:08:39.940
<v Speaker 6>which was his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's what got him this title shot.</v>

2991
02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:42.580
<v Speaker 6>Here's something bank on him landing on </v>
<v Speaker 6>Dominic.</v>

2992
02:08:42.670 --> 02:08:44.020
<v Speaker 6>Here's something that people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about.</v>

2993
02:08:44.021 --> 02:08:46.220
<v Speaker 6>Linacre and Tj dillashaw is on the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>card.</v>

2994
02:08:46.221 --> 02:08:49.450
<v Speaker 6>That's a crazy fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Linacre scary.</v>

2995
02:08:50.010 --> 02:08:52.120
<v Speaker 6>Lineker super scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's terrifying.</v>

2996
02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:56.800
<v Speaker 6>Building that little monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's built like a chimpanzee dude.</v>

2997
02:08:56.801 --> 02:09:00.540
<v Speaker 6>He like like a a pounder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when I say a little racist,</v>

2998
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:02.530
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I call myself a month 35.</v>

2999
02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:05.800
<v Speaker 6>Just want to specify Linacre wasn't any </v>
<v Speaker 6>one 25.</v>

3000
02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:07.060
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was one 25.</v>

3001
02:09:07.061 --> 02:09:07.894
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't make the way that he has.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has a real talent and he has real </v>

3002
02:09:12.251 --> 02:09:15.220
<v Speaker 6>power at that was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Scary guy.</v>

3003
02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.520
<v Speaker 6>Hemmer cody's the hardest hitters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That latter one fight.</v>

3004
02:09:18.710 --> 02:09:19.340
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible]</v>

3005
02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:20.173
<v Speaker 6>a different kind of hit her though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think cody is lightning fast and like </v>

3006
02:09:22.331 --> 02:09:24.370
<v Speaker 6>beautiful combinations and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 6>footwork,</v>

3007
02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:25.233
<v Speaker 6>better technique.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The angles that he cut when he knocked </v>

3008
02:09:27.491 --> 02:09:28.360
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3009
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:29.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thomas,</v>

3010
02:09:29.981 --> 02:09:30.814
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I made up when he knocked out Thomas </v>

3011
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:33.663
<v Speaker 6>Almeda like Amanda was undefeated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very scary and he cut some serious </v>

3012
02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:38.710
<v Speaker 6>fucking angles and drop some bombs on </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

3013
02:09:38.711 --> 02:09:39.520
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

3014
02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 6>Cody's back speed of entry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His uncle was alternative Olympic boxer.</v>

3015
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:48.070
<v Speaker 6>His Dad was a boxer and they just put </v>
<v Speaker 6>this little ball of hate and to him,</v>

3016
02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.113
<v Speaker 6>but he's a ridiculous wrestler to his </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of knockout power is a different </v>

3017
02:09:52.781 --> 02:09:53.614
<v Speaker 6>kind of knockout power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then Linacre Linacre is almost like a </v>

3018
02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:59.410
<v Speaker 6>guy that is 20 or 30 pounds bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

3019
02:09:59.411 --> 02:10:01.930
<v Speaker 6>It's weird like he hits guides and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>see them like,</v>

3020
02:10:02.130 --> 02:10:02.963
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's hitting you on the arms with </v>

3021
02:10:04.811 --> 02:10:07.990
<v Speaker 6>these bombs and he takes a shot </v>
<v Speaker 6>extremely well.</v>

3022
02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:11.690
<v Speaker 6>Like when he fought a Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3023
02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:13.160
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you watched the,</v>

3024
02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 6>the combination of those two guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>unloaded in the first round,</v>

3025
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:17.470
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

3026
02:10:17.471 --> 02:10:20.770
<v Speaker 6>Francisco Rivera is a bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a very good striker.</v>

3027
02:10:21.070 --> 02:10:21.903
<v Speaker 6>And he just decided to go to war with </v>
<v Speaker 6>Linacre and Leonard who was just </v>

3028
02:10:24.670 --> 02:10:27.070
<v Speaker 6>dropping bombs on them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>

3029
02:10:27.071 --> 02:10:30.820
<v Speaker 6>he can do this even at one 35 maybe be </v>
<v Speaker 6>even better at one 35.</v>

3030
02:10:30.850 --> 02:10:32.770
<v Speaker 6>I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I love to watch linacre fight.</v>

3031
02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.633
<v Speaker 6>I don't think in for right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think could be championed with </v>

3032
02:10:36.981 --> 02:10:38.990
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with that style of fighting.</v>

3033
02:10:39.670 --> 02:10:42.520
<v Speaker 6>Don't and only boxing watch what </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>

3034
02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:43.753
<v Speaker 6>Watch what happens when Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause it's easy to game plan for Tj and </v>

3035
02:10:46.701 --> 02:10:47.840
<v Speaker 6>Dwayne lug width and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

3036
02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 6>this is what we do and you're gonna see </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

3037
02:10:49.401 --> 02:10:50.234
<v Speaker 6>Angles makes it it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm excited about it because I think tj </v>

3038
02:10:53.751 --> 02:10:55.520
<v Speaker 6>spectacularly talented,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no doubt,</v>

3039
02:10:55.521 --> 02:10:58.850
<v Speaker 6>and Tj has amazing footwork and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3040
02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.170
<v Speaker 6>the Duane system.</v>

3041
02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.030
<v Speaker 6>But Leonard has got something special.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

3042
02:11:02.050 --> 02:11:02.461
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

3043
02:11:02.461 --> 02:11:05.990
<v Speaker 6>I've very rarely seen a guy at his </v>
<v Speaker 6>weight class that hits people the way he</v>

3044
02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:07.100
<v Speaker 6>does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a very,</v>

3045
02:11:07.101 --> 02:11:09.020
<v Speaker 6>it's an almost like good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's doing a different thing.</v>

3046
02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:10.153
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's different kind of months or those </v>

3047
02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.433
<v Speaker 6>fights are very similar where cody </v>
<v Speaker 6>garbrandt just needs one to win the </v>

3048
02:11:14.721 --> 02:11:16.730
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Linacre needs one to win the fight.</v>

3049
02:11:16.731 --> 02:11:20.210
<v Speaker 6>Dominic Cruz footwork's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tj dillashaw is footwork.</v>

3050
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:21.650
<v Speaker 6>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you've got to think,</v>

3051
02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.513
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tj Kol Hanan Barao twice dropped him in </v>

3052
02:11:24.771 --> 02:11:26.080
<v Speaker 6>the first round with a straight right </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand.</v>

3053
02:11:26.090 --> 02:11:28.970
<v Speaker 6>It's not like Tj doesn't have power and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Tj hooker power,</v>

3054
02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:30.013
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't have the same kind of power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's got way more options as far as </v>

3055
02:11:32.661 --> 02:11:33.830
<v Speaker 6>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3056
02:11:33.831 --> 02:11:34.664
<v Speaker 6>So it's going to be very interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see how you have this movement came and </v>

3057
02:11:37.461 --> 02:11:40.040
<v Speaker 6>remember that fight only three routes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which hurts.</v>

3058
02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:41.053
<v Speaker 6>I finished Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tj because he's got to survive the </v>

3059
02:11:43.791 --> 02:11:45.090
<v Speaker 6>storm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3060
02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:46.333
<v Speaker 6>Tj because tj moves so good man is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in the brow fight you saw it like </v>

3061
02:11:49.761 --> 02:11:50.530
<v Speaker 6>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>browse.</v>

3062
02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 6>Got that like linear style presses for </v>
<v Speaker 6>five rounds though,</v>

3063
02:11:54.261 --> 02:11:57.680
<v Speaker 6>right of that footwork's gonna that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna be hard to follow.</v>

3064
02:11:57.681 --> 02:12:01.170
<v Speaker 6>If you're that straight forward pressure</v>
<v Speaker 6>fighter for championship rounds,</v>

3065
02:12:01.171 --> 02:12:04.610
<v Speaker 6>you're like Jesus Christ and starts </v>
<v Speaker 6>wearing on you and then tj takes over.</v>

3066
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:06.170
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good point.</v>

3067
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:08.120
<v Speaker 6>I think Tj uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

3068
02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:12.800
<v Speaker 6>is definitely in a tricky situation </v>
<v Speaker 6>because he wanted that rematch,</v>

3069
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:13.723
<v Speaker 6>wanted that title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was really close in the first fight </v>

3070
02:12:15.321 --> 02:12:17.220
<v Speaker 6>with dominick Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a real close person.</v>

3071
02:12:17.230 --> 02:12:19.520
<v Speaker 6>You just told me they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you won that fight.</v>

3072
02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:21.710
<v Speaker 6>I think Dana even agreed was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you won that fight man.</v>

3073
02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.720
<v Speaker 6>It's a very close fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no doubt about it.</v>

3074
02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:24.673
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoever you believe won that fight and </v>

3075
02:12:25.521 --> 02:12:28.670
<v Speaker 6>then dominic goes on and beat Shariah </v>
<v Speaker 6>and beat them handily.</v>

3076
02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:32.930
<v Speaker 6>And now dominick is stepping in to fight</v>
<v Speaker 6>him and he's got a,</v>

3077
02:12:32.931 --> 02:12:33.764
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a fighting cody and he's got a </v>

3078
02:12:35.721 --> 02:12:36.554
<v Speaker 6>really tough fight on that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on that same card and a really tough </v>

3079
02:12:39.411 --> 02:12:42.680
<v Speaker 6>fight where if he loses that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck man back in the line.</v>

3080
02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:43.613
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is a guy with that is missed </v>

3081
02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:45.493
<v Speaker 6>wait a couple of times and Linacre is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like kind of tricky in that situation </v>

<v Speaker 6>Kao I had it but it didn't pull up it </v>

<v Speaker 6>like real classical style,</v>

3112
02:14:06.001 --> 02:14:09.570
<v Speaker 6>real good at punching power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not built like a scary guy,</v>

3113
02:14:09.571 --> 02:14:14.340
<v Speaker 6>but a vicious knockout artists like one </v>
<v Speaker 6>of those guys where the body really sort</v>

3114
02:14:14.341 --> 02:14:14.790
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

3115
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:16.680

<v Speaker 6>is very deceptive.</v>

3116
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:19.150
<v Speaker 6>And remember he was like top,</v>
<v Speaker 6>top prospect.</v>

3117
02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:23.810
<v Speaker 6>He was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big prospect to see Uriah or Hanan Barao</v>

3118
02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:25.680
<v Speaker 6>first he lost a hand and Barao.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

3119
02:14:25.710 --> 02:14:28.320
<v Speaker 6>and then he came back and fought uriah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't that the case?</v>

3120
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:30.390
<v Speaker 6>How tall is linker?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's short.</v>

3121
02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:32.700
<v Speaker 6>He's short,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's about the same height as dwight</v>

3122
02:14:32.701 --> 02:14:34.870
<v Speaker 6>cow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Five says.</v>

3123
02:14:35.970 --> 02:14:36.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

3124
02:14:36.630 --> 02:14:37.590
<v Speaker 6>they don't think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Honestly.</v>

3125
02:14:37.591 --> 02:14:40.050
<v Speaker 6>I think he's five four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a small little dude.</v>

3126
02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:43.950
<v Speaker 6>He's a small guy but hits like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>mack truck.</v>

3127
02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:48.840
<v Speaker 6>Almost creepy in his power man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like and in so confident in it too.</v>

3128
02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:49.733
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the point where I don't think he's </v>

3129
02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:52.613
<v Speaker 6>going to be champ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You look at a guy like John Dotson who </v>

3130
02:14:54.541 --> 02:14:57.540
<v Speaker 6>just outworked them and I thought he </v>
<v Speaker 6>lost that fight.</v>

3131
02:14:57.630 --> 02:14:59.370
<v Speaker 6>Granted they gave it to Lynika.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3132
02:14:59.371 --> 02:15:01.320
<v Speaker 6>well it was close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3133
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:02.040
<v Speaker 6>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

3134
02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 6>he heard him there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

3135
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.863
<v Speaker 6>he heard him there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could see Mike McDowell steps back </v>

3136
02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:06.840
<v Speaker 6>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh Jesus.</v>

3137
02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:07.973
<v Speaker 6>There's a feeling that guys get when he </v>
<v Speaker 6>connects on them when you see it in </v>

3138
02:15:10.591 --> 02:15:11.341
<v Speaker 6>their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like,</v>

3139
02:15:11.341 --> 02:15:14.640
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a different thing here.</v>

3140
02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:15.270
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

3141
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:17.550
<v Speaker 6>that's not snowflake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not snowflake move.</v>

3142
02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:18.421
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3143
02:15:18.421 --> 02:15:19.254
<v Speaker 6>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's also got a ridiculous Chin when he </v>

3144
02:15:21.361 --> 02:15:23.100
<v Speaker 6>foot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he stood in front of Rivera,</v>

3145
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:24.390
<v Speaker 6>it's going like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3146
02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:24.810

02:15:24.810 --> 02:15:29.040

<v Speaker 6>And Rivera fun but rare flattens people.</v>

3148
02:15:29.130 --> 02:15:31.080
<v Speaker 6>So as you watch like Linacre walk them </v>
<v Speaker 6>down here,</v>

3149
02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.440
<v Speaker 6>you're looking at this kid who's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>got unique power.</v>

3150
02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:35.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like really unique.</v>

3151
02:15:35.671 --> 02:15:36.540
<v Speaker 6>And even a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3152
02:15:36.541 --> 02:15:37.374
<v Speaker 6>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

3153
02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:39.560
<v Speaker 6>Michael McDonald recognize he goes down </v>
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

3154
02:15:39.561 --> 02:15:40.500
<v Speaker 6>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he goes down again,</v>

3155
02:15:40.530 --> 02:15:41.363
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

3156
02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:41.970
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom.</v>

3157
02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:43.710
<v Speaker 6>And linacre just stands in front of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>

3158
02:15:43.711 --> 02:15:46.350
<v Speaker 6>bites on his mouthpiece and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>malls on Mcdonald.</v>

3159
02:15:46.351 --> 02:15:49.020
<v Speaker 6>Landed one deal and Linacre ate it like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a tic TAC.</v>

3160
02:15:49.021 --> 02:15:51.090
<v Speaker 6>And he's moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom,</v>

3161
02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:53.400
<v Speaker 6>take home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he rocks him again.</v>

3162
02:15:53.610 --> 02:15:58.610
<v Speaker 6>And he's just undeniably confidence in </v>
<v Speaker 6>his ability to walk you down and smash.</v>

3163
02:15:59.371 --> 02:16:00.204
<v Speaker 6>You.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See what you can't do as loan back yet </v>

<v Speaker 6>You gotta move,</v>

3165
02:16:03.841 --> 02:16:06.600
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See I've heard him again times more,</v>

3166
02:16:07.110 --> 02:16:09.780
<v Speaker 6>10 times more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>100% but the question is,</v>

3167
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:10.853
<v Speaker 6>is there going to be exchanges were </v>
<v Speaker 6>dillashaw is inside of his range and </v>

3168
02:16:13.591 --> 02:16:16.680
<v Speaker 6>we'll one of these things land and once </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those things do land,</v>

3169
02:16:16.681 --> 02:16:19.410
<v Speaker 6>we'll dillashaw continue to engage the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same way like boom,</v>

3170
02:16:19.411 --> 02:16:20.190
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom.</v>

3171
02:16:20.190 --> 02:16:21.023
<v Speaker 6>Or will it be over right lands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But tj takes a good shot and has never </v>

3172
02:16:24.091 --> 02:16:27.480
<v Speaker 6>been a guy to stand in front of you like</v>
<v Speaker 6>this and Oh look at that.</v>

3173
02:16:27.650 --> 02:16:32.110
<v Speaker 6>And we see his head gets snapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What [inaudible] talking about.</v>

3174
02:16:32.550 --> 02:16:36.040
<v Speaker 6>It's very rare that anybody has that </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of destroying power.</v>

3175
02:16:36.090 --> 02:16:38.170
<v Speaker 6>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember Tj can wrestle too,</v>

3176
02:16:38.171 --> 02:16:40.060
<v Speaker 6>so if they're getting close he'll take </v>
<v Speaker 6>his ass down.</v>

3177
02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:41.313
<v Speaker 6>The difference between him and Dotson at</v>
<v Speaker 6>one 35 and I liked Dotson at 35 I think </v>

3178
02:16:44.621 --> 02:16:45.454
<v Speaker 6>he's better at 35 then 25 I just think </v>
<v Speaker 6>he just kills himself too much to make </v>

3179
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:49.444
<v Speaker 6>that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you fought GAM Berrien is </v>

3180
02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:53.890
<v Speaker 6>dotson can sneak in on you and your son </v>
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

3181
02:16:54.250 --> 02:16:55.083
<v Speaker 6>And when they fought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did they fight at 35 or 25 when it came </v>

3182
02:16:57.811 --> 02:16:59.450
<v Speaker 6>bands and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

3183
02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.600
<v Speaker 6>and Linacre fought does at 25.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it 100% of the 25?</v>

3184
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it,</v>

3185
02:17:06.010 --> 02:17:06.843
<v Speaker 6>you might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's the right weight </v>

3186
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:11.320
<v Speaker 6>class for dots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think Dodson we'd be at both guys.</v>

3187
02:17:11.350 --> 02:17:14.890
<v Speaker 6>I think both guys were way better off </v>
<v Speaker 6>without destroying themselves.</v>

3188
02:17:14.891 --> 02:17:15.724
<v Speaker 6>Those are fun fights man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then on the pre the fs one prelims </v>

3189
02:17:18.581 --> 02:17:20.950
<v Speaker 6>are stacked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got Neil magni versa.</v>

3190
02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:24.860
<v Speaker 6>What's that catch weight?</v>
<v Speaker 6>One 36 and a half wait or no?</v>

3191
02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.590
<v Speaker 6>So it must've been like a last minute </v>
<v Speaker 6>decision to,</v>

3192
02:17:28.630 --> 02:17:29.463
<v Speaker 6>to have that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So That's interesting that Dodson and </v>

3193
02:17:31.451 --> 02:17:33.520
<v Speaker 6>him went to war and linear one that </v>
<v Speaker 6>decision.</v>

3194
02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:34.780
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I 35,</v>

3195
02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.260
<v Speaker 6>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3196
02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:37.680
<v Speaker 6>you talked about some one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3197
02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:39.910
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's the other thing about Tj.</v>

3198
02:17:39.911 --> 02:17:40.744
<v Speaker 6>You got to think how long has tj really </v>
<v Speaker 6>been with Duane Ludwig and he continues </v>

3199
02:17:43.001 --> 02:17:45.250
<v Speaker 6>to get better with Duane Ludwig?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's only been a few years.</v>

3200
02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:48.340
<v Speaker 6>So in the last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we,</v>

3201
02:17:48.350 --> 02:17:48.941
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we will do,</v>

3202
02:17:48.941 --> 02:17:49.774
<v Speaker 6>we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've seen the two big fights with Hana </v>

3203
02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:52.720
<v Speaker 6>barrao where he marked him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

3204
02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:55.570
<v Speaker 6>which are the all time career highlight </v>
<v Speaker 6>performances.</v>

3205
02:17:55.570 --> 02:17:56.403
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe especially the second one that Joe </v>

3206
02:17:57.670 --> 02:17:58.503
<v Speaker 6>Soto fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was an interesting fight because </v>

3207
02:17:59.470 --> 02:18:02.130
<v Speaker 6>taking a real tough guy on a real short </v>
<v Speaker 6>notice today,</v>

3208
02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:06.280
<v Speaker 6>none day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one day during the way in trying to make</v>

3209
02:18:06.281 --> 02:18:07.114
<v Speaker 6>weight falls asleep and bangs his head </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the wall because he cut too much </v>

3210
02:18:09.461 --> 02:18:11.140
<v Speaker 6>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe Soto steps in.</v>

3211
02:18:11.350 --> 02:18:14.170
<v Speaker 6>And so tj makes that adjustment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wins that fight coming back,</v>

3212
02:18:14.590 --> 02:18:17.740
<v Speaker 6>beats the shit out of Barao and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>rematch like really dominated him in the</v>

3213
02:18:17.741 --> 02:18:19.030
<v Speaker 6>rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are like,</v>

3214
02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:21.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>real highlight reel finishes,</v>

3215
02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:23.290
<v Speaker 6>all three of those fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then,</v>

3216
02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:24.250
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he goes from that,</v>

3217
02:18:24.251 --> 02:18:28.680
<v Speaker 6>the really close lost to Dominick Cruz </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then beats a sun sal.</v>

3218
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:31.230
<v Speaker 6>Like he took a chance with a sun sal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A sense.</v>

3219
02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:33.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He beat us on site,</v>

3220
02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:34.553
<v Speaker 6>look better in the sun south fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then he did in the first time they </v>

3221
02:18:36.161 --> 02:18:38.290
<v Speaker 6>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's showing improvement just in that</v>

3222
02:18:38.291 --> 02:18:38.910
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>

3223
02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:41.860
<v Speaker 6>You just got to wonder what this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to look like,</v>

3224
02:18:41.861 --> 02:18:43.330
<v Speaker 6>what linacre versus him is going to look</v>
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>

3225
02:18:43.331 --> 02:18:44.620
<v Speaker 6>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very interesting fight.</v>

3226
02:18:44.770 --> 02:18:46.330

<v Speaker 6>Matchups fuck yeah.</v>

3227

3228
02:18:49.121 --> 02:18:49.954
<v Speaker 6>Dominic?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think the code he's going to be </v>

3229
02:18:50.741 --> 02:18:51.574
<v Speaker 6>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you look at cody move and you </v>

3230
02:18:53.081 --> 02:18:53.914
<v Speaker 6>see his success against guys like to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Gawky against guys like Thomas Almeda </v>

3231
02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:00.520
<v Speaker 6>and then you see what dominic does to </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

3232
02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:02.080
<v Speaker 6>He's in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not.</v>

3233
02:19:02.110 --> 02:19:03.940
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's shuffling stances.</v>

3234
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:06.310
<v Speaker 6>He's off to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got his hands down.</v>

3235
02:19:06.430 --> 02:19:08.680
<v Speaker 6>He's moving in this really fucking weird</v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

3236
02:19:08.681 --> 02:19:11.890
<v Speaker 6>That's real tough to emulate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love cody,</v>

3237
02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:13.900
<v Speaker 6>but the x factor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's,</v>

<v Speaker 6>We saw promise in Almeda.</v>

3242
02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:25.930
<v Speaker 6>We saw him fight a really promising God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

3243
02:19:25.931 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 6>young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not level of dominick Cruz</v>

3244
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:29.990

<v Speaker 2>like fight week.</v>

3248
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:40.460
<v Speaker 2>If he sees someone and he needs to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this,</v>

3249
02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:42.100
<v Speaker 2>but he's just young and hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3250
02:19:42.101 --> 02:19:44.780
<v Speaker 2>if he sees someone from the other camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tries to fight them in the hallway.</v>

3251
02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:48.950
<v Speaker 2>He's just like this pit bull man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just so god competitive.</v>

3252
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.990
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you see someone else from the camp </v>

3256
02:19:57.291 --> 02:19:58.124
<v Speaker 2>tries and fight some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't think that that's a waste of </v>

3257
02:19:59.901 --> 02:20:01.610
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% he's young.</v>

3258
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:03.830

<v Speaker 2>She's down to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wake.</v>

3325
02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:30.893
<v Speaker 2>Wait already apparently you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think losing to someone like Holly </v>

3326
02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Holm the way she did and to be tired and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get beat up and the whole deal like look</v>

3327
02:22:40.231 --> 02:22:41.790
<v Speaker 2>at her back there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was punching the speed bag.</v>

3328
02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3329
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:45.520
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3330
02:22:46.050 --> 02:22:46.883
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about the way she lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight and how she looked </v>

3331
02:22:51.001 --> 02:22:52.800
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't look nothing like this.</v>

3332
02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:53.693
<v Speaker 2>Like not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she's got all these videos of her </v>

3333
02:22:55.771 --> 02:22:57.540
<v Speaker 2>running up hills and all this different </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3334
02:22:57.780 --> 02:22:58.613
<v Speaker 2>She looks like way more fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got tired in the fight with holly </v>

3335
02:23:01.861 --> 02:23:05.120
<v Speaker 2>and that was a big factor is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hit was a big factor.</v>

3336
02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Getting stunned right away and but </v>
<v Speaker 2>really solid conditioning will allow you</v>

3337
02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:11.880
<v Speaker 2>to recover better than not being in such</v>
<v Speaker 2>good shape.</v>

3338
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you get hit in the Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

3339
02:23:14.001 --> 02:23:16.050
<v Speaker 2>a big factor with the guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>

3340
02:23:16.051 --> 02:23:19.080
<v Speaker 2>super fit is how they bounce back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3341
02:23:19.081 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3342
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:20.723
<v Speaker 2>Neil Magni is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can stun that guy in the first </v>

3343
02:23:22.501 --> 02:23:23.580
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so fit.</v>

3344
02:23:23.581 --> 02:23:26.070
<v Speaker 2>He bounces back for her to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that holly fight.</v>

3345
02:23:26.090 --> 02:23:27.740
<v Speaker 2>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that Ron,</v>

3346
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:29.610
<v Speaker 2>she always comes to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's always in shape.</v>

3347
02:23:29.611 --> 02:23:31.010
<v Speaker 2>She takes that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3348
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:32.000
<v Speaker 2>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes it,</v>

3349
02:23:32.290 --> 02:23:33.123
<v Speaker 2>it Kinda upon herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did not have the same sort of </v>

3350
02:23:35.161 --> 02:23:38.610
<v Speaker 2>dedication towards that fight with holly</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she's got towards this fight.</v>

3351
02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Physically it doesn't let us think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know physically.</v>

3352
02:23:41.311 --> 02:23:42.144
<v Speaker 2>You can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know cause she'd been </v>

3353
02:23:42.811 --> 02:23:44.320
<v Speaker 2>shooting movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She won't do Prescott.</v>

3354
02:23:44.420 --> 02:23:45.091
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3355
02:23:45.091 --> 02:23:48.240
<v Speaker 2>So we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could take her down her judo and not</v>

3356
02:23:48.241 --> 02:23:50.130
<v Speaker 2>try to strike with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just clinch up.</v>

3357
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Do that judo trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take her down.</v>

3358
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Anybody's in danger of that arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what she's so god,</v>

3359
02:23:57.350 --> 02:23:59.970
<v Speaker 2>she's going to mandan and this could </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily get caught in that arm bar.</v>

3360
02:23:59.971 --> 02:24:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a question for age.</v>

3361
02:24:01.491 --> 02:24:03.030
<v Speaker 2>He's got to drag her down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a question.</v>

3362
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.863
<v Speaker 2>Where do you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think she has the coaching to </v>

3363
02:24:06.481 --> 02:24:07.314
<v Speaker 2>make changes where she just doesn't pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward on a man Nunez and get punched </v>

3364
02:24:10.741 --> 02:24:12.110
<v Speaker 2>in the face course she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become,</v>

3365
02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:13.133
<v Speaker 2>of course she's going to take her time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course she's not going to go out </v>

3366
02:24:15.151 --> 02:24:17.160
<v Speaker 2>there reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to take your time.</v>

3367
02:24:17.161 --> 02:24:19.050
<v Speaker 2>That's how she came round around Shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

3368
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:21.870
<v Speaker 2>and it seems like common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fucking get crazy.</v>

3369
02:24:21.871 --> 02:24:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking get the blood going.</v>

3370
02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:25.260
<v Speaker 2>That's not her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not her.</v>

3371
02:24:25.261 --> 02:24:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't get to man.</v>

3372
02:24:26.551 --> 02:24:29.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a guy named Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gay Sound Outside and Jab and do.</v>

3373
02:24:29.281 --> 02:24:31.560
<v Speaker 2>She might try to overwhelm arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's not stupid.</v>

3374
02:24:31.561 --> 02:24:35.310
<v Speaker 2>She's going to learn from mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just fight a cleaner fight.</v>

3375
02:24:35.311 --> 02:24:37.050
<v Speaker 2>More movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more head movement.</v>

3376
02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:39.900
<v Speaker 2>The surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's had knee surgery since then.</v>

3377
02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:40.793
<v Speaker 2>She could take Amanda down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she can take cat cat cats in </v>

3378
02:24:46.441 --> 02:24:47.274
<v Speaker 2>Ghana had a real hard first round and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first round Amanda Nunez is beaten </v>

3379
02:24:49.941 --> 02:24:51.720
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of her cat Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

3380
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cat Cat came back and stop new needs.</v>

3381
02:24:56.100 --> 02:25:00.180
<v Speaker 2>That's either I got her on the back for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cardio.</v>

3382
02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:01.950
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Rhonda,</v>

3383
02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:02.953
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough because what makes Rhonda </v>

3384
02:25:04.051 --> 02:25:06.480
<v Speaker 2>great is there's this flurry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the exchange.</v>

3385
02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know you're f she fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip toss you and you're an armbar.</v>

3386
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:10.103
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing.</v>

3387
02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:11.490
<v Speaker 2>She's not really going to sit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

3388
02:25:11.491 --> 02:25:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Be patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not her.</v>

3389
02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:15.900
<v Speaker 2>But if she can like if it's a dog fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Rhonda,</v>

3390
02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I ended up catching a fourth or fifth </v>
<v Speaker 2>round cause Amanda,</v>

3391
02:25:18.091 --> 02:25:20.750
<v Speaker 2>she starts off like a tidal wave and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen it in her losses.</v>

3392
02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.890
<v Speaker 2>She kind of slows down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just does.</v>

3393
02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's going to be interesting to see</v>

3394
02:25:24.851 --> 02:25:27.370
<v Speaker 2>if American top team has been able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to mitigate that.</v>

3395
02:25:27.430 --> 02:25:28.263
<v Speaker 2>If they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what kind of strength </v>

3396
02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:30.880
<v Speaker 2>conditioning program she's under now.</v>

3397
02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:32.920
<v Speaker 2>The only problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it quite as quick.</v>

3398
02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:35.650
<v Speaker 2>If Rhonda takes her down and ends up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>

3399
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:40.420
<v Speaker 2>she might have a hard time passing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez Guard and we'll see.</v>

3400
02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Like Rhonda is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not known for guard passing,</v>

3401
02:25:44.411 --> 02:25:47.290
<v Speaker 2>so that could be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she'd shake Craig scrambles Eddie.</v>

3402
02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:50.650
<v Speaker 2>That's her thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a letter to him to get up.</v>

3403
02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:53.590
<v Speaker 2>If she can get her on her back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how will she,</v>

3404
02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:56.800
<v Speaker 2>she deal with passing the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She really doesn't.</v>

3405
02:25:56.801 --> 02:25:59.380
<v Speaker 2>She goes to it and then she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition from there.</v>

3406
02:25:59.410 --> 02:26:01.420
<v Speaker 2>You got to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With a black belt in Jujitsu,</v>

3407
02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:02.830
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard pass.</v>

3408
02:26:02.831 --> 02:26:05.590
<v Speaker 2>It's nine to really does submit anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fee.</v>

3409
02:26:06.270 --> 02:26:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda could get on top of her that </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

3410
02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:09.760
<v Speaker 2>She is a black male shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She submitted me.</v>

3411
02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:10.420
<v Speaker 2>She tape.</v>

3412
02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:13.600
<v Speaker 2>She's a black belt in Jujitsu and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair after mcmahon too.</v>

3413
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:15.063
<v Speaker 2>She battered both of them and submit </v>
<v Speaker 2>both their asses and then different </v>

3414
02:26:18.221 --> 02:26:19.990
<v Speaker 2>submission that she submits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her Mcmahon.</v>

3415
02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:23.260
<v Speaker 2>She submitted a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely have submitted Misha.</v>

3416
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I got beat her up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3417
02:26:24.851 --> 02:26:25.631
<v Speaker 2>not cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3418
02:26:25.631 --> 02:26:28.000
<v Speaker 2>She submitted me Hsa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She submitted Nisha,</v>

3419
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:30.130
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did the same thing to Sarah McMahon.</v>

3420
02:26:30.131 --> 02:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I think she cracked her and then and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then put her away with a choke.</v>

3421
02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:36.490
<v Speaker 2>The one pretty sure the one thing she </v>
<v Speaker 2>has over Rhonda in this fight,</v>

3422
02:26:36.491 --> 02:26:38.290
<v Speaker 2>it's power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has vicious power.</v>

3423
02:26:38.470 --> 02:26:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say that's it.</v>

3424
02:26:40.270 --> 02:26:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that if Rhonda does come at her </v>
<v Speaker 2>full clip like that,</v>

3425
02:26:43.870 --> 02:26:47.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a very risky proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can crack so fucking hard.</v>

3426
02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:49.720
<v Speaker 2>But if Rhonda feels like she can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>closer to that,</v>

3427
02:26:49.721 --> 02:26:51.390
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not shocking,</v>

3428
02:26:51.450 --> 02:26:54.100
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punch.</v>

3429
02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not scary.</v>

3430
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3431
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:59.530
<v Speaker 2>she's talking about Amanda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez.</v>

3432
02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:01.900
<v Speaker 2>So she's working girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only one shot.</v>

3433
02:27:01.901 --> 02:27:03.760
<v Speaker 2>She's dropping them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Shanna Blazer.</v>

3434
02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:06.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's marking girls.</v>

3435
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:08.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she needed,</v>

3436
02:27:08.291 --> 02:27:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Amanda does clench a punch as hard as </v>
<v Speaker 2>any fucking woman in that division.</v>

3437
02:27:12.430 --> 02:27:15.980
<v Speaker 2>She might be the hardest women puncher </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 135 she's the hardest one.</v>

3438
02:27:15.981 --> 02:27:18.310
<v Speaker 2>And punched her outside of Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll sidewalks.</v>

3439
02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Not One 35 just saying females in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

3440
02:27:20.861 --> 02:27:23.620
<v Speaker 2>She's the hardest punch outs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sideboards of difference.</v>

3441
02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:27.220
<v Speaker 2>You want to see her fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this in my mind.</v>

3442
02:27:27.221 --> 02:27:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Stays the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the fight with me?</v>

3443
02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see her fight with me Sha Amanda</v>

3444
02:27:31.570 --> 02:27:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Nunez?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nisha?</v>

3445
02:27:32.270 --> 02:27:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3446
02:27:33.431 --> 02:27:35.120
<v Speaker 2>but I forgot all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3447
02:27:35.570 --> 02:27:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Amanda knew this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stopping Misha.</v>

3448
02:27:37.721 --> 02:27:40.890
<v Speaker 2>She beat her up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wanted to know.</v>

3449
02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the Sarah McMahon fight?</v>

3450
02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:46.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 go before that.</v>

3451
02:27:46.511 --> 02:27:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Because before that is when she was beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>her up on the feet.</v>

3452
02:27:51.270 --> 02:27:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there.</v>

3453
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:54.130
<v Speaker 2>She's got a nasty jab to match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He steps in.</v>

3454
02:27:54.131 --> 02:27:56.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to distance to boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

3455
02:27:56.730 --> 02:27:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Good scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is like,</v>

3456
02:27:58.450 --> 02:28:00.610
<v Speaker 2>is she going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between dealing</v>

3457
02:28:00.611 --> 02:28:02.730
<v Speaker 2>with Rhonda and dealing with Misha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3458
02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:05.550
<v Speaker 2>this is a mauling man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She beat the brakes off of her.</v>

3459
02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Amanda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just putting it to me.</v>

3460
02:28:07.541 --> 02:28:08.374
<v Speaker 2>Should tape and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just has long ass punches too and </v>

3461
02:28:11.651 --> 02:28:14.800
<v Speaker 2>then she gets her back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This size sounds out,</v>

3462
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:15.703
<v Speaker 2>if Rhonda is in the right frame of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she does Russia and like she </v>

3463
02:28:18.491 --> 02:28:20.890
<v Speaker 2>usually does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably eats a shot,</v>

3464
02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>but then she gets inside,</v>

3465
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:22.963
<v Speaker 6>gets thrown under hook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>takes her for a ride and submits in the </v>

3466
02:28:24.201 --> 02:28:24.801
<v Speaker 6>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

3467
02:28:24.801 --> 02:28:29.750
<v Speaker 6>I hope nobody tests positive for </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything to so many people to in pop.</v>

3468
02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:31.390
<v Speaker 6>How about sideboard?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3469
02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:32.391
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Game.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no matter what.</v>

3471
02:28:33.801 --> 02:28:38.230

<v Speaker 6>Now everyone's goes told Ya fucking told</v>

3472
02:28:38.231 --> 02:28:39.360
<v Speaker 6>Ya.</v>

3473
02:28:39.370 --> 02:28:41.480
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lactone is what they're saying it is.</v>

3474
02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.980
<v Speaker 6>So Berona lactones a dht inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a derivative of testosterone.</v>

3475
02:28:45.981 --> 02:28:48.740
<v Speaker 6>Dihydrotestosterone I used to rub that </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit on my head.</v>

3476
02:28:48.770 --> 02:28:49.603
<v Speaker 6>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to keep my hair from </v>

3477
02:28:50.271 --> 02:28:52.370
<v Speaker 6>falling out because of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3478
02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:54.200
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have the gene for it,</v>

3479
02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:57.590
<v Speaker 6>dihydrotestosterone is what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Both of you beautiful heads of hair.</v>

3480
02:28:57.591 --> 02:28:59.420
<v Speaker 6>Don't have that as my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on dude,</v>

3481
02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:02.180
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My hair is falling out like it's fine.</v>

3482
02:29:02.181 --> 02:29:03.350
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>almost 50.</v>

3483
02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:05.180
<v Speaker 6>His hair's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thanks man.</v>

3484
02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:06.080
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

3485
02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:07.100
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] dead.</v>

3486
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:10.640
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] dead wasteland.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I was a kid or when I was in my,</v>

3487
02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:12.860
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess I was probably in my twenties,</v>

3488
02:29:12.890 --> 02:29:13.550
<v Speaker 6>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3489
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:14.383
<v Speaker 6>rub this spirono lock Tane on my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>scalp because it's a dht inhibitor and </v>

3490
02:29:18.891 --> 02:29:19.724
<v Speaker 6>it inhibits dht.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when people take steroids or a woman </v>

3491
02:29:24.051 --> 02:29:27.770
<v Speaker 6>takes steroids or a man who has that </v>
<v Speaker 6>gene where the hair falls out,</v>

3492
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:30.290
<v Speaker 6>and if a man has that gene and he takes </v>
<v Speaker 6>steroids is probably even worse.</v>

3493
02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:35.180
<v Speaker 6>But if you rub that spironolactone on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it has a dht inhibiting effect.</v>

3494
02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:38.270
<v Speaker 6>And I think if you take it orally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it also,</v>

3495
02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:41.030
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it acts as a diuretic.</v>

3496
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.500
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3497
02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:43.760
<v Speaker 6>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3498
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:44.623
<v Speaker 6>some uses as a masking agent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a whole bunch of different uses </v>

3499
02:29:47.541 --> 02:29:48.980
<v Speaker 6>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like as a diuretic.</v>

3500
02:29:48.981 --> 02:29:53.100
<v Speaker 6>It also has benefits as a masking agent </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it also mitigates the effects of,</v>

3501
02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:55.400
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of taking steroids in females.</v>

3502
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:58.490
<v Speaker 6>So there's a lot of stuff going on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>red flags with that stuff.</v>

3503
02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:01.160
<v Speaker 6>But the one on her side that she says it</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

3504
02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:03.170
<v Speaker 6>is that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's used as a diuretic,</v>

3505
02:30:03.171 --> 02:30:04.940
<v Speaker 6>which appears to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'd be great.</v>

3506
02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:08.420
<v Speaker 6>She has a rise in and fights Gabi Garcia</v>
<v Speaker 6>think about that.</v>

3507
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:09.283
<v Speaker 6>But what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she had some issues with their friends </v>

3508
02:30:11.991 --> 02:30:12.824
<v Speaker 6>and their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She had some pet issues with birth </v>

3509
02:30:14.931 --> 02:30:18.860
<v Speaker 6>control pills and then she was bloated </v>
<v Speaker 6>because of birth control pills.</v>

3510
02:30:18.861 --> 02:30:21.110
<v Speaker 6>So a doctor prescribed this to her off </v>
<v Speaker 6>season,</v>

3511
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:24.380
<v Speaker 6>which is to try to deal with a look.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

3512
02:30:24.381 --> 02:30:25.850
<v Speaker 6>I ain't never cut that kind of weight </v>
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>

3513
02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:28.130
<v Speaker 6>But if you watch that outside the lines </v>
<v Speaker 6>piece on her,</v>

3514
02:30:28.131 --> 02:30:29.090
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the weight cutting,</v>

3515
02:30:29.091 --> 02:30:31.220
<v Speaker 6>have you ever seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it in and it's horrific.</v>

3516
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:32.063
<v Speaker 6>Commissioner was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would never approve her to fight like </v>

3517
02:30:33.891 --> 02:30:34.130
<v Speaker 6>sheet.</v>

3518
02:30:34.130 --> 02:30:36.620
<v Speaker 6>That's terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How she's fighting at one three,</v>

3519
02:30:36.621 --> 02:30:37.730
<v Speaker 6>five should be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3520
02:30:37.731 --> 02:30:41.230
<v Speaker 6>one 40 she never got 20 to 35 40 even </v>
<v Speaker 6>when 40 you got to watch it,</v>

3521
02:30:41.231 --> 02:30:41.711
<v Speaker 6>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3522
02:30:41.711 --> 02:30:43.010
<v Speaker 6>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Terrifying.</v>

3523
02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:43.873
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's the way she should be able to do </v>

3524
02:30:45.111 --> 02:30:45.944
<v Speaker 6>that around the fight and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 6>she's saying she turned down those two </v>

3525
02:30:48.261 --> 02:30:49.880
<v Speaker 6>title fights because I was given a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3526
02:30:49.881 --> 02:30:52.740
<v Speaker 6>who turns down title fights?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even though they made the division for,</v>

3527
02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:54.920
<v Speaker 6>she's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I destroyed my body.</v>

3528
02:30:55.450 --> 02:30:58.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm having depression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm having a horrible issues.</v>

3529
02:30:58.070 --> 02:31:00.620
<v Speaker 6>My Body's just not ready to fight like I</v>
<v Speaker 6>need to march.</v>

3530
02:31:01.370 --> 02:31:02.630
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you talk to people,</v>

3531
02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:03.613
<v Speaker 6>we talked to people that have caught </v>
<v Speaker 6>like ridiculous amounts of weight like </v>

3532
02:31:05.451 --> 02:31:06.284
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then all of a sudden the body just </v>

3533
02:31:06.831 --> 02:31:07.664
<v Speaker 6>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which just if something goes wrong and </v>

3534
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:11.570
<v Speaker 6>your body doesn't want to lose any </v>
<v Speaker 6>weight anymore,</v>

3535
02:31:11.571 --> 02:31:13.700
<v Speaker 6>your kidneys start aching.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get kidney stones.</v>

3536
02:31:13.850 --> 02:31:18.110
<v Speaker 6>It could be some serious side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cutting back highway two goats.</v>

3537
02:31:18.111 --> 02:31:19.320
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3538
02:31:19.380 --> 02:31:20.310
<v Speaker 6>it's so dangerous.</v>

3539
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:21.143
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're literally getting to the door of </v>

3540
02:31:22.831 --> 02:31:25.380
<v Speaker 4>death 24 hours before you enter into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage fight.</v>

3541
02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:29.550
<v Speaker 4>It's the craziest thing that we allow </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to do an MMA and it's essentially</v>

3542
02:31:29.551 --> 02:31:31.560
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of ways it's sanctioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheating,</v>

3543
02:31:32.190 --> 02:31:33.640
<v Speaker 4>true sanction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheating.</v>

3544
02:31:33.650 --> 02:31:34.483
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to get out of them classes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you've got to have a way to </v>

3545
02:31:36.091 --> 02:31:37.380
<v Speaker 4>enforce them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>

3546
02:31:37.381 --> 02:31:38.760
<v Speaker 4>what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your idea?</v>

3547
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I think there's gotta be a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys to fight people that are their size</v>

3548
02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:49.440
<v Speaker 4>without having the same rigid wait </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure where you have like one 55 and</v>

3549
02:31:49.441 --> 02:31:53.160
<v Speaker 4>one 70 and one 85 any solutions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3550
02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:54.113
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's gotta be a way to check </v>

3551
02:31:55.921 --> 02:31:56.754
<v Speaker 4>hydration levels and camp and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotta be a way you're going to have to </v>

3552
02:31:59.611 --> 02:32:02.490
<v Speaker 4>blow the whole thing up though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like champions won't be the champions in</v>

3553
02:32:02.491 --> 02:32:03.660
<v Speaker 4>the same way class anymore.</v>

3554
02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:07.110
<v Speaker 4>But if you've got Chris Weidman to fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>at his natural weight and another guy to</v>

3555
02:32:07.111 --> 02:32:09.000
<v Speaker 4>fight at his you and how you determine </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3556
02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:12.630
<v Speaker 4>you would have to find out what a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways when he's in shape and fit.</v>

3557
02:32:12.631 --> 02:32:15.250
<v Speaker 4>And you would have to do this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>transition over a period of time.</v>

3558
02:32:15.310 --> 02:32:16.500
<v Speaker 4>When that went along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes in,</v>

3559
02:32:16.530 --> 02:32:18.360
<v Speaker 4>that's when they're going to cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3560
02:32:18.390 --> 02:32:20.180
<v Speaker 4>you don't allow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't allow him to,</v>

3561
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:23.340
<v Speaker 4>there would also be like 20 belts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in good shape.</v>

3562
02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:26.070
<v Speaker 4>But you do the same thing that you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Usada.</v>

3563
02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:28.110
<v Speaker 4>You'd randomly test their hydration </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels.</v>

3564
02:32:28.111 --> 02:32:28.944
<v Speaker 4>You randomly test their weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if they're healthy and they're in </v>

3565
02:32:30.181 --> 02:32:31.014
<v Speaker 4>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way they're gonna keep that </v>

3566
02:32:31.411 --> 02:32:33.090
<v Speaker 4>weight off the entire camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible,</v>

3567
02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:36.540
<v Speaker 4>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as it's close.</v>

3568
02:32:36.541 --> 02:32:39.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like when cowboy cuts five pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's normal.</v>

3569
02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Like when you see cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't go,</v>

3570
02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:41.700
<v Speaker 4>you don't go.</v>

3571
02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:43.650
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This dude is one 70 you look at him,</v>

3572
02:32:43.651 --> 02:32:44.071
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3573
02:32:44.071 --> 02:32:46.260
<v Speaker 4>he looks like he's one seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his real weight.</v>

3574
02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:48.090
<v Speaker 4>When you look at Damien Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like,</v>

3575
02:32:48.091 --> 02:32:50.910
<v Speaker 4>there's no fucking way he's won 70 he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>200 pounds.</v>

3576
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.910
<v Speaker 4>When you look at like rick story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's giant that like there's,</v>

3577
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:56.910
<v Speaker 4>there's some guys that cut the weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then put it back on in a big way.</v>

3578
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.863
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Hendricks in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Hendricks says prime would be </v>

3579
02:33:00.301 --> 02:33:01.134
<v Speaker 4>Jack modified when he was Merkin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Fitch and Marvin Capelin and those </v>

3580
02:33:04.651 --> 02:33:07.890
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So random wayins random.</v>

3581
02:33:07.891 --> 02:33:10.290
<v Speaker 4>So for sure they're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting the exactly what?</v>

3582
02:33:10.291 --> 02:33:11.730
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't.</v>

3583
02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:17.000
<v Speaker 4>And then whatever you weigh in at they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they let you cut five pounds of you need</v>

3584
02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:18.680
<v Speaker 4>to or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something along those lines.</v>

3585
02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:20.580
<v Speaker 4>You give a person like a five pound </v>
<v Speaker 4>buffer.</v>

3586
02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:21.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super messy.</v>

3587
02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:23.130
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does get messy.</v>

3588
02:33:23.310 --> 02:33:24.800
<v Speaker 4>But you also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you,</v>

3589
02:33:24.801 --> 02:33:25.634
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you causing part of the problem with </v>

3590
02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Wayans by having these very specific </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight classes,</v>

3591
02:33:29.971 --> 02:33:30.804
<v Speaker 4>like one 55 one 70 so then the problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be determining who is a champion </v>

3592
02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:38.550
<v Speaker 4>and what do you call that champion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a Builtin area because you know</v>

3593
02:33:38.551 --> 02:33:39.384
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd say welterweight or middleweight </v>

3594
02:33:40.441 --> 02:33:41.274
<v Speaker 4>or light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you're not saying is the 155 pound </v>

3595
02:33:44.371 --> 02:33:45.810
<v Speaker 4>champ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The names are kind of silly.</v>

3596
02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:50.900
<v Speaker 4>Like why is welterweight one 70 and MMA </v>
<v Speaker 4>but one 47 and boxing heavyweight boxing</v>

3597
02:33:52.801 --> 02:33:53.634
<v Speaker 4>has been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do we have different names or </v>

3598
02:33:55.921 --> 02:33:58.080
<v Speaker 4>different weight classes for the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>sport?</v>

3599
02:33:58.380 --> 02:33:59.213
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still everybody knows what a </v>

3600
02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:02.010
<v Speaker 4>lightheaded off that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3601
02:34:02.011 --> 02:34:02.844
<v Speaker 4>it's still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point is instead have like </v>

3602
02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:10.950
<v Speaker 4>lightweight middleweight have all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>different names but have people actually</v>

3603
02:34:10.951 --> 02:34:15.540
<v Speaker 4>way that like for a guy who's won 70 </v>
<v Speaker 4>have an actual hundred 70 pound man,</v>

3604
02:34:15.790 --> 02:34:18.430
<v Speaker 4>that's some crazy dude who gets to two </v>
<v Speaker 4>15</v>

3605
02:34:18.430 --> 02:34:21.040
<v Speaker 2>like like rumble Johnson is just too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>

3606
02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:23.140
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would work,</v>

3607
02:34:23.141 --> 02:34:25.030
<v Speaker 2>but how hard would it be in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3608
02:34:25.031 --> 02:34:27.940
<v Speaker 2>the random testing and all that shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the five pounds,</v>

3609
02:34:27.941 --> 02:34:29.020
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six pounds.</v>

3610
02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:34.530
<v Speaker 2>What you could do is that the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 48 hours before the weigh in,</v>

3611
02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:37.210
<v Speaker 2>you're under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

3612
02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:39.790
<v Speaker 2>you have to have like you're in a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3613
02:34:40.390 --> 02:34:42.640
<v Speaker 2>You can't do any extreme weight cutting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3614
02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Weird back check in on Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't again,</v>

3615
02:34:46.901 --> 02:34:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Burt's gone to the commission on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what the fuck to do now,</v>

3616
02:34:49.001 --> 02:34:53.440
<v Speaker 2>but they used to do as soon as you land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't check anything.</v>

3617
02:34:53.441 --> 02:34:57.730
<v Speaker 2>You go to the room and they weigh you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're like 40 pounds,</v>

3618
02:34:57.731 --> 02:35:00.370
<v Speaker 2>40 pounds over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know they're on your man.</v>

3619
02:35:00.970 --> 02:35:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

3620
02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it makes sense.</v>

3621
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.721
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3622
02:35:04.721 --> 02:35:08.230
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to do enough to where you all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and when they're all,</v>

3623
02:35:08.510 --> 02:35:09.343
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all over it and you're weighing </v>

3624
02:35:09.731 --> 02:35:13.240
<v Speaker 2>in every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're red flag,</v>

3625
02:35:13.241 --> 02:35:15.340
<v Speaker 2>then they'll tell Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3626
02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:18.180
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good example guys.</v>

3627
02:35:18.610 --> 02:35:19.443
<v Speaker 2>But they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't because the guy still miss </v>

3628
02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:21.844
<v Speaker 2>cause like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Kelvin's 30 pounds over weight and </v>

3629
02:35:24.251 --> 02:35:24.791
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3630
02:35:24.791 --> 02:35:26.710
<v Speaker 2>well he's made it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3631
02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:27.553
<v Speaker 2>You can't still can't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you got to have is someone who </v>

3632
02:35:30.310 --> 02:35:31.143
<v Speaker 2>doesn't allow anybody to fight 30 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>over what they actually weigh in that </v>

3633
02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:35.633
<v Speaker 2>it's not legal like Weidman cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say 37 pounds and three day </v>

3634

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3635
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:41.703

<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be an official way in a </v>

3636
02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:47.400
<v Speaker 2>few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3637
02:35:47.410 --> 02:35:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Like they all got to throw your shit out</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

3638
02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:50.753
<v Speaker 2>They do that in Abu Dhabi because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>two day tournament and you got to wait </v>

3639
02:35:53.281 --> 02:35:54.114
<v Speaker 2>if you make it to the Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you went a couple of matches and you </v>

3640
02:35:57.041 --> 02:35:59.980
<v Speaker 2>get it to the semifinals and finals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to weigh in again.</v>

3641

<v Speaker 2>Who did send fight when he cut all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way it was it Damien Maia?</v>

3646
02:36:11.561 --> 02:36:13.480
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3647
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:15.340
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't [inaudible] it was in Abu </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dhabi.</v>

3648
02:36:15.341 --> 02:36:16.174
<v Speaker 2>I remember I thought he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was Damien Maia Boyz days and that </v>

3649
02:36:21.211 --> 02:36:25.360
<v Speaker 2>was on Fox wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it uh,</v>

3650
02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:26.453
<v Speaker 2>two immunos on that card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was that Abu Dhabi when Bj Penn </v>

3651
02:36:29.951 --> 02:36:30.784
<v Speaker 2>fought Frankie Edgar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must've been cause the other Aboud </v>

3652
02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Dobby card was when Anderson fought </v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia.</v>

3653
02:36:35.350 --> 02:36:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two that I went to.</v>

3654
02:36:37.510 --> 02:36:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think if the Fox card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3655
02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:40.990
<v Speaker 2>you might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

3656
02:36:41.050 --> 02:36:43.630
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the new rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a big John McCarthy?</v>

3657
02:36:43.631 --> 02:36:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3658
02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:45.763
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3659
02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:47.590
<v Speaker 2>You replay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch it.</v>

3660
02:36:47.650 --> 02:36:48.483
<v Speaker 2>He didn't watch your MMA encyclopedia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you not watch the new unified </v>

3661
02:36:53.321 --> 02:36:55.840
<v Speaker 2>rules?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Big John McCarthy posted,</v>

3662
02:36:55.841 --> 02:36:56.531
<v Speaker 2>you watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3663
02:36:56.531 --> 02:36:57.364
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Damien Maia basically bought a </v>

3664
02:36:58.871 --> 02:37:01.690
<v Speaker 2>stand up fight against Damien Maia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was on Fox.</v>

3665
02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:03.003
<v Speaker 2>It was the second card on Fox and he cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>short amount of weight in a law or a </v>

3666
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:07.783
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of weight in a short amount of 22 </v>

3667
02:37:09.221 --> 02:37:10.900
<v Speaker 2>pounds in 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

3668
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she too shy like you do.</v>

3669
02:37:13.430 --> 02:37:15.770
<v Speaker 2>You get to death's door and then he's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tough.</v>

3670
02:37:15.850 --> 02:37:16.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

3671
02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:17.713
<v Speaker 2>I still want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when fighters are against the </v>

3672
02:37:18.801 --> 02:37:21.170
<v Speaker 2>cage and they put their hand on the mat </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't get kneed in the face.</v>

3673
02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Can't do that no more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

3674
02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:24.850
<v Speaker 2>You gotta have all four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3675
02:37:24.890 --> 02:37:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you have have both hands?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3676
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.110
<v Speaker 2>they haven't had that starfish in 2017.</v>

3677
02:37:32.830 --> 02:37:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great rule.</v>

3678
02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little,</v>

3679
02:37:36.531 --> 02:37:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they,</v>

3680
02:37:37.401 --> 02:37:39.350
<v Speaker 2>did they talk about I or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

3681
02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:41.353
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did talk about a clavicle grabs </v>

3682
02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:46.700
<v Speaker 2>grabbing the collar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That used to be illegal.</v>

3683
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:47.833
<v Speaker 2>You could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember hearing the guy say that he </v>

3684
02:37:49.131 --> 02:37:49.671
<v Speaker 2>could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>just so many in the collarbone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do try that.</v>

3686
02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please try to like,</v>

3687
02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I just kicked him in the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The column on those,</v>

3688
02:37:56.841 --> 02:37:59.780
<v Speaker 2>the dumbest like you really think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>that easy.</v>

3689
02:38:00.010 --> 02:38:00.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just going to get someone on their </v>

3690
02:38:01.671 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 2>collar bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think collapses,</v>

3691
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:05.443
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3692
02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:06.453
<v Speaker 2>Dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they could just kick you in </v>

3693
02:38:08.691 --> 02:38:10.460
<v Speaker 2>the knee and then they're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mobile icu.</v>

3694
02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:13.790
<v Speaker 2>To your way point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who could really benefit from that</v>

3695
02:38:13.791 --> 02:38:15.800
<v Speaker 2>as Chris Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he met light heavyweight.</v>

3696
02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:17.450
<v Speaker 2>He should be a light heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like.</v>

3697
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:18.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3698
02:38:18.231 --> 02:38:19.064
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones should be a heavyweight then </v>

3699
02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:20.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jones fought Dan Henderson that </v>

3700
02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:24.340
<v Speaker 2>grappling match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 238 pounds.</v>

3701
02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean he murked cheeses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so wheezes.</v>

3702
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:28.560
<v Speaker 2>What a beautiful takedown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's takedown.</v>

3703
02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3704
02:38:29.691 --> 02:38:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shot in and Gary,</v>

3705
02:38:31.870 --> 02:38:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Tony and hit that very same takedown but</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsuccessfully on his opponent.</v>

3706
02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:36.133
<v Speaker 2>Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3707
02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:37.093
<v Speaker 2>And grappling match right after that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is going to go to light </v>

3708
02:38:40.221 --> 02:38:41.054
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John is so big for light heavyweight </v>

3709
02:38:42.621 --> 02:38:44.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking physically talented too.</v>

3710
02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:45.451
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

3711
02:38:45.451 --> 02:38:50.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a fake single and then you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like duck under the clinch.</v>

3712
02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what that was?</v>

3713
02:38:51.681 --> 02:38:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And the way John did it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so glorious.</v>

3714
02:38:54.651 --> 02:38:58.640
<v Speaker 2>We watch how quickly he covered ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize like how fucking talented he</v>

3715
02:38:58.641 --> 02:38:59.474
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's up on the </v>

3716
02:39:00.621 --> 02:39:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Internet either.</v>

3717
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can watch it and go watch.</v>

3718
02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:04.933
<v Speaker 2>You could watch the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the take down and you can watch the </v>

3719
02:39:06.291 --> 02:39:07.124
<v Speaker 2>finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you watched the whole </v>

3720
02:39:07.521 --> 02:39:08.354
<v Speaker 2>fight and now are they going to do John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Verse jail now because John got on the </v>

3721
02:39:11.901 --> 02:39:12.411
<v Speaker 2>mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3722
02:39:12.411 --> 02:39:13.950

<v Speaker 2>I want to fight you chill.</v>

3723
02:39:13.951 --> 02:39:14.784
<v Speaker 2>And I think they are going to probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>do something like a tail will go in </v>

3724
02:39:17.481 --> 02:39:22.400
<v Speaker 2>there and get smooshed for the hx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John is just too big and too good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's so talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3726
02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:26.360
<v Speaker 2>He's winning Jujitsu tournaments like as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a goof.</v>

<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

3731
02:39:40.911 --> 02:39:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I fell in love with Jujitsu because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with it.</v>

3732
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:44.360

<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be standing in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people trade anymore.</v>

3735
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:47.870
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

3736
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:49.400
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be taking people down,</v>

3737
02:39:49.430 --> 02:39:50.800

<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>

3740
02:39:52.561 --> 02:39:55.520
<v Speaker 2>It was like just he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so talented as a grappler,</v>

3741
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on some other planet.</v>

3742
02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:00.950
<v Speaker 2>It was a nice pass to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took them down and then it was a nice</v>

3743
02:40:00.951 --> 02:40:01.784
<v Speaker 2>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That arm triangle was John Jones might </v>

3744
02:40:03.321 --> 02:40:05.190
<v Speaker 2>be pulling guard on people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an arm bar.</v>

3747
02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:13.800
<v Speaker 2>he might be pulling guard on people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an arm bar on him in the future.</v>

3748
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:16.950
<v Speaker 2>He's also a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who could do and even to a bay level,</v>

3749
02:40:16.951 --> 02:40:19.200

3750
02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:20.873
<v Speaker 2>And he could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get so much more notoriety than </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's about foot.</v>

3756
02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

3760
02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's really not going all out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was busy,</v>

3761
02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:46.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's effortless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3762
02:40:46.961 --> 02:40:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch how he does,</v>

3763
02:40:48.001 --> 02:40:49.680
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean Dan Henderson was going</v>

3764
02:40:49.681 --> 02:40:53.630
<v Speaker 2>light?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think Dan was nice match.</v>

3765
02:40:53.650 --> 02:40:56.940
<v Speaker 2>It was competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this here.</v>

3766
02:40:57.090 --> 02:41:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is a suspended UFC fighter.</v>

3767
02:41:00.211 --> 02:41:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>

3768
02:41:01.471 --> 02:41:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Fought Dan Henderson at underground </v>
<v Speaker 2>event and uh,</v>

3769
02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:05.393
<v Speaker 2>John started off on his knees and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>crawled forward and he see Dan like </v>

3770
02:41:09.151 --> 02:41:14.151
<v Speaker 2>putting his hand on his head and John </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] John is like,</v>

3771
02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:17.490
<v Speaker 2>he's like unstoppable.</v>

3772
02:41:17.490 --> 02:41:21.890
<v Speaker 2>The waste closing in on so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3773
02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:24.060
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is like the ways moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>in on them,</v>

3774
02:41:24.061 --> 02:41:27.870
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is going to be a mauling,</v>

3775
02:41:28.370 --> 02:41:29.203
<v Speaker 2>you know this is not going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did with jail sign and when he </v>

3776
02:41:31.261 --> 02:41:33.900
<v Speaker 2>grabbed shale and took them down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just slammed on the ground.</v>

3777
02:41:33.930 --> 02:41:34.763
<v Speaker 2>So their size and compete with John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at the guys that have given </v>

3778
02:41:37.141 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 2>him issues like Gustafson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says same size.</v>

3779
02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Those are the only time he really has </v>
<v Speaker 2>issued.</v>

3780
02:41:41.871 --> 02:41:42.704
<v Speaker 2>He toward gave him some issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] hard bar I think got dealt </v>

3781
02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:46.950
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He submitted veto us.</v>

3782
02:41:46.951 --> 02:41:47.940
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes he did.</v>

3783
02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:49.380
<v Speaker 2>But when Vito caught him in that arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>

3784
02:41:49.381 --> 02:41:50.214
<v Speaker 2>that was like really the first time we'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen him ever in trouble inside the ox </v>

3785
02:41:52.851 --> 02:41:53.940
<v Speaker 2>human they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3786
02:41:54.190 --> 02:41:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is mostly John just pushing them up</v>

3787
02:41:58.291 --> 02:41:59.460
<v Speaker 2>against the cage and they let him go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3788
02:41:59.461 --> 02:42:01.460
<v Speaker 2>he threw a jab at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that about?</v>

3789
02:42:04.750 --> 02:42:05.583
<v Speaker 2>We didn't really throw a jab like he </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretended he was going to do a spinning </v>

3790
02:42:07.481 --> 02:42:08.560
<v Speaker 2>elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3791
02:42:08.561 --> 02:42:09.394
<v Speaker 2>he's just clowning around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think rockhold wants to do it to Jon </v>

3792
02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Jones was rockhold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3793
02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Rockhold did say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see the tape.</v>

3794
02:42:14.980 --> 02:42:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Well how long did the match go?</v>

3795
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.983
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it did take down was the ridiculous </v>

3796
02:42:21.271 --> 02:42:22.104
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if you could find that in </v>

3797
02:42:22.681 --> 02:42:25.320
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See now this is worth it,</v>

3798
02:42:25.321 --> 02:42:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to make money</v>

3799
02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:30.250
<v Speaker 2>cause you're not no head trauma if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose it's whatever.</v>

3800
02:42:30.430 --> 02:42:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3801
02:42:31.331 --> 02:42:34.030
<v Speaker 2>This is a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wished that this pay,</v>

3802
02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:36.460
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo Boom,</v>

3803
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:37.623
<v Speaker 2>gets him down and riding side control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wished that this was a viable </v>

3804
02:42:41.861 --> 02:42:45.070
<v Speaker 2>option in terms of like financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

3805
02:42:45.071 --> 02:42:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I really wished that there was a a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3806
02:42:47.921 --> 02:42:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I think your event has the best chance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing it.</v>

3807
02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:52.110
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if your event,</v>

3808
02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:52.953
<v Speaker 2>when people watch it and get behind it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a real possibility because it's </v>

3809
02:42:56.351 --> 02:42:59.350
<v Speaker 2>fucking exciting as shit and people will</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay money to see it.</v>

3810
02:42:59.410 --> 02:43:00.243
<v Speaker 2>Especially when line at Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caliber of these guys are doing and </v>

3811
02:43:02.051 --> 02:43:05.230
<v Speaker 2>flying to Vegas tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting with a UFC fight pass.</v>

3812
02:43:05.231 --> 02:43:07.090
<v Speaker 2>They want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got great numbers.</v>

3813
02:43:07.091 --> 02:43:07.924
<v Speaker 2>Ebi 10 they said the numbers were </v>
<v Speaker 2>staggering and they want us to get </v>

3814
02:43:10.601 --> 02:43:12.120
<v Speaker 2>behind and go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the</v>

3815
02:43:12.130 --> 02:43:14.530
<v Speaker 3>best thing about Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3816
02:43:14.531 --> 02:43:17.530
<v Speaker 3>This is totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could be the Don King of chokes.</v>

3817
02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me get this top fucking jokes.</v>

3818
02:43:20.861 --> 02:43:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just you and Eddie.</v>

3819
02:43:22.901 --> 02:43:23.734
<v Speaker 3>You were saying that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes we'll stay in the mountain </v>

3820
02:43:26.030 --> 02:43:28.200
<v Speaker 3>that you don't three quarter mount </v>
<v Speaker 3>butter amount.</v>

3821
02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:30.280
<v Speaker 3>You stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever say in full amount?</v>

3822
02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Full amount to only because the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>leg lockers,</v>

3823
02:43:34.961 --> 02:43:35.920
<v Speaker 3>deadly leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg,</v>

3824
02:43:35.950 --> 02:43:39.250
<v Speaker 3>leg lockers that hit a leg lock </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition when they're mounted,</v>

3825
02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:42.520
<v Speaker 3>so if you let them get their hips up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always stay in three core.</v>

3826
02:43:42.521 --> 02:43:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only time I'm doing a full amount is</v>

3827
02:43:44.801 --> 02:43:45.634
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in sky dive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I got my hips down and my ankles </v>

3828
02:43:47.741 --> 02:43:49.810
<v Speaker 3>crossed and then I'm hunting for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>under hook,</v>

3829
02:43:50.050 --> 02:43:50.883
<v Speaker 3>but I'll never just sit there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular amount because everybody now </v>

3830
02:43:53.741 --> 02:43:54.574
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has got that mount escape to leg locks </v>

3831
02:43:56.201 --> 02:43:56.840
<v Speaker 3>that you got.</v>

3832
02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:58.610
<v Speaker 3>It could just turn everything around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be over.</v>

3833
02:43:58.810 --> 02:44:00.230
<v Speaker 3>So Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hips and get soaked.</v>

3834
02:44:00.310 --> 02:44:01.143
<v Speaker 3>Also those ridiculously flexible guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>that get those legs and play like </v>

3835
02:44:03.731 --> 02:44:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Eddie's dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dexterity.</v>

3836
02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:10.100
<v Speaker 3>It's always been my main escape too is </v>
<v Speaker 3>using my flexibility when someone mounts</v>

3837
02:44:10.101 --> 02:44:10.630
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3838
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:15.190
<v Speaker 3>And that takes me into leg locks and at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that used to be the only he'll hook.</v>

3839
02:44:15.191 --> 02:44:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I had in my game was off being mounted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I would use a hail Mary escape,</v>

3840
02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:22.810
<v Speaker 3>see cups in the armpits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cross my feet in front of her stomach,</v>

3841
02:44:22.990 --> 02:44:26.290
<v Speaker 3>over hook a leg and then take them right</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just good old fashion outside.</v>

3842
02:44:26.291 --> 02:44:27.940
<v Speaker 3>He'll hook that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3843
02:44:28.270 --> 02:44:30.900
<v Speaker 3>that was my number one escape and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just too dangerous now,</v>

3844
02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:31.743
<v Speaker 3>not now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys have taken that escape and added a </v>

3845
02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:39.010
<v Speaker 3>thousand more leg lock transitions off </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and at that I actually had a guy come</v>

3846
02:44:39.011 --> 02:44:39.844
<v Speaker 3>to my gym maybe four or five years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a purple belt from Hen Zos and he </v>

3847
02:44:44.381 --> 02:44:48.010
<v Speaker 3>was super flex by walk onto the Mat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he sitting there walking to class,</v>

3848
02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:50.080
<v Speaker 3>he's got both legs behind his head.</v>

3849
02:44:50.170 --> 02:44:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who this guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

3850
02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:52.841
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3851
02:44:52.841 --> 02:44:53.674
<v Speaker 3>I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like,</v>

3852
02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:55.300
<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just like looking at me.</v>

3853
02:44:55.301 --> 02:44:56.860
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to show me how flexible,</v>

3854
02:44:56.861 --> 02:44:58.850
<v Speaker 3>it was way more flexible than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more.</v>

3855
02:44:59.690 --> 02:45:00.523
<v Speaker 3>I can't cross my feet behind my head and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we rolled and I mounted him quite </v>

3856
02:45:04.421 --> 02:45:05.860
<v Speaker 3>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know it was a trick.</v>

3857
02:45:05.980 --> 02:45:09.010
<v Speaker 3>He let me mount them and then its </v>
<v Speaker 3>flexibility and I was low,</v>

3858
02:45:09.011 --> 02:45:09.844
<v Speaker 3>I was super low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would grab his feet and just put </v>

3859
02:45:12.491 --> 02:45:15.610
<v Speaker 3>it in the little crack and inch by inch </v>
<v Speaker 3>you with a stick his foot in B,</v>

3860
02:45:15.611 --> 02:45:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm laying flat on him and then he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>get through,</v>

3861
02:45:17.861 --> 02:45:19.840
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right into a leg lock and he tapped me.</v>

3862
02:45:19.841 --> 02:45:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3863
02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:23.020
<v Speaker 3>So we went again and I mounted him </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

3864
02:45:23.021 --> 02:45:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shared amount of them.</v>

3865
02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:26.253
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some guys like you just don't </v>

3866
02:45:26.651 --> 02:45:28.240
<v Speaker 3>fucking mouth these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take him to the truck.</v>

3867
02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:29.373
<v Speaker 3>So I mounted him and I was super tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just clinching time and he just grabbed </v>

3868
02:45:33.971 --> 02:45:36.640
<v Speaker 3>his foot and just put it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just would hold it right in the,</v>

3869
02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:40.600
<v Speaker 3>in between our rib cages and he couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in initially,</v>

3870
02:45:40.601 --> 02:45:43.570
<v Speaker 3>but inch pan she would just get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would just pull this flynn,</v>

3871
02:45:43.870 --> 02:45:46.720
<v Speaker 3>it was like he was jail breaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3872
02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:47.793
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3873
02:45:47.900 --> 02:45:49.600
<v Speaker 3>to that mount escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3874
02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:50.733
<v Speaker 3>That's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got tapped me again and I thought </v>

3875
02:45:52.151 --> 02:45:53.440
<v Speaker 3>from that point on I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

3876
02:45:53.860 --> 02:45:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I can ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3877
02:45:55.690 --> 02:45:56.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

3878
02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:57.933
<v Speaker 3>I always got to make sure that I roll </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people and assume everyone can do </v>

3879
02:46:04.811 --> 02:46:07.150
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't and have that kind of ridiculous</v>

3880
02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:08.760
<v Speaker 3>flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dexterity.</v>

3881
02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 3>You gotta assume everyone's that</v>

3882
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:11.540
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at that point,</v>

3883
02:46:11.541 --> 02:46:13.880
<v Speaker 2>it altered my mouth a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with the arm triangles,</v>

3884
02:46:13.881 --> 02:46:14.714
<v Speaker 2>I just stay in the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just assume you have to assume </v>

3885
02:46:16.401 --> 02:46:19.040
<v Speaker 2>that everybody's at the death level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That why not?</v>

3886
02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Because if it works on them that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works on everybody.</v>

3887
02:46:21.130 --> 02:46:21.963
<v Speaker 2>To me up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was crazy when Eddie and I were </v>

3888
02:46:23.871 --> 02:46:24.704
<v Speaker 2>doing that on an invitational thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were telling us that there's like </v>

3889
02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:31.510
<v Speaker 2>14 year olds mto tour homeschooled just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be dedicated to Jujitsu.</v>

3890
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:34.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those nine year old real,</v>

3891
02:46:34.401 --> 02:46:35.990
<v Speaker 2>those nine year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3892
02:46:35.991 --> 02:46:37.490
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3893
02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Two nine year olds doing ankle locks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking all your shit.</v>

3894
02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:45.410
<v Speaker 2>You know what we were talking before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast started,</v>

3895
02:46:45.411 --> 02:46:48.570
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about physical freaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that big gorilla Shane car.</v>

3896
02:46:48.571 --> 02:46:50.060
<v Speaker 2>When and how when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3897
02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I watched Jane Carlin role with people.</v>

3898
02:46:51.770 --> 02:46:53.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the point of this?</v>

3899
02:46:53.391 --> 02:46:56.450
<v Speaker 2>This is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shankar Shankar.</v>

3900
02:46:56.451 --> 02:46:57.284
<v Speaker 2>We walked into a mall Easton's Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym and I didn't know who he was for a </v>

3901
02:47:00.501 --> 02:47:01.490
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously,</v>

3902
02:47:01.491 --> 02:47:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I knew who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd commentated his fights,</v>

3903
02:47:03.051 --> 02:47:03.884
<v Speaker 2>but for a second I looked up from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mat and I saw him walk in and my tests </v>

3904
02:47:06.651 --> 02:47:07.484
<v Speaker 2>on a person that's a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's some shaved shuttle out from the </v>

3905
02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:10.880
<v Speaker 2>ECZEMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3906
02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:11.713
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even look like a real human </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would roll with people and it </v>

3907
02:47:13.491 --> 02:47:16.250
<v Speaker 2>would be preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste of your time.</v>

3908
02:47:16.251 --> 02:47:17.084
<v Speaker 2>I remember I trained because Jane would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had another job and he'd have an </v>

3909
02:47:19.071 --> 02:47:21.290
<v Speaker 2>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd gone for like four months,</v>

3910
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:23.560
<v Speaker 2>not train Jujitsu twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3911
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:24.403
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait cause he's like a big </v>

3912
02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:27.620
<v Speaker 2>brother and I can't wait till I get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know more role this full up.</v>

3913
02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:32.090
<v Speaker 2>He would come in off his nine to five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set his lunchbox down,</v>

3914
02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:36.140
<v Speaker 2>put on his fucking weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basketball shorts,</v>

3915
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:37.220
<v Speaker 2>baggy tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3916
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:38.481
<v Speaker 2>you've been rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3917

<v Speaker 2>why don't you do more Jitsu?</v>

3920
02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Like why I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking gorilla.</v>

3921
02:47:48.201 --> 02:47:49.034
<v Speaker 2>Strongest as strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wouldn't you love to see a guy like </v>

3922
02:47:51.021 --> 02:47:53.540
<v Speaker 2>him fall in love with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when the Monday owls,</v>

3923
02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:57.200
<v Speaker 2>like how crazy would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy would it be to watch Shane car</v>

3924
02:47:57.201 --> 02:47:58.034
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Abu Dhabi with his wrestling </v>

3925
02:47:59.391 --> 02:48:00.570
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he won,</v>

3926
02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:03.890
<v Speaker 2>if he dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicated himself to submissions,</v>

3927
02:48:03.891 --> 02:48:07.190
<v Speaker 2>like just pure submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what a freak athlete is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Months and choke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3929
02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:11.210
<v Speaker 2>cause he's bigger than months and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would pop your head off.</v>

3930
02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:12.800
<v Speaker 2>It took out it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the problem is though,</v>

3937
02:48:27.561 --> 02:48:28.394
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta feel way better to knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone out to drop someone than to tap </v>

<v Speaker 2>I just don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need to say.</v>

4052
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:09.820
<v Speaker 3>to do other stuff as well.</v>

4070
02:53:48.161 --> 02:53:48.994
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC did,</v>

4071

<v Speaker 3>eventually we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see the return of grace </v>

4077
02:53:58.240 --> 02:54:00.400
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually can imagine,</v>

4078
02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:02.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four years later and when she's</v>

4079
02:54:02.891 --> 02:54:05.680
<v Speaker 3>18 and we bring her back and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be crazy.</v>

4080
02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:07.830
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like the guns and roses</v>

4083
02:54:12.731 --> 02:54:13.564
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the safer alternative for the </v>

4084
02:54:15.251 --> 02:54:16.600
<v Speaker 3>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially athletes.</v>

4085
02:54:16.601 --> 02:54:19.300
<v Speaker 3>They really just want to develop the Jiu</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jitsu skills.</v>

4086
02:54:19.301 --> 02:54:21.700
<v Speaker 3>You can get immersed in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to have to,</v>

4087
02:54:21.790 --> 02:54:25.270
<v Speaker 3>in order to be a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to compete as an MMA fighter.</v>

4088
02:54:25.290 --> 02:54:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4089
02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:28.120
<v Speaker 3>competition is so high at Uga in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

4090
02:54:28.130 --> 02:54:29.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4091
02:54:29.110 --> 02:54:31.960
<v Speaker 3>And so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every Jujitsu event has failed.</v>

4092
02:54:32.110 --> 02:54:33.430
<v Speaker 3>They've all failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>

4093
02:54:33.690 --> 02:54:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4095
02:54:35.831 --> 02:54:36.664
<v Speaker 3>There's no big giant pile of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's making money except for the </v>

4096
02:54:38.981 --> 02:54:39.840
<v Speaker 3>winters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4097
02:54:39.850 --> 02:54:41.980
<v Speaker 3>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a passion project.</v>

4098
02:54:41.981 --> 02:54:44.380
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who knows,</v>

4099
02:54:44.381 --> 02:54:45.214
<v Speaker 3>maybe we don't survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apparently we got really good </v>

<v Speaker 3>Cummings go out at that.</v>

4103
02:54:56.021 --> 02:54:59.980
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most epic Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>matches of all time.</v>

4104
02:54:59.981 --> 02:55:01.990

<v Speaker 6>and I don't,</v>

4110
02:55:07.981 --> 02:55:08.960
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just never know.</v>

4111
02:55:08.961 --> 02:55:10.730
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no events have made it so far.</v>

4112
02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:11.481
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the main,</v>

4113
02:55:11.481 --> 02:55:13.340
<v Speaker 6>any markers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The rule sucked ass.</v>

4114
02:55:13.490 --> 02:55:15.830
<v Speaker 6>Go back to the card.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>

4115
02:55:15.831 --> 02:55:18.500
<v Speaker 6>See if [inaudible] is there any fights </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we missed on this UFC card?</v>

4116
02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:21.110
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how there's all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>ready.</v>

4117
02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:22.600
<v Speaker 6>Don't worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4118
02:55:22.601 --> 02:55:22.791
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

4119
02:55:22.791 --> 02:55:23.624
<v Speaker 6>You've got the perfect rule set.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's go back to this just to see if </v>

4120
02:55:26.301 --> 02:55:28.340
<v Speaker 6>there's anything else that Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4121
02:55:28.341 --> 02:55:29.300
<v Speaker 6>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

4122
02:55:29.301 --> 02:55:31.040
<v Speaker 6>That's what I wanted to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

4123
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:33.590
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to wonder where Johnny Hendricks</v>

4124
02:55:33.591 --> 02:55:34.424
<v Speaker 6>head is at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you heard the way he trained for </v>

4125
02:55:35.781 --> 02:55:37.250
<v Speaker 6>his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4126
02:55:37.251 --> 02:55:38.084
<v Speaker 6>he was saying that he was the only </v>
<v Speaker 6>training like a few days a week and it </v>

4127
02:55:40.551 --> 02:55:42.080
<v Speaker 6>wasn't really that steak house.</v>

4128
02:55:42.290 --> 02:55:45.770
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't really trained in every day </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that his wife really got them geared</v>

4129
02:55:45.771 --> 02:55:48.290
<v Speaker 6>up to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to train for this fight.</v>

4130
02:55:48.650 --> 02:55:50.780
<v Speaker 6>But the problem with that is like Neil </v>
<v Speaker 6>Magnese's,</v>

4131
02:55:50.781 --> 02:55:52.640
<v Speaker 6>I don't fucking roll man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4132
02:55:52.641 --> 02:55:57.380
<v Speaker 6>he's had some tough fights and some good</v>
<v Speaker 6>fights and he beat hector mother fucking</v>

4133
02:55:57.381 --> 02:55:59.340
<v Speaker 6>Lombard by stoppage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4134
02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:01.820
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'd be any beat Kelvin.</v>

4135
02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:02.853
<v Speaker 6>And he beat Lombard when Lombard was </v>
<v Speaker 6>putting it to them in the first round </v>

4136
02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:07.730
<v Speaker 6>was really close fights where it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4137
02:56:07.731 --> 02:56:08.960
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this might get stopped.</v>

4138
02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:14.000
<v Speaker 6>And Damien Maia eight his ass for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like coby has issued the way Damien Maia</v>

4139
02:56:14.001 --> 02:56:15.620
<v Speaker 6>put that smushed down on him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4140
02:56:15.621 --> 02:56:20.560
<v Speaker 6>whilst a bad matchup stud,</v>
<v Speaker 6>next level Jujitsu batch,</v>

4141
02:56:20.710 --> 02:56:22.010
<v Speaker 6>Damien Monster,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this thing.</v>

4142
02:56:22.250 --> 02:56:24.140
<v Speaker 6>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

4143
02:56:24.141 --> 02:56:26.810
<v Speaker 6>you got to get a hold of Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Second of all,</v>

4144
02:56:26.811 --> 02:56:28.370
<v Speaker 6>you've got to get him to the ground.</v>

4145
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:30.340
<v Speaker 6>Good luck with both of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4146
02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:31.393
<v Speaker 6>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Both of those fucking hammered into </v>

4147
02:56:33.861 --> 02:56:35.300
<v Speaker 6>another dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a fun,</v>

4148
02:56:35.301 --> 02:56:36.134
<v Speaker 6>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fun to Whitley and Woodley's showed him </v>

4149
02:56:37.101 --> 02:56:37.934
<v Speaker 6>that wonderboy fight that he can hammer </v>
<v Speaker 6>you went to a dimension in the fourth </v>

4150
02:56:39.741 --> 02:56:40.490
<v Speaker 6>round,</v>
<v Speaker 6>correct.</v>

4151
02:56:40.490 --> 02:56:43.130
<v Speaker 6>He could still like deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking championship rounds,</v>

4152
02:56:43.131 --> 02:56:46.580
<v Speaker 6>can still hammering you out of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking zone flag for money.</v>

4153
02:56:46.850 --> 02:56:51.830
<v Speaker 6>We'll tell you what Jujitsu might make </v>
<v Speaker 6>Woodley a little cautious.</v>

4154
02:56:51.850 --> 02:56:55.730
<v Speaker 6>100 [inaudible] probably not gonna throw</v>
<v Speaker 6>any leg kicks or anything,</v>

4155
02:56:55.900 --> 02:56:58.370
<v Speaker 6>but try to knock his ass out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we don't.</v>

4156
02:56:58.371 --> 02:56:59.204
<v Speaker 6>You think that Woodley's wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 6>his physical size and strength and he's </v>

4157
02:57:01.970 --> 02:57:02.803
<v Speaker 6>taking Breslin bubbly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>strong [inaudible] no taken down </v>

4158
02:57:05.511 --> 02:57:06.344
<v Speaker 6>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The rest of the juicy when Damien Maia </v>

4159
02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:13.160
<v Speaker 6>took down chill Sonin people forget that</v>
<v Speaker 6>it the man with the inverted triangle,</v>

4160
02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:17.660
<v Speaker 6>the mount that lateral dropped double </v>
<v Speaker 6>over Hook laterals dropped him.</v>

4161
02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:19.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4162
02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:22.020
<v Speaker 6>It's vintage Damien mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4163
02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:25.470
<v Speaker 6>He got ahold of them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those is frank Mir versus car went.</v>

4164
02:57:25.490 --> 02:57:28.310
<v Speaker 6>This is horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

4165
02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:29.150
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

4166
02:57:29.150 --> 02:57:30.290
<v Speaker 6>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That game.</v>

4167
02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:32.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's probably only on fight pass.</v>

4168
02:57:32.151 --> 02:57:35.930
<v Speaker 6>If you go to UFC fight pass and we have </v>
<v Speaker 6>a account or is it just my account?</v>

4169
02:57:36.980 --> 02:57:38.790
<v Speaker 6>Is it on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4170
02:57:38.810 --> 02:57:40.160
<v Speaker 6>we don't have to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

4171
02:57:40.161 --> 02:57:40.994
<v Speaker 6>it was a Merch gigging marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What we were talking about the </v>

4172
02:57:43.401 --> 02:57:45.440
<v Speaker 6>difference between a guy who's like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>super tactical,</v>

4173
02:57:45.441 --> 02:57:46.274
<v Speaker 6>really high level guy and then there's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>point of diminishing returns where it </v>

4174
02:57:48.561 --> 02:57:51.350
<v Speaker 6>doesn't work on somebody and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>point of shame.</v>

4175
02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:53.870
<v Speaker 6>Carwyn like you should like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like almost like,</v>

4176
02:57:53.871 --> 02:57:54.704
<v Speaker 6>there's like a physical limit of almost </v>
<v Speaker 6>all technique that you hit a wall when </v>

4177
02:57:59.031 --> 02:58:01.680
<v Speaker 6>someone gets just so stupid strong that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can,</v>

4178
02:58:01.770 --> 02:58:02.010
<v Speaker 6>as long</v>

4179
02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:04.320
<v Speaker 2>as he's skilled and he is skilled on top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

4180
02:58:04.350 --> 02:58:05.183
<v Speaker 2>he's aware of what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a Rashad Evans blackbelt like </v>

4181
02:58:07.351 --> 02:58:08.184
<v Speaker 2>Rashad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to submit you off his </v>

4182
02:58:09.181 --> 02:58:10.014
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his knowledge and his defense is </v>

4183
02:58:11.101 --> 02:58:13.260
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just different,</v>

4184
02:58:13.261 --> 02:58:14.094
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he doesn't have what's going on </v>

4185
02:58:14.551 --> 02:58:16.140
<v Speaker 2>with Rashad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened after that?</v>

4186
02:58:16.141 --> 02:58:16.974
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pulled them out of the Tim Kennedy </v>

4187
02:58:18.601 --> 02:58:19.434
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pulled him out and then he was </v>

4188
02:58:19.951 --> 02:58:21.460
<v Speaker 2>supposed to fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4189
02:58:21.470 --> 02:58:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Pull them out again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4190
02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:23.753
<v Speaker 2>He tried to fight Kennedy again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this time in Toronto and Toronto </v>

4191
02:58:25.501 --> 02:58:26.910
<v Speaker 2>pulled them out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

4192
02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:30.640
<v Speaker 2>So New York City pulled them out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then Toronto pulled them out and uh,</v>

4193
02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:33.810
<v Speaker 2>he says it's a preexisting condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he's something he's always had,</v>

4194
02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:35.520
<v Speaker 2>but who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4195
02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that Kevin?</v>

4196
02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Gasol them fight Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4197
02:58:40.300 --> 02:58:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4198
02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:42.391
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4199
02:58:42.391 --> 02:58:44.160
<v Speaker 2>But against a Tim Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all.</v>

4200
02:58:44.190 --> 02:58:45.023
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another example of a guy who </v>

4201
02:58:46.411 --> 02:58:48.420
<v Speaker 2>wasn't cutting any weight and look </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking amazing.</v>

4202
02:58:48.450 --> 02:58:50.520
<v Speaker 2>But then he wants to go back and talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your boy.</v>

4203
02:58:50.521 --> 02:58:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Why is you want to go back down to 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>because those guys have to cut weight.</v>

4204
02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:54.833
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are cutting weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting down to one 85 and they're </v>

4205
02:58:56.881 --> 02:58:57.714
<v Speaker 2>gigantic guys like Hector Lombard and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to have to fight one of </v>

4206
02:59:00.031 --> 02:59:00.751
<v Speaker 2>those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4207
02:59:00.751 --> 02:59:03.480
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta make weight a seventies I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what you're saying.</v>

4208
02:59:03.510 --> 02:59:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a middle ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4209
02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I think seven days to harvest made one </v>
<v Speaker 2>70 many times.</v>

4210
02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's missed it the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this last time he says he was on the</v>

4211
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:18.210
<v Speaker 2>new dieticians a regimen and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work out.</v>

4212
02:59:18.240 --> 02:59:19.073
<v Speaker 2>Didn't work out.</v>

4213
02:59:19.550 --> 02:59:21.870
<v Speaker 2>You have dolce originally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

4214

02:59:27.090 --> 02:59:30.120
<v Speaker 2>He's just gotta be personally more </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplined if he's just personally more</v>

4257
03:00:57.031 --> 03:00:57.864
<v Speaker 2>mauling him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Tim got ahold of him early in that </v>

4258
03:00:59.111 --> 03:01:00.010
<v Speaker 2>first round and really</v>

4259
03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:03.160
<v Speaker 6>put out a lot of effort that seatbelt </v>
<v Speaker 6>got his back.</v>

4260
03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:06.400
<v Speaker 6>Really was mauling him with size and </v>
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>

4261
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:09.610
<v Speaker 6>But Tim gas himself out doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tim Look terrible in that flight.</v>

4262
03:01:09.650 --> 03:01:11.340
<v Speaker 6>Did I love Tim more than anyone in this </v>
<v Speaker 6>world?</v>

4263
03:01:11.350 --> 03:01:12.310
<v Speaker 6>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what about me?</v>

4264
03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:14.200
<v Speaker 6>You love him more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a tossup.</v>

4265
03:01:14.230 --> 03:01:16.610
<v Speaker 6>He'd be fighting for my freedom from my </v>
<v Speaker 6>fridge.</v>

4266
03:01:16.611 --> 03:01:19.150
<v Speaker 6>I'm still interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

4267
03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:22.870
<v Speaker 6>tim looked rough in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a terrible performance for him,</v>

4268
03:01:22.871 --> 03:01:25.960
<v Speaker 6>but him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody fucking handled themselves better</v>

4269
03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:27.880
<v Speaker 6>after loss.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then that guy,</v>

4270
03:01:27.940 --> 03:01:29.590
<v Speaker 6>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking owns up to it.</v>

4271
03:01:29.591 --> 03:01:31.150
<v Speaker 6>The guy kicked my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a better fighter than me.</v>

4272
03:01:31.151 --> 03:01:31.984
<v Speaker 6>It was very embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Picture him going to the hospital at </v>

4273
03:01:33.571 --> 03:01:35.050
<v Speaker 6>well that sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4274
03:01:35.630 --> 03:01:36.463
<v Speaker 6>Eyes face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally jacked tip Kennedy took a </v>

4275
03:01:38.291 --> 03:01:39.790
<v Speaker 6>picture of herself jacked in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hospital.</v>

4276
03:01:40.270 --> 03:01:44.350
<v Speaker 6>I think I s uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>outlook on on losses,</v>

4277
03:01:44.590 --> 03:01:46.150
<v Speaker 6>losses or ou.</v>

4278
03:01:46.150 --> 03:01:48.400
<v Speaker 6>When you're in someone's corner and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're dealing with someone,</v>

4279
03:01:48.401 --> 03:01:49.190
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

4280
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:50.350
<v Speaker 6>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to,</v>

4281
03:01:50.530 --> 03:01:54.520
<v Speaker 6>all you can say is like there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that says you can't win them all,</v>

4282
03:01:54.521 --> 03:01:55.211
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got caught.</v>

4283
03:01:55.211 --> 03:01:56.044
<v Speaker 6>Anybody can get cut.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's a difference between like </v>

4284
03:01:58.301 --> 03:01:59.134
<v Speaker 6>what we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a guy like Tim Kennedy took that </v>

4285
03:02:00.821 --> 03:02:04.650
<v Speaker 6>loss and like how hard Rhonda took her </v>
<v Speaker 6>loss to Holly Holm.</v>

4286
03:02:04.700 --> 03:02:05.341
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>

4287
03:02:05.341 --> 03:02:06.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a giant difference.</v>

4288
03:02:06.491 --> 03:02:07.324
<v Speaker 6>Complete opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the business of being a </v>

4289
03:02:09.071 --> 03:02:09.904
<v Speaker 6>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This game's easy when your merch in </v>

4290
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:11.983
<v Speaker 6>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone's every media outlets telling </v>

<v Speaker 6>Like yeah,</v>

4292
03:02:14.621 --> 03:02:16.750
<v Speaker 6>this is fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you take one on the chin,</v>

4293
03:02:16.751 --> 03:02:19.300
<v Speaker 6>you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most fighters come back and go,</v>

4294
03:02:19.610 --> 03:02:20.560
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got merch.</v>

4295
03:02:20.561 --> 03:02:22.300

<v Speaker 6>You'll see what's up.</v>

4296
03:02:22.301 --> 03:02:23.134
<v Speaker 6>I'm a real fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why tim or you eat Kelvin's had </v>

4297
03:02:26.531 --> 03:02:26.950
<v Speaker 6>his loss.</v>

4298
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:29.250
<v Speaker 6>Is everyone that many.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then Connor,</v>

4299
03:02:29.330 --> 03:02:30.163
<v Speaker 6>you know he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was already talking shit after that </v>

4300
03:02:31.901 --> 03:02:33.050
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was like in a fuckhead.</v>

4301
03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:34.420
<v Speaker 6>I fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'll be back.</v>

4302
03:02:34.421 --> 03:02:36.970
<v Speaker 6>Took it like a man and didn't talk about</v>
<v Speaker 6>a staph infection.</v>

4303
03:02:36.971 --> 03:02:38.020
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people,</v>

4304
03:02:38.021 --> 03:02:38.854
<v Speaker 6>when we found out about us sat staph </v>
<v Speaker 6>infection because of my fucking big </v>

4305
03:02:40.991 --> 03:02:41.824
<v Speaker 6>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he had a staph infection two weeks </v>

4306
03:02:43.001 --> 03:02:45.820
<v Speaker 6>out of that first nate diaz fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was taking antibiotics.</v>

4307
03:02:46.210 --> 03:02:48.700
<v Speaker 6>That's the word might be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's bullshit.</v>

4308
03:02:48.730 --> 03:02:50.050
<v Speaker 6>I haven't heard it directly from his </v>
<v Speaker 6>mouth,</v>

4309
03:02:50.051 --> 03:02:51.580
<v Speaker 6>but I heard it from a very reliable </v>
<v Speaker 6>sources.</v>

4310
03:02:51.610 --> 03:02:53.620
<v Speaker 6>Do you hear what his camp is doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are they doing?</v>

4311
03:02:53.740 --> 03:02:58.000
<v Speaker 6>His coach is requiring every fight on </v>
<v Speaker 6>his team to have their brain scan.</v>

4312
03:02:58.030 --> 03:02:59.380
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>John Kavanagh.</v>

4313
03:02:59.410 --> 03:03:00.300
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4314
03:03:00.310 --> 03:03:01.720
<v Speaker 6>Powerful move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Smart Guy,</v>

4315
03:03:01.721 --> 03:03:04.360
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah.</v>

4316
03:03:04.900 --> 03:03:06.730
<v Speaker 6>This is a crazy sport.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4317
03:03:06.731 --> 03:03:08.860
<v Speaker 6>and no one wants to tell people when </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can and can't do it,</v>

4318
03:03:08.890 --> 03:03:09.723
<v Speaker 6>but someone should be watching out for </v>
<v Speaker 6>them because that fucking same ego that </v>

4319
03:03:13.901 --> 03:03:18.370
<v Speaker 6>makes you want to be a champion can also</v>
<v Speaker 6>get you real confused as to when you are</v>

4320
03:03:18.371 --> 03:03:19.204
<v Speaker 6>physically compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which brings us to the fight that was </v>

4321
03:03:21.011 --> 03:03:24.610
<v Speaker 6>pulled off this card,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cain Velasquez versus fabrizio for doom.</v>

4322
03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:25.473
<v Speaker 6>The rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which everybody was looking forward to </v>

4323
03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:30.810
<v Speaker 6>and a cane did that meeting with that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4324
03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:32.370
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever that meant.</v>

4325
03:03:32.500 --> 03:03:33.810
<v Speaker 6>A association.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4326
03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:34.653
<v Speaker 6>The Fighters Association and said that </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's going to have to have a surgery </v>

4327
03:03:37.541 --> 03:03:39.070
<v Speaker 6>after this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they went,</v>

4328
03:03:39.730 --> 03:03:40.563
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you step that he fucked up </v>

4329
03:03:43.380 --> 03:03:43.841
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They like,</v>

4330
03:03:43.841 --> 03:03:47.260
<v Speaker 6>you can't say you need a surgery before </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have a major fight.</v>

4331
03:03:47.261 --> 03:03:48.094
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that that's going to fuck with the </v>

4332
03:03:49.481 --> 03:03:50.290
<v Speaker 6>betting lines.</v>

4333
03:03:50.290 --> 03:03:51.123
<v Speaker 6>There's a disaster there that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck with the insurance if something </v>

4334
03:03:53.831 --> 03:03:56.020
<v Speaker 6>happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then afterwards they say,</v>

4335
03:03:56.050 --> 03:03:56.651
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4336
03:03:56.651 --> 03:03:59.060
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you told us that you are already hurt.</v>

4337
03:03:59.061 --> 03:04:01.160
<v Speaker 6>We're not paying for this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like do you,</v>

4338
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:02.840
<v Speaker 6>do you get paid?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4339
03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:03.793
<v Speaker 6>for like when you're in training camp </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you get to a fight and you have to </v>

4340
03:04:07.341 --> 03:04:09.140
<v Speaker 6>pull out because the injury,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't get nothing.</v>

4341
03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:10.310
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you get?</v>

4342
03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:12.170
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

4343
03:04:12.260 --> 03:04:13.490
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you've got nothing.</v>

4344
03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:15.770
<v Speaker 6>So if he chose to fight with that </v>
<v Speaker 6>injury,</v>

4345
03:04:15.771 --> 03:04:16.604
<v Speaker 6>he said he was gonna be 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's going to have a cortisone </v>

4346
03:04:17.601 --> 03:04:19.740
<v Speaker 6>injection.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the doctors disagree.</v>

4347
03:04:19.741 --> 03:04:22.310
<v Speaker 6>The Nevada State Athletic Commission </v>
<v Speaker 6>disagreed that uh,</v>

4348
03:04:22.340 --> 03:04:24.200
<v Speaker 6>Bob Bennett Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't fucking play any games,</v>

4349
03:04:24.201 --> 03:04:24.680
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

4350
03:04:24.680 --> 03:04:28.640
<v Speaker 6>you can't say something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then finally long to do that.</v>

4351
03:04:28.641 --> 03:04:29.474
<v Speaker 6>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He fucked up emotional when I called </v>

4352
03:04:31.781 --> 03:04:33.050
<v Speaker 6>Linacre a little monkey earlier.</v>

4353
03:04:33.230 --> 03:04:35.390
<v Speaker 6>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See came fucked up.</v>

4354
03:04:35.391 --> 03:04:36.920
<v Speaker 6>You just talk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you say things,</v>

4355
03:04:37.100 --> 03:04:38.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going to say,</v>

4356
03:04:38.481 --> 03:04:41.090
<v Speaker 6>well that's kind of racist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I call myself a monkey though.</v>

4357
03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:41.953
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it sounds sounds worse than it really </v>

4358
03:04:42.921 --> 03:04:44.060
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not racist.</v>

4359
03:04:44.061 --> 03:04:44.894
<v Speaker 6>It's not the last person racist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the point is with when it comes to </v>

4360
03:04:48.471 --> 03:04:49.304
<v Speaker 6>Cain is that it was a giant error and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that error pulled him off of this card </v>

4361
03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:53.023
<v Speaker 6>and now he's going to have to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's going to have to get surgery and </v>

4362
03:04:55.581 --> 03:04:57.750
<v Speaker 6>then he'd have to fight whoever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 6>has left and it's,</v>

4363
03:04:57.770 --> 03:05:01.910
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about more months out and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then even more examination next time and</v>

4364
03:05:01.911 --> 03:05:03.460
<v Speaker 6>it's going to cost him a shit load of </v>
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

4365
03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:05.480
<v Speaker 6>A ton of money went through the entire </v>
<v Speaker 6>camp.</v>

4366
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:07.760
<v Speaker 6>He was a week out and they pull them </v>
<v Speaker 6>from it.</v>

4367
03:05:07.820 --> 03:05:09.710
<v Speaker 6>And then he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what this is about.</v>

4368
03:05:09.720 --> 03:05:11.180
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm 100% good to go.</v>

4369
03:05:11.330 --> 03:05:14.330
<v Speaker 6>I've been told I've been cleared.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he was tweeting that he had been told</v>

4370
03:05:14.331 --> 03:05:16.400
<v Speaker 6>that he was cleared right before they </v>
<v Speaker 6>pull them.</v>

4371
03:05:17.120 --> 03:05:18.530
<v Speaker 6>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4372
03:05:18.531 --> 03:05:21.230
<v Speaker 6>I think you give the guy a physical </v>
<v Speaker 6>examination in terms of his movement.</v>

4373
03:05:21.260 --> 03:05:22.310
<v Speaker 6>Like what can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4374
03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:24.540
<v Speaker 6>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you tell a guy business wise,</v>

4375
03:05:24.860 --> 03:05:25.693
<v Speaker 6>business wise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can look in his bag back some since </v>

4376
03:05:27.441 --> 03:05:30.290
<v Speaker 6>I ask the as you can't cause the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 6>goes man,</v>

4377
03:05:30.291 --> 03:05:31.124
<v Speaker 6>you have a bulging disk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can of course on the shot and then </v>

4378
03:05:32.991 --> 03:05:33.824
<v Speaker 6>if you get punched in the face by doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>where he gets a guilty and you're </v>

4379
03:05:35.631 --> 03:05:37.730
<v Speaker 6>paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you assumed the fuck out us cause we let</v>

4380
03:05:37.731 --> 03:05:39.740
<v Speaker 6>your true business,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just can't do that.</v>

4381
03:05:39.770 --> 03:05:41.810
<v Speaker 6>No deny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it falls on.</v>

4382
03:05:42.190 --> 03:05:43.023
<v Speaker 6>Kay came knows better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The people around this association </v>

4383
03:05:46.340 --> 03:05:47.600
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't have let them do that.</v>

4384
03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:48.463
<v Speaker 6>Well first of all they should have known</v>
<v Speaker 6>about first the bjorn revenue thing is </v>

4385
03:05:51.381 --> 03:05:52.214
<v Speaker 6>very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I was reading what John Fitch had </v>

4386
03:05:53.361 --> 03:05:54.194
<v Speaker 6>written that John Fitch rather than an </v>
<v Speaker 6>interview said that he was very </v>

4387
03:05:57.020 --> 03:06:00.350
<v Speaker 6>disturbed by all this because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>class action lawsuit.</v>

4388
03:06:00.351 --> 03:06:01.184
<v Speaker 6>And what they're saying is that if the </v>
<v Speaker 6>class action lawsuit is dropped like </v>

4389
03:06:05.961 --> 03:06:07.910
<v Speaker 6>that they could form this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4390
03:06:07.911 --> 03:06:08.744
<v Speaker 6>this union.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if they all agreed to abandon the </v>

4391
03:06:11.841 --> 03:06:13.700
<v Speaker 6>class action lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would,</v>

4392
03:06:13.730 --> 03:06:15.950
<v Speaker 6>it would like help the strength and form</v>
<v Speaker 6>the union.</v>

4393
03:06:16.130 --> 03:06:17.450
<v Speaker 6>And John Fitch was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

4394
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:18.343
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you're saying that the UFC would </v>

4395
03:06:19.731 --> 03:06:20.564
<v Speaker 6>accept you as a union if you abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 6>the class action lawsuit that we'd been </v>

4396
03:06:23.811 --> 03:06:26.660
<v Speaker 6>chasing down for two years now without </v>
<v Speaker 6>picking any sides.</v>

4397
03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:28.760
<v Speaker 6>Like if you're on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighters,</v>

4398
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:31.190
<v Speaker 6>not picking any sides,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just have to look at that and go,</v>

4399
03:06:31.191 --> 03:06:32.024
<v Speaker 6>well what benefit would it be for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that are not in this to accept </v>

4400
03:06:35.420 --> 03:06:37.130
<v Speaker 6>that the class action lawsuit is </v>
<v Speaker 6>dropped?</v>

4401
03:06:37.131 --> 03:06:37.964
<v Speaker 6>This all sounds like someone's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 6>get some money because there's no one's </v>

4402
03:06:41.181 --> 03:06:42.014
<v Speaker 6>doing this for free.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what everybody has to realize </v>

4403
03:06:43.401 --> 03:06:44.234
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to like these agencies and</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's like three different competing </v>

4404
03:06:46.941 --> 03:06:48.320
<v Speaker 6>ones that are stepping in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4405
03:06:49.130 --> 03:06:50.660
<v Speaker 6>There's the associate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the two big ones.</v>

4406
03:06:50.661 --> 03:06:53.570
<v Speaker 6>There's associations as the union.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4407
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:56.130
<v Speaker 6>Well ultimately I think we all want the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same</v>

4408
03:06:56.130 --> 03:06:56.963
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all want fighters to be compensated </v>

4409
03:06:58.471 --> 03:07:00.150
<v Speaker 2>fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want them to make a lot of money because</v>

4410
03:07:00.151 --> 03:07:02.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a short window of time and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome sport to watch.</v>

4411
03:07:02.850 --> 03:07:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

4412
03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:07.320
<v Speaker 2>So you got wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this help that?</v>

4413
03:07:07.350 --> 03:07:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Does this help them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it do any of these organizations?</v>

4414
03:07:10.650 --> 03:07:11.483
<v Speaker 2>They haven't yet because if they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even get together and organize and </v>

4415
03:07:14.911 --> 03:07:17.610
<v Speaker 2>they're going to fight right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then no one's going to take you serious.</v>

4416
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:19.560
<v Speaker 2>There's three different leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three different ones,</v>

4417
03:07:19.680 --> 03:07:20.513
<v Speaker 2>and they all want different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got to wonder whose </v>

4418
03:07:22.501 --> 03:07:24.690
<v Speaker 2>agenda's over here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whose agenda's over here?</v>

4419
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:27.210
<v Speaker 2>What it has to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't come from businessman,</v>

4420
03:07:27.390 --> 03:07:30.510
<v Speaker 2>can't come from another promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it come from the fighters,</v>

4421
03:07:30.511 --> 03:07:31.830
<v Speaker 2>the fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4422
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:32.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying current fighters </v>

4423
03:07:33.671 --> 03:07:34.504
<v Speaker 2>because they need to fight and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to have someone speak for them </v>

4424
03:07:37.051 --> 03:07:37.884
<v Speaker 2>who's been there.</v>

4425
03:07:38.070 --> 03:07:38.903
<v Speaker 2>But you can't have these business guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other hidden agendas trying to get </v>

4426
03:07:41.911 --> 03:07:42.744
<v Speaker 2>things done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

4427
03:07:42.810 --> 03:07:45.030
<v Speaker 2>or in a b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orange case,</v>

4428
03:07:45.031 --> 03:07:48.960
<v Speaker 2>he has this weird jealousy with Dana and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see them destroyed.</v>

4429
03:07:48.961 --> 03:07:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't have that.</v>

4430
03:07:49.890 --> 03:07:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Why are you speaking for us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

4431
03:07:52.270 --> 03:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the respect of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

4432
03:07:53.790 --> 03:07:54.623
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And notice he's taking a seat back </v>

4433
03:07:56.970 --> 03:07:58.800
<v Speaker 2>because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when everyone saw him speaking,</v>

4434
03:07:58.830 --> 03:07:59.770
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're out man.</v>

4435
03:08:00.030 --> 03:08:00.863
<v Speaker 2>Like he was going old school bell tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was running things over there </v>

4436
03:08:04.050 --> 03:08:04.883
<v Speaker 2>and a King Mo was pissed off at him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>King Mo most of this day calls him a </v>

4437
03:08:08.821 --> 03:08:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Dick Rider all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good when you've got a guy like</v>

4438
03:08:11.521 --> 03:08:15.270
<v Speaker 2>king mo who's a very respected guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>has horrible things to say about you.</v>

4439
03:08:15.340 --> 03:08:17.130
<v Speaker 2>And I talked to association.</v>

4440
03:08:17.130 --> 03:08:18.210
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you guys doing?</v>

4441
03:08:18.211 --> 03:08:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4442
03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you have one way to make an impression </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do this.</v>

4443
03:08:21.721 --> 03:08:23.790
<v Speaker 2>You put your best foot forward with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

4444
03:08:23.940 --> 03:08:24.630
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4445
03:08:24.630 --> 03:08:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know him?</v>

4446
03:08:26.970 --> 03:08:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I know of fighters who have dealt with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

4447
03:08:29.940 --> 03:08:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I never thought for Bella tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I know inside the fighter circle that</v>

4448
03:08:33.901 --> 03:08:36.300
<v Speaker 2>people have dealt with them for managing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

4449
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:37.363
<v Speaker 2>But I him personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at all the tweets and all </v>

4450
03:08:39.061 --> 03:08:39.894
<v Speaker 2>the negative stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can take a very positive </v>

4451
03:08:42.001 --> 03:08:42.834
<v Speaker 2>angle about improving the life and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions of these fighters without </v>

4452
03:08:46.201 --> 03:08:47.400
<v Speaker 2>attacking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4453
03:08:47.401 --> 03:08:48.690
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to attack.</v>

4454
03:08:48.691 --> 03:08:50.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's also see what you want about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana White.</v>

4455
03:08:50.881 --> 03:08:51.714
<v Speaker 2>It's not his job to make sure you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>get your shit together and formed the </v>

4456
03:08:54.270 --> 03:08:55.350
<v Speaker 2>association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4457
03:08:55.351 --> 03:08:56.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm a businessman.</v>

4458
03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I put on fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you guys want to do that,</v>

4459
03:08:58.350 --> 03:09:00.460
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your shit together and then bring it</v>

4460
03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:01.393
<v Speaker 2>and then let's figure something out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you guys are fighting with each </v>

4461
03:09:03.031 --> 03:09:04.260
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even acknowledge,</v>

4462
03:09:04.261 --> 03:09:05.610
<v Speaker 2>you know what else is interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4463
03:09:05.611 --> 03:09:07.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the $4 billion that you know,</v>

4464
03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:11.340
<v Speaker 2>is that they had to pay to buy the EOC </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of debt.</v>

4465
03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

4466
03:09:13.471 --> 03:09:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4467
03:09:14.740 --> 03:09:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4468
03:09:15.810 --> 03:09:16.643
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any business background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how much money do you have to make </v>

4469
03:09:20.190 --> 03:09:21.023
<v Speaker 2>to pay off $4 billion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you buy a house and your house </v>

4470
03:09:23.491 --> 03:09:25.490
<v Speaker 2>is like 3 million bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like damn,</v>

4471
03:09:25.491 --> 03:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>we like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some daunting 30 year payments.</v>

4472
03:09:28.350 --> 03:09:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine a thousand times that plus a</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion because that's what it is,</v>

4473
03:09:38.570 --> 03:09:39.403
<v Speaker 2>but thousand million billion is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why they're going and doing </v>

4474
03:09:42.451 --> 03:09:43.284
<v Speaker 2>these budget cuts saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we save money here and how can </v>

4475
03:09:44.851 --> 03:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>we grow it?</v>

4476
03:09:45.330 --> 03:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>So then you see all of a sudden you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the women 140 pound division,</v>

4477
03:09:49.130 --> 03:09:51.690
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing these into 45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one 45.</v>

4478
03:09:51.691 --> 03:09:53.830
<v Speaker 2>You've seen these interim belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing ways to,</v>

4479
03:09:54.130 --> 03:09:55.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make up the money.</v>

4480
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:56.343
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really sad thing about the </v>

4481
03:09:57.431 --> 03:10:01.690
<v Speaker 2>cyborg thing because cyborgs extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketable at 145 pounds.</v>

4482
03:10:01.720 --> 03:10:03.850
<v Speaker 2>And they make the decision for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4483
03:10:03.851 --> 03:10:05.890
<v Speaker 2>They made the division for her and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just marketable,</v>

4484
03:10:05.891 --> 03:10:08.470
<v Speaker 2>but very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very controversial,</v>

4485
03:10:08.471 --> 03:10:09.041
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4486
03:10:09.041 --> 03:10:10.380
<v Speaker 2>she's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

4487
03:10:10.460 --> 03:10:11.293
<v Speaker 2>she merck's women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes after them and it takes them </v>

4488
03:10:12.791 --> 03:10:13.800
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroys him,</v>

4489
03:10:13.870 --> 03:10:15.820
<v Speaker 2>smashes people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's in her thirties.</v>

4490
03:10:15.850 --> 03:10:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I think she's 34,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 cause she,</v>

4491
03:10:17.531 --> 03:10:22.531
<v Speaker 2>that'll I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up three 30 on June 32 31.</v>

4492
03:10:23.321 --> 03:10:24.154
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong.</v>

4493
03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

4494
03:10:25.481 --> 03:10:26.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>31,</v>

4495
03:10:26.351 --> 03:10:27.670
<v Speaker 2>it's in her prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4496
03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:31.390
<v Speaker 2>in her prime and for her to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion at one 45 this she could be,</v>

4497
03:10:31.391 --> 03:10:32.224
<v Speaker 2>she could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is she's going to be an </v>

4498
03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>under even more screwed.</v>

4499
03:10:34.100 --> 03:10:34.933
<v Speaker 2>She's so fucking mad and there's never </v>
<v Speaker 2>been someone who fucking need to pass </v>

4500
03:10:38.451 --> 03:10:39.284
<v Speaker 2>the test so bad in their life than her </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the number one knock on her was </v>

4501
03:10:42.100 --> 03:10:42.933
<v Speaker 2>you've test pause before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason why you're </v>

4502
03:10:43.991 --> 03:10:45.430
<v Speaker 2>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're knocking people out.</v>

4503
03:10:45.620 --> 03:10:47.680
<v Speaker 2>But fell off that train was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4504
03:10:47.681 --> 03:10:49.420
<v Speaker 2>she's so skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She deserves it.</v>

4505
03:10:49.421 --> 03:10:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Put marketing dollars behind her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like fine,</v>

4506
03:10:51.371 --> 03:10:52.450
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's your division.</v>

4507
03:10:52.750 --> 03:10:53.583
<v Speaker 2>Boom test positive but put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put yourself in or is it possible that </v>

4508
03:10:57.101 --> 03:11:02.101
<v Speaker 2>she really did deal with some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight cutting backlash where her body's</v>

4509
03:11:02.351 --> 03:11:06.730
<v Speaker 2>just like fucked up and it's retaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>water in some weird way and our hormones</v>

4510
03:11:06.731 --> 03:11:08.570
<v Speaker 2>are all fucked up cause she got on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth control pill.</v>

4511
03:11:08.571 --> 03:11:09.404
<v Speaker 2>I believe that it's possible that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor did prescribe her this to try to </v>

4512
03:11:11.771 --> 03:11:12.604
<v Speaker 2>mitigate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the doctor told her that you </v>

4513
03:11:14.051 --> 03:11:15.340
<v Speaker 2>could take this out of competition.</v>

4514
03:11:15.340 --> 03:11:18.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it into in competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it is a diuretic,</v>

4515
03:11:18.401 --> 03:11:19.234
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4516
03:11:19.390 --> 03:11:20.223
<v Speaker 2>So a diuretic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are swollen and all those things </v>

4517
03:11:22.481 --> 03:11:23.680
<v Speaker 2>do seem to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4518
03:11:23.681 --> 03:11:24.514
<v Speaker 2>just trying to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wanna I don't wanna see any </v>

03:13:06.801 --> 03:13:08.380
<v Speaker 2>your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just many that,</v>

4556
03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:10.340
<v Speaker 2>plenty of that video going around on its</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

4557
03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:11.293
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something you needed to </v>

4558
03:13:12.461 --> 03:13:13.294
<v Speaker 2>discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they could have done it in that </v>

4559
03:13:15.381 --> 03:13:16.214
<v Speaker 2>video and then show him the workout to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the return and it might be even more </v>

4560
03:13:19.341 --> 03:13:22.430
<v Speaker 2>dramatic shown are crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing her building back up,</v>

4561
03:13:22.431 --> 03:13:24.020
<v Speaker 2>picking up the pieces again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

4562
03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:24.561
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4563
03:13:24.561 --> 03:13:26.270
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

4564
03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:27.740
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4565
03:13:27.741 --> 03:13:28.574
<v Speaker 2>If you have a Rhonda Rousey life story </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie that's gotta be in the movie </v>

4566
03:13:30.960 --> 03:13:33.740
<v Speaker 2>course a hundred percent if she comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and wins,</v>

4567
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what you're gonna see.</v>

4568
03:13:35.660 --> 03:13:39.170
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna see all the pain Ronda </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rousey today right now.</v>

4569
03:13:39.230 --> 03:13:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is who she is right now.</v>

4570
03:13:42.320 --> 03:13:44.960
<v Speaker 2>What's going on right now is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened with Holly Holm,</v>

4571
03:13:45.130 --> 03:13:47.220
<v Speaker 2>you know this is her comeback does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

4572
03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:49.880
<v Speaker 2>can she pull off the comeback?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4573
03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:51.980
<v Speaker 2>the only reason you ain't gotta come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back against who?</v>

4574
03:13:52.010 --> 03:13:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average Fan's gone come back against</v>

4575
03:13:54.381 --> 03:13:56.630
<v Speaker 2>who she has been the favorite in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight she's ever been,</v>

4576
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.943
<v Speaker 2>had a complete blackout of Amanda Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they haven't showed shit at all </v>

4577
03:14:00.681 --> 03:14:03.500
<v Speaker 2>just now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very little footage that they're</v>

4578
03:14:03.501 --> 03:14:05.600
<v Speaker 2>showing in these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're showing Nunez.</v>

4579
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Stop watching boxing as to put it back </v>
<v Speaker 2>on fucking,</v>

4580
03:14:08.271 --> 03:14:11.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't see an fs one.</v>

4581
03:14:12.410 --> 03:14:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Where on boxing that work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll like that.</v>

4582
03:14:14.300 --> 03:14:15.133
<v Speaker 2>Joe tweeted them know I tweeted a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall like while I was watching it at </v>

4583
03:14:17.781 --> 03:14:19.100
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching,</v>

4584
03:14:19.101 --> 03:14:19.934
<v Speaker 2>I was actually in a hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching that UFC on Fox where </v>

4585
03:14:23.151 --> 03:14:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Michelle waterson beat paige vanzant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching.</v>

4586
03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm like this is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not showing the champion to show</v>

4587
03:14:29.471 --> 03:14:34.070
<v Speaker 2>in this giant Promo and it's all Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which makes some sense because Rhonda is</v>

4588
03:14:34.071 --> 03:14:34.904
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to let everybody know that </v>

4589
03:14:35.931 --> 03:14:38.510
<v Speaker 2>she's coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you want to let everybody know</v>

4590
03:14:38.511 --> 03:14:39.344
<v Speaker 2>that she's coming back against a killer </v>
<v Speaker 2>against you want everybody to know that </v>

4591
03:14:41.211 --> 03:14:43.130
<v Speaker 2>she's coming back to fight the champion.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what in some weird world in mma,</v>

4593

<v Speaker 2>year she has look,</v>

4627
03:16:02.190 --> 03:16:07.020
<v Speaker 2>in business 101 what happened if that </v>

<v Speaker 2>about her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to say channel.</v>

03:16:08.431 --> 03:16:09.780
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4630

<v Speaker 2>There's just not much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see a bunch of different,</v>

4631
03:16:15.740 --> 03:16:19.010

<v Speaker 2>There's still timing.</v>

4632
03:16:19.310 --> 03:16:20.143
<v Speaker 2>We have a deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she willing can fight Ronda Rousey </v>

<v Speaker 2>if Rhonda gets work twice,</v>

4634
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:28.480

4636
03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:33.090

4638
03:16:36.541 --> 03:16:37.800
<v Speaker 2>cause she was instantly huge.</v>

4639
03:16:37.830 --> 03:16:39.840
<v Speaker 2>And then she loses two in a row </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>

4640
03:16:40.170 --> 03:16:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She gets choked out by Meesha against a </v>

4642
03:16:45.211 --> 03:16:46.044
<v Speaker 2>better grappler.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you show preferential treatment because </v>

4668
03:17:53.611 --> 03:17:54.960
<v Speaker 2>she's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's special,</v>

4669
03:17:55.140 --> 03:17:58.140
<v Speaker 2>she's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's doing massive star.</v>

4670
03:17:58.230 --> 03:17:59.650
<v Speaker 2>She has a massive star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

4671
03:17:59.660 --> 03:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>that's the girl that's going to put this</v>
<v Speaker 2>the asses in the seats right there,</v>

4672
03:18:02.970 --> 03:18:04.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got busier than conor though.</v>

4673
03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as far as women go,</v>

4674
03:18:07.231 --> 03:18:08.680
<v Speaker 2>she is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corner of the timeout.</v>

4675
03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:11.560
<v Speaker 2>The fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about fighters division.</v>

4676
03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:12.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4677
03:18:12.510 --> 03:18:14.460
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one like there's no one like,</v>

4678
03:18:14.500 --> 03:18:17.190
<v Speaker 2>but just cause connor sells more tickets</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean she's,</v>

4679
03:18:17.830 --> 03:18:20.480
<v Speaker 2>they have multiple stores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple elite stars.</v>

4680
03:18:20.540 --> 03:18:21.373
<v Speaker 2>And here you see Amanda doing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>workouts just lifting some weights or </v>

4685
03:18:38.620 --> 03:18:39.453
<v Speaker 2>The one that they see on tv where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll up the garage door and you see her </v>

<v Speaker 2>we should be aware of?</v>

4703
03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:28.593
<v Speaker 2>Any other big fights without what else </v>
<v Speaker 2>is happening on the feature about Tony </v>

4704
03:19:32.140 --> 03:19:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Khabib is that are going to have not </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

4705
03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:34.633
<v Speaker 2>Signed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that you're talking about for the </v>

4706
03:19:35.531 --> 03:19:37.930
<v Speaker 2>interim title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's not happening easily wants</v>

4707
03:19:37.931 --> 03:19:39.130
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's my question.</v>

4708
03:19:39.131 --> 03:19:41.410
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck do you have an interim </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion that quick?</v>

4709
03:19:42.130 --> 03:19:42.941
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

4710
03:19:42.941 --> 03:19:44.410
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

4711
03:19:44.411 --> 03:19:45.244
<v Speaker 2>what's what sells?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what gets people to tune in as </v>

4712
03:19:47.441 --> 03:19:48.550
<v Speaker 2>belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4713
03:19:48.820 --> 03:19:53.170
<v Speaker 2>And so because of the fact that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>guaranteeing will also,</v>

4714
03:19:53.200 --> 03:19:58.200
<v Speaker 2>if you have a beep fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conor in Russia and Habib has the belt,</v>

4715
03:19:59.680 --> 03:20:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to rush and destroy.</v>

4716
03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:08.110
<v Speaker 2>He is the Russian destroys the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is it.</v>

4717
03:20:08.111 --> 03:20:11.890
<v Speaker 2>He's on Rafi that he's a smasher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what a big opportunity for Tony,</v>

4718
03:20:12.220 --> 03:20:13.810
<v Speaker 2>if Tony Ferguson could steal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thunder.</v>

4719
03:20:13.811 --> 03:20:16.270
<v Speaker 2>And if you see when Michael Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 2>clipped him and hurt him,</v>

4720
03:20:16.271 --> 03:20:18.010
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time we ever saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her true.</v>

4721
03:20:18.400 --> 03:20:19.233
<v Speaker 2>But Michael Johnson just does not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same grappling ability of the Tony </v>

4722
03:20:22.200 --> 03:20:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Ferguson has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4723
03:20:22.970 --> 03:20:23.803
<v Speaker 2>it's a different animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also Tony Ferguson is a different </v>

4724
03:20:26.891 --> 03:20:27.920
<v Speaker 2>kind of stryker too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

4725
03:20:27.930 --> 03:20:31.300
<v Speaker 2>he's much more awkward in his movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>

4726
03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:33.580
<v Speaker 2>he's a real hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get what?</v>

4727
03:20:33.581 --> 03:20:35.940
<v Speaker 2>They're both real good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Johnson's a very good striker.</v>

4728
03:20:35.941 --> 03:20:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you knocked it knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>dust employee that both real good.</v>

4729
03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:42.090
<v Speaker 2>But the big difference is the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling ability,</v>

4730
03:20:42.100 --> 03:20:42.933
<v Speaker 2>Tony's grappling abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see Tony's tweet or did he say </v>

4731
03:20:46.360 --> 03:20:48.280
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm down except the fight.</v>

4732
03:20:48.281 --> 03:20:49.114
<v Speaker 2>He goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he could be be you cause could be </v>

4733
03:20:50.291 --> 03:20:51.730
<v Speaker 2>called them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause where's the fight?</v>

4734
03:20:51.970 --> 03:20:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony said,</v>

4735
03:20:53.410 --> 03:20:54.243
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made your deal and you're making </v>

4736
03:20:55.241 --> 03:20:56.980
<v Speaker 2>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not scared of anyone.</v>

4737
03:20:57.010 --> 03:20:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get paid what I'm worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4738
03:20:58.990 --> 03:21:00.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm down to take the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4739
03:21:00.430 --> 03:21:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I need to renegotiate my contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4740
03:21:02.620 --> 03:21:05.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what Tony said in between round</v>
<v Speaker 2>one and round two,</v>

4741
03:21:05.650 --> 03:21:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you know he lost that first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rafael Design Joe's,</v>

4742
03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:09.543
<v Speaker 2>he Atlanta took some good shots and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know we ran into the cage and you don't </v>

4743
03:21:14.861 --> 03:21:16.480
<v Speaker 2>know exactly what's going on through his</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

4744
03:21:16.500 --> 03:21:20.350
<v Speaker 2>And he and his striking coach Anthony's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like telling and some shit.</v>

4745
03:21:20.650 --> 03:21:22.270
<v Speaker 2>And before I got to say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks at me,</v>

4746
03:21:22.271 --> 03:21:23.380
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coach,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kick the inside of it.</v>

4748
03:21:26.770 --> 03:21:29.650
<v Speaker 2>You know when he started getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4749
03:21:29.651 --> 03:21:30.880
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to hear.</v>

4750
03:21:30.881 --> 03:21:32.980

<v Speaker 2>he's such a barbarian.</v>

4751
03:21:33.220 --> 03:21:35.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what he had to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pose a monster.</v>

4752
03:21:36.180 --> 03:21:39.790

<v Speaker 2>Dana murking.</v>

4758
03:21:50.991 --> 03:21:54.830
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking bear on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The grappler,</v>

4759
03:21:54.860 --> 03:21:58.030
<v Speaker 4>but excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Johnson was making a lot of uh,</v>

4760
03:21:58.550 --> 03:22:01.380
<v Speaker 4>key errors on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4761
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:02.380
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he was [inaudible] to fix with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>crucifix.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was hurt.</v>

4764
03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:08.990
<v Speaker 4>Did you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could be versus a dose Angeles though,</v>

4765
03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:11.750
<v Speaker 4>until just answers a legit black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He mauled him.</v>

4766
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:14.000
<v Speaker 4>He'll be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to say that again.</v>

4767
03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Mocking mauled him on the ground molded </v>
<v Speaker 4>me in a weird way where you watching him</v>

4768
03:22:17.871 --> 03:22:20.780
<v Speaker 4>just smush a guy who is a Brazilian Jiu </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jitsu black belt.</v>

4769
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Like he's handling it like a blue belt </v>
<v Speaker 4>or a purple bag costing around.</v>

4770
03:22:24.831 --> 03:22:25.664
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's grappling is as good as </v>

4771
03:22:26.631 --> 03:22:27.464
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen inside the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might not be the same submission </v>

4772
03:22:29.841 --> 03:22:33.650
<v Speaker 4>stylists that a Damien Maia is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's pure ability to control guys,</v>

4773
03:22:33.651 --> 03:22:35.690
<v Speaker 4>take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grapple them and maul them.</v>

4774
03:22:35.810 --> 03:22:37.730
<v Speaker 4>Is unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is MMA grappling.</v>

4775
03:22:37.740 --> 03:22:38.571
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

4776
03:22:38.571 --> 03:22:39.830
<v Speaker 4>When he gets a hold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4777
03:22:39.860 --> 03:22:43.460
<v Speaker 4>it's so fucking undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this kind of shit.</v>

4778
03:22:43.820 --> 03:22:46.130
<v Speaker 4>Like he gets a hold of you at bear hugs </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and just like,</v>

4779
03:22:46.131 --> 03:22:47.390

<v Speaker 2>That he called them Persian clubs.</v>

5044
03:33:57.601 --> 03:33:58.201
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran.</v>

5045
03:33:58.201 --> 03:33:59.690
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those were uh,</v>

5046
03:33:59.940 --> 03:34:00.773
<v Speaker 2>like an old school strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning piece of equipment and you </v>

5047
03:34:04.321 --> 03:34:06.720
<v Speaker 2>would get other people to try to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just couldn't do it.</v>

5048
03:34:07.380 --> 03:34:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Like some of them they would do matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

5049
03:34:10.350 --> 03:34:11.183
<v Speaker 2>they would use like these big thick </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces of heavy wood with a handle on </v>

5050
03:34:13.741 --> 03:34:14.400
<v Speaker 2>the bottom.</v>

5051
03:34:14.400 --> 03:34:15.990

<v Speaker 2>made out of.</v>

5052
03:34:16.200 --> 03:34:19.140
<v Speaker 2>But now a lot of guys make them out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>steel now.</v>

5053
03:34:19.210 --> 03:34:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Like this Guy Jack White boy taking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>

5054

5056
03:34:30.001 --> 03:34:30.834
<v Speaker 2>which is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the real way to do it is what's </v>

5057
03:34:32.430 --> 03:34:33.263
<v Speaker 2>called a shield cast where you take your</v>
<v Speaker 2>right hand and you go towards your left </v>

5058
03:34:37.351 --> 03:34:40.170
<v Speaker 2>shoulder behind your back and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

5059
03:34:40.171 --> 03:34:41.760
<v Speaker 2>you bring it down in front of you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

<v Speaker 2>stroke.</v>

<v Speaker 6>like I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

5190
03:39:52.310 --> 03:39:55.080
<v Speaker 6>that's what that was a problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like people like getting upset.</v>

5191
03:39:55.100 --> 03:39:56.810
<v Speaker 6>It's something that people's three </v>
<v Speaker 6>people say,</v>

5192
03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.823
<v Speaker 6>whether you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're all racing world's Darton in with </v>

5193
03:39:59.931 --> 03:40:03.200
<v Speaker 6>shit and talking shit and we're all high</v>
<v Speaker 6>and were being ridiculous.</v>

5194
03:40:03.350 --> 03:40:04.790
<v Speaker 6>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you do stuff like that,</v>

5195
03:40:04.850 --> 03:40:07.730
<v Speaker 6>like you're going to say some shit that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you probably shouldn't have said,</v>

5196
03:40:08.180 --> 03:40:10.670
<v Speaker 6>but you can't pretend that it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything we thought out.</v>

5197
03:40:10.850 --> 03:40:15.260
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of it is a completely off the</v>
<v Speaker 6>cuff and if you don't like that,</v>

5198
03:40:15.261 --> 03:40:16.094
<v Speaker 6>that's fine.</v>

5199
03:40:16.190 --> 03:40:18.740
<v Speaker 6>But if you do like it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's only one way to do it folks.</v>

5200
03:40:18.930 --> 03:40:21.470
<v Speaker 6>You've got to do it off the cuff like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that and you gotta get a crack,</v>

5201
03:40:21.471 --> 03:40:22.650
<v Speaker 6>some eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you want to make an Omelet.</v>

5202
03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:23.503
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll make some omelets [inaudible] </v>

5203
03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:28.580
<v Speaker 6>stones all day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the way.</v>

5204
03:40:28.581 --> 03:40:29.414
<v Speaker 6>Brian counts not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not that he's not here because we </v>

5205
03:40:30.621 --> 03:40:31.610
<v Speaker 6>don't love him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's busy.</v>

5206
03:40:31.700 --> 03:40:33.290
<v Speaker 6>He's a on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all.</v>

5207

<v Speaker 6>not at all.</v>

5209
03:40:36.470 --> 03:40:37.303
<v Speaker 6>But if he was here we would definitely </v>
<v Speaker 6>have made fun of them and we definitely </v>

5210
03:40:39.551 --> 03:40:41.210
<v Speaker 6>would have got called bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's uh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>that's also made some facts up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just what we do.</v>

5212
03:40:44.721 --> 03:40:47.510
<v Speaker 6>And we love him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a crazy boy.</v>

5213
03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:50.690
<v Speaker 6>He's so fun fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's out there on vacation.</v>

5214
03:40:51.040 --> 03:40:52.520
<v Speaker 6>He'll be back for the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
