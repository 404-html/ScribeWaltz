Hello,
you dirty freak pitches.
Welcome to the new world.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.670
Welcome to the future.
Welcome to the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.030
This episode is brought to you by stamps.com if you go to stamps.com and wow,

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.330
how long it takes one to delay the guys that live in the past time.

5
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.300
Here's to living in the past.
People listen to your shit already happened.
Um,

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.450
if you go,
what stamps.com is,
um,

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.180
a service that allows you to measure stuff at home with your own scale and

8
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.350
<v 1>then
shit through the Internet.
Man,</v>

9
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.050
you guys are high route.
You measure things.
You mentioned the weight.

10
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.340
Is that rude to say?
Measure the weight.
That's what it is.

11
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.870
You measure the weight yet.
Fucks.
How,
first of all,
how dare you,
all of you.

12
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.540
I was thinking I don't like it.
You ready sir?

13
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.330
<v 0>Um,
for some reason when I'm typing in Jre it's not sending me to that.</v>

14
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.030
How are you getting there?
What do you type it in?

15
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.950
Like as far as you type jre right?

16
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.800
stamps.com stamps.com forward slash Cho,
right?
No,
no,
no.

17
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.940
That's not it.
No.
How did you get it?
stamps.com you enter in the code word Jre,

18
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.774
right?

19
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.550
If you buy any of the kitty cat tee shirts at Brian red band cells,

20
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.960
that's how he makes them.

21
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.170
He sends him rather through stamps.com if you like a have a small business and

22
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.460
you're trying to go to the post office and wait in line and get your shit,

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.080
wade and different labels on boxes,
you're going to go crazy.

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
It's not,
it's not healthy this way.
You do it all on your home computer,

25
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.430
super sample.
They could do it for your weight.
We want to scale.

26
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.630
They give you a scale.
They uh,
they give you,
it's a $110 value.

27
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.310
If you enter in the code word jre and uh,
it's,
it's,
there's a nose,

28
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.770
no risk twat say it again.

29
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.160
No risk trial plus $110 bonus offer,

30
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.940
including the digital scale and up to $55 of free postage.

31
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.840
So they give you a sweet deal and if you like,
if you're selling shit,
it's,

32
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.950
it's a really easy way to deal with things as opposed to like hiring someone to

33
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:20.400
handle it.
You can actually handle it yourself and if you're not selling shit,

34
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.650
what do you want to work for somebody forever.

35
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.540
It's just go make some macrame and salad.

36
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.050
<v 1>No,
no person is online.
It's the future cancer from licking stamps.</v>

37
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.340
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You want a wet a sponge at Fox.
Don't people that can shit.

38
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.980
You remember when you have to lick stamps?
Sleep bitches.
Yeah,
I remember that.

39
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.340
That's a bad time man.

40
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.180
From [inaudible] dot com mouth are sticking together.

41
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.360
<v 0>Hey,
Ari
were also brought to you by hover.</v>

42
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Hover is a internet domain name company that is owned by the people that own,

43
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.620
is it hover.com forward slash Joe Rogan?
Is that what it is?

44
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.170
[inaudible] dot com forward slash Rogen hub or

45
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.700
fooling slash let's Jesse,

46
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.400
<v 2>you got to get all these people to make the same one.</v>

47
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.550
All make the same one together.

48
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.700
They can coach them no time because they don't want to pretend that each other

49
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:17.410
exists.
They're like,
if you're a single guy,
you've got a bunch of girlfriends.

50
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.260
So they don't want to know that they have his other girlfriends.

51
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.070
Nobody wants to think that.
Why should we change our shit to GRE?

52
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.360
<v 0>You know,
just because squarespace.com uses that.
I mean,</v>

53
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:31.250
what the fuck man hover is,
uh,
the domain company that I use actually.

54
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.810
And if you,
um,
if you're like a techno idiot,
like myself,

55
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.310
I do not know how to do anything correctly other than really easy,
simple,

56
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:43.350
intuitive shit like Facebook or Twitter or something like that.
But I don't,

57
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.610
I don't know how to,
you know,

58
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.830
if I can register a website like super easy and it has things that you normally

59
00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:53.480
have to pay for,
like who is domain name privacy,
which is a,

60
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.930
that's,
that's key.

61
00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:01.550
If you order Ari Shaffir his legs and then,
you know,
you put that shit online,

62
00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:05.930
you don't want people to know he's just steady beaten off to Arusha,
his legs,

63
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.910
family,
people.

64
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.910
I mean they're sexy or it could be dig party in my mouth.com which we own.

65
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.011
<v 2>Good.</v>

66
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:19.180
How are you going to dig party in your mouth.com because we were just trying to

67
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:21.540
make the point we want wanted to make the point.

68
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.010
<v 0>You could hide this because it would be embarrassing if people knew that you had</v>

69
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:30.011
Dick Party in your mouth.com [inaudible] dot com forward slash Rogan is the

70
00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:31.730
sweet spot.
If you go there,

71
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:36.530
you will save 10% off your domain name registrations.
And uh,
but like I said,

72
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:40.940
it's the same company that owns Ting,
very ethical company,

73
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:44.330
very reasonable rates and I use them too.
So go,

74
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.430
they support the podcast and we support them and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

75
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.770
Anyway,
on a.com last sponsor,
o n n I t,
use a code name,

76
00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:58.700
Rogan and save 10% off any supplements.
That's it.
Fuck it.

77
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.630
Let's just not say anything more.
I talked too much.
Boom.

78
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.580
We got Jason Silva.
Boom,

79
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:11.870
We got Dunkin Trust.
So this is the Uber podcasts,

80
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.430

Now

81
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.260
the Joe Rogan experience.

82
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.610

Praise Odin,
ours.
Your fear.
We were finally,
we're finally together again.

85
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.150
This is a fucking super podcast.
This is really great.

86
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.740
This is the sexy as it gets for me.
I'm very happy to be here,
man.

87
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.760
Thank you for having me back.
It was so cool.

88
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.120
Running into you with the global future 2045 conference,
man,

89
00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:51.750
that was bad ass dude.
That was awesome.
That is your world,
dude.

90
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.220
That's where I was actually talking about with Duncan about this a little while

91
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:57.980
ago.
What was your impression?
Because I

92
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.430
<v 4>mean that's kind of like the Mecca of the singularity.
You guys visited Mecca,</v>

93
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.610
singularity

94
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.710
<v 0>and because we visited for the show,</v>

95
00:06:04.711 --> 00:06:09.600
we got to talk to some really cool people that probably would never sit down and

96
00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:13.140
talk to us.
You know like Aubrey de grey.
I got to talk to RBT.
Greg.

97
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.870
We'll have that on the show.
And you know,
you guys got to talk to,

98
00:06:15.871 --> 00:06:19.830
what was the gentleman's name of the robot?
Uh,
Hiroshi.
Hiroshi Ishiguro.

99
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.830
Hiroshi Ishiguro crazy robot.

100
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.080
Man Really had limbs?
No,

101
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.461
<v 4>the one,</v>

102
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:33.461
that little baby one somewhat limbs creeps me out because that one responds to

103
00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:38.110
you in conversation.
It understands what you say in response to you.

104
00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:40.960
So you're like,
hey,
how you doing?
And it goes,
good,
how are you?

105
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.680
And then it's like,
and it's like,
good man,
where are you from?
He's like,

106
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.990
I'm from Tokyo.
And I'm like,
oh cool.
Did you like to travel here?
He's like,
yeah,

107
00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:51.430
it was fun.
But here's the thing,
it's this like humanoid baby with no limbs,

108
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.610
which feels like the beginning of like a creepy Scifi movie.

109
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.000
It starts out with showing like the first AI,
but it's limitless.

110
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.280
So it's this like weird thing like,
so we're going to build them,

111
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:04.870
but they're going to be like a little circus freaks without limbs felt really

112
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:05.704
honking.

113
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.330
<v 0>Be weirder if it was limbless or if it had limbs,
it couldn't move.</v>

114
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.330
<v 4>Paralyze you with his nubs.
You're right.</v>

115
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.870
But that's why I was freaking customer responds to you like a human and it's

116
00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:19.560
cute.

117
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.980
You immediately anthropomorphize it and you start to respond to it like it's

118
00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:23.670
alive.

119
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.870
And at some point it'll be so good at responding that by all measures that we

120
00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:29.310
know about when it comes to knowing your,

121
00:07:29.311 --> 00:07:32.040
for your son you have a subjective experience or if you have a subjective will

122
00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:33.750
just believe that they're conscious at that point.

123
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.890
Are they just going to be these living thinking things that we keep like

124
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:39.480
limbless behind like uh,

125
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.510
you know behind a rope so people can like throw money and look at it.

126
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:44.890
I mean it was just freaked me out the presentation of it.
I didn't think he was,

127
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.260
I don't think they're going to,

128
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:49.950
I think one thing that people haven't thought of with robots yet is that they

129
00:07:49.951 --> 00:07:52.560
think that they're going to be confined to one form.

130
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.640
I think the reality is going to be that they are going to be able to disassemble

131
00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:59.820
and did individual droplets if they want to.

132
00:07:59.821 --> 00:08:03.170
They're going to be these self assembling things that can kind of determine

133
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.340
what it's going to be.
It's going to be,
but think about that in a way.

134
00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:12.870
It's kind of like time lapsing reality because what are atoms if not self

135
00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:17.430
assembling linkup with other atoms and become cells and then those cells like

136
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:22.020
self assembled into into tissues and organism mean the whole story of the

137
00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:26.190
universe.
The whole,
the opposite of entropy is extra p right?

138
00:08:26.191 --> 00:08:29.340
The things that move towards greater complexity and self assemble.

139
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.560
So we will talk about robots or nanotechnology.
It's just,

140
00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:35.370
it's like an acceleration of it so that it becomes discernible to us from this

141
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:37.800
scale.
And this is funny because it already exists.

142
00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:40.890
When Mckenna talks about his DMT experience,

143
00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:43.270
he calls himself transforming machine off.

144
00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:47.700
So it's almost as though he's come in contact with a future version of what

145
00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:50.460
these a androids are going to do.
Stop.

146
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.650
<v 0>If you think if you accelerated life,
I mean time is all,</v>

147
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:57.990
it's all our perspective.
If you accelerated our life,
human life,

148
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:02.080
the experience of humanity.
Yeah,
but accelerated at times a billion,
right?

149
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:07.130
And you got to see the first single cell become multicellular and on and on and

150
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:11.070
on.
Cities rise,
people fly.
And then the earth crash again.
You got,

151
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.060
you would get to see it all in like some sort of a psychedelic trip.

152
00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:18.660
It only takes three minutes and you would see the the earth form out of the

153
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:21.960
cosmos.
I mean you could,
that's that psychedelic,

154
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.230
I mean that might as well be a mushroom trip.
100%

155
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.000
<v 4>I mean if you could like literally just a perspective thing.
It's a time thing.</v>

156
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.290
All a perspective.
Like even when you see time lapse of trees growing,

157
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.380
do you see the tree and aims towards the sun plants like came towards us.

158
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.270
I mean it's kind of crazy.
It's almost like agency itself,

159
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.610
which is that what they called it?

160
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.580
You know the life force that there's agency plants seem to have it through time

161
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:43.911
lapse.

162
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:48.911
Like you see agency intent like if wants to go towards Kevin Kelly.

163
00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:49.440
Okay.

164
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.150
They're the trippy white co founder of wired in his book what technology wants.

165
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.790
He calls technology that technium he says it's the seventh kingdom of life and

166
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.640
then it also has wants and needs and he says that if we were able to zoom out

167
00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:05.810
and remove ourselves from the being the co participants in creating technology,

168
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.810
it would actually look like the technology itself is self assembling and has a

169
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.830
direction like the time lapsing of plants,
which is crazy.

170
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.060
And then when Mckenna was tripping out and he starts talking about singularities

171
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:17.781
hello,

172
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:21.440
hear the echo with Kurzweil and Mckenna tennis tripping on DMT and talking about

173
00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:22.220
singularities,

174
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.850
he's talking about universes that engender novelty universes that allow the

175
00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:27.320
sprouting of new possibility.

176
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.470
It's the same thing that Kevin Kelly's writing about and its technology book to

177
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.030
see like the respected technologists writing these books about what's happening.

178
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.450
You know,
even Eric Schmidt,
the age of augmented humanity and Google.

179
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.660
Google represents the literalization of the psychedelic dream.

180
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:45.380
You know the literalization of the idea that we are expanding our minds with

181
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:46.280
these technologies,

182
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.040
whether they be chemical technologies or whether they be these external

183
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.570
technologies.
What you're saying.

184
00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:54.560
This is why it's hilarious when you hear people start railing against,

185
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.000
it's unnatural.
We shouldn't do it.
Because what you're saying is like,
no,

186
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:04.001
actually there appears to be some form of transcendent invisible architecture

187
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:09.740
that all things grow upon in a similar way.
100% technology,
humans.

188
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.320
It just stretches on this invisible framework and reveals a whole bunch of

189
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.020
hidden and underneath all things,
which seems to be this ever perfecting.

190
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.880
Absolutely ever complexifying harmonious expression.
That's right.
And peer dish,

191
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:26.210
our Dean,
who was a famous Jesuit called it the Omega point,

192
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.440
he called it the Omega Point.

193
00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:31.910
He got pushed out of the church because he basically sort of divinize the idea

194
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:34.340
of the singularity and he was using the language of God,

195
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:37.190
but he was talking about this move towards complexity and the phenomenon of men.

196
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:40.730
And man was the point in which evolution became self aware and started directing

197
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:41.564
its own evolution.

198
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.060
Doesn't that echo whether we were talking about it in the futures conference?

199
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.880
So you see these echos,
you see these patterns that connect,

200
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:49.370
you know the whole idea of cyber delex,
right.
Look,

201
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.850
so cybernetics and computers and then psychedelics and you know,

202
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.280
chemical technologies and they collide and what's

203
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.350
<v 5>known as Cyber Delek.</v>

204
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.290
That all started in the sixties and seventies in Silicon Valley when the

205
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:03.250
computer scientist or tripping on LSD and working on creative problems.
Yeah,

206
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.590
Xerox Parc augmenting human intelligence.

207
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.260
There's a book by John Markoff called what the dormouse says,

208
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:10.630
which talks about that,
where that came from.

209
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.360
I mean you have to think that these people were out of their minds when they

210
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:16.420
were conceiving of a world in which these computers could be wirelessly sending

211
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:19.600
our thoughts across time and space at the speed of light and that we're all

212
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:22.730
going to be connected and see our faces on these like machines like,

213
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.280
I mean you have to be,
you know,

214
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:28.180
way psychologically or metaphorically tripping to even think so far outside the

215
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:28.631
box.

216
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:33.631
So it's not like Davinci was so fascinating and look a lot of stuff that he came

217
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.610
up with,
it really didn't come to fruition in that form,

218
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.940
but you could see that he was like thinking of these concepts like way ahead of

219
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:44.140
everybody else who's saying he was just really like,
what a fascinating,

220
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.130
fascinating guy.
That must've been all completed.

221
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.360
I'm envisioning the future knowing that he's just stuck with these fucking,

222
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:51.760
do they have any regular conversation with anybody?

223
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.090
I doubt you're thinking could walk along and pretend the cared about what

224
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:58.550
happened.
The coliseum last night about the potatoes or

225
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.320
the potatoes are no good.
We've gone to riots.
Shh.
We can fly.

226
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:09.280
He's drawn a fucking helicopter in his backyard.
Yeah.

227
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.290
That's so far ahead of the curve.
It's just,
it's,

228
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.330
but it stands to reason that some people are born with bigger dicks and other

229
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:17.560
people have larger ears.

230
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.240
Some people would just have a part of the brain or have the ability to tune into

231
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:26.500
creativity.
Yes.
Da Vinci's teacher,
it sounds like.
I mean was he was wealthy guy,

232
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:29.470
like did he come from a background where he had muscle?
No,

233
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.770
I did not know any of the history of monsters.

234
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.650
You didn't make any money at these things.
So you don't think,

235
00:13:33.651 --> 00:13:35.200
when I was reading an article today that said,
you know,

236
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:38.830
even though human beings evolved about 200,000 years ago,
the first art,

237
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.840
the first signs of like religion or you know,

238
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.540
contemplated thinking didn't appear until the cave paintings that are like

239
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:46.920
70,000 years old.
So if we had had the same brains for 200,000 years,

240
00:13:46.921 --> 00:13:50.470
but you didn't see the beginning of humanness or imagination until about 70,000

241
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:52.450
years ago,
why did it take so long?

242
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:54.790
If we've had the same rates and the idea is that we,

243
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:56.140
it's like Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

244
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.660
Those first hundred thousand years we didn't even have enough food.

245
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.210
We didn't have like any kind of organized society.

246
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.700
It was only when we could afford it.

247
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:05.380
The leisure time that all this other stuff came back.

248
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:08.900
A loan you mostly pay interest at first and then and then 1 cent on that pop on

249
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.070
the two lodge and then eventually you're paying like only two sheets of any

250
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:15.520
hilarity.
The rest of the ticket,
get it all they had,

251
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.580
they took 99% of their time just dealing with staying alive.

252
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.650
That to get to wherever they were going,

253
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.040
hierarchy of needs and it's like as a collective human society,

254
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:25.360
at some point we were able to,

255
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:28.360
we had enough hunters and we had enough organization maybe that we could feed

256
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:31.570
ourselves.
And there was at the beginning of free time at the beginning of eating

257
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:35.100
psychedelic chemicals and making cave paintings and semantic dances and all of

258
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:38.680
that free time is my God.
Think about countries today,

259
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.690
w civilizations today that I live in like that.

260
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:42.160
Have you heard about these people in India?

261
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.200
There's an island and uncontacted island off of India and recently these,
uh,

262
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.470
within the last few years,

263
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.560
these fishermen inadvertently got drunk in their boat and drifted into shore and

264
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.190
these people killed

265
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.950
<v 0>them.
They killed them.
And then the,</v>

266
00:14:53.951 --> 00:14:56.720
the authorities are trying to figure out how to get to the bodies without

267
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:59.120
getting shot at by these people want to have him to kill them because there's

268
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:02.840
not that many lapses is maybe like 40 or 50 and they have no contact with other

269
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:03.570
human beings.

270
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:08.570
They are barbarians there total 100% complete savages that are living off the

271
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:12.270
land fishing with homemade Netscape.
What do you want them under it?

272
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:14.840
Just like they're controlling themselves who are usually put them under your

273
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.640
thumb.
Yeah.
Well it's,
it's not only that,

274
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:19.820
they won't even go in there to retaliate against murder,

275
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.710
which is fascinating to me.
It's like they're,

276
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:25.970
the anthropologists are so concerned with keeping this intact and studying the

277
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:28.740
civilization in some sort of a way to try to get to see,

278
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.030
I mean this is really not that many lasts like their own country and they were

279
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:36.680
attacked.
Wow.
No,
no.
It's both some cash to board and they just kill the guys.

280
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.080
We talked to him first,
you know what I mean?

281
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:41.980
He might've been a respected member of the community within six months.
You know,

282
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.740
they didn't even give a chance.
Can you help me out?

283
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.680
I run us seems broken and these tales of cannibalism,
but um,

284
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.590
it's hard to substantiate but it's not outside the realm of possibility.

285
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.650
So you might be dealing with cannibals that we uh,

286
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:58.640
allowed to kill people because there so primitive that we don't want to fuck up

287
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:00.890
what they've got because there's only like 40 of them

288
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.300
<v 6>I serve that isn't that interesting cause there is a sentimental instinct in</v>

289
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:08.570
humanity and that wants to preserve everything in everything.

290
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:11.230
All the old hamburger place goes under Armour.
Yeah.

291
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.220
It's like an instinct that people want to do that.

292
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:17.190
And a lot of people say that's like,
you know,
that's part of our humanity is a,

293
00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:22.191
is keeping intact cultures and religions and still be in tact.

294
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:24.900
All these ideas because they,
they,

295
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.920
you can see that with this thing that's emerging,

296
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:33.070
this thing that's emerging is so far is so much bigger than some old desert

297
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.910
religion.
And they'll bigger it gets.
And the more this thing emerges,

298
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.830
the more it's light begins to shine so brightly that all of these silly little

299
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:46.790
superstitious ideas begin to seem increasingly ridiculous.
I mean,

300
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:50.060
our consciousness is becoming so expanded that it's almost like,
you know,

301
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:53.660
we're able to like all of a sudden turn around and see ourselves and I know that

302
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:54.950
sounds almost like it's impossible shape,

303
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:58.010
but like the first time that we can actually do that and we can see ourselves

304
00:16:58.011 --> 00:16:59.000
sort of out of context.

305
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.870
Just like in 1969 when astronauts first took a picture of the earth from the

306
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:04.490
vantage point of space,
I mean,

307
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:07.820
it's literally like the human mind was folding in on itself because how's it

308
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:12.050
possible for a human brain that emerged from the earth to then see the earth,

309
00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:15.710
not from the euro.
You know what I mean?
It's like earth looking at itself.

310
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:18.890
Like that's what was happening because we are like a seed of the planet.

311
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.650
And then we left the planet and turned around and took a picture.

312
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.050
How about the Mindfox of the shots from the voyager?
From orbit?
Oh yeah.

313
00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:30.860
You see Earth as like a pale blue dot.
Dot.
Have you seen

314
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.750
<v 0>God?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Amazing.</v>

315
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.710
They sent something out there and it's still taking pictures of us and it's,

316
00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:40.800
it's so fucking far away that were like a little tiny.
Dot.

317
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.230
And then you get a sense of what this thing really is.

318
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.700
<v 6>Since sanity is insanity,
it doesn't even,</v>

319
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.980
how do you reconcile himself though to that?
Like think

320
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.100
<v 4>about the average person.
How do you accommodate to yourself,</v>

321
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.370
to the idea that everything you know,
the vast expanse,

322
00:17:56.371 --> 00:18:00.090
that repository of experience of your entire life is a blink of a blink of a

323
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:03.770
blink on a grain of a grain,
of a grain,
of a grain.

324
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.460
<v 0>Like instead of turning that way.
I mean,
you don't matter at all.</v>

325
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.940
Why not just enjoy yourself?
You do matter though.
That's not true.

326
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.270
You want it to mean something or want to fly.
No,
it does.

327
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:18.090
It does mean something.
It means something to you right now.
It's tangible.

328
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:20.550
It's real.
It means something that people do.
You're in contact with.

329
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:24.840
There's nothing unreal or unnatural banner because it's temporary,
but oh,

330
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.960
but do you have attachments where you don't have attachment?
When you do,

331
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:30.810
it's natural.
But there's this connection that you have to,

332
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:35.811
this greater gigantic thing doesn't negate the small moments in your life.

333
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.550
Right?
It doesn't negate video games that you enjoy.

334
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.760
It doesn't any gate finding like the perfect porn to jerk off to.

335
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.890
It doesn't negate a sandwich.
You Joy,
give yourself happiness until you're gone.

336
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.150
But I don't agree that it doesn't matter because it does matter.

337
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:55.380
It matters to you right now.
And although that seems ridiculous,

338
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:59.180
so does life itself.
So does every breath you take will hold your breath.
Stupid.

339
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.710
You don't,
you don't think the briefings important.
Hold your breath.

340
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.440
Of course it's important.
Don't be silly.
You're like this.

341
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.360
The existential ideas can overwhelm the reality of the situation and the reality

342
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:12.750
of the situation is you would like to stay alive.
And for the most part it's fun.

343
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.060
Yeah.
You know?
And if it's not fun,
you've managed your right,

344
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.910
your life and correct.

345
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.271
<v 4>Well,
you know,</v>

346
00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:19.270
but you know what's interesting about what you just said is that you know,
you,

347
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.680
you've eloquently stated something that's actually very difficult for most

348
00:19:23.681 --> 00:19:24.880
people to experience.

349
00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:28.360
Most people either have to have like they have to be half asleep,

350
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.100
which means ignore the overwhelming universe and just just be barely present.

351
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:38.150
And then other people are awake to this overwhelming university courses that he

352
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.740
can hear you.
You're talking about him like he's done here.

353
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.500
He's jabbing it red band.
No,
we're not.

354
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:51.070
We're just bringing them in on the conversation.
It's like,
you know,
Albert Kemu,

355
00:19:51.071 --> 00:19:54.550
the existentialists that life should be lived to the point of tears,
right.

356
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.310
Everything has been figured out except how to live,

357
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.540
<v 0>and this is the question is it was in the onions and hot sauce.</v>

358
00:19:59.541 --> 00:20:03.260
It was just a freak like that.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
It was a big misunderstanding.

359
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.490
Onions and hot sauce,
hot sauce aficionado.
And everybody was like,
oh,

360
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:08.480
he's just like really deep.

361
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.230
<v 4>You know how he died?</v>

362
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.550
He had a train ticket that he was going to take a train to get to its

363
00:20:15.551 --> 00:20:18.910
destination as friends are like,
no,
let us drive you.
And he got in an accident.

364
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.120
It's like a bad,
terrible decision.
But go on with the your commute quote.

365
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.990
Cause I loved that day before.

366
00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:29.890
I can't remember my mother died yesterday or it might've been the day before.

367
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:34.640
I can't remember the stranger just disconnected,

368
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.420
completely blew,
like reading it.
And I find it really depressing.

369
00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.980
I guess my whole question is,
okay,

370
00:20:38.981 --> 00:20:42.160
so in the face of an infinite universe with our minds,

371
00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:44.860
we can ponder something close to the infinite.

372
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.860
Yet the irony is that we're housed in these pumping,
breath,

373
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:50.710
gasping to king bodies.
You know,
Ernest Becker wrote the denial of death.

374
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.920
It says we are God's with anuses.
Think of how brilliant that is.

375
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.560
So the idea that we are these transcendent beings,

376
00:20:56.561 --> 00:21:00.160
but every single day we are reminded that we have met at metabolism.
It's funny,

377
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.470
Becker thinks that God doesn't have an anus.

378
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:08.150
How does he know so presumptuous,
but how do you,

379
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.430
how do you reconsider as the only species that can really like lose sleep over

380
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:14.290
the fact that we are mortal beings?
You know,
we,

381
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.520
we can barely sustain the here and now because we know that one day we might be

382
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:19.870
dead.
And so what do we do?

383
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:22.780
Do we just lose ourselves and diversions and sex and drugs?

384
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.540
<v 0>Here's my problem with this whole line of yeah,
here's my problem.</v>

385
00:21:26.541 --> 00:21:29.090
This whole line of thinking.
Yeah,
what does the average person do?

386
00:21:29.091 --> 00:21:32.270
Was He always first to do?
How about turn the question inward and say,

387
00:21:32.271 --> 00:21:33.170
what do you do?

388
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.180
And tell everybody what you do because that's how we figure it out through you

389
00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:41.090
telling me how you're managing it.
I tell you,
but when you start going,

390
00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:43.040
what does the average person to with the reality is we're all the,

391
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.330
we're all the average person.
The average person varies especially,
yeah.

392
00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.310
Yes,
absolutely.
In our significance we are all the average and 100% yeah.

393
00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:56.390
And when someone says it,
all men are created equal.
Not really,
but yes.

394
00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:00.200
Not really in this experience,
but yes.
You know,
there's Einsteins,

395
00:22:00.201 --> 00:22:01.580
just Stephen Hawkings.
There's fucking,

396
00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:03.680
Lou Ferrigno knows there's a lot of weird people in this world,

397
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.900
<v 6>but they're there.
I think there's a responsibility as you,</v>

398
00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:10.901
as technology emerges in science begins to show us the truth of reality.

399
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:15.040
These are responsibilities began to emerge that create ethical dilemmas for our

400
00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:15.621
societies,

401
00:22:15.621 --> 00:22:20.621
which is when you have large swaths of the human population being controlled by

402
00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:26.081
tyrannical fundamentalist religious people who are basing everything they do on

403
00:22:26.811 --> 00:22:30.110
a,
a phantasmo being that clearly doesn't exist.

404
00:22:30.111 --> 00:22:35.090
An outdated rituals that are,
are,
are,
are just rotting.
Galileo,

405
00:22:35.091 --> 00:22:38.660
apologize.
Yes.
What do you do?
Because in those situations,

406
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:41.930
at some point it's like,
well,
you do have a right,

407
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.520
you obviously there's freedom of religion.

408
00:22:43.521 --> 00:22:46.550
You want to give people freedom of religion,
but simultaneously it's like,
well,

409
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.560
but why are you cutting girls?
Cliteracy is off.
You know what I mean?

410
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.960
<v 4>It's almost like,
it's almost like,
you know,
we,
we need an upgrade.
You know,</v>

411
00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:58.961
like religion was a technology that at least informed people with the illusion

412
00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:02.540
of meaning so that they could,
you know,
as I say,

413
00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:04.970
you can live for a week without food,
three days without water,

414
00:23:04.971 --> 00:23:06.380
but not a minute without hope.
You know,

415
00:23:06.381 --> 00:23:09.500
like so that gave us hope and an Ernest Becker says that was the frustration for

416
00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:10.310
a minute.
Yeah.

417
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:14.810
That was the first deliver said that never ate a pot brownie cause this fucking

418
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.643
hours with no hope

419
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:23.470
really had the other side.

420
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.460
You learn what you are doing something well that's interesting.

421
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.690
We talked about Iowaska and DMT,
which as Eric Davis says,

422
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.430
baseline reality dissolves.

423
00:23:31.431 --> 00:23:35.840
There's a complete ego death and a new reality emerges or it just fucks with

424
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:39.500
your visual cortex and you add it all with your ego and your psyche and your

425
00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.270
creativity and you just,

426
00:23:41.271 --> 00:23:44.450
you have the ability to generate images inside the mines eye with your

427
00:23:44.451 --> 00:23:46.130
creativity.
You just create a fucking

428
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.520
<v 0>a world of geometric patterns because that's how your eyeball works when it's</v>

429
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.360
over flooded with too much DMT.
That's how your visual cortex response.

430
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:56.840
What happens when there's 10 times the normal dose in maybe that just like when

431
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:00.350
you have a cut it clots.
Yeah.
But you know,
responds to them.

432
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.870
This is what I always say when people say,

433
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.150
how do you know whether or not a DMT trip is a real,
like what do you know?

434
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:07.130
Like you're pretending like that that really happened.

435
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:09.560
You really did speak with intelligent beings from the planet.

436
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:15.010
The reality is whether or not you really did go to another dimension and speak

437
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:19.430
with these super intelligent beings who are made out of love or whether it

438
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:23.570
didn't happen at all.
Either way,
you experience the same thing.
Right?
Right.
Sure.

439
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.510
You get to hear the message.

440
00:24:24.511 --> 00:24:28.520
You get to see the exact same thing as if it was real.
Like literally,

441
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.840
<v 5>well you know where that was explored brilliantly.</v>

442
00:24:30.841 --> 00:24:32.730
Do you guys remember the movie contact?
Yeah.

443
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.460
So she is a secular scientists.
She doesn't want to hang out with like,
you know,

444
00:24:38.461 --> 00:24:41.100
Matthew mcconaughey who's a priest.
She doesn't believe in guide.
In fact,

445
00:24:41.101 --> 00:24:42.850
at first they try not to see,

446
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.720
but see that's how brilliant of the Matthew mcconahey cock.

447
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.110
Cause even though she didn't want any of that,
he's still fucked.
Her son,

448
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.790
she risk pregnancy ended the movie,

449
00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:58.080
she went right through the warm wool and went to the Saudis alien civilizations

450
00:24:58.081 --> 00:25:01.350
had an experience that sounded like a religious experience except it wasn't,

451
00:25:01.351 --> 00:25:03.650
you know,
she didn't go anywhere.
Well,

452
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.750
from the perspective of earth through the Wormhole,
it just looked like the ship,

453
00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:09.600
just what ran right through.
Right.
So nobody believed her,

454
00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:12.090
but she had the experience so that all of a sudden she was sounding like the

455
00:25:12.091 --> 00:25:14.280
religious people are like the people that were tripping that said they saw the

456
00:25:14.281 --> 00:25:17.640
Alps and all of a sudden she has this scientist was had to cast doubt on her own

457
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:21.810
experience because she,
we evidence you will try DMT.

458
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.510
You know already what that is.
It doesn't just hit.
You were like,
what the fuck?

459
00:25:24.511 --> 00:25:25.830
And your mind just explodes.
You know,

460
00:25:25.831 --> 00:25:29.040
you're taking something so you can make reason of it.
I could totally say like,

461
00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:32.640
well what was it that must be God and let me tell other people about this.
Well,

462
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.580
you know the totally see that

463
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.071
<v 0>Jerusalem,</v>

464
00:25:35.071 --> 00:25:38.550
legitimate scholars now that believe that that's what Moses saw when he saw the

465
00:25:38.551 --> 00:25:43.380
burning Bush did.
He saw the Acacia tree acacia tree,
which is rich and DMT,

466
00:25:43.381 --> 00:25:44.940
and it's really common to that area.

467
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.680
The idea is that this Bush or the extraction of this Bush was burning and that's

468
00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.030
how he had this religious experience.

469
00:25:51.031 --> 00:25:54.730
It's saw God dried a DMT trip and this is like,
this is nice.

470
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.500
I caught a puff of this tree like on fire.
That's one of the theories.

471
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.850
That's just a theory that,

472
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:05.910
but the primary focus is of achieving this theory is that Moses most likely had

473
00:26:06.391 --> 00:26:09.860
a psychedelic experience because we know that these substances are not Nicholas.

474
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.600
He said he got the tablets that God gave him,

475
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.670
but he's smashed him before we got on the hill.

476
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.160
He was mad cause they made the Golden County.

477
00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:19.440
Especially somebody of saw the fucking tablets.
Yeah,

478
00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:24.100
he was tripping as researcher does.
Yeah.
He could have been like,
yeah,

479
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.640
so I smashed it.
All the above,
the evidence,

480
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.360
all the [inaudible] are you talking about a tie?

481
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.160
<v 5>But that's very similar to when Terence Mckenna,</v>

482
00:26:32.161 --> 00:26:35.040
thoughts about the stoned ape hypothesis is obviously,
but there's um,

483
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.630
there's a guy called rich Doyle.

484
00:26:36.631 --> 00:26:40.140
He wrote a book called Darwin's pharmacy and it's about sex plants and the

485
00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:44.070
evolution of the newest fear.
He talks about psychedelic substances,
information

486
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.310
<v 4>technologies that manipulate our ability to capture,
manage attention.</v>

487
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:51.060
So they create what he calls infinite resonance with set and setting.

488
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.570
So in other words,
infinite resonance with set and setting.

489
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.850
That's why when people talk about like psychedelic experiences are like,

490
00:26:56.851 --> 00:26:59.190
make sure you're in a good headspace.
Make sure you're a sense.

491
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.180
Because if you have infinite resonance with set and setting residents like your,

492
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.530
you become completely porous to whatever
Mumbo jumbo,

493
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.780
you no longer have the ability.
It's like turning,

494
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.790
it's like turning up the volume on existence.

495
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.960
Turning up the volume was so loud that if you're in a magnificent place looking

496
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:20.760
at a tree,
you might think you're looking at God.

497
00:27:20.761 --> 00:27:22.320
If you're in an uncomfortable situation,

498
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:25.800
you're going to go down to the pits and a microphone gets too loud and you get

499
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:28.650
feedback.
If you're in a shitty place tripping,

500
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:31.050
you get a fee and that feedback just keeps going.

501
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.440
Or You could be in a beautiful place that elicits feelings of calm and serene,

502
00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:40.420
this and then you can feel like you're like,
oh my God.
Yeah.

503
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.060
<v 0>[inaudible] shrimp festival.
It's going to be the real happy shrimp fest.</v>

504
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.630
This guy.
That's going to be the real problem.

505
00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:48.680
When people are able to decide what state of consciousness they experience at

506
00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:49.490
that moment,

507
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.940
not even her by being so scared that you take mushrooms because every time I'm

508
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.270
taking mushrooms I've been scared.

509
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.450
Should be you're about to go through some change.
Yeah.
It gets scary.

510
00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.770
Why eat a pop quiz control?
When I,
when I eat the last [inaudible] pod cookie,

511
00:28:00.771 --> 00:28:04.670
I'm like,
Oh shit,
that's happened my feet.

512
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.780
<v 4>Why did I do?
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's true.
Now is that,
is that,
why is that?</v>

513
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:11.820
Because it's like if you think of the metaphor of skydiving,

514
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:13.020
it's the moment we've already jumped

515
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.240
<v 0>that there's an accelerating process of self development that we all go through.</v>

516
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.630
Yeah.
And then if we are not improving as a human being,
we feel shitty.

517
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.410
We don't feel good.
I don't feel good unless I'm getting my shit together.

518
00:28:26.411 --> 00:28:27.750
That's just a fact.
Um,

519
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.820
I try to be a better person today than I was yesterday for real.

520
00:28:30.821 --> 00:28:31.840
And it sounds stupid,

521
00:28:31.841 --> 00:28:36.010
but it's because everybody says it and very few people like legitimately totally

522
00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:37.720
practice it.
They fall in and out.

523
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.410
But I feel like that's also one of the reasons why people aren't that happy.

524
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.020
I feel like if you not like improving yourself and,

525
00:28:44.021 --> 00:28:46.840
and getting rid of your bullshit in life,

526
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.920
it's very difficult to feel good.
It's very difficult to be enjoying it.

527
00:28:50.921 --> 00:28:54.820
If you have all these issues that you're not dealing with like a you as a
person,

528
00:28:54.821 --> 00:28:56.380
are you with your job or you,

529
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.380
you know more and more people talking about it when they say like,

530
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.720
and I know I've been bad at that and I'm actually trying to get,

531
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.260
trying to make a note to not be like that anymore.
He's telling the truth.

532
00:29:05.261 --> 00:29:07.030
I mean it's not a process where you know,

533
00:29:07.031 --> 00:29:08.700
you either get it right or you don't get it right.

534
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.810
Like some people fall back and forth.
I mean,

535
00:29:10.811 --> 00:29:13.200
how many people do we know that used to drink and then drank again and stop

536
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.160
drinking for a long time and then,
you know,

537
00:29:15.161 --> 00:29:16.820
it's like a little battle sometimes with,

538
00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:18.790
with people to try to improve their shit.

539
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.900
<v 4>Ron doss compares it to floating in the ocean and your head's bobbing up and</v>

540
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:27.720
down.
Sometimes you see the shore and sometimes you don't.
That's what it's like.

541
00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:29.430
It's like sometimes you're there and you see it,

542
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.120
but you can't beat yourself up when you go down.

543
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.770
You have to have faith that you'll come back out.

544
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.200
But what you're saying is dead on man,
because if I'm feeling like shit,

545
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.530
it is what you're saying.
It's not some broad big thing you've got to do.

546
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.860
If I'm feeling like Shit,

547
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.360
nine times out of 10 it's just because I've got dishes in the sink or I didn't

548
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:50.460
go jogging or I didn't like sweet my kitchen.
It's not like big that.

549
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.270
But that would be like an example of set and setting right there.

550
00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:54.610
I know other people say that,
you know,

551
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:57.400
99% of your problems will go away if you get a good night's sleep.

552
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.670
Like in terms of a lot of them do.
Yeah.

553
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.820
<v 2>Where are we are sometimes,
you know,
even when you're sleeping,</v>

554
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.920
you're thinking about things and you put them into perspective.
Yeah.
I mean,

555
00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:07.500
how many times you've been really upset when you go to bed and by the time the

556
00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:10.650
night over you're like,
yeah,
whatever.
Oh,
right.
You let it go.

557
00:30:10.651 --> 00:30:14.880
Sleep on regulating your emotions a he lost or something,

558
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:18.670
something that happened.
Like,
I'm sure before you make the phone call,

559
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:21.720
don't worry about this because you've had a few instances where,
um,

560
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.440
like the amazing racist stuff like lost you gigs

561
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:32.610
in London,
Ontario.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's gotta be frustrating.

562
00:30:32.611 --> 00:30:35.070
It's frustrating.
How do you let go of that?
Like when you,

563
00:30:35.071 --> 00:30:37.430
when you're dealing with something like that,
hey,
how do you let go of that?
Well,

564
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.430
sometimes you just like,
I,
I stopped myself.
I go stop.
Hold on.
Ken.

565
00:30:41.431 --> 00:30:46.140
Griping about this,
change it in any way.
No.
All right.
All right.
Move on.

566
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.870
<v 4>Moment of dialogue with yourself in a decision.</v>

567
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.720
<v 2>Yeah.
If I'm,
if I'm,
if I'm in a,
uh,</v>

568
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:55.160
a long line at the airport and I'm gonna Miss My flight and I'm like,
I'll come.

569
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.150
I keep looking up ahead.
I'm like,
are you going to go to the front and asked,
hey,

570
00:30:58.151 --> 00:31:00.180
I'm about to miss my flight or you're not,
if you're not,

571
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.400
stop griping and just let it wash over you.

572
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.020
<v 4>I have a friend who was starting a company.</v>

573
00:31:04.021 --> 00:31:06.480
He wants to create a watch that regulates emotion.

574
00:31:06.481 --> 00:31:07.920
Because we were talking about like creating,

575
00:31:07.921 --> 00:31:10.170
if you were talking about the age of the quantified self,

576
00:31:10.171 --> 00:31:12.590
where we're going to have all these devices that are going to be what emotion

577
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:16.710
that measures emotion.
If you're annoyed,

578
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.760
well it's not going to tell other people,
it'll tell you.
So we will send a code,

579
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:24.770
it will measure your biofeedback rhythms and it'll give you feedback to tell you

580
00:31:24.871 --> 00:31:28.470
how you're feeling so that then you can change your behavior if that's what

581
00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:29.304
needs to be done.

582
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:33.210
Feedback loops seems to be the best way to reprogram reflex responses.

583
00:31:33.211 --> 00:31:36.750
Like they're saying that the best way to stop people from doing speeding is not

584
00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:38.070
from like actually pulling them over,

585
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.530
but it's from those sensors that say your speed,

586
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.210
I'll tell you that as you pass him by receiving feedback is the best way to

587
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.260
change behavior.

588
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.310
So in terms of like moving towards experience design and the age of the

589
00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:52.440
quantified self is if you know you're eating something unhealthy,

590
00:31:52.441 --> 00:31:53.131
maybe you won't eat it.

591
00:31:53.131 --> 00:31:55.950
If you're constantly reminded that you're feeling what you're doing,

592
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.570
you can really kind of improve yourself.

593
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.080
Like technologically enhanced mindfulness is what that is because it's like how

594
00:32:03.841 --> 00:32:08.120
often are you wandering around in a state of absolute terror pretending

595
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:12.060
everything's fine.
Yeah,
totally fine having a great day,
but inside you're like,

596
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.920
oh fuck,
I don't make enough money.
I'm not going to make rent.

597
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.440
But you're pretending to be happy.

598
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.790
If you have a watch that's a bolt that's flashing,
like you're terrified,

599
00:32:20.791 --> 00:32:24.000
you're tense right now,
you are tense.
Talk about it.
Deal with it.

600
00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.430
<v 2>The most important things that uh,</v>

601
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.560
anybody could ever understand in this life is what happens and what it feels

602
00:32:30.561 --> 00:32:33.620
like when you're out of debt.
You know,
cause how many of us,

603
00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:37.250
how many of us hangs on your time or 20 whatever the fuck we are.

604
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.010
We have so much money.
We can't pay off

605
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.510
<v 0>credit cards last week.
Pay Off my college loans.
Oh,
congratulations.</v>

606
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.900
39 and that crazy.

607
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.640
What a crazy society we have that like everybody by the time they're 30 years

608
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:51.310
old isn't some kind of debt unless you're

609
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.420
<v 4>super rich.
Out of a lot of uh,
education debt,
right.</v>

610
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.050
A lot of education that's going to change with technological

611
00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.270
medical debt.
That too.

612
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.040
Those are two systems that definitely need an upgrade.

613
00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:08.770
I mean this is what we can actually connect that to.

614
00:33:08.771 --> 00:33:10.260
The idea is that Ray Kurzweil is talking about,

615
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.880
he's saying that healthcare is about to undergo the same transformation that

616
00:33:12.881 --> 00:33:16.000
information technology went through so that means that the whole idea of how

617
00:33:16.001 --> 00:33:18.100
people you know cure themselves or fixed diseases,

618
00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:20.560
this is all going to become like something that's a part of our smartphone and

619
00:33:20.561 --> 00:33:23.550
part of our day to day life so it's going to change that broken system of health

620
00:33:23.551 --> 00:33:27.160
care and education.
Also education through the Internet free education,

621
00:33:27.161 --> 00:33:29.710
people around the world coming online in the global conversation,

622
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.580
getting free education.

623
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.690
There's a Harvard professor who's offering all those classes online.
Yeah,

624
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.980
exactly.
Yeah.

625
00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:38.770
It's only the beginning of that and you have these in the power of decentralized

626
00:33:38.771 --> 00:33:41.560
peer networks that can be leveraged to solve all these problems.

627
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:44.200
You know Steve's office,
Steve,
what does that mean?
Decentralized peer.

628
00:33:44.201 --> 00:33:46.060
Now it's the same thing that we talked about.

629
00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:49.180
Self Organization and emergence when like cells link up together and become

630
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.710
organisms.

631
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.470
So you haven't spoken to have electronic self organization happening like with

632
00:33:53.471 --> 00:33:54.910
social media,
like when spontaneous,

633
00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.020
when there's leaderless protests that just spontaneously self organized and

634
00:33:59.021 --> 00:34:01.930
these technologies are allowing these decentralized peer networks don't have

635
00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:05.620
leaders and don't have a head on cut cutoff potentially something like that.

636
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.360
But so Steven Johnson's book,

637
00:34:07.361 --> 00:34:10.630
future perfect talks about how those can be leveraged to like solve problems.

638
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.690
You know like cure diseases,
like leverage

639
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.990
lies pure now

640
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.620
<v 6>term because I think one of the big fucking problems is the need that people</v>

641
00:34:20.621 --> 00:34:23.800
have to claim responsibility for innovation.
And this is,

642
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.390
this is one of the horrors of our age is that that thing which makes people get

643
00:34:28.391 --> 00:34:31.330
rich is what motivates people.
People aren't motivated.

644
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:33.580
Like when people are trying to cure cancer,

645
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.520
you like to believe that the reason they're trying to cure cancer is out of some

646
00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:41.050
kind of altruism desire until you see them going to the supreme court to try to

647
00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.420
patent genes because they want to profit off of their research.
Yeah,

648
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.610
that's pretty weird,
right?
It seems like the PR,

649
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.110
the ideas should be the the dream.

650
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:50.581
<v 4>I know,</v>

651
00:34:50.581 --> 00:34:54.390
but that's why Pfizer is giving the researchers the money to research it so that

652
00:34:54.391 --> 00:34:57.410
eventually they'll give you a little bit show return on that investment.
Right.

653
00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.760
It's just a straight,
and you know what the real real

654
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.160
<v 0>problem with all of it is that it's not psychedelic.</v>

655
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.630
What's the real problem is that you can make money and create things and,

656
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.240
but you have to have a psychedelic mindset in order for society to move forward,

657
00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:13.510
like emotionally or put a little behind a friendship wise.

658
00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:15.280
Like if it's not doing that,

659
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:18.370
then it's going to get caught up in the ones and zeros collecting the numbers.

660
00:35:18.371 --> 00:35:22.480
It can be prosperous and still be ethical.
It's just,
it's not.

661
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.680
And the reason why it's not as,
because the,
this,
when you have a corporation,

662
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.620
like you get that diffusion of responsibility thing going on,

663
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.270
which is the opposite of what psychedelic.
Yes,
absolutely.
Exactly man.

664
00:35:34.271 --> 00:35:38.130
It's where the individual has no responsibility for the mass of individuals,

665
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.990
<v 2>whereas the psychedelic experience,
massive individuals is connected entirely.</v>

666
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.880
Yeah.
Joshua tree on Sunday.
Tell me what you're going to do this on.

667
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.020
Let me guess.
I think you're,
you're probably going to do your taxes.

668
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.670
You can get through mushrooms under the supermoon.

669
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.730
Get your freak on and they're super moon on Sunday,
Sunday night,

670
00:35:56.731 --> 00:36:00.370
middle of shrimp fest and tell you something son.
When you do mushrooms supermom

671
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:02.950
no,
none.

672
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.040
Supermoon when you do mushrooms and you realize that there is a fucking planet,

673
00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:13.161
one quarter of the size of ours and it's literally for loading above our heads

674
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:21.330
tent hotel room
out in Joshua.
Yeah.
I've never been there too.

675
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.340
She'll be cool.
Dunkin,
what are you getting buddy?

676
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.120
I'm talking about beer.
Try One of these black Butte porters there.

677
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.000
She lish.
Yeah.
Delicious.

678
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.790
I tried to check in with that 23 year old recently.

679
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.550
Those people that's straight out of college,
they're in training,

680
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.840
damn shots around like it's nothing.

681
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.980
And I'm barfing in the street and they're still going.
They don't grow food.

682
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:49.080
I can't,
yeah,
you're live results on,
it's almost over.
Have you ever had,
um,

683
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.310
Eric Davis on the show?

684
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.990
Eric Davis just wrote a book called Tech Gnosis then I think you guys would
love,

685
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.700
yeah,
he kind of writes about the mystical undertones of technology.

686
00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:03.540
So again,
like the whole psychedelic cybernetics thing,

687
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.350
and I just,
I don't know.
I wondered if you guys ever had,
because he no,

688
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.890
never heard of him.
Yeah.
Now I know.
I've got this book guys.
Boom.
Sounds good.

689
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:14.160
It sounds like this perfect stuff right up my alley.
Yeah.
Yeah.

690
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:15.630
There's so many people like that now.
Thank you,
sir.

691
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.760
That's the beautiful thing about this time.
It's like,
you know,

692
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:21.630
every day there's some new guy who's got a new video or a new song or a new
fuck.

693
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.380
There's so many fucking pieces of something that are being created,

694
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:29.040
whether it's jokes,
more comedians now than ever access to all of it,

695
00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.930
but there's also an infinite amount of content.

696
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.120
How do you decide what to pay attention to it?
That's one of the really hard,

697
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.680
well that's one of the things anxiety.

698
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.890
Well that's the beauty of something like a death squad where like,
you know what,

699
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.360
which was the stupid nickname and we all call ourselves like you know that if

700
00:37:42.361 --> 00:37:45.420
Ari tells you someone's funny,
he's not going to be lying about it.
Right.

701
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.800
You know people that aren't funny.
No.
Yeah,
but that's good.

702
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:52.710
You've already tells me to watch some guy I know.
He's really funny.

703
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:54.720
So the audience knows that too.

704
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.700
And that's sorta like the beauty of having like a bunch of people that have a

705
00:37:58.701 --> 00:38:01.470
likeminded.
You tune in and we're all different.

706
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:05.340
Like there's a lot of people that would hate our humor.
All right.

707
00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:07.860
And the last thing they want to do is be hanging around with us and they're not

708
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:12.150
wrong.
They're just not into it.
They have a different thing,
you know what I mean?

709
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.880
But you find your thing,
whatever it is,
you know,

710
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:19.560
when there's Johnny Cash or Taylor Swift,
you fucking follow it.
And then,

711
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:21.060
you know,
whatever connected to her.

712
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.310
I mean those people are gonna find it for you.
Yeah.

713
00:38:23.311 --> 00:38:26.220
I think that's how you do it in today's Day and age.
It's like,

714
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:30.900
and that's the beauty of us being able to introduce people like Bert Kreischer

715
00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:35.740
or anybody else that we brought onto our podcast that all sudden other people

716
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:39.550
and go,
oh,
that guy's really funny.
Like,
oh,
and he's friends with this guy.
Oh,

717
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:40.480
that guy's really funny too.

718
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:44.650
And then people discovered was this was,

719
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:48.160
this was one of the biggest thing that has ever I ever did because my gas dude,

720
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.150
it's amazing.
It's been a year later and I still get people saying,

721
00:38:51.151 --> 00:38:53.110
you like to come back and hang out with you guys and have a main drag,

722
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:55.270
which has been amazing.
Well,
it's a two way street though,

723
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:57.220
because the whole reason why the podcast is,

724
00:38:57.221 --> 00:39:00.390
is interesting is because people like you are interested in coming on.
You know?

725
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.110
If you only had to just me talking after awhile,

726
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.320
I'd be repeating stories like a motherfucker.

727
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.870
I just be spouting nonsense at this point.

728
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:10.220
But you know what's interesting about what you're saying?

729
00:39:10.221 --> 00:39:13.420
You know there's a book that talks about the importance of an information diet.

730
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:13.660
You know,

731
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.200
because we live in a world now where there is like an infinite amount of content

732
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:17.561
out there,

733
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:21.550
more than 10,000 hours of video uploaded to youtube every hour or some crazy

734
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:22.301
number like that.

735
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:27.301
And so the most difficult thing I think becomes deciding who we're going to be.

736
00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:31.510
Your information diet filters,
like in this case,
the death squad,

737
00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:36.070
the peer networks that you are connected to the people you follow.
Brian Writer,

738
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.490
by the way,
Brian Redman one is

739
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.140
leaving us everybody.
So he's got to go do a nice house show.

740
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.620
When is your new shirt coming out?
Preorders should be up next week.

741
00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:55.030
So next two weeks or so.
My favorite of all time,
it's,
it's a head and shoulders.

742
00:39:55.031 --> 00:39:56.980
It's awesome.
And the other one is awesome too.

743
00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.260
But this new one is on another level.
It's dope.
I want it.
I want it.

744
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.670
I want a pair of underwear on it.

745
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.550
I want a pair of underwear with that on Jesus Christ.
Fuck Dude.

746
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.580
I work cloth off over my Dick.
That's how I got on that pie cast show.

747
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.990
Jason,
what kind of car do you drive?
Dude?
Oh,
that was the,

748
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.810
I don't have a car anymore because one of those mother fuckers,
I'm in New York.

749
00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.450
I used to have one here in New York.
You don't,
you don't drive cars.
I mean,

750
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:29.290
when I lived here,
I had a car.
I wanted to ask you about that Tesla.
Oh,
oh my God.

751
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:31.900
Is that the coolest thing of all times of incredible and they're only gonna get

752
00:40:31.901 --> 00:40:32.171
better.

753
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:34.540
I think there were about to release like the third or fourth generation now.

754
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.280
Martine Rothblatt had one and when I interviewed her and I got to meet her robot

755
00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:42.130
Bina 48.
Yeah.
You ever seen that?
Her know for spouses,

756
00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:46.990
a robot chicken broth bought fascinating story was a man was a man,

757
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.840
uh,
founded Sirius satellite radio,
got a sex change,

758
00:40:49.841 --> 00:40:54.841
became a woman and then created a robot that is a direct copy,

759
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:59.290
a duplicate of her spouse.
We'd be,
how good is spouse?

760
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.460
Well there she's there too.
She's there as well,
the bear.

761
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.790
So she made a robot for that.
So sweet.
Yeah.
It's interesting.

762
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:11.410
Liberace making that guy a,
his face to him.
Whoa,
you really do that.

763
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.910
They don't get plastic surgery to look more like Liberace.
That's hilarious.

764
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.190
He really is out in that the HBO thing,

765
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.000
I always wondered why Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were willing to do that and

766
00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:23.770
like they have pictures of those two blowing each other.

767
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.970
That's the only thing that makes sense.
They agreed to do it.

768
00:41:26.971 --> 00:41:30.760
Look like if they came up to you and you were,
you were mad when they said,

769
00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:33.070
hey listen man,
I know those Bourne identity movies,

770
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.040
they were really big and blah,

771
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.010
<v 0>blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Listen,
you're going to play Liberace cheese.</v>

772
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.450
But buddy made for TV.
Yeah.
TV,

773
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.210
Liberace,
his longtime lover.
But it's very offensive,
by the way,

774
00:41:47.211 --> 00:41:49.820
to my gay friends,
and I apologize,
but pirate,

775
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.450
you guys are so immature.
I mean,

776
00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:57.590
if you said that a girl was your vagina,
pal does,
that'd be rude.

777
00:41:57.591 --> 00:41:58.810
But Jain of power,
you know,

778
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.380
it just be embarrassed isn't interesting that a girl can call a Guy Dick and

779
00:42:03.381 --> 00:42:07.760
there's no repercussions at all.
There aren't in my heart.
And she can even say a,

780
00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:10.280
I'm hearing good.
Get some good Jason Silva,
Dick.

781
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.720
And you wouldn't have any problem with that.
You'd be like,
Yep,

782
00:42:12.721 --> 00:42:16.010
I'm dishing it out,
honey.
But if a guy says,
oh,

783
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:18.710
I'm here to get some sweet Mary Pussy,
she'd be like,
what the fuck?

784
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.460
It's cause of the keepers.
That's who I am.
I'm sweet Mary Pussy.

785
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.730
You don't think that's gross?
And you're like,
oh my God,
you're not really,

786
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:28.250
my friend.
Can't even joke around with you.

787
00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.540
<v 4>Jason,
what do you think's gonna Happen with these checks?
Android's,</v>

788
00:42:31.541 --> 00:42:33.930
what do you see as the future?
Well,
I think,
I think,

789
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.870
I think the sex does sex technology will probably be the pioneer.

790
00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:39.790
I mean just like with porn,
the porn industry,

791
00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:41.860
Pioneer Dvds when DVDs were first a thing,

792
00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:45.030
who do you think was doing the most advanced?
Like multi-angle interactive?

793
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.440
The experiences was the point of this.

794
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.470
I said phones wasn't going to go with that old style of video.

795
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.140
All the porn was like,
cool,
we'll have to,
yeah,
exactly.

796
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:55.420
I never did the rest of them totally.

797
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.240
I mean we're always going to be driven by sort of our sexual desires.

798
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.600
Kurzweil says we'll be able to tap into each other's nervous systems and become

799
00:43:01.601 --> 00:43:04.060
each other when we have sex with a girl.

800
00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:07.480
Finding with someone like imagine actually merges.
Well,
but no,

801
00:43:07.481 --> 00:43:08.261
but some people say,

802
00:43:08.261 --> 00:43:10.840
you know that come a suture talks about we've been wanting to merge with our

803
00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:12.880
lovers.
It's the beginning of time.
I want to become one.

804
00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:15.730
But imagine if we can actually scramble our nervous systems together because we

805
00:43:15.731 --> 00:43:18.160
had an engine and demolition man device or whatever.

806
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.350
That can be a real mind fuck though.

807
00:43:20.351 --> 00:43:25.240
If you just find out that you are like the worst in bed ever to be fucked by

808
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:29.810
you.
Shit,
look at me.
I'm this og,

809
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.980
why am I doing?

810
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.410
<v 0>Wow,
that's going to be for 16 be</v>

811
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.270
even better.
Take it.
I don't like it.

812
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:45.890
Take it over.
Like why am I choking myself?

813
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.290
I won't you let me breathe me.
Or even worse.
What if she get into her mind?

814
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:54.770
Like if you can access your girlfriend's needs and desires and you got,

815
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:59.030
I want to know what you want and you get into,
it's just a river of black cock,

816
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.100
sleepy river of disembodied black cops just shooting,

817
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.250
shooting sperm like a,
like a psychadelic dream.

818
00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:11.150
You're binding a river of dark black coffee,
black caucus,

819
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:13.420
slippery red

820
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.170
<v 4>bull.
Cox Do allow for a lot of creativity in sort of our,
our,</v>

821
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:19.870
our sexual consciousness,
you know,

822
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.360
was on the side that's going ahead with a multiplicity of dimensions and we

823
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:28.361
can't even imagine it's the black psychedelic causation of sexualities that

824
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:32.160
every,
that drives most a lot of our technology lately,
but we still

825
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.530
<v 5>have to repress it.
Societaly sex.
Well,</v>

826
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.340
I think that still has to be like looked on as embarrassing reproductive force.

827
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:41.930
It's the drive.
It's the wind in the sails of humanity.
It's dre.
It drives me.

828
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:45.720
What's that?
But as you guys know this,
there was actually like a book about this.

829
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:47.010
It's called the mating mind.

830
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:50.400
It was written by Geoffrey Miller and he says that the brain's extraordinary

831
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:52.830
capacities for creativity,
for discourse,

832
00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:56.700
for everything we do even build airplanes and iPhones is ultimately are

833
00:44:56.701 --> 00:45:00.630
glorified version of the peacock feather.
It's our version of the song.

834
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:04.740
It's just us charming to capture and manage the attention to those potential

835
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:06.780
mates.
It's a way of saying I'm poetic,

836
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.000
I built that skyscraper or I wrote you the sows,

837
00:45:09.001 --> 00:45:11.520
every joke and we comedians ever told everything.

838
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.480
What's interesting is that this side,

839
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.950
the side effect of this sexual creativity is also responsible for everything

840
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:18.360
wonderful we've created.

841
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:23.160
So it talks about thinking about sexuality ultimately as a creative act it is

842
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:27.240
cause it's about reproduction but ultimately on a cultural level and on a idea

843
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:31.590
sex level,
like the whole fucking thing about reproduction seems to be like,

844
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.220
all right,
we used that thing.
We're getting lured by nature and to making babies,

845
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:38.830
but now we see where being lured by nature and to making spaceships.

846
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.070
Singularity is a cosmic orgasm is the best way to describe what the singularity

847
00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:49.370
is.
It's like universe waking up.
It's up.
It's awesome.

848
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.620
Impregnating the University of Intelligent McLuhan quote,

849
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:57.150
human beings are the sex organs of the machine world.
Wow.
Brilliant.

850
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:58.110
That's brilliant.

851
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.900
Marshall McLuhan nailed that shit in the sixth to the machine world,

852
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:02.790
like the machines are controlling our computers.

853
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.420
He figured that out before computers.
It was this actual genius.

854
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:09.910
He also said we build the tools.
Then they billed us.
Think about it.

855
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.410
That's happening.
That's true.
Of course it's happening again.
Much like Davinci.

856
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.380
What a mind.
Fuck.
It must've been to be operating like that back in the,

857
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.530
you know it's eventually also did he figured out how to draw curves,

858
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:24.090
how to draw a rounded edges and art like no one knew how to like make it like so

859
00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:27.870
you have to catch it.
It's like to go around and loses frame.

860
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.110
You know how like a path I'll go until he was the one who,

861
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.240
I don't know if I remember from high school

862
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:38.650
and whatever that's attributed to him along those lines.
It was a good guy.

863
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.240
He put in his hours

864
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.610
because it's like,
well,

865
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:48.660
what aren't we doing now that will have like for grand,

866
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:50.190
we'll take for granted in a hundred years?

867
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.780
What do you mean didn't they didn't walk through walls
for time?

868
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.880
Yeah.
What a strange world it must have been back then,
man,

869
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.840
when you could just die if you got sick.
Most people just died.

870
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.540
They thought 50% children.
Completely.
And most people I know,

871
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.730
and there's a lot of people though today that think that the things are getting

872
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:12.840
worse in the world,

873
00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:15.330
which is another one of those like mistakes that people are living longer than

874
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:16.470
ever.
We're living longer than ever.

875
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.020
And there's a guy called Hans Rosling who has these amazing videos on the

876
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:22.110
Internet that show every nation in the world by every measurable indicator of

877
00:47:22.111 --> 00:47:25.410
quality of life has been measurable last a hundred years.
No,

878
00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:29.040
but it just shows that,
you know,
contrary to what the media in which it bleeds,

879
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.100
it leads feeds us

880
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.530
<v 1>because we have these overactive fear based Amygdala.</v>

881
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:34.210
They only pay attention to what's wrong.

882
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.490
We failed to see everything that's going right.

883
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:41.020
<v 0>Phasing Shit.
Really hot.
Newscasters telling you horrible things.</v>

884
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.580
She's got big tits and I'm scared out of their mind.

885
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.150
My Dick is hard and I'm ready to run.
Like everything is together.
Yeah.

886
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.690
So rude.
You know.

887
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.570
Show me some of the ugly to propel you to tell me some bad news.

888
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:58.960
Tell it's like get my high school team or switch them in when they go.

889
00:47:58.961 --> 00:48:02.070
And this is just an a puppy found alive and healthy.
Ah,

890
00:48:02.071 --> 00:48:05.010
and then the big tits come out at a party.
Yeah.

891
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.060
<v 1>But you could tell a lot about bill O'Reilly.</v>

892
00:48:07.061 --> 00:48:11.180
Like I promise you that Bill O'reilly loves getting tied up.
I can,

893
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:15.100
I can't say that for sure.
Like whatever legal stuff is I guess.

894
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:19.030
But I would imagine bill O'Reilly,
cause he's always like an honest show.

895
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:21.430
It's always these like beautiful,

896
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:24.700
yet dominating hot girls that surround him.

897
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:28.420
Like he likes to be around these types of girls.
He,
yeah,
he loves it.

898
00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.140
He never see that the women around him on that show is being like submissive to

899
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:35.770
them.
They're always kind of tough guaranteed.
They scrub him down.

900
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:37.530
When you think about this email she wrote from down,

901
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.940
what are you thinking about bill O'Reilly all the time?

902
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.360
Do you imagine ever that you were some really fucking stupid guy like bill

903
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:47.560
O'Reilly,
a smart,
stupid guy.
He's a Harvard graduate dummy.
You know,

904
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:49.570
he's one of those guys.
I'm going to go with Jesus.

905
00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:52.630
What did he say his thing about Jesus,
he's like,
Jesus,

906
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:56.050
I'm going to go with the Jesus.
Why is the tide come in?
Why does it go out?
Oh,

907
00:48:56.051 --> 00:49:00.130
that Dawkins interview in doc and they'll look at that smile on Dawkins face.

908
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:05.110
It's a smile of the Lord of the rings.
Necromancer as he's crushing just like a,

909
00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:06.520
a little emperor,
something.

910
00:49:06.521 --> 00:49:09.270
It was just this like the look on his face because he's like

911
00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:13.550
<v 0>Dunkin's though from my tastes gets a little too upset.
What's that?</v>

912
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.150
Yes.
For my,

913
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.670
for I don't have my super genius atheist,

914
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:23.780
reasonable people talking to cuco heads.
I like my,
uh,

915
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.000
my atheist to be a little bit more relaxed.

916
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.050
<v 1>I think it,
I think it was a great reaction.</v>

917
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.070
Shot him as Dawkins has got.

918
00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:37.630
He's a little on the county side or smile like oh Riley deserves a co for sure.

919
00:49:37.631 --> 00:49:38.470
Don't get me wrong.

920
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:43.360
<v 0>But I think that Dawkins,
uh,
at his age is,
is such a statesmen,</v>

921
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.650
such a,
a well respected is probably showing off too.
I am maybe perhaps,

922
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:51.100
and maybe also he feels it's his duty to maybe merciful,
you know,

923
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:55.420
to mercenary go after those guys cause he is the intellectual voice for the

924
00:49:55.421 --> 00:49:59.380
atheist.
You know,
he's super important in that way.
I just wish she would chill.

925
00:49:59.500 --> 00:49:59.801
And you know,

926
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:03.430
one of the things that I found out about him is no psychedelic drugs in his back

927
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:09.690
and he talked about how he maybe would be interested in taking LSD under egg,

928
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:13.540
very clinical setting to explore the merit to that drug.

929
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:16.180
You know what that says to me?
That's,
that's where the hole is.

930
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:19.270
That's where the holes in his game.
That's why it comes off country.
Because

931
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.200
<v 1>another one of our atheist you for Sam Harris,</v>

932
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.640
he has done psychedelics.

933
00:50:24.641 --> 00:50:28.160
In fact he wrote an essay called psychedelics in the meaning of life,
which

934
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.230
<v 2>was actually a very brilliant piece.
And for,
you know,</v>

935
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:32.060
he's an interesting guy because he's an atheist,

936
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:35.210
but he has some radical insights about like,
you know,
spiritual,

937
00:50:35.211 --> 00:50:38.600
subjective experience and where are things that come from Islamophobia.

938
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:43.810
I don't find that his writing comes across that way.
People argued that it does.

939
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:47.410
Uh,
he's a brilliant man and a friend.
I really like.
Yeah,
I very much.
Yeah.
Um,

940
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.250
and I really enjoyed talking to him because it's got such a fucking stupid smart

941
00:50:52.251 --> 00:50:57.050
mind.
His brain is like firing like a brilliant million hurts.

942
00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:00.170
Oh yeah.
But the,
the,
the thing about the,
uh,

943
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:02.390
the label of Islamophobe is like,

944
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:08.080
the reality is all ideologies that force people into doing violent things are

945
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:13.130
crazy and try to pretend that they're not to make some people who aren't violent

946
00:51:13.131 --> 00:51:16.040
happy seems like intellectually dishonest.

947
00:51:16.041 --> 00:51:20.570
And that's where the guy has has courage.
It's not Islamophobe.
Not at all.

948
00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:23.900
He says Islam was Buddhism.
Okay.
Thinking about Buddhism,
and by the way,

949
00:51:23.901 --> 00:51:25.550
this is a radical new sector of Buddhism.

950
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:29.750
Apparently that's like involved in like ethnic cleansing and so don't know what

951
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.580
you're talking about.
Oh,
they're fucking up Buddhism.

952
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:35.030
Like it's the last safe place after being a Mormon,
you know,

953
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:38.140
go to [inaudible] fault.
But I mean,

954
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:42.050
apparently it's Malaysia humans.
Humans are imperfect man.

955
00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:44.060
I think it's something like that.
I don't really remember where it was,

956
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:46.460
but humans are so imperfect.
You know?

957
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:51.560
Th the I the idea that there's anything wrong with saying that ancient

958
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:56.360
ideologies that involve killing people if they don't believe her fucking bad.

959
00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.550
Doesn't it say that somewhere?
Yeah.

960
00:51:58.551 --> 00:52:01.340
We of course tell you you can't be tolerant of intolerance.
I mean,

961
00:52:01.341 --> 00:52:05.030
that's the problem with moral relativism and we have this fear of like passing

962
00:52:05.031 --> 00:52:07.550
any kind of judgment.
It's a different religion.

963
00:52:07.551 --> 00:52:10.070
So what if they beat each other to death,

964
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:14.990
but don't let someone do something against someone's will to the hundred
percent.

965
00:52:14.991 --> 00:52:16.130
You can't tolerate it.

966
00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.440
Tolerance and behavior like that obviously isn't tolerance.

967
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:20.910
That's where the buck stops.
Bill Maher has spoken about this a lot of,

968
00:52:20.911 --> 00:52:23.660
you know what's weird though?
Here's what's weird said.
Bill Maher.

969
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.810
Bill Maher gets labeled as in his Llama.
Phobe,

970
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:32.050
which I find fascinating because progressive's for some reason it's almost like

971
00:52:32.421 --> 00:52:35.240
they're bullied.
So they want to make friends with the bully.

972
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:39.620
So there's this weird progressive thing where you don't criticize Islam and if

973
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:43.850
you do,
you become an Islamophobe.
Or if someone's criticizing other religions,

974
00:52:43.851 --> 00:52:45.200
that's the first thing that they say.
Oh,

975
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:47.660
she criticize you never criticized Islam.

976
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.520
How come you never say shit about Islam?
So it becomes this weird sort of,

977
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.200
because they're so gangster,
you know,

978
00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:56.090
they'll kill you if you draw pictures of Mohammed,

979
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.510
they take shit to the next level.
So the,

980
00:52:59.511 --> 00:53:02.780
the natural inclination of the biggest pussy,
he's on earth,

981
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:06.440
which are the liberals for the most part.
They not only let them do it,

982
00:53:06.441 --> 00:53:11.300
but support them.
You're Islamophobic.
You know Bill Martin is Islamophobe.

983
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.420
Guess what you should be.
You believe a phobe,

984
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.270
whether it's Ufo shows or big macabre is or Islam or

985
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.070
because you're against them raping little boys believe thing that you haven't

986
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.230
<v 0>seen yourself are watched on TV.
You're an idiot.</v>

987
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.030
<v 6>Well,
this is the thing,
Joe.
This is a thing.</v>

988
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.010
This is the thing you were talking about earlier when it,

989
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:35.160
and when it comes to the DMT experience of the psychedelic experience,

990
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:39.300
and the question is,
does it matter if this is real or not?
And I think it,

991
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.660
I think it matters more than anything.
If it's real,
we must,

992
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.460
we must understand reality from subjective reality.

993
00:53:47.461 --> 00:53:51.830
We must understand if we can,
we should try to understand that.
For example,
um,

994
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.670
who was it?
I can't remember.
It was,
it was

995
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.420
<v 5>only when it affects someone else.
It doesn't matter because it's,</v>

996
00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.680
<v 0>it's the same experience,</v>

997
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:05.080
but the experience is not a tangible rock solid carbon based touch,

998
00:54:05.201 --> 00:54:09.580
a table experience.
The experience is this spiritual with the,

999
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:10.960
which I fucking hate to use,

1000
00:54:10.961 --> 00:54:13.240
but there's no other way to use a disembodied consciousness.

1001
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.310
It's a disembodied consciousness experience.

1002
00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:18.370
Why would that be the same as an experience that's real?

1003
00:54:18.371 --> 00:54:19.340
That where you can touch pain.

1004
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.250
<v 6>Here's why.
Here's why.
If you take,
let's take,
I can't wear,</v>

1005
00:54:23.251 --> 00:54:26.060
where does that people go to get healed?
Lords,
I think is what it's called.

1006
00:54:26.061 --> 00:54:30.690
But the water where,
I can't remember who wrote this,

1007
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:33.120
I think it might've been Sagan or no,
it might've been fine man.

1008
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:33.930
I can't remember which one.

1009
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:38.930
Talking about how it's important to understand if this phenomenon is real or

1010
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:41.460
subjective because cause if it's real,

1011
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.430
then that means that we should understand what are the properties of these

1012
00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:47.130
waters.
Is it something in the land?
Is it's something in the air.

1013
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:50.790
And if we can understand that,
then we can help the whole planet with us.

1014
00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:55.350
And the same way if the DMT or the psychedelic experience is taking us into a

1015
00:54:55.351 --> 00:54:58.260
state that is non subjective,
that is external,

1016
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.200
is actually introducing us to entities or intelligence,

1017
00:55:01.201 --> 00:55:04.050
is that somehow exist outside of our own species.

1018
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:08.850
It's incredibly important to begin to communicate with them.
And our real way,

1019
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:09.713
if it is

1020
00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:12.640
<v 0>what is real,</v>

1021
00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:16.960
that's where it becomes when you're talking about an outside of the body

1022
00:55:16.961 --> 00:55:20.050
experience,
uh,
an experience that transcends the physical flesh.

1023
00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:24.220
It could still be real,
but not be measurable.
It could still be real,

1024
00:55:24.221 --> 00:55:25.800
but you can't put it in a bucket and throw it on us.

1025
00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:27.680
<v 5>It's not measurable.
I mean it's not really,</v>

1026
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.750
I think it could be a chemical gateway.

1027
00:55:29.751 --> 00:55:32.020
It could be something that we don't have an instrument to measure.

1028
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.260
You don't have a conceptual framework understanding it's still real if it

1029
00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:38.860
happens.
That's one of my point is the idea of the imagination.

1030
00:55:38.861 --> 00:55:39.880
You imagine something,

1031
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.630
the imagination is responsible for every fucking thing that a human has ever

1032
00:55:43.631 --> 00:55:47.170
made.
Sure.
Close this microphone that I'm talking to you,

1033
00:55:47.171 --> 00:55:50.200
this computer that I'm on is closing them.
Wearing the car that drove me here.

1034
00:55:50.201 --> 00:55:54.550
It's all manifest out of the imagination.
So imagination is fucking really shit.

1035
00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:59.500
100% and before you created those things,
when you just imagine them,

1036
00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:03.610
you were conjuring up something that didn't exist and the fact that we then

1037
00:56:03.611 --> 00:56:06.580
brought it into existence proofs,
well at at least existed as a potentiality.

1038
00:56:06.581 --> 00:56:09.760
Yeah.
It was allowed by the laws of physics.
So then it makes you wonder,

1039
00:56:09.761 --> 00:56:12.970
what are you tapping into when you were having that kind of vision,

1040
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:16.330
that disembodied,
you know reconceptualization of reality.

1041
00:56:16.331 --> 00:56:19.900
We live in a world where there is no airplanes and you think that you could

1042
00:56:19.901 --> 00:56:24.490
build a machine that will fly over the ocean and get you to this other place.

1043
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:29.490
<v 1>Like to imagine that [inaudible] even fantasize about we can utter it means that</v>

1044
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:33.320
it's possible.
I mean,

1045
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.130
does anybody even know how cell phones work?

1046
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:41.150
But when you explain to me how a cell phone works,
look at stuff,
I dunno.

1047
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:47.160
They swiped the card.
The card didn't card.
Wasn't Roddenberry though,
wasn't he?

1048
00:56:47.161 --> 00:56:51.550
I think he did that and then died.
Oh,
poor guy.
Yeah.
Well you had to predict,

1049
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:54.860
but he didn't get to see the future.
I didn't get to say this way.

1050
00:56:54.861 --> 00:56:57.880
It's not on your rails motherfuckers.
I just think that if something,

1051
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:02.650
if I think we should be mourning Roddenberry's likely there was a deep space,

1052
00:57:02.651 --> 00:57:06.670
nine,
he never saw the new Battlestar Galactica,

1053
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:11.300
which is lucky.
Kicked his show.
Right.
And the,
Oh yeah.

1054
00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:16.330
I was going say was our track is so shit compared to Battlestar Galactica.

1055
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.320
I never watched the problem you have every time you thinking like,
oh,

1056
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:24.340
they're doing,
this is lame.
Within two seasons.
It'll pay off and be like,
oh,

1057
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:29.910
Battlestar Galactica on the Scifi channel was the greatest Scifi show

1058
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:33.490
dealt with in a real way.

1059
00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:37.520
Real life situations say with game of Thrones has whores,
you know murder up.

1060
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:39.320
By the way,
how hot is that robot pitch?

1061
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:44.580
The blonde one and one of the hottest I've take it burned holes in socks.

1062
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.720
Oh,
the cylons.
The cylons become hot chicks.

1063
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:51.790
That's part of the plot.

1064
00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.750
I don't want to spoiler spoiler alert if you haven't seen the DVD series,

1065
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:59.020
you got to get that it right now.
It's incredulous.

1066
00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:01.360
Brian Kaplan told me about that.
I'm like,
that's going to suck dude.

1067
00:58:01.361 --> 00:58:05.730
It's a remake of a show.
That was kind of Hokey.
This show is not hokey at all.

1068
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.850
All seriousness man,
because you're one of the busiest people I know.

1069
00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:15.360
How do you find time to watch Battlestar GALACTICA and breaking bad and game of

1070
00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:19.860
Thrones?
Like right now I don't have hardly any time.
Right?

1071
00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:21.970
He's already watched all star.
It was a long time ago.

1072
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.150
You know when I was just doing like fear factor in the UFC,

1073
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:28.090
I had way more time back in the days of breaking bad.
It just started.

1074
00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.930
Things were different back then while getting tattooed.

1075
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.230
I watched like the first season while getting my left arm down,

1076
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:41.020
right arm held my right arm.
I'm trying to catch up.
I'm breaking bad.

1077
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:44.410
I fucking love it.
It's great.
So good.
You have to catch better.

1078
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.940
Talk about it with homeland.
I heard that.
Was that watch season one?
It was.

1079
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:52.660
I'm up to season two stunningly good.
Stunningly.

1080
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:55.840
What'd you guys think of walking dead?
It's awesome and sucks.

1081
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:58.040
It's the same shit.

1082
00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:02.890
Every time they resolve a conflict over the way they describe their emotions.

1083
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.990
This gun,
it's all done.
The Guy,
the spoiler,
spoiler alert,
the bad guy,

1084
00:59:07.991 --> 00:59:10.090
the number one bad guy in the third season come.

1085
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:14.350
You guys are teetering on the edge of fucking this whole thing up.

1086
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.290
You need to regroup,
get together as a group of writers,

1087
00:59:17.291 --> 00:59:20.220
do some mushrooms and figured out where the fuck are you going.
You told me that,

1088
00:59:20.221 --> 00:59:22.000
that they had this other writers and they've

1089
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.350
<v 4>got really emotional for awhile and then they came in as said,
guys,</v>

1090
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:27.320
everybody get the fuck out and they hired like legit like action guys.

1091
00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:31.460
Here's the problem.
I think the problem is TV,
not the riders.

1092
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:35.450
It's what TV tends to do to creativity.
If you read the comics,

1093
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.490
the comics are some of the most bleak,

1094
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:42.820
horrific things that you've ever seen where it's like every few pages is a gut

1095
00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:44.660
punch where you're like,
what the fuck?

1096
00:59:44.661 --> 00:59:48.260
It's not like this like emotional kind of sappy thing.

1097
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:52.180
It's like you are existing in a world where you're going,

1098
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:56.210
you are going to die probably eaten by the on deck.
Yeah,

1099
00:59:56.211 --> 00:59:57.380
that's what I was in apocalypse.

1100
00:59:57.381 --> 01:00:01.880
That was what was so what are you saying about that versus the world of TV?

1101
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:06.140
Like I'm saying what happened because TV is like,
oh,
we can't make it too dark.

1102
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:10.310
We can't kill that character because he was an established business model and we

1103
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:12.010
have to keep some kind of stability in the system.

1104
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.670
Stuff this up does make you a question to homicide.
Homicide.

1105
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.330
Didn't last because it's,

1106
01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:19.140
I didn't have any clear cut victories for the good guys and bad guys.

1107
01:00:19.141 --> 01:00:22.210
I'm going to do a spoiler.
Is that why they call it programming?
Let me do it.
Not,

1108
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:25.160
not win the series,
but with the comic books.
Can I do a spoiler?

1109
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.570
Spoiler the comic books don't spoiler spoiler alert.

1110
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:33.770
Spoiler alert boiler.
It's a spoiler to me and I'm not going to read the comics.

1111
01:00:33.771 --> 01:00:37.470
How dare you?
I,
you know,
listen to this fast.

1112
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:40.670
I had comics on my iPad once on a plane

1113
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.460
<v 1>mercilessly</v>

1114
01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.930
about the fact that I know why.
You know,
I can go,
well,
you responded,

1115
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.170
you responded.
I'm like,
Oh,
I got him dancing.

1116
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.740
A bear man.

1117
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.020
Thought of myself as a twin.
Yeah,

1118
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:10.000
you

1119
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.550
<v 4>were.
You were fucking dancing over the road.</v>

1120
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:16.960
That's pretty fucking,
you might as well just get punched in the face.

1121
01:01:16.961 --> 01:01:21.910
Just get kicked in the stomach.
I had to regroup for about a year also.
Also,
uh,

1122
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.030
uh,
this is what movies sent me in the depression.
Where that anything,
which one?

1123
01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.450
Revolutionary Road.
What's that guy's brilliant dude.
Oh my God.

1124
01:01:29.451 --> 01:01:31.990
With DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.
And it was about,

1125
01:01:31.991 --> 01:01:35.860
it's about a married couple and it flashes back and forth between the banality

1126
01:01:35.861 --> 01:01:36.581
of day to day life.

1127
01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:39.370
Like what happens after you get what you want versus the hopes and dreams of

1128
01:01:39.371 --> 01:01:41.980
when they first met and then

1129
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.160
read about the bushes.

1130
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.780
It made you collide against,

1131
01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:54.930
against frustrated ambitions and a life of having to settle and settle and

1132
01:01:55.631 --> 01:01:59.900
settle and settle in to become a stale facsimile of what you find your dreams.

1133
01:01:59.901 --> 01:02:03.950
After that,
when they get excited about Paris is the best part of it.

1134
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.040
You're just like,
Oh yes,
they're gonna move to Paris.
It's going to be a man,

1135
01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:11.670
Richard Linklater Foam.
They're going to be in Europe.
You know,
it doesn't happen.

1136
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.870
Yes,
it's going to be awesome for you guys.
Get into it.
I want to give a report.

1137
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.010
I'm going to report on what you've been looking on the laptop

1138
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.940
<v 1>during this thing.
Okay.</v>

1139
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:25.970
It's now gone from a series of videos of like weird vintage cars.

1140
01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:27.310
Porsches.

1141
01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.810
At one point he was just looking at what he called an accelerometer or you're

1142
01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:35.220
just looking at like a car accelerator.
Like the pedometer accelerating.

1143
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:38.640
That was like five minutes.
You're building a car,

1144
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:41.700
speeding and now you're looking at plot.
I don't know if you know this Dunkin,

1145
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:42.534
but I'm crazy.

1146
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.580
I'm looking at people playing pool.

1147
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:52.610
I have an add that you couldn't publish class and I need no rhyme or rhythm to

1148
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:56.130
it.
I need 13 different things going on with the drums of war pigs.

1149
01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.900
I have no sense.
I am what I am son.
Do you want to see it a two minute,

1150
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.650
a two minute trippy video?
Yeah,
it's a new video says we are already,

1151
01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:07.800
cyborgs is kind of about the stuff from the conference we were just at,

1152
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.460
let's pass that joint around before

1153
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:18.520
Chad.
Thank you.
Oh yeah.

1154
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.750
We live in a world of abundance.
Yes,

1155
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:28.500
thanks Joanna Studios,
the new Roman Empire for weed.
Fuck Dude.

1156
01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:33.060
We're more like vomitorium.
Did you ever go to one of those?
Uh,

1157
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:34.440
vomitorium they exist.

1158
01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:38.550
They just showed the old ones and like in Israel they show you where you'd have

1159
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:42.330
to go to vomit and they come right back to partying and they left out the part

1160
01:03:42.331 --> 01:03:44.310
about fucking kids.
But I'm like,
I don't,

1161
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:49.710
what's it vomitorium and party and drink.
Just keep going and going.

1162
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:52.080
He's like,
oh,
I can't eat anymore.
You know,
that moment was that kid anymore.

1163
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.160
You go to this room,
we just get to vomit and then come back.

1164
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.260
It's like a urinal,

1165
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.040
but instead of peeing you're just vomit out as much as you can have the booze

1166
01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.400
and the food and you go back to drinking and eating.
Yeah.

1167
01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.720
The Romans supposedly did it with feathers.
That was the,
the,
you know,
really

1168
01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:15.450
Romans wanting to party so hard that they were willing to just eat as much as

1169
01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:18.390
they want it to and then throw up so they could eat again.
The way it's cough,

1170
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:20.730
things of living forever.
They thought of partying forever.

1171
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:25.800
Well it's also because mortality was such a high level back ever.

1172
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:30.270
Presence and mortality is 50% people were dying left and right.
And sword fights.

1173
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:34.140
I mean it was,
that was some crazy ass times.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1174
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:37.980
But how much different is that different shit.

1175
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:42.390
Emergency,
like set up a free tee shirt.

1176
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.153
Oh is it?

1177
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.380
Let's say higher primate Dotcom shirt available at [inaudible] dot com there are

1178
01:04:51.381 --> 01:04:52.780
also great for mop it up.
Spill.

1179
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:58.630
You can mop up booze room wash right off those salt crystals are great man.

1180
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.150
I gotta get some of those.
They're cool.
If you want to Bang Yoga teachers,

1181
01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.420
if you had a house and it was totally set up like a,

1182
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:13.350
like you were like sot nom come into my presence.

1183
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:18.010
You had a home on the wall and like these are your bed dude.

1184
01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:22.570
You're in and all you need is like some quote from some really obscure Indian

1185
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:24.880
guy on the wall.
Like,
oh,
he's my guru.

1186
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:27.310
I just know a video of Dunkin playing behind the boat.
Oh,

1187
01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:29.260
Duncan gets to start singing my apartment.

1188
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:36.040
I'm ascribing his apartment to a tape.
I'm trying to fuck with them.
My stuff.

1189
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:40.910
I can get accident,
sing them songs.
You could sing you,

1190
01:05:40.911 --> 01:05:44.250
you have chance in your head.
Oh God.
Give me another one.

1191
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:47.180
<v 6>The,
when I'm chanting right now is a,</v>

1192
01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:52.490
it's a great chant because it sounds exactly the way a nitrous oxide sounds when

1193
01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:55.420
you do nitrous oxide.
If you chant it long enough,

1194
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.420
it's the sound of Om when you get super high,

1195
01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:01.960
and so the Chan has our am Rom.
It's simple.

1196
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:03.620
So the chant just goes,
yeah,

1197
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.090
<v 7>rum,
rum,
rum,
rum,
rum,
rum,</v>

1198
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.700
rum,
rum,
rum,
rum,
rum,
rum.

1199
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:20.060
<v 1>You're hearing the old myths that your hearing is your brain cells committing</v>

1200
01:06:20.061 --> 01:06:24.860
suicide by swim,
you're hearing your dance,
your hearing,

1201
01:06:24.861 --> 01:06:29.060
your brain cells tap dancing give you like brain damage or just a short amount

1202
01:06:29.061 --> 01:06:33.710
of time.
I'm pretty sure sweat.
It's the same thing to give you.

1203
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.650
I'm pretty sure going to the dentist is not good.
You're right about that,

1204
01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:37.900
but that's

1205
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:41.380
<v 6>pull great chance that you could do it anytime.
Oh,
wrong,
wrong.</v>

1206
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:45.240
<v 1>Do that.
Crazy.
When you have memorized.
That's what I'm talking about.</v>

1207
01:06:45.241 --> 01:06:47.640
You know that whole,
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1208
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:51.840
<v 6>That's a chant that goes a</v>

1209
01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:58.480
[inaudible] extra and Tommy not decimate your,

1210
01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.120
you gotta have an ma.
She just,
Tonya,
I'm on obesity.

1211
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:07.370
[inaudible] everybody to calm day.

1212
01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.570
I'm sure you could road show your top it all come along,

1213
01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:10.710
I'm sure eager to invite.
And I have,

1214
01:07:10.711 --> 01:07:14.480
I'm Josh Reed with palms created a ta so I do not going to Tommy Tom Tom saw to

1215
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:18.510
be,
but be Tom said Shit.
Do you still do that thing where you put the business?

1216
01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.310
I lost that way.
That's amazing.

1217
01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.950
That's a chance that you say at the beginning you would,

1218
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.890
you might pray a fewer into Bhakti Yoga.
You are prayed that into you,

1219
01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.540
your pray that prior to reading the Bhagavad Gita.
And that's a prayer that is,

1220
01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:36.490
um,
basically,
uh,
you were,
um,
the,
the first verse is very beautiful.

1221
01:07:36.491 --> 01:07:40.030
It goes,
I was born to the darkest of ignorance,

1222
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.170
but my spiritual master opened my eyes with a torch of knowledge,

1223
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.100
which I love that I love.
But it's like basically the idea is like,
um,

1224
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.860
when you come into contact with truth,

1225
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.300
which is what any of the sutures are by the way,
that I love the bug of,
I get it.

1226
01:07:54.301 --> 01:07:56.740
But I just started reading the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,

1227
01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:58.990
which are fucking great man.

1228
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:01.480
They blow the Bhagavad Gita out of the water as far as I'm,

1229
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:04.860
you can find a pretentious at all.
What the,
the second thing,

1230
01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:09.430
<v 1>I forgot it.
Sorry.
Yes,</v>

1231
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:15.320
<v 6>I think it can seem pretentious and I think that people can use it as a tail</v>

1232
01:08:15.321 --> 01:08:16.280
feather as you mentioned.

1233
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.600
<v 1>And I will fully admit that I've used it as a tail feather a before,</v>

1234
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:23.720
but I think in the same way that you were talking about how like reproduction

1235
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:28.550
kind of lures you into creating robots or advances society in the same way.

1236
01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:31.910
I think people get drawn to philosophy for reasons that are just like,
well,

1237
01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:34.700
this will make me seem smart.
And then he,
uh,
on the one hand,

1238
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:39.680
but also the tail feathers.
Yeah,
don't worry about it in other people.

1239
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:44.330
But what's crazy about this stuff is that once you get into it for weird
reasons,

1240
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:48.440
but once you get into it,
then it starts,
it starts deconstructing you.

1241
01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:53.030
It starts breaking you apart because it's going to this very micro level of the

1242
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:55.670
way that we tend to work subjectively,
which is what,

1243
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:59.010
<v 4>but that's an objective experience.
There's only thing that ultimately matters,</v>

1244
01:08:59.011 --> 01:09:03.000
you know,
in terms of your interior world,
right?
I mean,
you,
you talk about truth,

1245
01:09:03.150 --> 01:09:06.270
I think it was Verner Hertzog documentary film maker that was talking about the

1246
01:09:06.271 --> 01:09:10.100
difference between Ecstatic Truth and factual truth.
And he said,
you know,

1247
01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.450
if facts where the most interesting thing in the world,

1248
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.090
then the phone book would be the world's most interesting book.

1249
01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.690
But obviously there's this other experience that we still called truth.

1250
01:09:18.691 --> 01:09:21.540
Maybe it's italicized or whatever it is,
but it's that ecstatic truth.

1251
01:09:21.541 --> 01:09:24.900
It's subjective truth.
It's the truth of the poet.
You know,

1252
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.890
the journalist may be more accurate in describing the facts of an event,

1253
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.020
but a poet may never brought deep and found the way to overcome the spurs.

1254
01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:34.681
Whatever it is.

1255
01:09:34.681 --> 01:09:38.400
The poet would reveal deeper truths if final place in the other's literal grids.

1256
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:42.180
<v 1>Well,
this is the Werner Herzog something interesting cat.
Very interesting.
Oh,</v>

1257
01:09:42.181 --> 01:09:45.270
I fucking love it,
man.
I just saw him in spring break.
Oh wait,
no,

1258
01:09:45.271 --> 01:09:48.650
not spring breakers.
What I seen when he played a villain,
no,
Jack reacher,
yeah,

1259
01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:53.520
he was great,
but it wasn't a weird mills.
It's got that mill guy.

1260
01:09:53.521 --> 01:09:57.450
He's a good actor.
It's a great actor.
Which is weird.
Yeah.
I love Verner Herzog,

1261
01:09:57.451 --> 01:09:57.931
man.
He's the,

1262
01:09:57.931 --> 01:10:02.010
she would really love to get him off the record to give his opinion on grizzly

1263
01:10:02.011 --> 01:10:06.240
man.
Whether or not he knew that he was making a comedy.
He knew,

1264
01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:08.550
he knows no Verner Herzog knows he's making comedy.

1265
01:10:08.551 --> 01:10:12.360
Cause then all of his documentaries is an element of comedy and mocking the

1266
01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:16.320
person that she is smart enough to know what the person watching his movie,

1267
01:10:16.321 --> 01:10:19.560
his thinking.
And he knows when he,
when he does this stuff,

1268
01:10:19.561 --> 01:10:22.850
he knows that we are thinking this has got to be a comic Verner Herzog.

1269
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:26.340
It's hilarious that if that's the case and cynical in that sense,

1270
01:10:26.341 --> 01:10:30.270
then that might be grizzly man might be the greatest creation of comedy.

1271
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.700
Real subtle.
It's a wonderful comedy.

1272
01:10:32.701 --> 01:10:37.320
So subtle and so goddamn brilliantly crazy.
It's so,
it's wonderful.

1273
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:40.830
It like celebrates people and all our wackiness and there's like a certain

1274
01:10:40.831 --> 01:10:45.830
comfort in watching a film about a guy who was completely off the rails that's

1275
01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.410
living with grizzlies.
Yeah.
Like it is.
We,
you know,
we might not like it,

1276
01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.970
but it makes us feel better about ourselves,
man.
And we,

1277
01:10:51.971 --> 01:10:55.530
we got a guy who's way more fucked up than us and makes us feel better about

1278
01:10:55.531 --> 01:10:55.910
ourselves.

1279
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:59.180
<v 4>Did,
but did you find them also kind of fascinating because I,
fuck,
yeah,</v>

1280
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.610
it was actually fascinating because that's the thing about when you watch a

1281
01:11:01.611 --> 01:11:01.881
movie,

1282
01:11:01.881 --> 01:11:04.130
I mean part of what happens when you're watching a movie is the same thing.

1283
01:11:04.131 --> 01:11:07.670
They don't rem when people,
when they,
they done an MRI scans on people.

1284
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:08.710
When they watch movies and they say it,

1285
01:11:08.711 --> 01:11:11.480
it's very similar to when you're dreaming.
So the self,

1286
01:11:11.481 --> 01:11:14.190
that kind of the self awareness disappears.
And so that's

1287
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.650
<v 6>why you're able to like become the character that you identify with.</v>

1288
01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:19.500
They call it the didactic shift when you assumed the viewpoint of one of the

1289
01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:21.390
characters.
So you watch a film like grizzly man,

1290
01:11:21.391 --> 01:11:24.750
it allows you to actually enter the consciousness perhaps with this person.

1291
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:27.150
And that's what the whole thing about cinema,
it allows us to do.

1292
01:11:27.151 --> 01:11:30.180
That's why I feel like that might be fascinating for the shift.
Again,

1293
01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.980
dialectic shift,
love that term man.

1294
01:11:32.981 --> 01:11:35.490
Because enlightenment is the ultimate shift,

1295
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:37.380
which is where you do the didactic shift.

1296
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:39.510
You assume the viewpoint of the whole to the whole.

1297
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:43.800
That's the idea is like we are always on the precipice of this final shift.

1298
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:47.070
You are terrified to make that shift because we want to be an individual.

1299
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:48.610
And the idea of going backwards,

1300
01:11:48.611 --> 01:11:52.050
that one time of taking off the neurological VR goggles,

1301
01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:56.630
the sociological VR goggles,
the consensus trends,
that cultural operating system,

1302
01:11:56.631 --> 01:12:01.631
you don't want it easier to become another person in the movie than it is to

1303
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:06.690
become the whole training.
It makes my heart race.
It's terrifying,

1304
01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:07.380
but it's,
I would,

1305
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.860
the reason I did it is because I love movies a lot since I was a little kid.

1306
01:12:10.861 --> 01:12:14.130
I would watch movies and one of the coolest experiences that you became Indiana

1307
01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:17.490
Jones,
like for two hours know Indiana Jones.
We're finding the right.

1308
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:18.780
So what is happening?

1309
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:22.320
Like how come sometimes you become the movie and other times you don't and when

1310
01:12:22.321 --> 01:12:25.230
you don't like life sucks,
right?
Right.
Like,
Oh,
I'm watching this movie.

1311
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:28.920
It's not sucking me in.
And I wanted to study that and they say that,
you know,

1312
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:33.921
movie watching and dreaming or strangely familiar exists faintly familiar

1313
01:12:34.381 --> 01:12:36.000
experiences,
similar experiences,

1314
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:38.520
but apparently it has to do with your self awareness.

1315
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.110
The lateral prefrontal Cortex,

1316
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:42.570
the same thing that turns off when people are in flow states,

1317
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:43.920
when rappers or freestyle,

1318
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.220
the self editing this self consciousness disappears and we love transcending our

1319
01:12:49.221 --> 01:12:52.560
self consciousness because it's the moment in which we see that there's an

1320
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:54.780
infinite amount of subjective experiences that we can have.

1321
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.620
We can be Indiana Jones,
we can be,
you know,
anybody we want,
you know,

1322
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.000
we're not bound by our individuated state,
which has amazing as it is.

1323
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:03.750
It's still limited.

1324
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:06.600
Is that lateral prefrontal frontal cortex that you're talking about?

1325
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:11.220
Is that the neo cortex?
It is that in like as the neo cortex?
I have no idea.

1326
01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:13.890
It's the,
it says lateral,
so I imagine it's on this side,

1327
01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.020
but this is the reason I saw this as,

1328
01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:18.850
because it was talking about it in the article about movies and you blurring,

1329
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.280
blending into the films.

1330
01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:23.820
But also another article was talking about flow states and when they did Fmri

1331
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.150
Scans on freestyle rappers verses memorized and it was like the same thing.

1332
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.860
But this is a terrifying thing for people.

1333
01:13:28.861 --> 01:13:30.360
That flow state that you're talking about.

1334
01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:35.660
If you have identified yourself with a level of suffering or with a level of

1335
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:40.200
control or with a level of always being the thing driving the car in this flow

1336
01:13:40.201 --> 01:13:43.650
state,
you're talking about as a form of death,
you don't want to be there.

1337
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:48.000
A lot of people,
the people who are stuck in bad are the ones who are,
uh,

1338
01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:50.190
the most wanting to be in control.

1339
01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:54.850
The people who have the most awful marijuana trips are always the control
freaks.

1340
01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:57.181
But think about it,

1341
01:13:57.181 --> 01:14:00.750
the reason that movies are so good at is because first they sit you in a really

1342
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:05.100
comfortable place.
It's a comfortable seat.
You're in the dark,
the phones are off.

1343
01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:08.250
They make sure that you are comfortable so that they can ease you in.

1344
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:10.860
And when the movie starts,
you're still yourself.
You're still fidgeting,

1345
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:12.700
you have to pee.
But as soon as it starts,

1346
01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:16.720
they guide you with music and the set and setting informed the direction that

1347
01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:19.270
your consciousness is going.
And before you know what you're on a ride,

1348
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.050
like the roller coaster has started and all of a sudden you forget yourself,

1349
01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:26.920
you are the source.
And then at the end of the day it becomes the most,

1350
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.130
the best experience ever,
right?
Because when the great movies done,
you're like,

1351
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.920
wow,
that was awesome.
I don't know where I went,
but I loved it.
Right?
Right.

1352
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.650
But when the movie sucks,
it was a really unpleasant experience.

1353
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.040
So we'd love losing ourselves,
but it's also what we were most terrified of.

1354
01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:42.130
So this is the idea that when we die,

1355
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:46.420
the exact same experience happens where you're like,
holy shit,

1356
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.820
maybe that was fucking amazing.
I thought I was

1357
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:56.170
maybe hitting right.
Well,
maybe it's just an extended period of dreaming.

1358
01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:01.240
Maybe it's a movie where the doors becomes a dream state of 80 years.

1359
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:04.780
That's why the movie inception is still brilliant when they go into limbo.

1360
01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:09.670
Limbo was 80 years aren't in life to be one of those limos that we forgot that

1361
01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:12.500
we decided to go to sleep.
We could be in the dream with the dream.

1362
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.840
Didn't really lock me in.

1363
01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:17.680
I don't know why you should have been more high when you saw it.
Oh,
maybe.
No,

1364
01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:20.950
I wasn't understood.
Inception was,
I think inception.
I was a,

1365
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:25.210
was a little like Wah.
It was a little too or find it was a little,

1366
01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:26.980
you had to follow it a little too close.

1367
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.970
He's a little too much and he was explaining it to you.
Makes cube or something.

1368
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.030
I'm sure you liked.
I'm sure your mind likes that.
I like,
you know,

1369
01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:38.290
it wasn't like the Matrix,
which is sort of a more of a visceral thing,

1370
01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:40.810
but it's still,
they're both pointing to the same idea,

1371
01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:43.630
which is that whatever your experience of reality is,

1372
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.790
may in fact just be a dream state or some kind of hallucination or an aspect of

1373
01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:51.400
a simulation that you've become absorbed.
You know,

1374
01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:54.130
it's interesting you mentioned that because I actually brought

1375
01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:58.200
<v 2>something to read to you guys about the Matrix,
so I'm going to load it up.</v>

1376
01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.690
Oh cool.
And it's exactly about this conversation we're having.

1377
01:16:00.691 --> 01:16:03.240
It's almost like I thought at some point we're going to start talking about

1378
01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.600
blending into movies and breaking the ego and that whole thing.

1379
01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.270
So I'm just going to load that up.
Killing the person that,
uh,

1380
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.360
the brothers had made the majors do.
Remember that the whole time she lost.

1381
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.380
Then she really,
there was a settlement.
Maybe there was a settlement.
Yeah,

1382
01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.270
I think I remember that.
Yeah.

1383
01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.950
That never means anything does it right sometimes means you didn't want your

1384
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.510
lower back.
You're just bored of dealing with it.
Sometimes it's fast.

1385
01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:28.830
You're going to win.
How about we just stop this right now?

1386
01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.480
Sometimes it's that too.
It's different things.
You never saw them never,
you know,

1387
01:16:33.481 --> 01:16:36.690
maybe she had an original idea and they took,
they took it to a different place,

1388
01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:39.930
but maybe they can trace the origin for that idea to get the fuck out of here.

1389
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:45.290
Who is this?
There was a woman who sued the brother or brothers.

1390
01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:50.650
Brothers.
Siblings.
Yeah.
Boy Alerts.

1391
01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:53.850
Lame Larson.
You're just going from memory on that.

1392
01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.740
That'd be great if you've got it right.

1393
01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.490
Why won't the story about Sophia Stewart in their bone Matrix Matrix?

1394
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:05.550
Let's hear it.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me read you this while you search for that.

1395
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.590
So this is article by Eric Davis and he's talking about Descartes and the and

1396
01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.100
the fee

1397
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.130
<v 5>and the false reality genre of filmmaking.</v>

1398
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.390
So films that reveal a crack in your reality,

1399
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:18.170
the possibility of a hidden door of a rabbit hole to fall through.

1400
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:21.680
And so he says we do you know that scene in the matrix when he's in the hotel

1401
01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:23.720
room and they are about to give him the pill?
Yes.
Okay.

1402
01:17:23.721 --> 01:17:26.750
That's the craziest part of the movie.
So he says,
we too are in debt,

1403
01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:30.440
decrepit hotel room with Laurence Fishburne is Morpheus who is really speaking

1404
01:17:30.441 --> 01:17:35.060
to us when he addresses neo.
The ever wouldn't canneries.
You know something.

1405
01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.750
What you know you can't explain,
but you feel it.
You've felt it your whole life.

1406
01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:42.110
You felt that something is wrong with the world,
you don't know what,

1407
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:45.620
but it's like they're like a splinter in your mind.
And establishing that itch,

1408
01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:47.720
which I suppose most of us share,

1409
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:50.570
however we interpreted Morpheus offers to scratch.

1410
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:53.630
He will give Neil nothing more than knowledge of the truth.

1411
01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:57.020
I he no solutions to the problems posed by said truth.

1412
01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.440
And then it goes on and he says like a serpent in the garden of Eden,
which uh,

1413
01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:06.470
which,
okay,
so hello.
Morpheus offers neo a pill like a,
like,
uh,

1414
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.160
like the serpent in the garden of Eden.
Morpheus offers neo a pill.
Neo of course,

1415
01:18:10.161 --> 01:18:11.930
swallows the molecular package,

1416
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:16.160
which is really the most heroic act in the film for Neo must then pass his own

1417
01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:20.990
car Tz and passage through madness melting into the mirror that alludes not only

1418
01:18:20.991 --> 01:18:25.460
to Lewis Carroll but to the mystic psychotic collapse and disappearance of the

1419
01:18:25.461 --> 01:18:30.461
externalized ego that stabilizes our inner voice as neo phases out of the

1420
01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:34.280
matrix.
He opens up however briefly the fractured Bartow.

1421
01:18:34.281 --> 01:18:38.060
That is the secret thrill of every fan of the false reality genre,

1422
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:40.730
the moment when baseline reality dissolves.

1423
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.560
But no new reality has yet emerged and it's pixelating wait.
Okay,
cool.

1424
01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.270
That's great man.
I mean the fact that Eric Davis reads this deeply,
Phil,

1425
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:53.690
that's why you guys got to chat with,
yeah,
so let's listen to the store.

1426
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:58.610
Tell the case she was dismissed when she failed to show up for a preliminary

1427
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:01.490
hearing of her case.
So that can mean one of two things.

1428
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:05.800
You don't even mean she's crazy or they paid her to not show up.
No,
they,

1429
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:09.170
she would just like,
no,
they made a settlement with her off the record.

1430
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:12.860
I think they don't just not show up and scare the shit out of her.

1431
01:19:12.861 --> 01:19:15.560
And I told her not to show up.
Something happened.
She didn't show up.

1432
01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:19.490
I think maybe she had no case at all and she was just,

1433
01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:24.720
<v 1>I just realized because crazy lawyer.
Oh,
that's right.
The angels.
God God.</v>

1434
01:19:24.721 --> 01:19:27.570
Yeah.
I was his lawyer.
He,
I had to go.
I had to get a lawyer to go to court.

1435
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.340
How long were you in court with that thing?
But a year.
Are you kidding?
Yeah.

1436
01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.540
How many times or no,
you are good to keep responding to keep responding to them.

1437
01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:40.590
He sued me for being a false prophet and no,
no,
I'm sorry.
He wanted us,

1438
01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:45.570
he wanted us to point.
Yeah.
And it,
and uh,
uh,
being a bad lawyer,
um,

1439
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:50.010
and the better business bureau came after me.
So you lost the case?
No,

1440
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:55.230
this girl Lisa helped me fight the case and had to show her he was suing me for,

1441
01:19:55.410 --> 01:19:57.570
um,
all the riches in the world.

1442
01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.540
And then when they,
when the,
she had to read it to the judge,
like,

1443
01:20:03.541 --> 01:20:05.850
this guy's crazy.
She's like,
what do you mean because we need that.

1444
01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:08.350
And she did the judge read and he was like,
oh,
it's that.

1445
01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.780
They made them rewrite it and it goes,
okay.

1446
01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:14.781
That $800 billion was what he's doing richest in the world.

1447
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:19.080
Like leaves a lot on the table,
a lot of room for negotiation.
I mean,

1448
01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:21.420
assuming that you're going to continue to be more successful.

1449
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.100
He did promise me though,
when he did eventually become king of kings,

1450
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.650
he could repay me with,

1451
01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.720
<v 6>um,
untold riches.
King of kings is a big,</v>

1452
01:20:31.721 --> 01:20:35.470
big title for a,
a guy living in a homeless shelter.

1453
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:39.580
Him Pro Bono.
I love this guys like levels of riches.

1454
01:20:39.581 --> 01:20:43.410
He has all the riches in the world,
but that's exceeded by untold riches.

1455
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.840
All the riches in the world's more well then if you pay him all the riches in

1456
01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:50.280
the world and he pays you back and untold riches,
you're getting ripped off.
Yeah.

1457
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:54.120
Yeah.
It's a bad before I denied him.

1458
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:55.480
Why he's not really paying you back.

1459
01:20:55.481 --> 01:20:58.150
He's just giving you a little bit of what you guys give me some for helping
them.

1460
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:01.570
That's,
that's about right.
You're just saying riches are confined to the world.

1461
01:21:01.571 --> 01:21:05.710
Rei Disagree.
Oh,
untold riches could be all the riches and

1462
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.823
me as an attorney,

1463
01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:12.770
<v 1>oh,
I'll hire you to represent me and I would have been a mayor,</v>

1464
01:21:12.771 --> 01:21:17.450
was her name fake attorney Dunkin represents fig attorney Ra being sued by crazy

1465
01:21:17.451 --> 01:21:21.500
guy.
He kept trying to use big lingo because I would sometimes,
so we'd be like,

1466
01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:24.110
where to four awesome.

1467
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.130
The plaintiffs who are attacking me,
he had,

1468
01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:30.290
he also wanted us to San Diego State Hospital.
I think they really fucked him up.

1469
01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:33.080
I think it got this like where they're really fucked him up.
Yeah.

1470
01:21:33.081 --> 01:21:36.150
I think he wanted us to do with that guy.
Right?
Dean Dean

1471
01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:41.040
<v 6>know who talks to the dead.
Dean.
Dean [inaudible],</v>

1472
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.380
Dean Edwards.
John Edward.
John Edwards.

1473
01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:48.390
Demers is a comic cause it was just like the guy ran for president.
Dean Edwards.

1474
01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:49.680
Yeah.
And I remember saying like,

1475
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:52.410
well why would he said he wanted to sue him for being a false prophet.

1476
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.780
And I was like,
why would you get that money?
Hey wait,

1477
01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:56.790
can I change the subject for talking logical,

1478
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:59.100
the crazy guy check for two seconds.

1479
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.460
You're talking about just cause we were talking about Rich's outside the world.

1480
01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:06.630
Yeah.
It's media or harvesting thing.
Do you know about this free resources?

1481
01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:09.600
Oh yeah.
Peter Diamandis is behind it.
Dude.

1482
01:22:09.601 --> 01:22:13.920
They just launched $1 million Kickstarter project to create a space telescope

1483
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:15.510
for public use because you know,

1484
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:20.250
they're launching a whole fleet of tiny space telescopes to scan for near Earth

1485
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:24.300
asteroids that we can then land on and leverage for resources.
Hold back in mind.

1486
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.170
Typical one has like $1 trillion worth of plutonium,
for example.

1487
01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:30.750
That's why they're doing it.
They're not doing this.
When they,

1488
01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:34.110
when they're talking about NASA wants to grab an asteroid or a medium,

1489
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:37.890
it's a media or an asteroid.
Asteroids,
asteroids,
when they say this,

1490
01:22:37.891 --> 01:22:40.980
you know they're not doing this.
You know,
it's not just scientific reasons.

1491
01:22:40.981 --> 01:22:45.981
They don't just want to harvest riches beyond all previous limits,

1492
01:22:46.021 --> 01:22:48.090
but it's that cake cause that's just an unscented.

1493
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:52.080
It can really pull it off and that's why they would go do that.

1494
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:57.110
That's why there's technologies and those thing so that somebody can make money.

1495
01:22:57.331 --> 01:23:00.990
And then how do they know that they plutonium in those things?
Oh they know,

1496
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:02.920
they know that.
They know the chemical composition.

1497
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.190
A filter can make estimations about what Jupiter

1498
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.670
<v 2>is composed of.
I mean that's kind of insane about humanity.</v>

1499
01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.910
We can actually use our brains to extend our sensory apparatus.
Me On earth.

1500
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.610
What's the mechanism of a determining the contents of an asteroid and you don't

1501
01:23:16.611 --> 01:23:19.750
know how they knew it?
The last few elements I paradox table.

1502
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:23.500
They knew how much they'd way this.
They knew where they fit in and that chart,

1503
01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:23.711
they were like,

1504
01:23:23.711 --> 01:23:26.080
we haven't discovered them but we know exactly what they'll weigh and how would

1505
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:29.980
their masculinity of the human brain to acquire such knowledge about the

1506
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:31.780
building blocks of the physical world.

1507
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:36.781
What does that say about us as like this unique for me into that group and that

1508
01:23:38.001 --> 01:23:40.840
Shit's preposterous.
I don't even,
those aren't even related to me.

1509
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:42.370
Those are totally different kinds of animals.

1510
01:23:42.371 --> 01:23:43.480
Those people that have figured that out,

1511
01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:46.360
I don't think they are because the fact that we can have this conversation means

1512
01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:49.780
we can acknowledge some kind of understanding of what we're talking.

1513
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:54.190
I mean I think that child is a child like understanding comparison to the dude

1514
01:23:54.191 --> 01:23:59.110
who figured out what a cork glue on plasma political the way and then made it

1515
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.800
made something that if you get a sugar cube of it will fall straight through the

1516
01:24:02.801 --> 01:24:06.340
center of the earth because of the way like 400 billion pounds or something

1517
01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:08.410
fucking tray.
It's a different kind of animal.

1518
01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.180
You think there's a lot of different kind of brand you think?

1519
01:24:10.181 --> 01:24:12.160
Like if we went and sat with him for a couple of weeks,

1520
01:24:12.161 --> 01:24:15.100
he could explain it to us.
Like normal terms,

1521
01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:19.870
while people are remarkably adaptable and people go down certain paths,

1522
01:24:19.871 --> 01:24:23.740
I think in life and if you meet a guy who's like been a ballet dancer since he

1523
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:27.730
was four years old and now he's 25 and doing these twirls in the air and Shit,

1524
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.820
you would look at that guy moving,
I don't know why I chose ballet dance,

1525
01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.380
but you would look at that guy and moving,
they're going like,

1526
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:38.210
that guy is so far down the path.
I could never possibly catch up.
Right?

1527
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:41.390
But I think you could do ballet,
human beings,

1528
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.270
human beings have a capacity for continuing down a path in a very far way to the

1529
01:24:46.271 --> 01:24:49.650
point where they're almost unrecognizable from when they first started and

1530
01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:54.670
insane specialization,
like a malleability trends.
Martial arts especially.

1531
01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:57.820
It's amazing how you can see that about let's say a ballet artist dancing and

1532
01:24:57.821 --> 01:25:00.400
stuff like,
well,
I can never do that.
And you could easily say,

1533
01:25:00.401 --> 01:25:01.330
there's no way I could,

1534
01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:05.710
but everybody thinks they can do stand up and that's funny with no training at

1535
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:08.680
all that you find that they don't,
they don't really know what we're doing.

1536
01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:11.620
It's like they think they were just telling jokes and we absolutely are,

1537
01:25:11.621 --> 01:25:14.900
but it's all about where to put them.
How to Sam [inaudible],

1538
01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:17.640
I think they're hired philosophers.
They're up philosophy.

1539
01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:21.880
It's also hypnotism because there's some weird thing that you're doing where you

1540
01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:25.780
can get them in and the way you're lowering your voice and you get them tuned to

1541
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:29.350
the way you're thinking by giving them shit that they want to listen to and if

1542
01:25:29.351 --> 01:25:31.420
you can find that rhythm where it's,

1543
01:25:31.421 --> 01:25:34.240
it's a thought that they would entertain themselves,

1544
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:37.150
then they'll allow your mind to work for them because like,
oh,

1545
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:40.760
this guy's got a very aware mind.
I'm,
I'm curious to hear what,

1546
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:44.110
how he looks at things.
I'll allow him to thank for that.
The same thing,

1547
01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.120
presidents then comments,
then a big plugging into you.

1548
01:25:48.121 --> 01:25:50.410
The same way when you watch a movie,
you become the character in movie.

1549
01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.660
Those people are plugging into you at that moment.

1550
01:25:52.661 --> 01:25:53.860
When you enter that flow state,

1551
01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:56.720
do you feel like a conductor in an orchestra like literally like you move

1552
01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.880
orchestra?
That's exactly how it is.
Yeah.
It's like you guys were in a flow.

1553
01:26:00.881 --> 01:26:03.100
You become in sync,
so right there is interesting.
It's happening.

1554
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.100
I don't know if we can even measure

1555
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.750
<v 6>that.
Like when people sync up like that,</v>

1556
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.970
whether it's lots of people to one person or lots of photos,

1557
01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:10.160
lots of other people like his gal for that.

1558
01:26:10.161 --> 01:26:11.710
You don't have a scale for that feeling.

1559
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:16.930
I think you can study the way that a metallic particles react to magnets.

1560
01:26:17.241 --> 01:26:21.650
I think you can shit the way sound waves affect water and we use those
metaphors.

1561
01:26:21.651 --> 01:26:23.990
We say he's so magnetic,
it's on stage.

1562
01:26:23.991 --> 01:26:26.930
I mean use those metaphors to explain something for which we have no

1563
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:30.980
instrumentation or way to quantify or measure.
Yet we employ those capacities.

1564
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.210
We use those capacities.

1565
01:26:32.211 --> 01:26:35.420
We pay people millions of dollars because they're charismatic.
Well,

1566
01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:38.120
how do you measure charisma?
Is there a little machine that measures it?

1567
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:41.360
Like radiation?
He has 97 Kelvin's of charisma.
Who,

1568
01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.280
so we employ these things but we can't measure them.

1569
01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:44.540
They exist but we can't measure.

1570
01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:49.540
It can focus attention and attention is a specific pattern of neural activity.

1571
01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:54.440
So the idea is that you have this group of people and you are transforming their

1572
01:26:54.441 --> 01:26:57.590
neuroactivity to match some intention that you have.

1573
01:26:57.591 --> 01:27:01.260
Whether it's because you want them to listen to your speech about hotels don't

1574
01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:02.510
like,

1575
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:05.410
don't you wish there was like a special light you could use the could show the

1576
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:10.040
energy
bridge and we can see the cell phone signals going through us right now.

1577
01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:13.810
Like if I can see how your my attention and catch a group of people dancing who

1578
01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:17.960
are all on ecstasy and what you are looking at the white fishes fish move around

1579
01:27:17.961 --> 01:27:19.930
a coral reef or look at yes,

1580
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:24.470
you see this exact same undulating hidden order.
Just thinks,

1581
01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:28.670
well there's an essay due to called virtual reality and hallucination written by

1582
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:31.820
Diana Slattery on reality sandwich.
And it's all about that.

1583
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:36.410
She says the capture and management of attention is a vital component.

1584
01:27:36.411 --> 01:27:40.400
A state of immersion and state of absorption is a vital component in any kind of

1585
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:45.430
interpersonal transformation or education or influence of any capacity or

1586
01:27:45.801 --> 01:27:47.240
growth.
In other words,

1587
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:50.930
you need to be completely sucked into whatever it is that's going to really like

1588
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:52.270
transform you and get inside of you.
Yeah,

1589
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:56.030
so it all has to do with the capture and manage management of attention and what

1590
01:27:56.031 --> 01:27:59.990
our psychedelics,
if not attention,
technologies,
rhetoric,
technologies,

1591
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:04.410
what is language if not a technology to capture attention and shift any

1592
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:05.730
discipline as a cycle,

1593
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:09.200
a psychedelic experience and the long haul because disciplines transform you.

1594
01:28:09.210 --> 01:28:12.620
Yes,
yes,
yes and they focus attention,
attention.

1595
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:15.110
Paul Fish and you just want people to put the laundry away while they were

1596
01:28:15.111 --> 01:28:17.330
watching.
Just not full of Shit.
Just look at it.

1597
01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.930
It's all he wanted was so he'd get lost in it.

1598
01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.500
You got people on your sourcing.
Attention is the key to everything.

1599
01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:28.160
If we had the power to decide at any given moment to focus our attention on the

1600
01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:30.440
best possible thing that we could focus our attention on,

1601
01:28:30.630 --> 01:28:33.290
my life would be like a living,
breathing sculpture.
It would be like a dream,

1602
01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:37.880
like constantly
jerking off in the new socks.

1603
01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.450
But think of Alec,
how's it sounds like a dream world.

1604
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:44.110
Think about how I profitable,
being able to grab people's attention is,

1605
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:48.980
and it's everything.
It's everything.
It's the currency of this new age.

1606
01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.570
Attention.
Attention is the new limited resource.
Yeah.

1607
01:28:51.571 --> 01:28:55.790
Attention is the new oil in a world of social media,
of infinite media,

1608
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:57.890
infinite channels who succeeds,

1609
01:28:57.891 --> 01:29:01.040
but the one who was most physically able to capture and manage attention.

1610
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.230
And that's where you see the phenomenon or something like this.
You guys,

1611
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.650
I'm always talking about like you know,
it's been a year.

1612
01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.060
People are still saying come back and have this conversation.

1613
01:29:09.061 --> 01:29:13.740
I mean that just means that you've tapped into a nerve that millions are feeling

1614
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.240
and when you consider that 10,000 hours of content is uploaded to youtube every

1615
01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.000
hour,
they,
you still have millions of people that come in and join.

1616
01:29:21.001 --> 01:29:25.680
This conversation shows like the power of that.
Like it's like,
it's like,

1617
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:29.070
you know,
shining a little bit brighter than the other 10,000 hours.

1618
01:29:29.071 --> 01:29:31.920
But it's a funny thing when the surgeon doesn't tune in.

1619
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:35.550
Like when you see Obama in Germany recently,
do you see that shit?

1620
01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.800
This speech he gave?
Ooh,
it's creepy.

1621
01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:41.520
That's like Alex Jones level creepy German pension.
Well,
no,

1622
01:29:41.521 --> 01:29:43.590
not aside from the fact that there was only like Latin,

1623
01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:47.250
the first time he came there,
it was packed hordes of people came to see him.

1624
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:49.050
This time it was sparse and empty.

1625
01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.200
But what was really creepy was his echoing message about how we have to give up

1626
01:29:54.211 --> 01:29:58.950
freedom for security.
And you hear this coming out.
It's like Obama was saying it.

1627
01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:03.170
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
He was saying he was fucking sticking up for the Goddamn man.

1628
01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.290
I say,
because this leaky pull up the up,
Jeremy,

1629
01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:09.300
you find that it might be a long speech,
but it was Suki is out there,

1630
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:12.150
bacon and the heat sweating and giving this,

1631
01:30:12.151 --> 01:30:15.420
this proclamation of how there's a balance between sick.

1632
01:30:15.421 --> 01:30:19.410
He was just talking about the importance of the security state.
And by the way,

1633
01:30:19.411 --> 01:30:19.650
you know,

1634
01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:24.120
there's a logical part of my brain that considers the what they're saying.

1635
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:28.500
I have to allow myself to give consideration to saying,
you know what I mean?

1636
01:30:28.501 --> 01:30:30.600
But there's another cause.
Well especially cause I'm thinking,

1637
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:33.270
well if this allows them to stop somebody from blowing themselves up in the

1638
01:30:33.271 --> 01:30:37.000
subway.
Yeah,
cool.
You know what a pickle urine,
what a pickle you're in.
If,
if,

1639
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:41.170
if you do,
if you know that if I have this much,
uh,
uh,

1640
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:44.640
width when it comes breadth,
when it comes to monitoring,

1641
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:47.250
then I can stop people from getting blown up.

1642
01:30:47.251 --> 01:30:48.510
What happened at the Boston Marathon.

1643
01:30:48.511 --> 01:30:52.320
I can stop a kid from getting turned into fucking hamburger meat.

1644
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:55.290
So now you're basically saying,
well,
what do we do here?

1645
01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:57.660
Are we going to just do we just say,
okay,

1646
01:30:57.661 --> 01:30:59.850
well I guess the cost of People's privacy,

1647
01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:04.620
is that from time to time children get evaporated or do you say,
no,

1648
01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:09.030
we've got to grow up to the fact that we're an interconnected system where all

1649
01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:12.440
cells in a bigger organism,
it's time.
We don't want to give up a secure,

1650
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:15.990
I don't think the price is worth it.
We can't trust the government.

1651
01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.120
<v 0>Not only that,
I think we're looking at the thing and correctly.</v>

1652
01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:23.090
I think the thing that they should be concentrating on is the mental health

1653
01:31:23.091 --> 01:31:24.490
issue.
Yeah.
What?
What?

1654
01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.680
What makes people willing to lash out and kill large numbers

1655
01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:29.610
<v 6>instead of instead of [inaudible]?</v>

1656
01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:32.490
Where do you think you can do with that you can invest in,

1657
01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:35.280
in research for mental health and you would solve a lot more mobile?

1658
01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:39.920
<v 0>No,
when babies are born,
essentially,
we know we have,
we have birth certificates.</v>

1659
01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:42.410
We know where people were living on social security numbers.

1660
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.040
Why can't we find out whether or not people are doing really bad?
Well,

1661
01:31:46.041 --> 01:31:48.410
it's hard to find out whether or not people are losing their minds.
Well,

1662
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:51.890
it's hard when they're in Yemen,
not meaning,
even in America,
we can't find out.

1663
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.190
I think we do not have an accurate account of our citizens yet.

1664
01:31:55.191 --> 01:31:57.230
We could pretend that we're some sort of a community,

1665
01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.010
but we don't have an accurate account of the of our citizens.

1666
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.160
<v 5>When Zach told me they weren't gonna cover my mental health anymore because of</v>

1667
01:32:03.161 --> 01:32:06.400
some type of Obamacare that went into action.
Oh,
you can't carry,

1668
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:09.250
everybody can't carry them.
Also,
only plan one gets a plan to gets none.

1669
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:10.120
Oh my God.
I was like,

1670
01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:14.370
I hope another Jared lauffner goes into your building and shoots.
Yeah.

1671
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:17.080
Yeah.
What'd he get pulled every right after that?

1672
01:32:17.081 --> 01:32:19.880
They're going to pull everyone's mental health insurance.
Yeah,

1673
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:22.870
because that crazy guy lost his health.
Well,
that's what you're turning us all.

1674
01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:25.090
If one of us is going to do that.
But let me ask you something.

1675
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:27.700
Do you think that when a person who uploads like that,

1676
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:31.030
if we're talking about what happened to that person on like a human scale,

1677
01:32:31.031 --> 01:32:32.640
we might say,
okay,
well maybe you know,

1678
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:36.790
years of disaffection and radicalization and propaganda and mediation from the

1679
01:32:36.791 --> 01:32:40.570
wrong influences in his focused attention on the wrong place until he's old

1680
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:43.760
personality could be a real issue,
medical issue.
But let's,

1681
01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:46.660
so let's zoom out for a little bit and think of that person as a cell in the

1682
01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.430
bigger organism.
Is he like a cancer cell?

1683
01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:52.180
Is he the equivalent of like when a cancer cell starts to like replicate without

1684
01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:53.950
concern for the rest of the sales and the system?

1685
01:32:53.951 --> 01:32:58.790
I mean it's that where is it a broken thing?
Could it be fixed?

1686
01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:02.080
Like just like we want to make advances in medicine to detect cancer cells

1687
01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:03.970
before they metastasize.

1688
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:08.350
Can we find human beings before they metastasize into,
into that final thing?

1689
01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:11.410
It's not an either or.
I think sometimes yes,
sometimes no.

1690
01:33:11.411 --> 01:33:13.480
I think sometimes it's probably a medical issue.

1691
01:33:13.481 --> 01:33:15.910
And what about research in terms of being able to find it,

1692
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:19.180
find that the genetic markers that predispose you to that.

1693
01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:22.810
And there's a lot of times we have to wash these but isn't culture ultimately

1694
01:33:22.811 --> 01:33:26.040
led technology that does,
that is your culture.
Like when we call TV,

1695
01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.380
we call it program.
It programs you,

1696
01:33:28.381 --> 01:33:31.600
it teaches you about right and wrong and what's legal and what's not legal.

1697
01:33:31.601 --> 01:33:34.270
And if you're part of the pop culture,
you know,

1698
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:37.990
you're programmed into it kind of mainstream consensus trance that basically

1699
01:33:37.991 --> 01:33:39.760
says we're moderately free.

1700
01:33:39.761 --> 01:33:42.370
As long as you don't physically hurt me and I don't physically hurt you.

1701
01:33:42.371 --> 01:33:44.170
And you know you don't do certain things,

1702
01:33:44.171 --> 01:33:47.590
but we know we have these kinds of frameworks to impose some kind of an order so

1703
01:33:47.591 --> 01:33:51.040
that the system can,
some kind of can have some kind of function.

1704
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:54.280
So it just makes you wonder,
you know,
like especially with the privacy things,

1705
01:33:54.281 --> 01:33:54.520
you know,

1706
01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:58.150
are they really like spying on me or is it more like I'm a billion lines of code

1707
01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:00.850
mixed with a billion other lines of code.
It just a bunch of algorithms.

1708
01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:01.810
Here's what's coming,
here's what's,

1709
01:34:01.811 --> 01:34:05.290
and then they just detect when there's like weird behavior associated with

1710
01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:07.390
violence that they would zoom in,
they will use it,

1711
01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:11.170
they will use anything you've done wrong as an excuse to go and really go after

1712
01:34:11.171 --> 01:34:15.220
you,
you know,
briefly already want to fuck with you.

1713
01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.100
They can look at your stuff.
It's like,
oh he owns two larger lobster,

1714
01:34:18.101 --> 01:34:20.830
which is a federal offense.
All right,
let me ask you whether or not you bought,

1715
01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:25.480
he broken along.
When there's people that want to blow themselves up in subways,

1716
01:34:25.481 --> 01:34:29.050
don't you think that that's going to occupy most of them?
This is why,

1717
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:33.400
because some guy who works there,
you fucked his ex girlfriend.
Oh snap.
Sorry.

1718
01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:35.550
Damn Shit just got real.
You know what I mean?

1719
01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:41.100
And then you're giving that guy the power to abuse it and that's what I don't

1720
01:34:41.381 --> 01:34:45.310
like and I think that's what this guy is saying is absolutely possible.

1721
01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:50.000
Here's my question that the people that work at the organization like him turn

1722
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:53.950
to him as a high school dropout,
which is hilarious.
Like um,
he was,

1723
01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.250
your coder didn't use your guy.
Are you pretending you don't know this guy?

1724
01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.080
<v 6>He's at play.
When is it ever worked?
This is the question we have to ask.</v>

1725
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:06.420
You know what that I saying,
if we don't understand history,

1726
01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.710
we're doomed or repeat it.
Let's look in the past.
What it,

1727
01:35:09.711 --> 01:35:14.711
what point has a government gain full access to the information flow of its

1728
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:19.340
citizenry where it hasn't gone wrong?
Show me where,

1729
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:23.180
what's what nation has it been where it's like,
Oh yes.
That was the,

1730
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:24.950
that was that one government that knew,

1731
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.940
that studied all the correspondence polish citizens and it didn't go wrong at

1732
01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:32.900
all.
It didn't tightened down.
It didn't become a security state.
It was a utopia.

1733
01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:37.700
No,
no,
no.
It doesn't exist.
It's no always bath.
Korea.
Yes.

1734
01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:40.010
But here's,
here's the counter argument to that.

1735
01:35:40.011 --> 01:35:42.710
Do you think that if given the proper instruments,

1736
01:35:42.711 --> 01:35:44.660
the citizenry could police themselves,

1737
01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:49.661
could we have nowadays that becomes like airbnb where everybody can rent their

1738
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:53.240
own place and everybody else judges everybody else and you don't raise everybody

1739
01:35:53.241 --> 01:35:54.890
out to tell you about a good dentist.

1740
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:58.790
You can just look online and you're connected to all the citizens hold you by

1741
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:01.130
four and a half stars.
I was asking my brother,
I was like,

1742
01:36:01.131 --> 01:36:03.820
how do you know somebody from airbnb is not going to be some serial killer?

1743
01:36:03.821 --> 01:36:05.060
He's going to come into pieces.
He's like,

1744
01:36:05.061 --> 01:36:07.970
well cause you can look at the 50 other people that stayed at his house and they

1745
01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:11.450
rate his cleanness and the rain is you can go anywhere in the world and have

1746
01:36:11.451 --> 01:36:15.130
this joker's work now and Arrow succumb to regulate each other.

1747
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:16.760
Self regulating networks.

1748
01:36:16.761 --> 01:36:20.480
So it's almost like we are connected to each other and it's like a homeo status

1749
01:36:20.481 --> 01:36:23.440
as being formed where the system is self regulators,

1750
01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.720
government in a time where we didn't have that ability.
Right now we do.

1751
01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:30.840
So the government,
right,
so it's governments and append to,

1752
01:36:30.841 --> 01:36:32.000
it's not utopia,

1753
01:36:32.001 --> 01:36:35.810
but these decentralized peer networks that self regulate each other with no top

1754
01:36:35.811 --> 01:36:40.550
down management but just lateral is leaning towards a kind of like space in

1755
01:36:40.551 --> 01:36:41.384
which we can,

1756
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.070
we have congress because we didn't have the ability to send someone that

1757
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.750
ourselves.
It's a from California,
we can't,
we can't speak in Washington,

1758
01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:51.170
so we need to send some guy as our congressman to speak for us,

1759
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.030
but now we can speak for ourselves.
We don't need a lot of people.

1760
01:36:55.580 --> 01:37:00.580
Democracy 2.0 we need literally like Ios doesn't get an upgrade for our iPhone

1761
01:37:00.651 --> 01:37:03.320
every six months.
We freak out like we need to upgrade it.

1762
01:37:03.321 --> 01:37:07.370
Literally the way the whole governmental system works to use these rooms like it

1763
01:37:07.371 --> 01:37:09.320
should be online.
It's really simple.

1764
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.690
The idea that anybody controls it is ridiculous.

1765
01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:16.190
It should be online and there should be some sort of anonymous type group that

1766
01:37:16.191 --> 01:37:18.920
controls the code,
makes sure that nobody can fuck with it,

1767
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:22.070
like pick and was on top of Shit.

1768
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:27.440
Maybe the AI global ethic amongst the anonymous is us by the way.
He was like,

1769
01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:31.010
no one's giving you,
here's the thing,
but no one's giving this power up.

1770
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:36.370
This is where I think that that is where I think this fervent form of a naive

1771
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:39.950
futurist comes into being aware and not just futurist spiritualist.

1772
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:44.240
And a lot of other people think,
oh,
you know,
these,
uh,
as you're saying these,
uh,

1773
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:47.720
what do you call it?
Peerless networks,
these decentralized peer.

1774
01:37:47.721 --> 01:37:49.910
Now and by the way,
when I say you,
I mean me too.

1775
01:37:49.911 --> 01:37:53.540
Cause I do have this hope that somehow this thing is just like an escalation

1776
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:57.120
towards bliss and it's all to work itself out.
And I do think that,
but again,

1777
01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:58.410
if you look back at history,

1778
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:02.040
you will see that even if a thing is become archaic and antiquated,

1779
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:05.330
it doesn't mean that the people running that finger going to give it up.
No,
no,

1780
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.390
they don't want to give it.

1781
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:11.710
The only way they give it up is through violence.
And this,

1782
01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:15.710
<v 4>that's our inevitability here for revolution here in our lifetime.</v>

1783
01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:20.630
Kurzweil Kurzweil says,
Kurzweil says that that's actually not the case.

1784
01:38:20.631 --> 01:38:21.560
And he says that,
you know,

1785
01:38:21.561 --> 01:38:26.330
like the radio industry didn't want like TV to become a thing and it didn't,

1786
01:38:26.331 --> 01:38:29.730
it didn't need,
it didn't need to be violence for TV to like become more,

1787
01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:33.260
not talking about,
they didn't need to be goddamn revolution.

1788
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:35.600
I'm ready to cheer it on Mama Howard,

1789
01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:40.700
but I'm ready to say here's some water.
You guys go out there and fight for us.

1790
01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:44.900
But I think that these technologies will meet resistance from the establishment,

1791
01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.050
but I don't think that it requires violence for transformation to occur.
I mean,

1792
01:38:48.051 --> 01:38:51.200
we're seeing it through social media.
I'm in the old,
what are you talking about?

1793
01:38:51.710 --> 01:38:56.580
Area Libera lip,
Liberia.
Uh,
the other one off.

1794
01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.870
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Always gets,

1795
01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:03.050
always gets overthrown by,
aren't they?
Don't give up.

1796
01:39:03.051 --> 01:39:04.150
They don't give up and they have the guns.

1797
01:39:04.151 --> 01:39:07.010
So the only way to get him to give it up,
they can look the other way.

1798
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:09.000
Which other ways?
When is it work?

1799
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:14.170
<v 0>People who are growing up with the dye outside different.
Understand what you're,</v>

1800
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:17.400
I don't,
I don't think that a representative governments impossible.

1801
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:19.770
I just think that we have to have more accountability.

1802
01:39:19.771 --> 01:39:23.520
And the thing that gives more accountability than anything is the Internet.

1803
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:26.070
It forces accountability.
So I think that's,

1804
01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:30.780
I think ultimately you can't record some pay anymore though.
You can.

1805
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:33.720
Yes you can.
They can arrest you.
No,
they can't.
No.

1806
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.710
I mean individual places have passed laws trying to make that real.

1807
01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:41.100
But there's a bunch of videos online that show people telling cops.

1808
01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:42.840
They told me today I couldn't take a picture of a Tsa.

1809
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:46.060
I saw a baby being left on the counter.
So it was funny.
So I took a picture.

1810
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:49.050
Sorry,
you can't take a picture of the check one mic that's raw.

1811
01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:53.100
What you're telling me is not true.
I'm going to take more pictures.

1812
01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:56.940
<v 6>I got to say I don't,
I don't want there to be violence,
man.</v>

1813
01:39:57.030 --> 01:40:01.970
I know that there needs to be,
I think the dream then naive dream of,
uh,

1814
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:05.730
the futurists is,
it's like you look in the animal kingdom,

1815
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.560
you look in and not just the animal kingdom,

1816
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:12.561
but you look at any massive change that has ever happened is always surrounded

1817
01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:15.780
by a release of energy.
When things rapidly change,

1818
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:20.640
there's a release of energy and energy releases are always violent.
Bam,

1819
01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.530
they're called explosion.
So it's like

1820
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.030
<v 4>B though,
just because I don't want it to be a psychic.</v>

1821
01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:28.450
I can be a consciousness explosion and it doesn't,

1822
01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:31.340
it doesn't require Hiroshimas experiencing

1823
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:34.070
<v 0>that.
It's just,
again,
right.
The psychedelic state of,
you know,</v>

1824
01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:38.240
seeing the whole history unfold in a matter of a few seconds.
This,

1825
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:40.350
I think this is just,
it's slow.

1826
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.060
So we're not really understanding what's happening,

1827
01:40:42.061 --> 01:40:45.060
but we're seeing all these psychedelics and coming back,

1828
01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:46.770
we're seeing all these things.

1829
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:50.840
We're seeing all these paradigms crumble in front of our son,

1830
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:54.190
and the reason being is because they're being espoused,
they're being exposed

1831
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.210
<v 1>to by the Internet.
It's just happening to us too slowly or it's happening.</v>

1832
01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:00.790
It's too confusing as to which direction it's going to go.

1833
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:04.060
There's too much peril in it.
It seems last two people that aren't just our luck.

1834
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:05.350
Hey,
it's chasing like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1835
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:10.351
I don't want to need tola understand that it's not good to put women in

1836
01:41:10.771 --> 01:41:11.920
beekeeper outfits.

1837
01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:18.260
<v 4>You know?
I completely concur with that,</v>

1838
01:41:18.261 --> 01:41:20.540
but I had an interesting experience.
I was just in,
in,

1839
01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:23.810
in Berlin for a couple of days and I was hanging out with this.

1840
01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:26.950
I went to this like steam room and spa over at the Soho House there.
Yes.

1841
01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.090
And it's coed.

1842
01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:34.550
So beautiful naked girls are walking around and showering in front of you in

1843
01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.980
Germany and it's perfectly normal.
And of course I'm loving it,

1844
01:41:36.981 --> 01:41:38.960
but I'm also slightly like what's happening here?

1845
01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:44.140
And then I think we're just as primitive here with separating the men's room

1846
01:41:44.781 --> 01:41:49.640
into female room compared to them.
We're like the beekeeper suit.

1847
01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:50.630
Do you know what I mean?

1848
01:41:50.630 --> 01:41:53.790
<v 1>Indeed.
I know you're saying,
I would think of myself as,
no,</v>

1849
01:41:53.791 --> 01:41:55.260
we're liberal here in America and inept,

1850
01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:59.050
but look how shamelessly those woman are just walking around naked and it's like

1851
01:41:59.070 --> 01:42:01.830
relaxed.
We're not fucking,
I totally agree.
I totally agree with you.

1852
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.520
<v 6>I think that it's a,
it's your,
what you're seeing is a spectrum of,
of,
of,</v>

1853
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:07.880
of men kind of controlling women.
Like if,

1854
01:42:07.881 --> 01:42:09.780
if a woman takes her shirt off at the beach,

1855
01:42:09.781 --> 01:42:12.270
she gets arrested in the United States.
Crazy.

1856
01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:16.350
But I think that if I'm going to be on some part of that spectrum,

1857
01:42:16.351 --> 01:42:19.230
I definitely want to be on the part of the spectrum where there's definite

1858
01:42:19.410 --> 01:42:22.200
definition of shirt is like a shoe lace or something.

1859
01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:25.710
I'd rather be no shoe lace at all.
But in that way,

1860
01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:30.090
all I'm saying is I don't understand the solution to,
um,

1861
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:35.430
fundamentalists of any religion controlling massive populations.

1862
01:42:35.761 --> 01:42:39.850
Or in the case of North Korea,
uh,
people controlling master.

1863
01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:42.870
I don't see how some android,
Jesus,

1864
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:47.550
I don't see how as wells manifestation of full brain emulation and the

1865
01:42:47.551 --> 01:42:50.610
subsequent empathic connection that happens with people.

1866
01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:55.380
I don't understand how that makes a person who's wheel the control over a chunk

1867
01:42:55.381 --> 01:42:57.840
of land using a false god.
Uh,

1868
01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.930
I don't understand how that's going to make them be like,
you know what,

1869
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:04.370
I guess I was wrong.
Well,
you can all just,

1870
01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:08.550
<v 4>but our,
our society has been transformed by a change in consciousness.
I mean,</v>

1871
01:43:08.551 --> 01:43:11.820
you could argue that the 60s fundamentally changed the way we think.

1872
01:43:11.821 --> 01:43:15.580
I mean this place used to be a lot more puritan than it is now drawn.

1873
01:43:15.630 --> 01:43:18.720
Used to be a lot more liberal.
Okay,
so you have it,

1874
01:43:18.721 --> 01:43:19.950
you have both things happening,

1875
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:24.280
<v 1>what cycles?
You have things to be wrong.
It's very liberal now of the,</v>

1876
01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:28.380
amongst the people.
Yeah.
The [inaudible] a very secular is,

1877
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:32.390
but the govern the government is what's really got an office,

1878
01:43:32.391 --> 01:43:35.840
but there's always going to be the ayatollah that's the supreme leader.
Yeah,

1879
01:43:35.841 --> 01:43:38.290
exactly.
It's really a weird situation.
So strange.

1880
01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.740
And the guy who was the I had told has been the,

1881
01:43:39.741 --> 01:43:41.930
I told us it's like 89 or something like that.

1882
01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:46.400
<v 6>Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
something crazy like that.
Yeah.
Well,
you know what,
man,</v>

1883
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:49.640
let me just say this cause I don't want to come off sounding like Ari.

1884
01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:53.630
Like I want some violent,
right.
I don't want why I see it a habitable.

1885
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:55.530
Did you ever have Steven pinker on the show?

1886
01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:58.400
So Steven pinker called the better angels of our nature.

1887
01:43:58.401 --> 01:44:01.520
He wrote a book called the better angels of our nature is a tech.co Ted talk

1888
01:44:01.521 --> 01:44:02.660
called the myth of violence.

1889
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:06.020
And he actually went up there and explained that the chances of a man die at the

1890
01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:08.750
hands of another man today are the lowest than they've ever been in a lot of all

1891
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:09.584
of human history.

1892
01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:13.820
The world has actually never been less violent than it is today.

1893
01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:18.580
100,000 people like,
and it's a lot.
But I,

1894
01:44:18.581 --> 01:44:20.920
I guess what he's saying is that it used to be worried.
I mean,

1895
01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:23.900
the Mongols killed a million and a day.
Right,
right,
right,
right.

1896
01:44:23.901 --> 01:44:26.810
I see what you're saying.
Yes.
Is that right?
It's that spectrum.

1897
01:44:26.811 --> 01:44:28.140
It's a spectrum day.

1898
01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.980
<v 0>Yeah.
Some insane number.
It was probably like,
I might be exaggerating,</v>

1899
01:44:30.981 --> 01:44:33.530
there would be 72 hours to 72 hours.

1900
01:44:33.531 --> 01:44:36.590
It killed a million people with horses on horseback.

1901
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:41.210
No nuclear bomb to swords that say,
must be so tired after that.

1902
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:47.760
That's when he got to run.
When they're that tired.
Oh,

1903
01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:53.030
actually really killed a million people.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1904
01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:58.520
Lillian.
Yeah.
That's a,
we have to really sort of grasped,
it's hard to,

1905
01:44:58.521 --> 01:45:02.270
but we have to try to grasp just what a short period of time we haven't been

1906
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:06.880
barbarians.
Yeah.
I mean,
even the Catholic church even,

1907
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:10.940
I mean,
you,
you,
you go back to the 15 hundreds,
they were drinking.

1908
01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:14.540
They had like mistresses.
The pope's had mistresses.

1909
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:18.020
They even raised kids had armies.
Yeah.
They rape kids.
They had armies.

1910
01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:21.800
They had four armies.
The Pope had army.
Did.
Karthik Catholic Church had armies.

1911
01:45:21.801 --> 01:45:23.700
The Vatican and an army behind it.
It's crazy.

1912
01:45:23.701 --> 01:45:26.640
I mean that you're talking about like really nutty shit.
Like they asked for,
uh,

1913
01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:30.630
the,
the pope's help once in fighting off.
The Mongols were here late.
Yeah.

1914
01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:34.700
I didn't want to send some to the troops.
They got lucky.

1915
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:37.700
Fucking muggles died off.
Ooh,

1916
01:45:37.770 --> 01:45:41.830
<v 6>can I,
here's the thing,
man.
I want to be pessimistic again because I've been to,</v>

1917
01:45:41.850 --> 01:45:44.040
I keep thinking about this,
so it's like,
okay,

1918
01:45:45.370 --> 01:45:45.710
<v 0>okay.</v>

1919
01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:47.390
<v 6>In the same way that it used to be,</v>

1920
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:50.240
if a person had a great idea and wanted to transmit it,

1921
01:45:50.241 --> 01:45:52.790
you'd have to get a printing press and he'd have to like,
you know,

1922
01:45:52.791 --> 01:45:56.950
to get the idea around,
it took a long time.
It would have to go buy boats,
right.

1923
01:45:57.410 --> 01:46:02.410
So now it's like if you want to build a like a nuclear bomb,

1924
01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:06.710
like it's really hard.
Like you've got to have centrifuges plutonium.

1925
01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:09.980
It's a fucking bitch.
Like you can't just do it if you want to build a nuke.

1926
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:11.430
But as matter is,

1927
01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:15.020
is it three d printers began to become more and more advanced and they start

1928
01:46:15.021 --> 01:46:16.430
working at the atomic level.

1929
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:20.540
Then in the same way that we have accessibility to instantaneous communication,

1930
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:24.800
people are going to have accessibility to instantaneous print guns,
creation of,

1931
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:28.280
of all kinds of fucked up weapons.
The need

1932
01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.400
<v 0>and account of all the people in our community that we're going to need an</v>

1933
01:46:31.401 --> 01:46:33.590
account of them in a loving way.

1934
01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:36.950
Our society like looking out for each other.

1935
01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.430
The idea is that every one guy's basement with a nuclear bomb.
You're right,

1936
01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.040
you're right.

1937
01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.410
But the idea is that every baby has a potential to become an awesome human
being.

1938
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:46.830
Right?
That's the idea.
Right?

1939
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:50.930
But that some of them just get shit rolls of the dice and they get one windup

1940
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:54.810
when two asshole meth head parents who fucking leave them in a basement one day

1941
01:46:54.811 --> 01:46:57.000
for 24 hours and they starve to death.
You know,

1942
01:46:57.001 --> 01:46:58.620
this shit like that happens to kids.

1943
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:02.070
You just get a shit roll of the dice or you can get an awesome roll the dice,

1944
01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:06.710
you know?
I mean that's possible too.
It's,
I think it's our job collectively as,

1945
01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:11.670
as a human species to concentrate on the least fortunate amongst us.

1946
01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:15.480
I think it's,
it's the,
the thing that everyone takes for granted,

1947
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:19.890
everyone ignores and every single guy who runs for president doesn't bring it
up.

1948
01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.150
They know.
They never say,
look,

1949
01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:25.350
our society is only as strong as its weakest link.
Right.

1950
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:27.840
We got a bunch of people that are being ignored and they,

1951
01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:29.430
they're an awesome resource.
If we,

1952
01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:32.820
if we educated them and help them and move them forward in some way,

1953
01:47:32.970 --> 01:47:35.880
who knows what kind of great benefit you could get out of this.
Alright.
Unity.

1954
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:36.800
It's true.

1955
01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:41.090
<v 1>I just think of that guy on locked up raw that one or like,</v>

1956
01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.170
you know like the guy,

1957
01:47:42.171 --> 01:47:45.230
I can't remember which guide is like one of these like the people that you see

1958
01:47:45.231 --> 01:47:49.010
on locked up raw or just like,
you know like I think,
cause you know I've,

1959
01:47:49.011 --> 01:47:50.840
I've thought,
oh I know the way to fix that.

1960
01:47:50.841 --> 01:47:55.440
It's like you flood the prisons with Lsd and like give these people help a

1961
01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.320
little.
That would definitely help a little.

1962
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:59.150
You're eventually going to have a 12 monkeys situation.

1963
01:47:59.570 --> 01:48:03.710
I think do you can do a site is going to have much effect on the rest of the

1964
01:48:03.711 --> 01:48:08.080
population with like a toxin or like a bunch of nuclear weapons that it'll just

1965
01:48:08.150 --> 01:48:09.350
drastically change everything.

1966
01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.520
<v 0>I think society has always thought that this was coming or not.
You know,</v>

1967
01:48:13.521 --> 01:48:16.160
it's like there's always people that believe that the apocalypse is around the

1968
01:48:16.161 --> 01:48:18.700
corner and there's all these people that had faith and like

1969
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:22.080
<v 1>Jason said,
it's,
this is the safest time to be alive ever.</v>

1970
01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:25.040
But yet we're still like fuck the sky's falling.
But you know,

1971
01:48:25.110 --> 01:48:28.800
almost like a part of being a human to recognize all the flaws around us to make

1972
01:48:28.801 --> 01:48:32.240
it glaringly obvious that we're aware of them and to focus more attention on it.

1973
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.620
Hold on.
Really slowed down the progress.

1974
01:48:35.230 --> 01:48:35.590
<v 4>US,</v>

1975
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:40.390
US being scared and neurotic and almost like negative has been biologically

1976
01:48:40.391 --> 01:48:43.900
selected for to warn us against potential consequences.
Like the,
you know,

1977
01:48:43.930 --> 01:48:44.440
the early,

1978
01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:49.010
the early cavemen who was chilling out and looking at the sky got eaten quickly.

1979
01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.690
The one that was like scared of impending doom survive.

1980
01:48:52.691 --> 01:48:54.910
So there's no coincidence that we have evolved that,

1981
01:48:54.911 --> 01:48:57.720
but until we start like playing with our own genomes,

1982
01:48:57.730 --> 01:48:59.740
like we can't change our basic dispositions,

1983
01:48:59.741 --> 01:49:02.320
which is a pay attention to whatever we think is dangerous.

1984
01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.920
But I think it does have,
you know,
knowledge is power when you appreciate,

1985
01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:08.440
Oh really?
The world has never been safer.
That's interesting.

1986
01:49:08.590 --> 01:49:10.330
Not to say there's not a thought of the things to worry about.

1987
01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.420
It's not to say that there's not school shootings and three d printing guns

1988
01:49:13.421 --> 01:49:17.060
could be dangerous,
but let's look at the actual facts as it is today.
Yeah.

1989
01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.790
But all it would take,
but in the beginning,

1990
01:49:18.791 --> 01:49:22.240
if one guy out of a hundred of them went a little nuts,
who punched some people,

1991
01:49:22.650 --> 01:49:25.720
right?
Then as technology got better,
he'd stabbed two people and then I stopped.

1992
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:27.070
And then as technology got better,

1993
01:49:27.250 --> 01:49:29.350
he put off a bomb and then as technology got better,

1994
01:49:29.351 --> 01:49:31.810
he flew a plane into a building.
And as technology gets better,

1995
01:49:31.811 --> 01:49:36.130
you can effect millions and millions of millions of people all at once with just

1996
01:49:36.131 --> 01:49:40.000
one.
Just one guy that falls in the cracks.
Well this is very,
very

1997
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.860
<v 1>much like the Internet,
but it's funny.
All right,</v>

1998
01:49:41.861 --> 01:49:46.390
what you're saying goes against your hate of the surveillance state because you

1999
01:49:46.391 --> 01:49:48.640
could see how when an accelerating

2000
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.690
<v 6>technology where people can blow each other up with increasing,
uh,</v>

2001
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:55.240
within a increasing competency,

2002
01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:59.880
you can see the necessity for perhaps a,
you know,
an observation of her.

2003
01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:02.080
It's a fuck.
That's what I'm saying.
It's a pickle,
man.

2004
01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.490
That's going to happen anyway.
You're never going to stay fully.

2005
01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:08.140
You can't monitor everything something's going to happen.

2006
01:50:08.141 --> 01:50:09.790
Doesn't mean you don't try to stop it.
I mean,

2007
01:50:10.490 --> 01:50:13.950
<v 2>the trend seems they're reversible.
The trend towards,
uh,</v>

2008
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:17.090
everybody having access to everything at all times.

2009
01:50:17.091 --> 01:50:20.630
I think we're going to have a real problem with money because money right now is

2010
01:50:20.631 --> 01:50:21.464
just,
you know,

2011
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:25.580
used to be based on gold and now we've got this one's and zero's thing that

2012
01:50:25.581 --> 01:50:27.740
we're rocking.
That doesn't really make any sense at all.

2013
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:31.160
I think that bitcoin in the last thing that comes right after bitcoin is going

2014
01:50:31.161 --> 01:50:35.920
to be the one,
oh,
if you guys heard about this shit,
I wonder,
I mean,
I think it's,

2015
01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:36.754
it's,
it's we,

2016
01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.570
we live in a really strange time because as access to information gets more and

2017
01:50:41.571 --> 01:50:44.600
more transparent and more and more free,

2018
01:50:44.810 --> 01:50:48.370
where we all have access to everything.
Well then what is that?

2019
01:50:48.410 --> 01:50:52.190
What exactly is financial resources?
Yeah.

2020
01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.810
Where are those ones and Zeros?
Where do they go if nothing gets,
sorry,
go ahead.

2021
01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:01.250
I'm just saying it's like there'll be a permeation point where transparency,

2022
01:51:01.251 --> 01:51:04.130
it gets to a point where everyone has access to everything at all times.

2023
01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:06.020
You're not going to be able to store any secrets,

2024
01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:07.550
so you're not going to mail to have money.

2025
01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.880
You're not going to be able to put ones and Zeros all in your bank account.

2026
01:51:10.881 --> 01:51:12.800
Does it mean anything?
So we will take your ones and Zeros.

2027
01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:15.760
<v 4>There also might not be a reason for anybody to hurt each other.
Like,
you know,</v>

2028
01:51:15.761 --> 01:51:19.020
it might not have to be that when the Kenneth says we're all going to move into

2029
01:51:19.021 --> 01:51:20.670
universes of our own construction,

2030
01:51:20.671 --> 01:51:23.940
but then like Kurzweil and Peter Diamandis just say,
you know,

2031
01:51:23.970 --> 01:51:26.370
technology is a resource liberating mechanism.

2032
01:51:26.371 --> 01:51:28.920
The whole idea of scarcity is just contextual.
You know,

2033
01:51:29.070 --> 01:51:32.850
we fight over 1% of the freshwater in the world when this is a water planet.

2034
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.880
Desalinization revolution could give us all the water we could ever need.

2035
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.110
We fight over energy.

2036
01:51:37.111 --> 01:51:39.870
We get 10,000 times more energy from the sun than we would ever need.

2037
01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:43.110
With nanotechnology.
Matter becomes a programmable medium.

2038
01:51:43.111 --> 01:51:45.180
We can turn anything into anything.
So I mean,

2039
01:51:45.181 --> 01:51:49.090
when we have just like infinite abundance,
potentially,
what would we fight about?

2040
01:51:49.110 --> 01:51:50.010
There will be no incentive

2041
01:51:50.010 --> 01:51:52.220
<v 6>sensitive to fight pussy go.</v>

2042
01:51:52.230 --> 01:51:56.410
What did we could call Chloe?
I live in virtual reality.

2043
01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.240
Diamonds.
Girls don't want to fake diamonds.

2044
01:51:59.241 --> 01:52:02.390
They want real diamonds that came from coal and the guys are going to want real

2045
01:52:02.391 --> 01:52:05.220
pussy that you earn.
Oh,
she's a real person and have,

2046
01:52:05.250 --> 01:52:08.930
do they have virtual games where we can be the heroes in our own unit?

2047
01:52:09.150 --> 01:52:12.770
In your argument and that terrifying flaw in your argument is the assumption

2048
01:52:12.771 --> 01:52:14.690
that people do things for a reason.

2049
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:17.900
You're saying people do things because they don't have enough or they do things

2050
01:52:17.901 --> 01:52:18.740
because of this or that.

2051
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:22.400
Some of the most horrible things are done for no reason at all.

2052
01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.820
They're done because the bio computer that,

2053
01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:28.490
that somebody is running clicked the wrong way and they decided it'd be fun to

2054
01:52:28.491 --> 01:52:32.920
hear the sound of a teenage boy that's snap like a clown.

2055
01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:36.410
That's a cancer cell.
That's a,
that's a thing that's not doing,

2056
01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:39.680
it's not moving towards complexity and organization and the sublime.
Right?

2057
01:52:39.681 --> 01:52:43.100
Like the rest of the evolutionary process.
Why there's the urge to kill it.
Right.

2058
01:52:43.130 --> 01:52:46.460
There's the urgency kill it.
But the interesting thing,
and I think this,
I heard,

2059
01:52:46.461 --> 01:52:49.850
I think Mckenna said this,
there's this relay,
there's a race happening right now.

2060
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:51.980
There's a race happening.
Cause it's,

2061
01:52:52.110 --> 01:52:54.590
it's not as though these two things can exist.
At the same time.

2062
01:52:54.591 --> 01:52:57.160
It's like we were talking about this and I've been thinking about a bunch of

2063
01:52:57.161 --> 01:53:01.100
sense.
How you know in phones of course the are their conflict minerals.

2064
01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:04.090
What's the name of that shit?
And Fuck,
what's it called?
Hold on.

2065
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:08.890
Phones is cold hands.
So we know that in our phones,
in this,
uh,
device,

2066
01:53:08.891 --> 01:53:12.950
it's allowing us this greater connectivity is the suffering of children and

2067
01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:15.080
African an African minds.

2068
01:53:15.230 --> 01:53:20.230
So we see in nature that there is this intertwining of horror and of darkness

2069
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:22.320
and light very,

2070
01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:27.320
and to think that somehow technology is going to make things all light is to say

2071
01:53:27.831 --> 01:53:31.970
that we will actually rewire the universe when in fact it seems like what's

2072
01:53:31.971 --> 01:53:35.540
happening is an acceleration on both sides of the scale.

2073
01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:37.280
And is that acceleration happens.

2074
01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:41.780
There'll be an equivalent amount of this orgasmic Utopian Tayley our day.

2075
01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:45.780
Shar don't Omega Point with the other side of the thing,
which is well,

2076
01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:50.860
the absolute obliteration of all humanity through nuclear weapons or bioweapons.

2077
01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:55.100
Now here's the hopeful thing is what a Martin Luther King said,

2078
01:53:55.101 --> 01:53:57.980
which is the universe bends in the direction of justice.

2079
01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:00.290
And there is this hope that there's a refraction.

2080
01:54:00.291 --> 01:54:04.880
Is this the same where things are going towards the direction of creation

2081
01:54:04.881 --> 01:54:05.400
instead of,

2082
01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.190
<v 5>yeah,
with Steven Johnson says it's not utopia,
but it's leaning that way.</v>

2083
01:54:09.191 --> 01:54:12.580
So you know you could do the things are better.
They're not perfect,

2084
01:54:12.581 --> 01:54:16.210
they're better.
Technology amplifies the good in us.

2085
01:54:16.211 --> 01:54:18.130
That amplifies the bat at us in a,
in us,

2086
01:54:18.131 --> 01:54:21.370
but maybe it amplifies the good a little bit more than it amplifies the bad so

2087
01:54:21.371 --> 01:54:24.580
that eventually it might subvert completely.

2088
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:30.000
The light might swallow the darkness.
That's the trippy might transcend,
enter,

2089
01:54:30.001 --> 01:54:33.730
be completely,
you know,
we might become immortal gods living outside of time,

2090
01:54:33.970 --> 01:54:36.210
you know?
And maybe that's the singularity.
Yeah,

2091
01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:39.720
may sounds a lot like a battle between Hell and heaven.
It does,
doesn't,

2092
01:54:39.730 --> 01:54:43.210
it almost seems like that's happened before.
It's not a coincidence.

2093
01:54:43.211 --> 01:54:45.880
We need those archetypes to make sense of what's happening.

2094
01:54:45.881 --> 01:54:49.510
We've used the same archetypes,
religion,
salvation,
transcendence,
the same things.

2095
01:54:49.630 --> 01:54:53.410
The difference is that religion never produced with technology produced
religion.

2096
01:54:53.410 --> 01:54:54.640
Never let us fly through the air.

2097

01:56:41.321 --> 01:56:43.650
It's tied to the environment is perfect.

it's a really interesting sort of set up the way you have it.

2132
01:56:49.801 --> 01:56:53.250
And I love that comedy central had the balls to put that on line like that,

2133
01:56:53.251 --> 01:56:56.550
just produce it and make it like a real show,
like a legit TV show.

Put it online and,

2135
01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.050
and if it gets a good reaction they'll probably wind up doing something like

2136
01:57:01.051 --> 01:57:02.400
that on television.
All the comics,
