<v Speaker 1>I'm ranked number seven in the world or you know,</v>

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.720

<v Speaker 1>and so I remember I was going to the Asian food store cause I was gonna make</v>

9
00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>some tom cost soup and bjorn calls me and said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can go.</v>

14
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.221
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

15
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.054
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

16
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>So Friday morning,</v>

17
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.191
<v Speaker 1>it's Thursday night,</v>

18
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:29.761
<v Speaker 1>Friday morning,</v>

19
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:30.481
<v Speaker 1>it's in November,</v>

20
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>sometime in May,</v>

21
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>mid November morning they fax over the release my management,</v>

22
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>fax it to UFC headquarters and all of a sudden that afternoon there's a,</v>

23
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>like little scrum wherever was asking Dana questions and the data says we're not</v>

25
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:44.874
<v Speaker 1>interested in Ben.</v>

26
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.403
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

27
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

28
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>what just happened there?</v>

29
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.671
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

30
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Because for the last three months they were saying we were interested in wearing</v>

31
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>short words twisted.</v>

32
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Now I finally produced this full release for Bella tour that I got and now</v>

33
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:00.774
<v Speaker 1>they're not interested.</v>

34
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.651
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

35
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

36
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I just got caught in the middle of this and uh,</v>

37
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>was there a reason given well,</v>

38
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.961
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

39
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:07.201
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

40
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:07.861
<v Speaker 1>so the Monday.</v>

41
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>So then I say F that I buy my,</v>

42
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I bought a plane ticket to Vegas for Monday,</v>

43
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.501
<v Speaker 1>so that was Friday.</v>

44
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:14.334
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>

45
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

46
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.623
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

47
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Vegas,</v>

48
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking this shit,</v>

49
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:18.864
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

50
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>So a Monday I buy my plane ticket to Vegas,</v>

51
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I fly out to Vegas.</v>

52
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to headquarters a lot?</v>

53
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I met with Lorenzo.</v>

54
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:30.711
<v Speaker 1>Dana was on the little speakerphone dealy and they offered me a contract,</v>

55
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>but it would be confidential and I would have to fight one fight for the world</v>

56
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:36.504
<v Speaker 1>series of fighting,</v>

57
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.943
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

58
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>well that's bizarre.</v>

59
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

60
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>At the same fight for the world series a funding relationship with the world</v>

62
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.054
<v Speaker 1>series,</v>

63
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>like a feeder organization at that time.</v>

64
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.881
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>

65
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:48.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:48.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

67
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

68
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

69
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Morrowind,</v>

70
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Mariah's just engage you.</v>

71
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Both those kids came from champs over there.</v>

72
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I think the relationship is very hazy between the old world series of fighting</v>

73
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC because there was also people don't want the other way.</v>

74
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:01.381
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Andre Arlovski gets dropped from the FC,</v>

76
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>goes to world series.</v>

77
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Johnson,</v>

78
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.391
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

79
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:07.224
<v Speaker 1>All these people.</v>

80
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So they say one fight,</v>

81
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:09.144
<v Speaker 1>one fight,</v>

82
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.043
<v Speaker 1>world series of fighting.</v>

83
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>We will pay Zoopla.</v>

84
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.843
<v Speaker 1>We'll pay you.</v>

85
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Would you do one fight?</v>

86
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I say let that's eft up,</v>

88
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>

89
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.281
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

90
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone's going to go for it,</v>

91
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.134
<v Speaker 1>but I'll do it.</v>

92
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.303
<v Speaker 1>So I leave.</v>

93
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.331
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

94
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>about six hours later I got a phone call and says,</v>

95
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>that deal is no longer available.</v>

96
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to make you an offer.</v>

97
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>So wow.</v>

99
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And you have no idea why?</v>

100
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

102
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

103
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>so here's my guess.</v>

104
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I've never got to sit face to face meeting and say,</v>

105
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>what was your problem with me?</v>

106
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I think there's four things.</v>

107
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.913
<v Speaker 1>My mind,</v>

108
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

109
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really like me.</v>

110
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm stemming from the.</v>

111
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I called them out on the steroid thing,</v>

112
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.440
<v Speaker 1>where he said it's impossible and this is where our disagree.</v>

114
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to test all UFC athletes.</v>

115
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:53.041
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

116
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:53.641
<v Speaker 1>let's not true.</v>

117
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>You sat does it all over the world for all kinds of athletes.</v>

118
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

119
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.181
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

120
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just expensive,</v>

121
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.921
<v Speaker 1>but let's just call it.</v>

122
00:02:58.921 --> 00:02:59.754
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

123
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>You're a private business.</v>

124
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do drug testing.</v>

125
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It's basically they do it now.</v>

126
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Do it now.</v>

127
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Do it through Usada.</v>

128
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So you're totally right.</v>

129
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>So I was correct and now.</v>

131
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.071
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>

132
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:09.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>when Dana is wrong in an argument,</v>

134
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>but he's got this huge army that follows him and he said I'd rather hit.</v>

135
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I think his quote was Bev,</v>

136
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather watch [inaudible] fucking bad ass him fight,</v>

137
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I think he said something like,</v>

139
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>ambien takes.</v>

140
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Ben Asked her if it goes asleep.</v>

141
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

142
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:23.821
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

143
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:24.431
<v Speaker 1>there was a few of them.</v>

144
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>So the personal attacks started.</v>

145
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:25.781
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

146
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

147
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>that's number one.</v>

148
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.693
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

149
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

150
00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:30.380
<v Speaker 2>it's that thing,</v>

151
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:30.901

<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing this thing that she can't do.</v>

154
00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:34.910
<v Speaker 2>She's the wife is not a comedian.</v>

155
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.631
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing.</v>

156
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I think comics also have a bond that that I feel like the outside person can</v>

157
00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:42.200
<v Speaker 1>never totally understand as well.</v>

158
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Just the way we joke around with each other,</v>

159
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190
<v Speaker 1>like if just the things you and I have said to each other,</v>

160
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.310

162
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd go to jail more than me.</v>

163
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.101
<v Speaker 1>I am the worse,</v>

241
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.940

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 2>We have to have a meeting.</v>

251
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.841
<v Speaker 2>And when she said that,</v>

252
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 2>the way she said it,</v>

253
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 2>I meant everything came over me like,</v>

254
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.593

00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>would you want to sit in the back?</v>

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Did you buy the ticket?</v>

261
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>And then left without any explanation.</v>

262
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.681
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>

263
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>When Roe,</v>

264
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 2>when Roe said that to me,</v>

265
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 2>my fucking head exploded it.</v>

266
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:46.964
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing I can say,</v>

267
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

268
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to fucking think about this all night.</v>

269
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.183
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

270
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 5>why did you stop being religious?</v>

271
00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.091
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

272
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 5>I started in high school and stopped in graduate school.</v>

273
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 5>So when you started being religious in high school,</v>

274
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 5>so it wasn't something that your family introduce you to.</v>

275
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.940
<v Speaker 5>My parents were pretty secular.</v>

276
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

277
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.820
<v Speaker 5>they weren't antireligious it,</v>

278
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

279
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't a thing then,</v>

280
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.180
<v Speaker 5>but this is 1971 when I was in high school and the,</v>

281
00:07:16.181 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 5>in the sort of Nissan born again,</v>

282
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 5>movement was starting and there was no religious affiliation.</v>

283
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:21.471
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>

284
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 5>it's me and Jesus.</v>

285
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

286
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 5>It's just you and the Lord.</v>

287
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of these um,</v>

288
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 5>very charismatic hip,</v>

289
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 5>young preachers that are doing sort of a thing like that where they don't even</v>

290
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:37.150
<v Speaker 5>have their own church to like rent time in the church and they have these</v>

291
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.180
<v Speaker 5>meetings where it's not,</v>

292
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.380
<v Speaker 5>it's just nondenominational and they just talk about God and yet they get a lot</v>

293
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 5>of people fired up.</v>

294
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

295
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.761
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

296
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:47.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

297
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.330
<v Speaker 5>the place I went to this place called the barn in Locker Santa where I grew up</v>

298
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

299
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

300
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 5>they played guitar and</v>

301
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 5>sang to a sex cult.</v>

302
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.630
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of one starts banging people.</v>

303
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 5>I was hoping for something like that,</v>

304
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

305
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.363
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

306
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.423
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

307
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 5>that is one of the problems with the utopia,</v>

308
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 5>the 19th century utopian experiments,</v>

309
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 5>they always turned into this free sex for the leader.</v>

310
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.831
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

311
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 5>it always seems like whenever there's a man that's in a position where people</v>

312
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 5>start worshiping him,</v>

313
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

314
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:15.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

315
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 5>and then they start hanging on his every word.</v>

316
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:18.591
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

317
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 5>I started going to start fucking some of these people.</v>

318
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

319
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.250
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

320
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 5>I covered Jim Jones and uh,</v>

321
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:24.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

322
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 5>the way I phrase it is that no one joins a cult.</v>

323
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 5>They join a group that they think is going to do good,</v>

324
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 5>save the world.</v>

325
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 5>Kind of helped me improve my life,</v>

326
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:33.710
<v Speaker 5>improve the lives of others.</v>

327
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 5>And there's pictures online.</v>

328
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 5>You can see if Jim Jones with Jerry Brown,</v>

329
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 5>governor Jerry Brown in his first round and you know,</v>

330
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 5>they were man in the soup kitchens.</v>

331
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 5>He was very liberal,</v>

332
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 5>open to African Americans being part of the church in San Francisco.</v>

333
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 5>They're gays women.</v>

334
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.821
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

335
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:47.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

336
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 5>it was a really cutting edge,</v>

337
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.131
<v Speaker 5>pioneering thing.</v>

338
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 5>And at the time it seemed like,</v>

339
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:50.500
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

340
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:50.700
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

341
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 5>that's a cool thing.</v>

342
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:52.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to join this group,</v>

343
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 5>not me,</v>

344
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:53.811
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

345
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 5>the people that did this in the fifties and sixties when he was coming up and</v>

346
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 5>then into the seventies and then,</v>

347
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>

348
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.241
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

349
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 5>he started having sex and drugs and then the,</v>

350
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:03.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

351
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 5>the feds started kind of poking around and taxes and that's when they went to</v>

352
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.790
<v Speaker 5>South America speaking,</v>

353
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 5>which I think this week is the spike specialists now,</v>

354
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 5>the paramount network on Waco and waco going on,</v>

355
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Speaker 5>like right now.</v>

356
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like a started Sunday.</v>

357
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

358
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

359
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a six part series or something along those lines.</v>

360
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:22.591
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

361
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:23.331
<v Speaker 5>that's an interesting one.</v>

362
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:23.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

363
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

364
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

365
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm absolutely convinced most of these guys believe what they say now.</v>

366
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:28.060
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>

367
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 5>maybe they're bullshitters at the start or they only partially believe,</v>

368
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:32.170
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

369
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 5>they repeat their rhetoric,</v>

370
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 5>their followers give them positive reinforcement.</v>

371
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 5>They come to believe it.</v>

372
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

373
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.411
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

374
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.101
<v Speaker 5>David Koresh,</v>

375
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 5>he was right down the barrel.</v>

376
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 5>He choked,</v>

377
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.333
<v Speaker 5>totally believed,</v>

378
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 5>willing to die for his beliefs.</v>

379
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 5>And he also was having sex with everybody.</v>

380
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.030
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
