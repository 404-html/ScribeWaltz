00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.700
Yes and we launch and we're live.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.600
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by lumosity.com

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.500
Lumosity is essentially a gym for your brain,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.530
gives you a bunch of really cool exercises to stimulate your mind and you can

5
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.690
set them up.
He had that breathing heavy man breathing.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.900
That's John Hackleman and breathing into the microphone like a man.

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.410
We've had that issue before.
Eddie Bravo,
right?

8
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.200
Remember 80 Bravo fucking mugged that thing.

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.300
lumosity.com like I said,

10
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:40.410
an online gym essentially for your brain and how appropriate that we have the

11
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.860
pit master here when you're talking about online gyms and we're actually in an

12
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:48.600
area very,
very near where the original pit was.
This historical shit.

13
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.900
It brings back memories.
I'm sure Lumosity is.

14
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:56.901
Brain Games are designed by top scientist to train the mental processes and over

15
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:01.020
time you can track your progress online and compare yourself to other people.

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.330
Don't compare yourself to me.
You're going to feel sad.
I feel sad as fuck.

17
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.790
Fucking not as good at these brain games.

18
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.450
Plus he mosque Lumosity only takes a few minutes each day.

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.570
You can play from anywhere you computer,
iPad,

20
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.080
iPhone with the free Lumosity app so you can have fun,

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.360
work your brain and make Lumosity part of your everyday routine.
It's very um,

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.170
flexible.
When you go to Lumosity,
you can,
uh,

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.860
when you click on the get started now button,
you start screwing around with it.

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.170
And as you see,
when you start doing it,

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.540
go to lumosity.com forward slash Joe.
Um,

26
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.800
when you start entering in like what you're looking to,
uh,
to accomplish,
it's,

27
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.640
it's very fascinating because there's so many different aspects that they have

28
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:46.410
designed these games for like memory,
recalling the location of objects,

29
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.630
remembering names after the first introduction,

30
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:53.160
which a lot of people are super fucking bad at.
And attention,
maintaining,

31
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.830
focus on important tasks,
improving productivity,

32
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.650
like all these different things you're trying to improve and they've got these

33
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.240
games that are designed to try to meet those challenges and uh,

34
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.440
get your brain in shape.
I find it really fun and fascinating and a,

35
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:09.990
you could check out my special Lumosity page to get started.

36
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:14.991
Go Lou lumosity.com/joe Click the start training button.

And then start playing your first game.
That's lumosity.com/joe.

38
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.420
We're also brought to you by on at.com.
That's o.
N N.
I t.
Um,

39
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.830
if you haven't been there before on it ha is essentially what we like to call it

40
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:31.200
human optimization website.
We're just trying,

41
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.420
and I can only say that so many times in a row before.

42
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.290
I don't even like hearing to come on out my own mouth.
[inaudible] folks,

43
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.050
these things have to get done.
There's no other way to say it.

44
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.870
We have a bunch of really cool shit though.
If you've never been there before,

45
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:47.360
you'll enjoy it.
Um,
if you're into strength and conditioning,
we have,
uh,
a bit,

46
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.400
basically anything you could ever need like kettle bells,
battle ropes,

47
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:55.110
weight vest,
steel maces,
steel clubs,
ab wheels or things along those lines.

48
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.730
And we also have artistic ones.

49
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:59.870
We have these Zombie Bells and these primal bells that we,
um,

50
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.930
<v 1>had made by this sculptors named Steven Shubin junior and he's a bad</v>

51
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.970
motherfucker and made some cool ass kettlebells,
the chimpanzee ones,

52
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.150
the gorilla ones,
the great apes.

53
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.120
He should make a pit one with a skull pit version.
Yeah,
like you're a,

54
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.610
that's not a bad idea.
You could totally get something like that done.
Well,

55
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.580
if you do it though,
the key is like the,
one of the things that's real important,

56
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.610
like when we have these design is to make sure that they're actually balanced.

57
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.820
They don't just look really cool,
but they're not wacky.
They're not like they're,

58
00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:32.500
they're,

59
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.030
one of the things about a Kettlebell is that it's a uniform in its movements.

60
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.180
Like when you're swinging that kettle bell and you're controlling it,

61
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.350
it's very balanced.

62
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.700
You don't want it like waited 60% to one side and 40% to another and they'd be

63
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:46.534
all wonky.

64
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.340
So we worked very hard to make sure that these kettle bells are 3d balanced so

65
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:55.510
they don't just look cool.
The design actually is functional.
The Zombie Bells,

66
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:58.480
the the my favorite,
the primal bells,
all that stuff.

67
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.380
Strength and conditioning equipment,
supplements,
exercise,
DVDs,

68
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:07.381
all shit to improve the quality of the functionality of your body.

69
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.830
So get there and use the codeword Rogan and save yourself 10% off any in all

70
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.040
supplements.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,
okay,

71
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.670
we want to just get popping right away.
John motherfucking Hackleman is here.

72
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:22.660
Cue The music,

73
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.530
<v 2>the Joe Rogan experience.
Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

74
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.240
<v 1>I've been around martial arts since I was a little kid and uh,</v>

75
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.410
I have always loved to talk to guys like you that have not just been around

76
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:49.110
martial arts but come from a traditional martial arts background.

77
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:51.760
You were there for the birth of MMA.
You know,

78
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.650
you're still walking around did g pants and you still sport his fanny pack.

79
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.370
You don't give a fuck.
And you,

80
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:04.020
you've been around for a long time,
man.
You've been around through uh,
the,

81
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:08.790
the whole birthplace of MMA and trained arguably one of the greatest fighters in

82
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:12.530
the history of the game and chocolate,
Dell.
I mean,
we can argue,

83
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.780
impossible to argue right in.
Arguably,
I should have said no.

84
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.100
I mean top all,
one of the all time,
most exciting guys to watch ever,
ever,

85
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.160
ever.
And he was always like that.
And you were there through his entire ride,
man,

86
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.290
from day one.
Yeah.
I remember you were there when he fought,
was it?
No.

87
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.031
[inaudible] Hernandez.

88
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:33.360
Is that the guy that the cat's name that was a the boxer guy.
Yeah,

89
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.930
and they came up to chuck backstage and,

90
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.680
and John and John Perretti told chuck not to shoot on him because he found out

91
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:43.850
chuck was a wrestler.
I told him if he wants to work for the UFC,

92
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.880
you got to have to stand up and bang.
They stood up and banged all right.

93
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.090
He's tickled.
He stood up and bagged a lot.
Yeah,
we've been telling that guy.
Yes,

94
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:52.350
they do that.
So hilarious.

95
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.270
It's like you didn't have to tell him that he was going to do that anyway.
No,

96
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.850
he's,
he's chuck fucking Lidl.
I actually,
towards the end of his career,

97
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:03.470
I begged him not to so much and he still wouldn't,
he would not stop banging.

98
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:07.040
He Bang to the end.
Yeah,
he certainly did.
And it was,

99
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.420
he's talked about it before too,

100
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.930
that he just like would hit a guy and he'd know he had him hurt and it's just

101
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:15.890
killer instinct.
We just take over and he couldn't help it.
He couldn't help it.

102
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.830
He would,
he would,
we would spend hours and hours and hours with,

103
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.791
you know,

104
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:27.260
we put the little thing down between his chin and his shoulders to keep his chin

105
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:31.880
down.
Uh,
I'd keep stuff to keep his hands up,
put weights in his hands,

106
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:36.320
put stuff under his arms,
hours and hours.
And he would drill it,
drill a,
drill it.

107
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.250
And then the second he hit someone and just saw that little spark in the eye,

108
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:43.790
that killer instinct would take over.
And he dropped his hands to his hips.

109
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.910
He put his chin up in the air and just starts swinging for the knockout.

110
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.290
You'd forget everything.

111
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.580
Well the crazy thing about chuck is for the longest time he could take

112
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.310
everything.
Yeah,
he could take all of it.

113
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.520
And he beat a lot of guys cause he took their best shots.

114
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.520
And then when they didn't expect him to be around,
he's knocking them out.

115
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.690
Like Allister,
we fought Alastair and pride.
That was God damn wars are won.

116
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:09.890
Round War Alster came out very strong.
Hit him with some really good knees,

117
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:14.330
real sharp,
but chuck could fucking take it and stay in there.

118
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.830
Yeah.
And he would.
Yeah.
And he,
he hit so hard and uh,

119
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.110
and then when he,
he,
his Chin wasn't quite what it was.
He just,

120
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.950
he didn't want to change a style.
Uh,

121
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.600
we didn't want to turn it into a more cerebral game.

122
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:34.370
He wanted to go out a banger.
Hey,
did,
isn't that crazy?
Yeah.

123
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.840
Well I guess,
you know,
it's so hard for the average person,
even me included.

124
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.490
I might've been there for all of it,

125
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.240
but it's so hard for me to even understand what it must've been like to be that

126
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:47.270
guy.
You know,
that he was,

127
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.300
when the UFC first exploded,

128
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.630
chuck was the poster boy.
I mean,

129
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:58.631
he was the guy and you couldn't get like a better guy as far as like his style

130
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.740
and like the result of his fights.
Like,
if you wanted people to watch a fight,

131
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.790
you watch a chuckle Delphi,

132
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:09.650
like the Bob Aloof fights are the Randy fights and God damn,
he fought exciting.

133
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.651
I mean he was one of the most all time destructive guys in the history of MMA

134
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.240
and he,
he was the guy that was at the top right when it exploded.

135
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.190
So it was so fascinating.
So fascinating to watch that guy's career.
Yeah,
it was,

136
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.780
it was,
uh,
it was quite a ride.
Oh,
he was in an animal.
He was a fucking animal.

137
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.990
And here's when he stopped and Alastair this then pride.
Yeah.

138
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:35.990
That overhand right.
Crazy overhand.
Right.
He throws,

139
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.160
he had hit him a few times before that too though.
He had tagged him.

140
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.100
He was starting to wear on them.
Yeah.
And then boom,
we just put them away.

141
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.700
That crazy right hand that he used to throw it.
That was the strangest punch.

142
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.540
He would throw it right in between their gloves.
Yeah.
And,

143
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.950
and it's a glove was going to be the same.
Glover's got that bad.

144
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.740
<v 0>He's got some serious one punch knockout power too.</v>

145
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.170
<v 3>He,
yeah,
we were training yesterday and uh,
it's,</v>

146
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.180
it's scary because I want to use these hands usually with hard punches.

147
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.470
It hurts your shoulder when you're hitting the holding the meds.

148
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.020
But with him it goes,
it doesn't even,

149
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.710
it doesn't even hit the shoulders because it feels like your hands,

150
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.860
every time he hits it actually feels like you're the bones.

151
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.600
There's 28 little bones in your hand.

152
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.560
I mean there's 28 little bones in there and it feels like they're all separating

153
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.490
every time he hits.
And it,
I mean,
it's not even pain.

154
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:33.840
It just has such a weird feeling.
And I just,
I just,
you know,

155
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:37.440
and then I get flashbacks every time he hits me cause it hits my hand.

156
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:40.860
But it goes all the way into my brain and I have flashbacks to when I was 14

157
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:45.520
years old getting hit in the head by Samoans back in a while.
It's like,

158
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.090
I was like,
yes,
deep flashbacks play.
You're holding pads.
I do.
And I'm like,

159
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.640
uh,
but then I realize where I am.
I'm just thinking,

160
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.180
I just feel sorry for anyone that he hits and makes contact with,

161
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.660
with that punch.
Cause it's the punch I've never felt before.
It's the power.

162
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.700
Chuck had a different power.
Chuck Chuck's power was mainly that straight.
Right.

163
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:09.090
And then he had the overhand,
uh,
but it was timing.

164
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.720
Chuck was about timing.
Had great timing.
Very accurate too.

165
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.060
I saw him when he fought,
uh,

166
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.880
Vernon Forrest force for none.
That Jerry Foran,
Vernon white Vernon.
Why?

167
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.070
He was like,
tiger was walking backwards and I was yelling.

168
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.310
I was yelling at him this,

169
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.960
I was yelling at him for the signal for the right hand.

170
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.450
And he actually looked over and,
and went like that.

171
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:34.720
And the announcer said something like,
I think it was a you that fight.
Um,

172
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.971
he's think it was me.

173
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.580
Then he was looking over to the corner and they just turn around.
I said,
okay.

174
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.260
And he threw the right and he just,
boom.
I think,
I think it may have been me.

175
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.330
I do,
I do.
I think it was,

176
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:48.390
it was like when I first started working for the UFC and I was yelling,

177
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.290
I was yelling the number for that punch.
And he like looked okay,
bang,
I did it.

178
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.320
Then he was out.

179
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.600
<v 0>Yeah.
And he hit him right in the eyeball too.
That was a brutal pump.</v>

180
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.070
<v 3>He has.
Yeah.
He had,
uh,
he had really hard hands and he,</v>

181
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.890
he punched really hard and he had perfect timing and clover clover without the

182
00:11:05.891 --> 00:11:08.920
timing or with the timing.
I'm not saying he doesn't have the timing,

183
00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:12.880
but he doesn't need the timing.
He'll just,
he has Tyson power.

184
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.440
Like Tyson a one punch,
go to sleep.
Wow.

185
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.620
It's scary.

186
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.360
<v 0>Well,
I saw the Bader fight and you can see it in that fight,
you know,
and uh,
he,</v>

187
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:28.040
uh,
he performed very well against rampage to,
yeah.
And then,
you know,

188
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.330
you see the Kyle Kingsbury fight,
that was just an unbelievable mauling.
I mean,

189
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.160
Kingsbury's a really tough guy,
a really good athlete and such a great guy,

190
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:41.390
but Glover just was so outmatched him.
It was,
it was a mauling.

191
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.450
<v 3>We did not like that mint.
Chuck hated that fight.
In fact,
chuck,</v>

192
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.810
because we love Kyle and he his mind,
could you not?
Yeah,

193
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.250
he's my fanny pack of Jammy pack partner.

194
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.910
We actually have a jam off because I have a,

195
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.290
I have a song on a dance on Youtube cause I did a little dance and uh,

196
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.480
with my jammy pack,
I love to dance.
And uh,
so I challenged,
uh,
Kyle,

197
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:07.600
but I mean you can't not love Kyle when Kyle,
um,

198
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.540
would come around camp for chuck towards the end.

199
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.360
It was just not even as a spider point anymore.

200
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.830
Just you want him his energy.
His is,
he's a martial artist and uh,

201
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.290
and it,
he emulates just,
uh,
Kyle Kingsbury Enos.

202
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.220
<v 0>Yeah,
Kyle's a really good guy.
He just couldn't,
couldn't be nicer,</v>

203
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.160
couldn't be smarter.
And now I'm really good athlete too.

204
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.070
It's coming to Matt and Matt may late in his life though,
you know?
Yeah.

205
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.730
And it would've been interesting if that kid got involved in him and maybe he

206
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:40.520
was like 14 or something like that,
you know?
Oh,
he started later.
Yeah,

207
00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:44.930
I believe so.
I'm pretty sure he was an athlete first at Bressler.
Um,

208
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.810
I don't think he was a wrestler.
I think he's like a football player.
So,
yeah.

209
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.210
Super Athlete though.
Yeah.
I love love.
I don't know if he's retired.

210
00:12:53.211 --> 00:12:54.560
I think he was thinking of retiring.

211
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.580
He had a bunch of tough fights and Glover fight was one of them.

212
00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:00.690
It was a real tough fight.
It chuck was checking

213
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.730
<v 3>it was yelling from the side choke cause he was on top of him and and chuck just</v>

214
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:08.160
wanted to choke them out so they,
he would tap right.

215
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.810
Did not want any more damage.
Cause we love Kyle.

216
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.300
<v 0>Right.
We hated taking that fight.
Yeah.
Does it,
was that,</v>

217
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.170
is that dangerous when you have a situation like that and you know your guy is

218
00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:21.020
going to face him,
is that,
is it dangerous?

219
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.620
Is in any way like to have that attitude to go into a Dick?

220
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.110
Glover doesn't have that attitude.
Right.
He does it.

221
00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:29.300
I mean as much as he likes him,
he's there to do the job.

222
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.210
<v 3>Jack was a glove,
was there,</v>

223
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:35.860
did Java and clover didn't have the closeness that we did to him cause he came,

224
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.090
uh,

225
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:42.090
Kyle came around more when Glover was when on his hiatus to Brazil.

226
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.570
So he didn't have quite the closest.
He really liked him,

227
00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:50.860
but I mean the,
the MMA spirit,
um,

228
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.020
and I'll take out an m the maa spirit,
martial arts,
um,

229
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.550
is just so different than boxing,
which is,
I mean technically a marsh art too,

230
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:04.450
but they just don't carry themselves.
Most of them,
like martial artists,

231
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.510
they carry themselves like more like thugs or just they don't have the same

232
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:11.740
comradery.
I mean,

233
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.960
I have a picture of a sailor of his fight in,
I'm in Kentucky,

234
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:21.610
I don't even know.
I forgot the guy's name.
Really tough strong wrestler.
Um,

235
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.350
he lost a close decision.
It was his last fight.
Um,

236
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.190
but they were actually the day before the fight at the Wayne.

237
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.480
Um,
they were,
they were hanging out,
playing video games together,

238
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:39.010
like huddle together.
And I was,
and I didn't know who that guy was at first.

239
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.320
And I walked over,
hey,
what's up man?
What's your name?
And he's like,

240
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:45.550
so and so I go,
aren't you guys fighting tomorrow?
And they go,
yeah,
yeah,
coach,

241
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.290
we just gotta hold on.
We got to finish this game.

242
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:51.620
And they hung out for like two hours at the way in.
And then the day the fight,

243
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:55.250
they were like hanging out in the dressing room and then they went out and put

244
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:57.740
on a brutal,
I mean,
it was a very brutal fight.

245
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.000
It was a good fight and it was a brutal,
they didn't hold back anything.

246
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:02.930
They definitely fought.

247
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.400
<v 0>Yeah.
It was Dennis Bermudez who's a great guy as well.</v>

248
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.430
<v 3>Yeah.
And I mean,
and that's the comradery.</v>

249
00:15:08.431 --> 00:15:13.170
You don't see that in boxing and MMA.
You see it more than you don't.
Yeah.

250
00:15:13.171 --> 00:15:14.800
It's cool to see.
It's cool.
I love it.

251
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.620
<v 0>You know,
it was cool to when,
uh,</v>

252
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.010
when Anderson was champion and George St Pierre was champion,

253
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.450
all those champion Anderson was champion.
When,

254
00:15:24.451 --> 00:15:29.170
when those guys would like get into the cage and bow,
and I'd go,
well,

255
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.680
look at this.
Here's the best guys in the world today.

256
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.050
And all of them behave like martial artists.

257
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.280
All of them have the martial arts,
the the ethics,

258
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.570
all of them bow and face their opponent and they all are very well versed.

259
00:15:42.571 --> 00:15:46.740
They have lifelong Leono,
lifelong martial artists and those are the best guys.

260
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.690
It seems like as time goes on and as guys get better,

261
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.950
they start to realize that the correct way to live your life is the way the

262
00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:58.290
ancient warriors did.
Like they weren't stupid.

263
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.260
Like they didn't come up with all these ethics because it was cute.

264
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.450
They did it because it makes you a better person and all these ideas of peace

265
00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:11.070
and harmony until battle and the the,
the zen state of mind,

266
00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:14.490
the ability to achieve this oneness with,
with,
with the task at hand.

267
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:19.850
There's a reason why they invented all that stuff and for like boxers and you

268
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:23.370
know like a lot of MMA guys that came from even a wrestling background,

269
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.780
they don't recognize the power of that.
The,

270
00:16:27.781 --> 00:16:32.781
those philosophies like those philosophies remove a lot of the uncertainty and

271
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:36.210
the doubt that people have,
they removed.

272
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.840
You know who you are if you follow those philosophies.

273
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.170
<v 3>Yeah,
I,
I think I see a lot of the boxes didn't have that.</v>

274
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:47.200
And I came up in a box and background and I was on boxing teams.

275
00:16:47.201 --> 00:16:48.640
I was on the all army boxing team,

276
00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:52.630
I was on a lot of boxing teams and there was camaraderie with our team,

277
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.800
but there wasn't with other teams.
And I mean guys like chuck,

278
00:16:56.801 --> 00:17:00.880
I think chuck was one of the first guys that started that.
Um,

279
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:06.190
the Gracies did too.
Um,
but even,
even a lot of the wrestlers,

280
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.210
they've replaced Sensei with coach and they,

281
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:12.970
and they use the word coach with the same reverence that,

282
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.650
that a lot of karate guys,
you sensei and,
and so they,

283
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:21.250
I think a lot of the wrestlers do have a more of of that work ethic,

284
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:26.230
martial arts ethic.
Um,
and like I said,
it comes through with the coach and stuff,

285
00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:27.880
but you'll see that with chuck.

286
00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:32.100
We'll see that with the w Liotta when he kicked,
um,

287
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.270
Ms. Dot.
Munoz in the head.

288
00:17:34.271 --> 00:17:38.140
And he stood over him and he just like could've hit hidden one or two more
times.

289
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.090
And he,
he knew he was out and there's no need to.

290
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.550
But I've also seen Dan Henderson do that.
Um,
and I've seen him not do it,

291
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.450
but I've actually seen him do it when he wasn't angry at with a guy.

292
00:17:49.451 --> 00:17:52.880
I remember he did that with one of the graces and they Renzo or Enzo or didn't

293
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.733
need you that when he

294
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.880
<v 0>stop Henzel was completely out.</v>

295
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.100
<v 3>He could have hit him again.
And a lot of people do,</v>

296
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.330
a lot of people will every single time.
But yeah,
a lot of the guys just like,

297
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.070
they,
they know that no need to and some guys know that there's no need to,

298
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:08.970
but they still do.

299
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.080
<v 0>Yeah.
And sometimes it's the same guy.
It's just different fight.</v>

300
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.310
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But um,
but like,
uh,</v>

301
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.970
check had that from the very beginning.
He also had that with Randy,
you know,

302
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.890
cause they were,

303
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.460
they weren't like friends where they call each other and hang out,
but they were,

304
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.420
they were friendly.

305
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.800
And Randy came out to train with me a couple of times and they,
him and chuck,

306
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:33.360
that was before they fought the first time,

307
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:37.900
but not too far before they finally got signed to fight and they hung out a

308
00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:41.520
little.
So they were good.
They were,
they never weren't.
Okay.

309
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.890
Chuck was okay with almost all of his opponents.

310
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:45.660
He wasn't with two of them that I know of.

311
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:50.190
But I think every other one he was very friendly with before and after the
fight,

312
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.053
but never during,

313
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.890
<v 0>yeah.
Never during.
But yeah,
he's,
he recognizes there's no need to be an asshole,</v>

314
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.730
you know,
w you're going to fight no matter what.
I'll talk all you want,
all that.

315
00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:03.900
Great.
But when,
when all the guys did talk,
like if anybody,
like,

316
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.510
like Tito,
like it was a perfect example,

317
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.710
and that's like one of the more bitter rivalries that he had.

318
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.850
You know,
it's like you could see it pisses him off.
Yeah.

319
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.010
It's not really a good strategy.
Wasn't a good strategy to put to chuck off now

320
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.360
<v 3>and,
and Tito.
Yeah.
He said something about,
um,
you know,</v>

321
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:26.560
it bothered chuck the most,
um,

322
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.870
was not what someone said to him because he almost everything could go off his

323
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:34.500
shoulder.
I mean,
I mean,
you know,
like chuck,

324
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.810
who's Big Fan,
I think it's Shaq O'Neal or one of the basketball players.

325
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:40.740
I'm not sure who it was,

326
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.180
but he was actually in the dress room after chuck beat somebody and chuck came

327
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:48.620
in and this Shaq O'Neal or whatever is it.

328
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.010
That's an ideal Shaquille O'Neal.
And he said,
you're my favorite fighter.

329
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.290
And check talk to them.
I saw the way chuck,
you know,

330
00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.210
interact with them or a famous movie star Chuck Interact with him.

331
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:05.330
He interacted with a guy on the street asking for a quarter the exact same way

332
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.430
he interacts with everyone with dignity and respect.
Um,

333
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.760
and he's a family man,
like no other.
But so when,

334
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.490
when Tito did say some things,

335
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.540
he didn't bother chuck that what it said to him if by their chuck,

336
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:26.220
because he thought his kids would hear that and he didn't want his kids hearing

337
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:27.930
that kind of stuff.
So he was pissed.

338
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:33.120
And you saw this 23 punches land on Tito's face in about a second and a half

339
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:33.930
flat.

340
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.540
<v 0>That was one of his best performances.
Yeah.
And those,</v>

341
00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:38.790
those were epic fights and epic in,

342
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:42.330
in different ways like the Randy fights where epic,
those were,

343
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.020
those were defining cause I think the first one like losing that first one

344
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:47.830
really taught him something,
talking about

345
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.930
<v 4>being prepared and being condition that he just,
he got out worked,
you know,</v>

346
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:55.660
he got to a situation where he,
uh,
you know,

347
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.740
he underestimated and Randy's on top of him and he's exhausted and Randy pounded

348
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:00.350
on them.

349
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:05.030
<v 3>Yeah,
he was.
And uh,
chuck was never the conditioning guy.</v>

350
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.200
He trained really hard and gotten a condition,
but he didn't love to work out.

351
00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:11.330
He loves to fight.
He was a fighter.

352
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.870
I mean there's some people that love to fight and want to be a fighter,

353
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.080
but they don't know.
They love to be a fighter.
They want to be a fighter.
Check,

354
00:21:21.081 --> 00:21:24.200
love to fight.
He didn't care about being a fighter.
He just loved to fight.

355
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.680
He was in there 11 to five thing.
I contradict myself.
But he did.

356
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:31.670
He just loved to fight.
Um,
and,
and um,

357
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.900
he,
you know,
he just,
he just wanted to fight.
He didn't,

358
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.000
the conditioning part was so he could be,
you know,
be a better at fighting.

359
00:21:41.001 --> 00:21:43.610
He didn't love to work out.
He loved to fight.

360
00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:46.370
That was very few people do love the stove or loans yesterday.
Yeah.

361
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.330
Like Glover court McGee loves it.
Grilling Glover loves it.

362
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.850
<v 4>Yeah.
Court Mcgee.
He runs a lot with weight vests on too.
Right?</v>

363
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.900
<v 3>He does crazy stuff.
And I hail call me like every other day.
All right,
coach,</v>

364
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.000
what am I,
what am I doing?
10,

365
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.370
I'll put them on these crazy things and sometimes just,
you know,

366
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.190
not expect him to do the whole thing.
And they'll call me back that night.

367
00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:08.520
He goes,
well,
my time was so-and-so and I did this much weight.
And I was like,

368
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.930
Oh shit.
Okay.
And he's,
yeah,
he's a freak.
I mean,
he's a freak of,

369
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.700
of conditioning nature and,
and sales.
Glover.
Yeah.
I uh,

370
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.200
clover,
I brought Glover to a crossfit cause I'm a crossfit,
a certified guy.

371
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.250
Um,
and I brought him in the early days across that I brought him to a seminar,

372
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.140
a certification,

373
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.110
and they picked him out of the audience because he was the buff guy.

374
00:22:31.111 --> 00:22:34.590
And they want,
they always want to make them look bad.
So they were,

375
00:22:34.591 --> 00:22:38.280
so basically they're trying to call them out to try to dog him and they're

376
00:22:38.281 --> 00:22:41.940
trying to have them go against this girl doing overhead squats,

377
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.730
which is the really tough movement,
um,

378
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.900
for even a muscular guys cause it has so much to do with flexibility and balance

379
00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:51.900
and,
and,
and uh,
and shoulder pliability.

380
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.930
So they call him up and he did 21 of them in a row and everybody in the audience

381
00:22:57.931 --> 00:23:00.880
was like,
okay,
he just made it feel to you guys.
And then say,

382
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:02.490
the crossfit guys said,
okay,

383
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.780
now go to a muscle up and Glover,
what's a muscle of,

384
00:23:07.781 --> 00:23:08.790
I don't even know what that is.

385
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.400
So they showed them to the ranks and he did a muscle up.

386
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.290
He never even knew it and what it was.
No,
he did it.
So,

387
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.170
I mean that's clovers and natural,
uh,
free to just like a quarter's,
well,

388
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.760
all my guys have to go through my training regimen,
which most don't like,

389
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.710
but they actually love it.
They like,
Hey,
what did we do today,
coach?
So,

390
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.421
<v 4>well,
you're,</v>

391
00:23:29.421 --> 00:23:33.110
you're famous for having some pretty outlandish shuck strength and conditioning

392
00:23:33.111 --> 00:23:37.470
methods.
Like you like to use wheel barrels,
you like to use,
uh,
you'll,

393
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.710
you like to make guys do like heavy actual work.

394
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.990
<v 3>I want to,
I want them to,
yeah,
I do.
I have to work hard and I want it to,</v>

395
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.490
to that limit because in a fight you go to that limit so many times.

396
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:53.990
And I realized that and I had to get my strength and conditioning and stuff in

397
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:58.550
order by reading books because at 14 years old and Honolulu,
Hawaii,

398
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.010
and when I decided I wanted to fight in the golden gloves,

399
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.770
I didn't know how to get in shape.
So I went to the library,

400
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:08.630
I was in junior high school and I got a library library book and it was a rocky

401
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:11.420
Marciano and I read that.

402
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:15.110
So I learned that I should go run two miles every day.
That's what Marsianno did.

403
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.960
He ran and there was a bunch of other stuff but there was since he,

404
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.170
what do you think it was bad though cause I was trying to gain weight and rocky

405
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:24.710
Marciano was light for heavyweight so he,

406
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.890
he advocated eating a lot of Graham crackers and shakes and riff crackers and

407
00:24:30.161 --> 00:24:32.120
crackers and shakes.
It was in his book,

408
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:35.690
his book is like Britain and probably 1952 but uh,
he,

409
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.020
cause he said that way we'll put on some extra muscle.
He was,

410
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.770
he was a heavyweight,
you know,
and he was walking around it like,
you know,

411
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:44.690
172 pounds

412
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.110
<v 0>once the only that light,
I thought he was about one 90</v>

413
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.300
<v 3>no,
he would fight.
He would try to fight.</v>

414
00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:52.450
I think he would get in the high eighties but he would walk around lighter and

415
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:56.650
he would try to gain the way to weigh in because there's no way clause.
Yeah.

416
00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.340
<v 0>Wow.
That's crazy.
I didn't know,
I thought he was a,
I thought it was very light,</v>

417
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:03.260
but we're in people smaller back then,

418
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:08.180
except for guys like Primo Carnera and you know who fought,
did he fight Lewis?

419
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.120
Who?
The Primo Carnera fight.
He fought Dempsey,

420
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.120
didn't he get knocked out of the ring by Dempsey?
Yeah,
I think it was Dempsey.

421
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.770
Yeah,
it was before the famous picture.
Yeah,
that's right.
And he was a legitimate,

422
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.450
enormous giant guy.
Sevenish yeah,
he was seven feet.
Huge.
Huge.

423
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.260
But like Joe Lewis also fairly light guy,
right.
He was in the 90s.

424
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.850
That's so crazy.
Yeah.

425
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.430
It's so hard for people to imagine that the heavyweight champion of the world

426
00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:32.290
was a buck 90.

427
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.380
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
And I mean,
and when you look at someone like,
um,</v>

428
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.220
like mark Marsianno hits so hard,
you know,
or even Mike Tyson,

429
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.860
I mean,
I mean he,
he,

430
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:49.130
he bulked up and wait in what to 12 to 15 solid as a rock.

431
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.820
Yeah.
And he was so,
he was smaller than most of his opponents.

432
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.810
<v 0>He was such a God damn nightmare though.</v>

433
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.770
Doesn't Mike Tyson of the 1980s what a nightmare.

434
00:25:59.771 --> 00:26:03.430
It must've been the fight that guy,
like just try to keep them off,
keep them off,

435
00:26:03.431 --> 00:26:06.820
keep them off.
And he's just swinging at you.

436
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.860
<v 3>Yeah.
And every pint in we even and every punch and he,
and he was such a,</v>

437
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.930
he was such a student of the game.
Yeah.
Huge,
huge team in the game.
So he knew,

438
00:26:16.931 --> 00:26:21.520
he knew exactly how to land those lows.
Solid punches.

439
00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:26.080
And that's,
that happens to be clover's idle.
Yeah.
Not In life,
but as a,
as a,

440
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.250
as a fighter.
Well,
uh,

441
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:32.000
<v 0>didn't gloss over,
have a fight and Tyson was in the audience and he</v>

442
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.810
<v 3>came up and hugged him afternoon.
Which fight was that?
That was a,</v>

443
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.200
the one that was to Hoonah that's doing that.
It was a tough mother.

444
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.370
He's very tough.
Very tough.
So Glover is now

445
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.980
<v 0>finally after all this time for a lot of folks who don't know,</v>

446
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:52.310
there's very few guys to this day that aren't in the UFC that you look at and

447
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.600
you go,
damn,
I wish that guy was in the UFC.

448
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.970
Like pretty much all of them are in the UFC today.

449
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.230
There's a couple of guys in my opinion,
um,
uh,

450
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:05.490
I think Michael Chandler and Eddie Alvarez or two guys that I'd love to see in

451
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:09.010
the UFC,
I think they're super high level.
You know,
I think,
um,

452
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.260
I think there's some,

453
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.990
there's some talented guys that fight in other organizations,

454
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:16.890
but the big name was always Glover.
It was always the guy can't get a visa.

455
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.170
I can't get a visa.
And people would tell you,

456
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:21.000
wait till you see this motherfucker.

457
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.250
And I watched some of his fights online and then,
you know,

458
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.630
we finally got a chance to have them in the octagon and I was like,
wow.
Yeah,

459
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:31.560
this guy's legit.
He's very legit.
He's very well rounded.

460
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:36.510
Like what an epic,
well rounded game,
good kicks,

461
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.070
good punches,
good chin,
good aggression,
great Jujitsu,

462
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:46.080
good wrassling,
vicious ground and pound,
very solid,
you know,
not,

463
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:46.950
not really missing anything.

464
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.580
Conditioning is off the hook conditioning and the ability to take a shot and

465
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:53.250
then recover really quickly and hurt the other guy.

466
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.060
Like the Bader fight was a perfect example of that.
You know,

467
00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.870
Bay Bader clipped him and he knocked,
paid her out cold just a few seconds later.

468
00:28:00.871 --> 00:28:05.200
I mean,
it was just a beautiful left hand that he and landed on Bader.
Yeah.

469
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.330
He's a monster man.

470
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.020
<v 3>Yes.
Well he fought,
showed Yuca</v>

471
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.230
<v 0>[inaudible] yeah,
I saw that fight that was in WC.
Right.</v>

472
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:15.960
<v 3>Devy see,
and that was,
uh,
that was a fight that,
uh,
um,</v>

473
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.550
Dan Henderson called me and asked me to take because Dan was,
uh,
managing,

474
00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:23.260
uh,
so Gq.

475
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.350
<v 0>Yeah.
Here's,
so could you,
here's him just teeing off on,
so could you,
yeah.</v>

476
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.110
He crushed that dude.
And so could you was like,

477
00:28:30.111 --> 00:28:34.640
after that went on that Hoe that horrifying tear in pride,
right?
Well,

478
00:28:34.641 --> 00:28:38.600
he was destroying people.
It started with a Roman destroyed or run it.

479
00:28:38.601 --> 00:28:42.020
And we started with [inaudible].
He fought little Nog,

480
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.050
knocked out little Nog with a wrist.
Remember that he like,

481
00:28:45.051 --> 00:28:49.010
went to throw like a left hand and like caught him with the wrist and starched

482
00:28:49.011 --> 00:28:53.180
him.
I mean,
he had unbelievable power.
He knocked him out,

483
00:28:53.181 --> 00:28:56.660
knocked a rona out,
and one of the most terrifying Kaos ever.
And you thought,

484
00:28:56.661 --> 00:29:00.350
Holy Shit,
who's going to beat this guy?
Like,
and then you realize,

485
00:29:00.351 --> 00:29:02.810
well he was Homans already beat him.
Glover beat them.

486
00:29:02.811 --> 00:29:04.610
And then you wash the Glover fight and you're like,
Whoa,

487
00:29:04.611 --> 00:29:06.980
what the fuck man Glover is an animal.

488
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.963
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

489
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.440
In any of that really fast knock out a six second knock out of uh,

490
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.630
is another WDC fight the guy out of a vandelays camp.

491
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.550
<v 0>I Dunno,
it was,</v>

492
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.000
<v 3>yeah,
George,
it was George something.
Not Jorge,</v>

493
00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:24.834
but George,

494
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.170
<v 0>well Glover's now going to fight for the title and it's really interesting</v>

495
00:29:29.171 --> 00:29:33.240
because it's a no,
it was long time coming just to get him into the,

496
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:37.900
the UFC had visa problems for a solid six mirrors nightmare and now he's

497
00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:39.570
fighting John Jones and uh,

498
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.820
Gino John is coming off really tough fight with Gustafson.

499
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.110
I think Jon Jones is going to be highly,
highly motivated.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,

500
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.430
he realizes how close that fight was and how dangerous that fight was.
That was,

501
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.240
that was a wake up call kind of a fight where it's like,
look man,
you know,

502
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:56.140
this is out there,

503
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.310
that Gustafson guys are out there and just go over to share guys out there too.

504
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.720
So I think John is going to come in like super motivated and he's such a

505
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:08.920
talented kid too.
I mean Jon Jones,
think about that guy,

506
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.570
youngest guy to ever win MMA title at at the highest level,

507
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:16.750
fights shogun for the title and stops him.

508
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.650
I mean he beats him up,
beat him up,
murders a mall,
awesome.

509
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.120
Hit Him with a flying knee seconds into the fight.
Just so creative.

510
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.380
So like ticks a lot of chances and risk does a lot of shit that you don't expect

511
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.700
and and still doesn't even as a champion,
you know,
I mean,
he's not,

512
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:37.490
he's not changing his game at all as a champion.
No,
he's a,

513
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.210
he's a bad motherfucker.
That is a fantastic fight.

514
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.770
<v 3>Yes it is.
A lot of tools.
But yeah,</v>

515
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.640
that one,
that one punch.
I just,

516
00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:53.320
I keep thinking of my hands separating and the bones in them and just how hard

517
00:30:53.321 --> 00:30:58.030
he hits.
I'm like,
it's going to be a good fight and it's a,
it's a great matchup.

518
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.620
But it's,
I mean,
I don't think,
I mean I,
you know,

519
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:07.621
I would get real nervous to fight Jones real nervous to fight someone like even

520
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.360
jail who's like his takedowns are so crazy,
be so nervous to fight,

521
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.550
you know,
rampage cause it was aggression.
There's,

522
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.020
there's so many guys with so many tools,
Anderson,
but that,

523
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.780
just knowing the power that that clover has,

524
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:26.590
I think that would put the most fear into me.
Wow.
Just,

525
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:30.580
he's just hitting that hard.
It just be like,
what do I do?
I can do this,

526
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:34.060
this and this and this and get away from it.
And I could try to do this on him.

527
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.350
But the second that handled lands,
it's going to,
I don't know what to do.

528
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.740
What's not going to break.

529
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.400
<v 0>Do you have any videos of him like hitting the bag or hitting the pads that are</v>

530
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.234
online?

531
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:49.210
<v 3>Uh,
not really.
We did one yesterday and Instagram one.</v>

532
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.450
<v 0>People love watching training videos.
Yeah.
People love watching those.</v>

533
00:31:54.451 --> 00:31:55.470
I love watching those.

534
00:31:55.471 --> 00:31:59.340
Like I love those countdown to the UFC shows because I get here you go right

535
00:31:59.341 --> 00:32:02.940
here.
You get to see in those countdown to the UFC shows.

536
00:32:02.941 --> 00:32:05.910
He get to see guys in their honing things up,

537
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.970
tightening their skills and it just makes the anticipation,

538
00:32:08.971 --> 00:32:11.190
the fight ever more exciting.

539
00:32:11.191 --> 00:32:15.510
You know like this upcoming card this weekend,

540
00:32:15.511 --> 00:32:20.280
the Fox card Henderson versus a Josh.
Yeah,
that's Josh Thompson.

541
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.940
Yeah.
Fucking love that fight.
That is a great fight.

542
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.090
Ben Henderson and Josh Thompson.
Yeah.

543
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.730
That is going to be an exciting car that's in Chicago,

544
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:34.120
<v 3>Huh?
Yeah.
Loved that fight.
I love both of them.</v>

545
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.310
<v 0>Those guys are dead.
I love that Josh Thompson is finally getting his due.
Yeah.</v>

546
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.980
He's been of the top guys at

547
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.980
<v 1>155 pounds for a long time and it took that Nate Diaz fight for people to see,</v>

548
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:47.600
you know,
of a focused,

549
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.280
motivated Josh Thompson is undoubtedly world class.

550
00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.690
I mean the first guy to stop Nate Diaz like that in the octagon.
I mean,

551
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.980
who do you remember?
Anybody ever doing that to Diaz?
It's tough as shit date.

552
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:02.570
Nate Diaz takes a hell of a punch.
Hell of a punch.
He's durable as fuck.

553
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.860
Josh Thomson stopping him was a huge victory that you really got to see what

554
00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:11.360
Josh has fully capable of coming into his own.
You know,
he's got it all.

555
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:12.620
He's a great wrestler

556
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.480
<v 0>in this fight with Gilbert Melendez.
Woo.</v>

557
00:33:15.481 --> 00:33:20.100
That last fight with Melendez and strike force.
What a fight that was.
God Damn,

558
00:33:20.101 --> 00:33:22.680
that was a fun fight.
That was a really,

559
00:33:22.681 --> 00:33:26.040
really close fight to a lot of people had to Thompson winning that fight.

560
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:30.390
You know,
it was very closed.
Very controversial.
And what a great fight it was.

561
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.820
Gilbert Melendez.
A fucking savage.

562
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.390
<v 1>Yeah,
he's,
he's uh,
he's like an old school Mexican boxer.</v>

563
00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.980
I love that dude.
Love watching that dude fight.
Yeah,
he'll go.
Yeah.

564
00:33:41.981 --> 00:33:45.340
Like he chose to get into a fight like that with Diego.

565
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.930
Like he could have avoided that.
He could have fought like a,
you know,

566
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:52.990
more tactical.
Could he used his wrestling more?
Could have,
nope.

567
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.130
Just met them in the center.
And they both threw down.
Whew.

568
00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:01.840
They fought if I'd a Henderson the same way.
Yup.
Yeah.
Yup.

569
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.110
<v 0>That was a very,
very close fight as well.
Very close,
very close fight.</v>

570
00:34:05.111 --> 00:34:10.111
I love that these guys are so evenly matched because one or two or more are

571
00:34:10.751 --> 00:34:12.640
going to have to rise to the occasion.

572
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.630
They're going to have to see what's going on in this division and you to fucking

573
00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:21.070
insane division where you got Anthony Pettis who's just Uber talented kid.

574
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.270
Ridiculous kicker.
I mean by probably one of the best kickers in MMA today,

575
00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:29.050
one of the best strikers,
like tactical strikers.
He's so slick.

576
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:32.650
And then you take him to the ground and he's got laser sharp Jujitsu.

577
00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.270
I mean that arm bar was fucking magical.
It was so perfect the way.

578
00:34:37.271 --> 00:34:41.460
Set that up and slapped it on.
It was a vice,
I mean that was going nowhere.

579
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:45.280
The fight was over.
That was like real high level shit.

580
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.800
So you got him and then you got Benson.

581
00:34:47.801 --> 00:34:52.110
He's fantastic and guarantee you he's going to be motivated as hell coming off

582
00:34:52.111 --> 00:34:53.890
of the loss and coming off of,
you know,

583
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:56.500
he just didn't think he was going to get caught in that position.
He was on top.

584
00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.150
He thought he was okay.
Kent getting caught like that.
Losing twice.

585
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.800
<v 1>I wrote to him,
he's kickboxer.
Yeah,
exactly.
Well,</v>

586
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:07.760
you can't call this a kickboxer.
He's too good.

587
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.710
Then you don't think he's a kickbox and you get kid kicked out of the liver.

588
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.460
Yeah,

589
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.470
<v 0>well I remember watching him on the ground before he was knocking him.</v>

590
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.760
He's still always kicking really well and always doing really well,

591
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.760
but there was a couple of fights where he got taken to the ground where I was

592
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.660
even more impressed with the way cinched up a cha,
a triangle on somebody.

593
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:29.580
I forget the fight,
but I was like,
Whoa,
this kid is legit.
Not just stand up,

594
00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:34.470
but he's dangerous as fuck from his back,
which is rare among fighters.

595
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.623
Fairly rare.

596
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.430
<v 1>He's like,
he's,
he's definitely</v>

597
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.590
<v 3>coming off of a or comes from a very,
very talented and creative camp.</v>

598
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.450
Duke Roufus is a,
what,
a gem of a human being too.
You know,

599
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.210
couldn't get a nicer guy to like run your camp and he runs.
Yeah.

600
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.530
He runs it and he runs it well.
Yeah.
He,
I think he's,

601
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.150
he's probably one of my favorites.

602
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.170
<v 0>Mine as well.
He's a great coach.
He's a just a great guy too.</v>

603
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:04.650
I love sitting there and talking to him and picking his brain and I've had long

604
00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:07.740
conversations with him picking his brain about striking techniques and about

605
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.340
what guys are doing differently and what,
you know,
what,

606
00:36:10.341 --> 00:36:14.280
what you have to do to avoid this and why this guy is standing like this and

607
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:17.520
he's setting up that and then,
you know,
he's got such a wealth of knowledge.

608
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.180
<v 3>Yeah.
He's,
I'm more like,
just go</v>

609
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.430
<v 0>if you get,
no,
it was,
man,
you give great corner advice,
I'll tell you that.
Yeah.</v>

610
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.560
Fuck No.
You know what's good about your corner advice?
You're,

611
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:32.970
you don't freak out.
You don't,
you don't lose your calm.
You're always common.

612
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:37.080
The guy down while you're in there.
I'll never forget.
Um,
uh,

613
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.450
when court fought the,
that first big fight,
was it Ryan?

614
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.110
Um,
God dammit Jansen.
Yes.
Ryan Jensen.

615
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.490
That was the fight and Ryan Jensen came out like a house on fire in the first

616
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:55.410
round.
So huge to Tammy looked good in that,
in that first fight.

617
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.640
I mean it was one of the best performances of Ryan's career.

618
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.640
That first round,
the first round of that fight is scary.

619
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:06.750
And then you got him down,
you got court in between rounds and you said,

620
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:08.910
I'll never forget this because you're so calm.
He said,
don't worry,

621
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:11.850
your conditioning is going to take over.
You're going to take over from here.

622
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.100
And that dude came out like a God damn John Hackleman robot and just did exactly

623
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:20.750
that.
Just put it on him,
chased him down and eventually finished them.

624
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.730
And I was like,
wow,
that is a unbelievable turnaround of events because yeah,

625
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.890
it was,
cause Kyle,
it looks so good in that fight.
Or Ryan Rather,

626
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:33.180
Ryan Jensen looks so good in that fight,
in that first round.

627
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.440
I mean he showed like his real potential that he's a really talented kid,

628
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.020
that you know,
there's a lot of those guys that are like that,

629
00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:43.230
these really talented kids that may or may not ever fight for the title,

630
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:46.380
but they had moments inside that cage where you're like,
Whoa,

631
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.740
this guy's got potential.
And I think that first round was one of them.
But yeah,

632
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:54.540
the way you were so calm and so like collected in the corner.

633
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.990
You like you had a physically calming effect,
you know,

634
00:37:57.991 --> 00:38:00.270
and all your experience and you're talking to him.

635
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.730
It's pretty valuable shit to have in your corner,
man.

636
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.080
<v 3>Yeah,
I was,
I was pretty nervous going down.
I think the,
the,</v>

637
00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:11.970
another close one in the corner was clay harvest sin against Justin Edwards.

638
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.280
Put Key,
get closer to that thing or pull it closer to you if you could.
Yeah,

639
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:16.680
I think another club,
there we go.

640
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:21.930
A closer one was a clay harvest and when he fought Justin Edwards.
Yeah,

641
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.540
another,
it was so close.

642
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.560
Then sometimes you can tell that the guy just needs this or that said or either

643
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:35.500
whether it be instruction,
direction or motivation.

644
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.700
I mean,
you never tell a guy you're losing,
right.
I'll never tell the guys listen,

645
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.600
because all he's going to hear,
like when you,
you know,
when you're a parent,

646
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:48.190
you tell,
you tell the kid you're acting stupid.
All he hears is your stupid.

647
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.300
Even though I have said that before as a parent,
um,
but when you say you know,

648
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.790
you're losing,
they're just going to,
you know,

649
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:58.040
you're going to lose or anything with the word losing in it.
It's just,

650
00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.680
it's a negative and they're just going to hear,
oh shit,
I lost.
And they,

651
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.630
it takes a little bit,
I think out of them.

652
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.100
<v 4>What do you do though?</v>

653
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:08.710
When a guy's lost four rounds in a row and you've got to give them some kind of

654
00:39:08.711 --> 00:39:12.350
instruction,
you just go straight technical.
Do you tell him he has to win this?

655
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.690
You have to stop this fight.

656
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.090
<v 3>You have to sell instead of saying when you lost the four rounds,</v>

657
00:39:17.091 --> 00:39:19.940
you just say you have to win this one.
Right.
You know,

658
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:21.230
you have to win this next round.

659
00:39:21.231 --> 00:39:25.100
You have to knock him out or you going to lose and then you gonna lose your

660
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:28.910
house and your kids and your wife will probably divorce you and somebody will

661
00:39:28.911 --> 00:39:32.870
fucking take your lunch money when you get home.
That's a lot of pressure.

662
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.160
I think you put an extra pressure on them.
I don't know.
Yeah.
So is that okay?

663
00:39:37.161 --> 00:39:39.560
So I want to see human.
Sometimes I get emotional.

664
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.381
<v 4>Does it vary?</v>

665
00:39:40.381 --> 00:39:44.310
Does your approach vary depending on like the guy different for chuck,

666
00:39:44.311 --> 00:39:45.300
the Navy for Siler?

667
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:49.070
<v 3>Yeah.
Very different.
And you just have to feel the guy and then feel the fight.</v>

668
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:53.210
Cause I've been doing corners since [inaudible] 74 1974.

669
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.470
<v 4>That's insane.</v>

670
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:58.950
<v 3>Yeah.
Tell me,
I,
so I,
I mean I get like,
I'm real emotional too,</v>

671
00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.820
especially with my fighters.
Um,
and I get,
some of it is,

672
00:40:02.821 --> 00:40:04.200
I'll have my own little breakdowns,

673
00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:07.140
but I don't want them to see it cause I get very emotional.

674
00:40:07.141 --> 00:40:11.850
I've had like Chuck Glover,
I vet all my guys at one time or another.
Go coach.

675
00:40:11.851 --> 00:40:14.010
It's okay man.
Just relaxed because I get really,

676
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.820
sometimes I get worked up too cause I get really nervous cause I don't like to

677
00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:19.920
see my guys see.

678
00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:22.980
I'd rather have all my guys in my gym training,

679
00:40:22.981 --> 00:40:27.960
having a great time doing Hawaiian Kempo doing pit stuff,
hitting the bag,

680
00:40:27.961 --> 00:40:31.500
spying once in a while,
but nobody fighting.
That would be,

681
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.960
that'd be my dream come true.

682
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.970
My passion is training people and having fun training with them and just having

683
00:40:38.971 --> 00:40:40.080
a martial arts school,

684
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.820
putting our geese on and going to the beach on Saturdays with our gies and

685
00:40:44.821 --> 00:40:49.200
running and everybody looks at us and we're just like,
Hey,
what's up?
But uh,

686
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:54.730
but the chuck stopped all that cause that's what we're,

687
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.300
that's the path I was on.
You know,

688
00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.460
I retired from fighting and I didn't want to fight anymore.
I hate fighting.

689
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.120
I hate fighting when I was fighting,
you know.
But that's all I knew how to do.

690
00:41:03.121 --> 00:41:05.700
And that's what,
it's a long story.
Growing up in Hawaii,

691
00:41:05.701 --> 00:41:09.070
it wasn't a pretty picture.
Um,
uh,

692
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.950
but then chuck come came to me one day and just said,
Hey John,
you there?

693
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.500
You can try fighting.
I was like,
what do you mean?
He was like in the ring.
I go,

694
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.610
whoa,
you serious bro.
I've already fought enough for all of us.
Let's just,

695
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.640
let's just have fun training.
He goes,
I just want to try it.

696
00:41:23.641 --> 00:41:28.320
If it doesn't work out,
it doesn't work out.
I go,
all right.

697
00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:31.690
Just a couple of fights and to see where it goes.
And it was chocolate l so,

698
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.203
so after,

699
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.550
by plans of just having a fun little martial arts school called the pit and a

700
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:42.020
bunch of fun guys training and having a great time and wearing a Gucci all over

701
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:46.860
the place and fanny packs and shit.
And it went to hell.
Well,

702
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.430
fucking hell.
I never came back.
One of the greatest careers in,
in training ever.

703
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.540
And it went to hell.
It went down.
And then because chuck,

704
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:59.810
towards the end of his career,
you know,
we decided,
okay,

705
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:03.460
we decided when he was going to retire.
And,
um,

706
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.790
there was a little controversy on that,
uh,
with the Dana white thing.
Um,

707
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.230
but we,
I mean all of us,
including Dana,
who,
you know,

708
00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:17.240
we went ahead a couple of interactions but he loves chuck like I do.

709
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:20.810
And he always wanted the best for chuck.
Like I did and it was like,

710
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.380
but we're coming from different angles.
How as a trainer,
and he was a promoter,

711
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.920
you know,
uh,
and we,
but we both love chuck and wanted the best for chuck.

712
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.190
But then towards the end of his career I go,
Oh shit,

713
00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:35.660
okay you take over the team and I'm just going to go work,
you know,

714
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:40.400
work with working in my school and do my what I love to do the pit and you can

715
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:44.270
train the fighters and I'll help you out.
But I don't want to travel anymore.

716
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:48.350
I don't want to work anymore corner cause all right man.
No problem.
Yeah,
yeah.

717
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.270
We see how that worked out.

718
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:55.310
Now he's like fucking Kardashians in Calabasas and he doesn't even have the
time.

719
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.340
He doesn't even have the time basically for anything but to be chuckling.

720
00:42:59.341 --> 00:43:03.290
L and that's all he,
that's his,
that's his life now.
While he's a legend,

721
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.500
he's a legend and a superstar and ease and there's nobody that,

722
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.580
that deserves it more.

723
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.140
And he's a great representative of the sport because he's like Super Nice Guy.

724
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.980
He's a,
he's a great person,
a rep,
uh,
representative of being a man.

725
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.580
He's starting a family.
He's the most loyal,
he's a low,

726
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:23.570
most loyal human alive.
He's a scary stuff.

727
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.470
He's a very noble guy and people don't even know the stories about him.

728
00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:30.470
And he's just,
he is that guy through and through.
And I mean,

729
00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:32.990
I'm probably the closest to him and I just,

730
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.550
I know you know everything it is.
If it wasn't for one guy,

731
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.580
you wouldn't be known as a trainer.
I think I,
yeah,
probably could.
Oh,

732
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.780
I wouldn't be training.
I think if it wasn't for him,
they'd still be,
you know,

733
00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:47.420
some of the other guys that were around.
But I'd be,

734
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.600
you'd be a martial arts and striving.
That's about,
I'd be,
and I'd be so happy.

735
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:53.960
I said,
what is it about the competition?

736
00:43:53.961 --> 00:43:58.190
What is it about fighting that is distasteful or you don't like or nerve
racking?

737
00:43:58.191 --> 00:44:00.740
What is it?
I mean,
I,
you know,
people you love competing.

738
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:02.260
It makes me cry and I don't,

739
00:44:02.261 --> 00:44:06.350
I don't like to cry and I definitely don't like my guys to see me cry.

740
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.370
How does it make you cry?
It makes me sad just to see them get hit really.

741
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.040
And just realizing what I went through when I was fighting and,

742
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.040
and not liking and not wanting to do it.

743
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:20.450
And then just wanting to be at a different place and getting so nervous and then

744
00:44:20.451 --> 00:44:24.350
the late let down of the fight.
We know whether they win or lose.
I mean,

745
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.970
I did mean let down,
like if they lose,

746
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:28.910
but just it's over now and you're just like,
okay.

747
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:34.200
But then I know I have to do it again.
But I love these guys.
I mean,
I love,

748
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.520
I love all of them.
I mean,
now that I've been involved in the sport,

749
00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:42.840
I've become like,
you know,
I just like all these guys,
not even my own guys.

750
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:46.950
There's so many guys out there.
I,
I hate to see,
you know,
I get to see,

751
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.220
I hate to see any of the guys lose.
And even worse than that,

752
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:53.670
I hate to see them get hurt cause I know it hurts him.
No.
So I just,

753
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:55.920
I just don't like that.
So yeah,
if it wasn't for Chuck,

754
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:59.070
I'd be teaching karate happy as a pig in shit somewhere.

755
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.620
Just kind of to almost done.
Let's go

756
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.550
<v 0>take on chuck,
was he,
he's going to retire when he wants to retire,</v>

757
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.440
when he chooses to retire.
He's a man.

758
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:10.530
He's one of the great champions of all time.
When he chooses to retire,

759
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:14.610
that's when he retires.
And Dana was like,
look,
that's it.
You're retired.

760
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.370
And so that's where you guys had your issues.

761
00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:22.371
Yours was almost sort of out of maybe like so much respect for the man and as a

762
00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:27.660
competitor that you'll likely,
it's up to him.
He's got to make the decision,

763
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.300
you know,
you can listen to my advice,
but it doesn't matter.

764
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:34.290
You've got to make the decision where it's,
Dana was like,
he loves them.
I mean,

765
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.010
no doubt about it.

766
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.160
Dana fucking loves chocolate and he was looking at first best then.

767
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:40.860
And I say for a promoter,
I mean it's contrary.

768
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:45.510
It's contour counter to his own financial interests.
Chuck was a huge paper view.

769
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:48.870
Draw still would be if he came back today,
we got,

770
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:52.350
imagine God dammit if chocolate Gal came back today and him and Randy went out

771
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:56.680
at again,
chocolate Randy for Jesus Louisa.
So that would be a big pay per view.

772
00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:58.910
Wouldn't happen.
It wouldn't happen.
It would never happen.

773
00:45:59.120 --> 00:45:59.690
<v 3>I would,</v>

774
00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:04.640
I don't care if I baseball bat break his legs and be like Nancy Kerrigan.

775
00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.470
<v 0>But if it did whatever,
what I'm saying is it would be a huge,
huge event,</v>

776
00:46:08.471 --> 00:46:11.200
but the UFC would never do it.
You know,
they would never get,
well,
first of all,

777
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.190
yeah,
they would never do it.

778
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.410
<v 3>Oh,
he wanted,
but what people don't realize,
including Dana,</v>

779
00:46:16.411 --> 00:46:19.460
was I wanted to check to retire from before he even started.

780
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.900
I didn't want him to fight it all.
So it's was like,

781
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:26.450
but now he's fighting and he loves fighting.
It's his passion.
I mean,

782
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.120
he's going to say was say,
quit.
If I saw him get hurt really bad

783
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:36.000
like I did with retrain Clin,
right then it was done.
And,
and,

784
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:40.720
and right then I said,
that's it.
That's the last one,
no more.
Um,

785
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.250
and he didn't disagree and,
but,
you know,

786
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.500
emotions run high after the fight.
So we,

787
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.530
we decided right that that night we said,
well,

788
00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:52.530
let's meet and such and such weeks we're going to go hike Madonna,

789
00:46:52.531 --> 00:46:57.390
which is our mountain up there.
And we'll talk about it and we'll decide then.

790
00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.690
And we walked up and Madonna and we said,
you know what,
no more.
That's it.

791
00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:03.270
And we decided then and he came back down and then announced it.

792
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.650
<v 0>That's awesome.
That was awesome.
Yeah.
That,
um,
what about the,
uh,</v>

793
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:12.510
some of the other tough fights that he had had like the Rashad fire,
the shogun.

794
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:17.020
<v 3>But I mean,
to be honest,
I've only seen chuck,
um,</v>

795
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.790
knocked out that one time.
Rashad?
Yes.
Like the other cold.
Yeah.

796
00:47:21.791 --> 00:47:25.080
The other times were like,
in boxing,
they would have been a flash knockdown.

797
00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.430
He would have,
he would have taken an eight count.
Um,

798
00:47:27.431 --> 00:47:30.580
what about the rich Franklin fight though?
But one is the one,
yeah,

799
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.360
I saw those two are the ones who really went out well,
to be honest,

800
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:36.170
the rich Franklin one,
um,

801
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.450
I didn't really notice the knock out as much as I did the cut.

802
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:42.490
The cut just freaked me the shit out.

803
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.680
<v 4>You had a big cuddle.
Is Open upper lip.</v>

804
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.450
<v 3>It was,
it was,
it,
it freaked me out.
I mean,
I,
and I'm,</v>

805
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:53.970
I've seen,
you know,
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm an er nurse.
I mean in la I've seen,
you know,

806
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.530
hearts open,
but this one is just,
it,

807
00:47:56.531 --> 00:48:00.500
just to see someone I love so much like that,
it just freaked me out.
Right.

808
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.960
So I was like that never,
you will never fight again.
I don't give a shit.

809
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:07.330
You're never going to fight again.
Just that cut,
you know,

810
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:08.500
it just freaked me the hell out.

811
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:13.450
And he had such good plastic surgery and it looks great now.
And someone,
yeah,
so,

812
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.880
and he agrees that perfect.
They did amazing job.

813
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.360
They did a great job and thanks to,
uh,
we got,
we got,
um,

814
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.980
we've got a doc,
a out of our town doctor Rushdie,

815
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:28.780
who's a great er doc,
and he traveled to that fight,
um,

816
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.780
and he actually went into the Er and said,
hey,

817
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:34.600
I know we're going to do it this way.

818
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:38.050
And they were gonna just have a regular er guy do it.
And he said,
no,

819
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:41.080
this is the lip.
This is,
this needs plastic work we're going to do.

820
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:46.290
So he went in and did his doctor thing and made sure it was done the right way

821
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:49.240
the first time.
Dr V was,
uh,

822
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:54.550
I mean chuck has some really loyal friends because of his loyalty to people.
And,

823
00:48:54.551 --> 00:48:56.170
uh,
so that was,
that was lucky.

824
00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:00.990
<v 4>So after the Rashad fight,
um,
what was,
what was the thinking?</v>

825
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.090
The thinking was just regroup.

826
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.730
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah,
he got knocked out.
I mean,
that was,</v>

827
00:49:05.731 --> 00:49:08.340
that was the first time I've ever seen him be knocked out.
I mean,

828
00:49:08.341 --> 00:49:11.760
I've seen him knocked down,
but that was hard.

829
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:16.500
But you know,
I mean,
how many guys have you seen that came back and,
yeah,

830
00:49:16.501 --> 00:49:21.430
I mean it says a lot.
Um,
and yeah,
decided to regroup and see,
you know,

831
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.100
what,
how he's feeling,
you sure you want to fight and let,
okay,
let's go.
Um,

832
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.810
but I was always pushing that,
but for him to retire,

833
00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:34.860
but to just as a coach to keep putting that in his ear,
it's like,

834
00:49:34.861 --> 00:49:37.680
well that's kind of like,
Oh yeah,
I'm a great trainer.
I'm telling you to retire.

835
00:49:37.681 --> 00:49:40.610
And I'm saying hit harder.
It's like kinda going beltway.

836
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:45.560
So I kinda just let him as a grown man a decide and then,

837
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.230
and,
and like I said,
Dana's input was very,
you know,

838
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.790
it was important and it was as well taken.
It was just,
I didn't,

839
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.630
I didn't want that always throw shoved in Chuck's face because I was more trying

840
00:49:57.631 --> 00:49:58.200
to build them up

841
00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.970
<v 4>more.
I think those,
um,</v>

842
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:03.990
watching a guy from the beginning to the end and watching the end,

843
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.660
like a guy like chuck,
it's very important for young fighters too,

844
00:50:06.661 --> 00:50:10.350
to see that there's a window in this thing.
Yeah.
And you really,

845
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:14.130
you don't have forever.
You have a few years and they'll all,

846
00:50:14.131 --> 00:50:16.650
depending entirely upon how much damage you take,

847
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:18.600
how many injuries you get along the way,

848
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:23.010
and genetics and nutrition and health and taking care of yourself along the way

849
00:50:23.011 --> 00:50:26.840
as well.
I've known water,
got to be able to see that there's,

850
00:50:26.841 --> 00:50:28.070
there's different

851
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.160
<v 0>TRT,
there's a beginning.
TRT is another one.</v>

852
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.400
There's a beginning and then there's an end and when it's at,
it's over,

853
00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:37.400
it's over.
Muhammad Ali's not gonna come back and win the title.
You know,

854
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.980
he's not going to get in the ring with Vladimir Klitschko and all of a sudden he

855
00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:42.950
starts dancing and everybody starts cheering.
It's over.
Okay.

856
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.610
And that's not an extreme.
People think it's an extreme.
But Muhammad Ali,

857
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:50.120
I guarantee you can still remember the days when he was a boxer,

858
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:52.700
when he was the fucking baddest motherfucker on earth when he was lighting up

859
00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:56.240
Cleveland Williams,
you know,
just hitting them with unbelievable combinations.

860
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:59.270
Fleet of foot.
He,
I'm sure that's still on his head.

861
00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.700
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's hard for Todd,
for all of them.
Yeah.
It was hard for me to retire.</v>

862
00:51:03.701 --> 00:51:06.890
And I was never,
you know,
anywhere in that,
you know,

863
00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.150
I never tasted the,
the fruits of,

864
00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:14.370
of superstardom as a fighter.
I never got,
you know,

865
00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:18.940
my ears blown out by the raging crazy crowds,

866
00:51:18.941 --> 00:51:22.900
like chucked it when he walked into the cage and then to,
to,

867
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.760
to retire from that,
you know,
we can never understand it.
Know it was hard.
It was,

868
00:51:27.761 --> 00:51:31.840
I mean,
cause I could like,
you know,
I'd walk in with him and I,
ve,
yeah.
Wow.

869
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.160
There they really like me.

870
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.810
<v 0>So you brought up TRT and I think this is a huge subject,
uh,</v>

871
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.860
in MMA right now.
And um,

872
00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:45.420
I had a doctor on who's a specialist in traumatic brain injuries.

873
00:51:45.421 --> 00:51:49.080
His name is Dr. Mark Gordon and he's a friend of mine and uh,

874
00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.320
he treats people all the time,
soldiers,
football players,

875
00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:55.530
people with traumatic brain injuries that are trying to recover.

876
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.400
And one of the symptoms is a lack of testosterone.

877
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:03.090
It's one of the major symptoms of traumatic brain injuries and one of the major

878
00:52:03.091 --> 00:52:06.990
causes of depression,
the lack of energy as if they're their brain.

879
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.470
In just getting rattled.
It does a lot of damage to the pituitary gland.

880
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.980
And what he says is the pituitary gland is very sensitive to impacts,

881
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:18.600
whether it's car accidents or falling down or just banging your head on things.

882
00:52:18.601 --> 00:52:22.230
Even soccer players just heading the soccer ball over long periods of time,

883
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:26.190
convert really fuck you up.
And,
um,
you know,

884
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.020
when,
when you realize that,
okay,
well you're,

885
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.650
you're dealing with professional fighters,

886
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.930
professional fighters that are on testosterone replacement.
Well,

887
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.470
why are they on testosterone replacement?
What's going on?

888
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.740
Are they on testosterone replacement because they have a legitimate medical

889
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:42.790
condition?
Or is it because they're,

890
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.710
they're just slowly starting to age and they would like a little pep in their

891
00:52:46.711 --> 00:52:47.400
step?

892
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.580
Or is it because they've been hit in the head so many times their body's not

893
00:52:50.581 --> 00:52:54.810
producing testosterone as much as it should?
And if that's the case,
that's a,

894
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.730
that's a very tricky subject,
isn't it?

895
00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:01.660
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
I have,
I'm not a doctor.</v>

896
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.970
I'm a karate guy.
Um,

897
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
but I have my opinion on testosterone is like unless you have like Kleinfelter

898
00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.510
Syndrome,
uh,
or some other low t um,
um,

899
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:20.440
sickness or disease or I think your t's going to be normal.
I think.

900
00:53:20.441 --> 00:53:25.441
I think your testosterone was normal unless you've taken in the past.

901
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.870
And I think I would be willing to bet.
I'd be willing to bet that.
Okay,

902
00:53:30.871 --> 00:53:35.640
so a repetitive,
you know,
chronic brain trauma.
Okay.

903
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:36.510
I think,
you know,

904
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:40.230
the endocrine and the pituitary are working together with the testes,

905
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:42.210
which is producing the testosterone.

906
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:47.760
I think I'm rattling the brain can cause a low t but I think it can also cause a

907
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:50.640
high tea because when you're messing with it,
you know,

908
00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:55.320
some guys get extra high teas,
like a,
you know,
an HTA too.
I mean it does,

909
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.370
it throws it off.

910
00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.830
<v 0>So you think getting hit in the head could actually increase your production?</v>

911
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:03.870
<v 3>I think,
I think it can.
I think it can alter it.
That's interesting.</v>

912
00:54:03.871 --> 00:54:07.170
I think in alternate.
So it's just a theory.
I think it's,
yeah,

913
00:54:07.171 --> 00:54:09.900
it's a theory because I think everybody's just a theory because I think they can

914
00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:13.150
show,
um,
but I,

915
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.430
I would be willing to bet that I'd say,

916
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.200
I dunno a number,
I'll throw a number,

917
00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:24.210
95% of guys that are doing TRT or they have a low t testing for low t and

918
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:29.970
they're in their 20s or 30s.
They've done some type of steroid in the past.

919
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.850
I'd be willing to bet that that's a pretty safe bet.

920
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.210
And so I think that is why their t his is low,

921
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.860
much more than them getting hit.
And if they have been getting hit that much,

922
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:45.861
I think other symptoms would manifest themselves before a low t such as slurring

923
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:51.680
in the speech.
Um,
memory,
cognitive,
uh,
you know,

924
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:55.710
alterations and stuff like that.
I think a dementia pugilistic,
uh,

925
00:54:56.070 --> 00:55:00.600
which is getting hit too much.
That's what they call the chronic brain injury.
Um,

926
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:04.890
I think it would manifest itself in a lot of different ways before their t

927
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:07.800
started lowering.
And I think you say,
you know,

928
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:10.050
inbox and you'll see a lot more because they get hit.

929
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.570
I mean they get hit thousands of times more.

930
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.840
Then they do an MMA because of the wrestling,
the clinching,
the you said the,

931
00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:19.570
the Jujitsu,
etc. But I,

932
00:55:19.571 --> 00:55:24.510
I think people are in t because they've taken in the past,

933
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:27.300
so now it's low.
So they go to a doctor and a doctor says,
oh yeah,

934
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:31.230
you have low t here's a prescription for tea,
and now they're,
they're on t.

935
00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:35.260
<v 0>It certainly is possible.
That certainly is a possible scenario,</v>

936
00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:38.100
but one of the things that this doctor,

937
00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:42.250
Dr. Mark Gordon has figured out is that it could be just one,
excuse me,

938
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:46.630
one head injury.
Okay,
one time falling down.
It doesn't slur your words,
right?

939
00:55:46.631 --> 00:55:51.010
Don't just one,
one o one acute acute injury one one.

940
00:55:51.011 --> 00:55:53.740
It doesn't even really have to be that brutal.
That's what's scary about it.

941
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:56.860
That one can throw it off.
It might not throw it off,

942
00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.020
but just much like how chocolate Dell could take a terrific punch,
right?

943
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.950
Some guys can't take a punch at all,
right?
It's just the way it is.

944
00:56:02.951 --> 00:56:04.000
It's the way it's always going to be.

945
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:06.640
No one that we're not all built uniformly durable.

946
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:11.560
And for some people it just nothing.
One traumatic incident,
whether it's a,

947
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:14.380
you know,
getting hit in the head by a golf ball and they're never the same again

948
00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.660
<v 3>and you think it's never the same again.</v>

949
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:18.990
There t level are never the same again possible.

950
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.000
<v 0>Very possible that,
that they're,
they're connected,</v>

951
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:25.600
that that head injury can disrupt the production of testosterone growth hormone.

952
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.290
The pituitary gland is,
you know,
very sensitive apparently according to him.

953
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:32.050
And he said,
a lot of guys get through it.
No problem.

954
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:35.440
They have long careers as football players and they're okay.
They have,

955
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:38.500
I mean there's more than one who've gone through football and not suffered brain

956
00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:42.010
damage.
It does not.
It's not 100% everybody gets brain damage.
Right.

957
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:46.540
But he said one real good concussion,
one real good head injury,

958
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:50.120
the whole thing could get thrown off.
So I don't know.
I,

959
00:56:50.121 --> 00:56:53.560
I wouldn't want to just give people the false courage that like,

960
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:57.760
or the false idea that if you don't slur your words,
you don't have brain damage.

961
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.340
Or if you don't slow your words,
you didn't have an injury,
right?

962
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:02.480
<v 3>No,
no.
I'm not saying you do or don't,</v>

963
00:57:02.481 --> 00:57:07.481
but I'm just saying I think those symptoms would manifest themselves before an

964
00:57:08.211 --> 00:57:13.211
actual clinical or diagnostic test where your tea is all of a sudden low.

965
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:16.400
And I'd like to see how that test was.

966
00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:18.980
If they know it was one punch that knocked them out,

967
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:21.860
then all of a sudden was this t low before,
after.

968
00:57:21.861 --> 00:57:26.090
I mean it would have to be a pretty weird,
pretty precise Dell,
you know,

969
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:30.710
double blind study that had been done for awhile and maybe it,
maybe it is right.

970
00:57:30.711 --> 00:57:35.450
I mean I,
I'm,
I'm guesstimating but I,
I just being around the sport long,

971
00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:40.100
long enough and knowing that I've seen guys just get pounded and pounded and

972
00:57:40.101 --> 00:57:44.990
pounded and they just seem pretty t t a keyed up still.
Yeah.

973
00:57:44.991 --> 00:57:47.630
And they're fine.
I've never taken tea so,

974
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:51.440
but I have heard a lot of guys throughout their career start slurring their

975
00:57:51.441 --> 00:57:53.990
speech,
their,
their memory.
I've seen other things,

976
00:57:53.991 --> 00:57:56.090
but I mean it's definitely an interesting study.

977
00:57:56.091 --> 00:58:00.200
So if their t's low because of that one punch,
then okay,

978
00:58:00.201 --> 00:58:01.790
so then you give them tea.
But if it's,

979
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.970
if there's other things also manifesting themselves in there,

980
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:08.400
they're actually getting early signs of dementia pugilistic uh,

981
00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.580
then they probably shouldn't be fighting anyway.

982
00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:10.921
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

983
00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:14.970
That's the big question is that if you've incurred a head injury and the head

984
00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:16.620
injury,
even if it was only one,

985
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:21.180
is somehow another altering your brain's ability to produce hormones.

986
00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:23.850
Maybe you shouldn't be getting more head injuries.

987
00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:27.120
So maybe you shouldn't be in a sport where the number one thing that people want

988
00:58:27.121 --> 00:58:31.200
to do is give you a head injury.
Like that seems to be counterproductive.

989
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.720
That doesn't make any sense.
Yeah.
So what does,

990
00:58:33.721 --> 00:58:37.650
we're subject because so many guys are on testosterone replacement therapy now.

991
00:58:37.651 --> 00:58:40.110
I mean,
it's a super,
super common situation.

992
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:43.510
<v 3>This too common.
It's common.
Yeah.
It's way too common.
I mean,</v>

993
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:47.030
and like your doctor,
Doctor Greg.
I will,

994
00:58:47.031 --> 00:58:50.070
I'd love to read that by the way before we go.
Can you give me that because uh,

995
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:54.290
yeah,
I'll get you a connected cause I love stuff online.
I'm very interested in,

996
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.430
you know,
in the different,
uh,
you know,

997
00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.580
stuff that happens to fighters medically.
But,
uh,

998
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:06.100
but I'd be willing to bet that the guys are on it because they want to recover

999
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:09.310
quicker from training.
I think they wanted better,
quicker results.

1000
00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:13.240
And I think what they don't realize is you got a 20 some year old,

1001
00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:18.010
30 year old guy and now he's doing TRT because,

1002
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.160
um,
he got some,
I'm to say quack doctor,

1003
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:24.680
but he got some guy to say,
okay,
you're,
you're low,

1004
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:29.810
as easy as say low because you go,
I mean,
you do cycle your hormones and,
and,

1005
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:34.100
and you know,
um,
so you could be on the low end of,
of,

1006
00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:38.030
of high end of normal.
So they give you your testosterone now,

1007
00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:42.740
now you're at 22nd,
you're a 27 year old guy,
you're taking your TRT and,

1008
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.820
and um,
so it goes up to normal.
It goes a little higher.

1009
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:50.330
Usually when you're training,
then they cycle it down before the test,
you know,

1010
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:52.340
so they,
they're normal at the test.

1011
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.300
But now with that abuse of the TRT or your testosterone,
now your,

1012
00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.090
your career's over your 32,

1013
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.040
but now you need to take tier t for the rest of your life.
Yeah.

1014
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:06.260
You shut your production down.
So,

1015
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:09.460
so now you're 45 years old and you find yourself in between

1016
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:10.880
<v 4>John,
how about 25?</v>

1017
01:00:10.881 --> 01:00:14.510
We've had guys in the UFC that were 25 years old that had testosterone use

1018
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:15.363
exemptions.

1019
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.960
<v 3>Yeah.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I mean,
that seems crazy.
So,
okay,
so this year,</v>

1020
01:00:19.961 --> 01:00:22.420
25 and you're not fighting anymore and you,

1021
01:00:22.421 --> 01:00:25.510
you don't have insurance and you don't have the money to pay for that,

1022
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:29.110
that weekly testosterone shot.
I'm not a doctor,

1023
01:00:29.111 --> 01:00:32.060
but I would think that if it does shut it down or a fever,

1024
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.990
if it even inhibits it like Lupron does,

1025
01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:38.770
then are you gonna are you going to start growing breasts and a vagina?

1026
01:00:38.771 --> 01:00:42.600
I don't know for sure.
What's Lupron?
Lupron is,
um,

1027
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:47.500
Lupron is what we give 'em.
Um,
sexual offense.
It's chemical castration.

1028
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:52.540
So that's what we'd,
I would give the,
um,
like the sex offenders in the,
um,

1029
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:55.610
when I worked at the prison or the State Hospital,
um,

1030
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:59.130
I would give them their monthly Lupron.
So we keep their tea,

1031
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:03.070
it's a testosterone and inhibitor,
so they can't,
so they don't,

1032
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.560
they think that testosterone is what's making them rapists,
which I don't,

1033
01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:09.010
I don't think it is,
but whatever.
So we give it to them.

1034
01:01:09.011 --> 01:01:13.660
And then if you gave him a little extra by mistake once in a while,
then they,

1035
01:01:13.661 --> 01:01:16.930
you know,
they start growing,
you know,
they started growing breasts.

1036
01:01:16.931 --> 01:01:20.380
I don't think they actually grew a vagina.
That was kind of a joke.
But they do,

1037
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:24.350
they do soften up and their facial hair goes away and,
and they,

1038
01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.580
they become curvy,
like a woman and become more of a family,

1039
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:30.160
a lowering to the other inmates.
Really?

1040
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:34.210
<v 4>Yes.
So they would,
you would not saying you would,
someone might,</v>

1041
01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.440
might do that on purpose to make them more sexually attractive to the inmates to

1042
01:01:38.441 --> 01:01:42.550
create a fattened cow as it were in my eye.
That would work that way.

1043
01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.830
It's sort of like that right up a cow for the slaughter.
Wow.

1044
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.030
<v 3>Brown was fun
as far as a nurse.</v>

1045
01:01:52.031 --> 01:01:56.960
I mean it's,
it's,
it's,
it's a testosterone neighbor,
so it turns the man into,

1046
01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:01.480
you know,
know a woman.
So it'd be like,
um,
but,

1047
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.350
but um,
so you would,
I would think you're being on tests,

1048
01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:09.730
TRT as a fighter,
a young fighter.
Um,
um,

1049
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.350
then all of a sudden you're not taking it.

1050
01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:14.590
If you don't have insurance and you can't afford the t testosterone,

1051
01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:16.270
you're screwed.

1052
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:20.040
<v 4>Yeah.
You're in a bad shape.
It took a while for your body to and start producing</v>

1053
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.970
<v 1>its own testosterone to try it.
I had to fight or not too long ago,
uh,</v>

1054
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.130
an older fighter and he's,
he's on testosterone and he thought I,
he's,

1055
01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.250
he couldn't believe I wasn't on it.
I like,
I started taking anything in my life.

1056
01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.960
I mean,
the closest thing I've ever taken,

1057
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.850
closest thing I've come to kiss testosterone is top ramen.
You know,

1058
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.360
top ramen does not give you top drone.
I don't know.
TRT,

1059
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.130
top ramen problem therapy.
That's what I used to take back home.
No,
no,

1060
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:51.510
this doesn't work dude.
No wonder it you so hard.

1061
01:02:51.511 --> 01:02:54.990
You need to get your money back.
I was cause I was on TRD and that they,

1062
01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.790
that's what they got.
I thought it always meant,

1063
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.920
oh you were just eating top ramen.
Ramen is,

1064
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.890
it's one of the things I miss about being gluten free.
Ramen noodles,

1065
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.550
chicken flavor.
I would do two of them.
Two of those packages together.
You know,

1066
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.310
sometimes a crack an egg.
I've put like six eggs and just let it boil in him.

1067
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:12.820
Ooh,
that's nice.
Yeah.

1068
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:17.280
So I wish I could eat that can eat anymore gluten free.
Yeah.

1069
01:03:17.281 --> 01:03:20.040
My face gets in and look up.
Much more sexy.
Yeah,
you are sexy.

1070
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:24.570
But I'm not saying I like,
I'm not saying all this,
speaking of like Amen.
Um,

1071
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.720
and I'm not going to talk about me like a man cause that's something that

1072
01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:30.420
happened a while ago,
but my fighter,

1073
01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.200
you know I have the world's only bisexual,

1074
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:39.180
bipolar and bilingual fighter.
Who's that?
Who Do you think Antonio Banuelos.

1075
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:44.480
Oh,
I didn't know Ben Wallace was.
All of those things is really,
it's openly,

1076
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:46.953
I didn't know this.

1077
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:50.190
You're going to his Facebook and he has like pictures of him and address and

1078
01:03:50.191 --> 01:03:54.560
stuff.
He's one tough mother.
Oh fuck yeah.
Is very tough fighter.
Oh my God.

1079
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.220
Been around for a while.
He was the guy when,

1080
01:03:56.221 --> 01:03:58.920
when Floyd Mayweather was talking shit.
Yeah.
Chuck Odell was like,
look,

1081
01:03:58.921 --> 01:04:00.810
I've got a guy who weighs 135 pounds million,

1082
01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:02.580
drop you and your fucking they a million.

1083
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:07.010
He bet him a million and he would win that money.
Oh,
you can't Floyd Mayweather.

1084
01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:08.900
It's a fucking phenomenal boxer.
Yeah,

1085
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.910
but the difference between a phenomenal boxer and the guy who has the ability to

1086
01:04:11.911 --> 01:04:15.630
stop a guy like Ben Wells from taking them down,
good fucking luck.

1087
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.270
You know,
I learned that the hard way.

1088
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:22.770
Good luck guy like that could take a guy who's not a boxer,

1089
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.970
70 pounds heavier down.
You know a guy who doesn't know what he's doing.

1090
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.330
You know,
if you're,
if you're like light and quick,

1091
01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:33.630
you think you're going to move out of the way and you're not going to,

1092
01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:37.560
he's going to shoot on one.
You're going to defend that.
He gets the other clamp,

1093
01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:41.310
his hands together and going for a fucking ride up in the air.
Boom,

1094
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:45.690
down on your head.
He's dropping Hammerfest on you.
It's not a boxing match.
No,
no.

1095
01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:49.170
I know and are correct.
Like our karate guys in my neighborhood.
I mean,

1096
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.550
I mean in my own neighborhood,
I don't go to a pit.

1097
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.780
That guy wastes his time.

1098
01:04:54.781 --> 01:04:58.560
He teaches people take down defense and take downs and groundwork.
He goes,

1099
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:00.630
we don't waste our time with that.
We,

1100
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.920
we hit them while they're coming in and we knock them out.

1101
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:07.050
They'll never get us to the ground and it's like actually good idea.

1102
01:05:07.051 --> 01:05:09.930
Did you ever try that?
It's a good strategy with a crane strike.

1103
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.200
I tried it with a crane cranes.
It didn't work.

1104
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.060
You ever seen monkeypod practice monkey on each other?

1105
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:22.570
Shrunk Monkey.
A monkey would just bring just rescue.
How would you take a guy?

1106
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:24.640
Dive is monkey.
What about a dragon?

1107
01:05:24.641 --> 01:05:29.641
What does the drag dragging clauses that tiger claw type on dragon breathing the

1108
01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:32.710
fire fire break or a snake or something.

1109
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:35.170
They cannot take a guy down if he knows that.

1110
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:41.070
And all the martial arts that were sort of exposed or integrated into mixed

1111
01:05:41.351 --> 01:05:45.640
martial arts,
the one that got really left out of the fucking dance was Kung Fu.

1112
01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.310
Boy It Kung Fu get fucking left out.

1113
01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:52.810
The music stopped at Kung Fu is standing in the musical chairs game of life.

1114
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:56.110
Kung Fu was the standing motherfucker at the end of the martial arts parade.

1115
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.890
I mean,
judo came in and a lot of people probably would've thought judo,

1116
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:02.560
not the most effective con wrong.

1117
01:06:02.561 --> 01:06:05.260
She'll know con karate showed they were laughing at that.

1118
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:10.410
I'd say if they're not laughing and they get kicked in the head show,
the con uh,

1119
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:14.040
taekwondo guys Quando Muay Thai guys were,
you know,

1120
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:18.070
he owns a karate schools is a full taekwondo guy.

1121
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.000
He's a black belt under master Bill Clark.
Yeah.
And a real good one too.

1122
01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:25.900
The way he throws those kicks very taekwondo.
Like where he's got no chambering.

1123
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.640
Yeah.
There's no step before he throws that cat laugh at that guy's,
yeah,

1124
01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.840
I've had him wrestlers.
Yeah.

1125
01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.730
I sleep on it and we'll look it up.
Edson Barboza landing that we'll kick.

1126
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:38.050
You're starting to see all these,

1127
01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.080
these techniques now our land to get now Vitara at 35 years of age at 36 years

1128
01:06:43.451 --> 01:06:46.150
of age,
whatever he is,
there's all of a sudden a taekwondo black belt.

1129
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:49.240
He's thrown wheel kicks,
head kicks.
He had kicked Bisbing.
It's like,

1130
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.040
what the hell man,

1131
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:55.270
the fucking head Dan Henderson fight vitro that just fought Dan Henderson.

1132
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:59.110
That was like,
we were watching me like,
is he fucking getting better?

1133
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:03.880
Is he better somehow or another?
I mean,
chuck fought him back in 2001 right.

1134
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:07.220
What was,
when was that?
UFC 37 and a half.
Yeah.
I don't remember.

1135
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.980
2002 it was the first one I ever commentated was chuck on Best Day.

1136
01:07:11.981 --> 01:07:14.980
It was like best damn sports show.
One of those things.

1137
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:19.200
They held the fights and v tour back then.
Well,

1138
01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.240
I mean we're still worldclass.
He was still fighting against guys like chuck.

1139
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:26.980
And then you look at him today and he's actually better all those years later.

1140
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:30.220
This is him against Luke Rockhold.
I mean Jesus Christ.

1141
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:33.590
And that's against Luke Rock.
Look at this shit.
And I guys got sweet.

1142
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.920
This wheel kick is man.
I mean,
you would never believe that he wasn't,
uh,

1143
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.440
like a lifelong taekwondo students.
Ridiculous fucking athlete.

1144
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.840
He has his and then I don't,
I mean,

1145
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:47.500
I don't think he's necessarily better than he was way back then.

1146
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:52.120
He's a lot different because then he had a different,
like that blitz he had was,

1147
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.750
was worldclass.
Yes,
no doubt.
I said now Vandelay fight.

1148
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.110
He's much more well rounded now.
Yeah.
Look at this shit man.

1149
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:04.360
Who the fuck saw that coming?
The guy throws it two times in his career.

1150
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.510
Both in one fight.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,

1151
01:08:07.511 --> 01:08:11.870
he's definitely a much more well rounded fighter than he was.
And he's in look,

1152
01:08:11.871 --> 01:08:14.860
go back to him when people were thinking it was over with him when he was

1153
01:08:14.861 --> 01:08:16.210
fighting soccer.
Robyn pride.

1154
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.510
<v 0>Remember that fight?
They were like,
it's over for Vituro.
It's done.
You know,</v>

1155
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.600
he breaks his hands too easy.
He,
you know,
gave up against Sakharova.

1156
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:27.720
He's been through a ride.
He's been through a ride.
Bet You.

1157
01:08:27.721 --> 01:08:31.630
Oh my God.
Yeah.
You carry so much stuff for folks who don't know.

1158
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:37.570
His sister was kidnapped and murdered and it was murdered,
kidnapped,

1159
01:08:37.571 --> 01:08:41.900
and they found her.
No,
no,
she's murdered.
Yeah.
No,
she was murdered.

1160
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.740
It's terrible.
Terrible,
terrible story.
I didn't know.
And yeah,

1161
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:49.250
it was a horrible story and that haunted him for a long time,
man.

1162
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:53.030
But whatever the reasons are he,

1163
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:57.290
it seems like now at this stage of his career,
here's him against Sakuraba.

1164
01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:01.460
I mean,
this is just a totally different guy than the guy we're seeing now.

1165
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:05.750
I mean,
Sakharova beat his ass soccer.
Raba where the hell is he?
He's done.

1166
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.490
I know too many.
But that Melvin man who fight,
did you see that?
No.

1167
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.190
Jesus would pull up Sakuraba versus Melvin Manhoef.

1168
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.520
Melvin Manhoef one of my all time favorite fighters because the guy win,

1169
01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:23.591
lose or draw came in growing missiles at you knocked out Mark Hunt in the

1170
01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:29.600
fucking first round.
Yeah.
Fatah in the kickboxing about knocked the or no,

1171
01:09:29.601 --> 01:09:32.540
it was MMA.
Mark on was like shooting it for the take down and he uh,

1172
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:37.040
he caught him and knocked him out.
He,
he's just a wild,

1173
01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:40.760
crazy fucking fighter.
He's from England or something.
He's from Holland,

1174
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:46.450
classic Dutch kickboxer and super ridiculously built just to fucking freak

1175
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:51.180
athlete and he put a horrendous beating on soccer raw.

1176
01:09:51.181 --> 01:09:54.440
But it was one of the last beatings of soccer I was career.

1177
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.890
It's like the Japanese,
they threw him in like,
it's like,
oh yeah,

1178
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:59.600
they threw him in to that.
Like,

1179
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:03.130
remember that vendor lay [inaudible] seven,

1180
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.260
they just kind of learn a man over and over his Melvin Manhoef.

1181
01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:10.100
You've seen this guy fight before,
right?
Where's the gladiator trunks?

1182
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.440
He's such a destroyer and he's a guy who's a do or die guy.

1183
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.910
Like Robbie Lawler knocked him out.

1184
01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:21.290
He was going after Robbie Lawler and Robbie Lawler caught him and put him in

1185
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:26.020
dream time.
But look at this horrendous beating.
Once he got soccer Robert Down,

1186
01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:29.450
and this was soccer.
Robert just couldn't do it anymore.
You know,

1187
01:10:29.451 --> 01:10:30.560
there was just nothing left.

1188
01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:34.160
His knees were all completely wrapped up like a mummy and look,
man,

1189
01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:38.150
hope is just fucking hammering him,
throwing his guard to the side,

1190
01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:42.350
like it's nonexistent laying on top of them and just pounding on them.

1191
01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:47.660
I mean just these hammer fists while he's out cold,
ruthless,

1192
01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:50.960
ruthless,
ruthless shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1193
01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:54.290
And then he took a lot of those,
you know,
look at this.

1194
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:58.220
Jesus Christ gave his fucking head kick.
God Damn.
Matt Hoof is a monster.

1195
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.550
That whole team,
Mike's gym and Holland.
Poof.

1196
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:06.630
What a group of savages like Badr Hari Him.
He's got a,

1197
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:10.300
he's got Allister for awhile actually.
From what I understand Allister,

1198
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:14.190
his training and Thailand.
Oh yes.
For this upcoming fight with mirror,

1199
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.380
<v 1>which should be very interesting to see how that goes.</v>

1200
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:17.880
It looks like he lost a lot of weight too.

1201
01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.790
They said they had a photo of them are recently online and it looks like,

1202
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.870
like he's lost a massive amount of mass.
I can't as many.
Five chuck.

1203
01:11:24.871 --> 01:11:27.150
He could barely make 200 pounds.
Yeah,

1204
01:11:27.151 --> 01:11:29.910
he had a Hartwell two oh five two or three though.
It wasn't pride.

1205
01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:34.940
I think I'll go with one 99 but I think he had a hard time making two oh five I

1206
01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:38.490
gained the weight.
Yeah.
Really?
I'd thought it was the opposite.

1207
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:42.750
What I had always understood was that hey yeah he got better when he stopped

1208
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:46.230
cutting weight cause cutting weight to make two or five was apparently brutal on

1209
01:11:46.231 --> 01:11:51.110
him cause he was always gas out
of the way I remember it.

1210
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.030
Oh okay.

1211
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.181
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1212
01:11:52.181 --> 01:11:56.470
I remember him being super lanky and skinny and barely making be able to make

1213
01:11:56.471 --> 01:11:57.100
two or five.

1214
01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:01.370
<v 1>That's interesting.
Yeah.
Like this is like when he fought chuck.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Yeah.</v>

1215
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:05.790
<v 3>Cause there was a whole weird way in process and cause this isn't it.</v>

1216
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.810
<v 1>Everyone's different.
Yeah.
Those are the vendor lay days too,
man.</v>

1217
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.150
Ooh God.
Like the Vangelis stopped rampage.
The Vandelay stopped.

1218
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.780
Sapora Sakharova here was a guy that even though I love martial artists and guys

1219
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:21.720
who show a lot of respect and bow to each other and you know,

1220
01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:25.620
and then go at it demanded.
I didn't want none of that shit.
It's,
no,
it was,

1221
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:29.470
he was a wild dog who's coming at you like a,
like a demon?

1222
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:31.223
Yeah.

1223
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.270
<v 3>Yeah.
I,
I,
yeah,
I mean,
to be honest though,
I see him,</v>

1224
01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.670
I see that martial arts and name it might,

1225
01:12:36.671 --> 01:12:41.280
he might not have brought it out in the,
in the,
in the ways.
Um,
but I,

1226
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:44.770
I actually saw it,
I even saw it in,
um,
rampage,
um,

1227
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.810
it a rampage to me,

1228
01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.200
rampage through for the persona of the camera and stuff.

1229
01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:52.720
And sometimes off camera,
I guess.
Well,

1230
01:12:52.721 --> 01:12:56.650
there was actually a camera because the whole truck thing,

1231
01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.120
I don't remember that.

1232
01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:00.980
Remember that truck thing when he had too many energy drinks or something?
Yeah,

1233
01:13:00.981 --> 01:13:02.950
yeah.
He went crazy.
But I,

1234
01:13:02.951 --> 01:13:07.570
even those days I just always saw him as I saw through,
you know,

1235
01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:13.060
that,
and I just saw him as a very respectful guy.
I always did.

1236
01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.840
<v 1>Yeah,
and I agree.
He's,
you know,</v>

1237
01:13:15.841 --> 01:13:18.500
he talks a lot of trash and he's smart and he knows how to promote fights in

1238
01:13:18.501 --> 01:13:23.120
that regard.
But yeah,
he's always been a very easy to talk to guy.

1239
01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:23.890
This is very few

1240
01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:27.550
<v 3>guys that aren't in the,
in the MMA,
in the MMA world,</v>

1241
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:29.770
you could think of many boxers.

1242
01:13:29.771 --> 01:13:34.300
Like that guy that threw the chair at the referee who is that guy threw the

1243
01:13:34.301 --> 01:13:37.960
chair,
he's like hit a referee or something.
And was recently,

1244
01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.710
there was a while ago and he just fought recently lost again,
I forgot his name.

1245
01:13:41.711 --> 01:13:45.180
His Dad used to train him,
I forgot his name,
but I mean a boxing.

1246
01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:49.390
It just seems like it just didn't have that martial art edge.

1247
01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:53.230
And I can think of so few MMA guys,

1248
01:13:53.231 --> 01:13:56.350
like when I go to the UFC and it's just,

1249
01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.230
it's just being around these guys,
it's just,

1250
01:13:59.231 --> 01:14:02.170
they're so nice and respectful and just like all of them,

1251
01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:06.100
it's like you're being at some kind of happy party camping,

1252
01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:11.290
like your leg at a conference full of happy,
respectful people.
And it's like,

1253
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:15.110
I don't,
I can't think of many that aren't what it,

1254
01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:18.550
what is the general feeling amongst the fighters that you're involved with about

1255
01:14:18.551 --> 01:14:23.380
TRT?
Um,
about my guys.

1256
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:26.280
<v 4>No,
not even,
you know,
about how they feel about it in general.</v>

1257
01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:29.160
Like what's the general,
is there a,
is there a general consensus or,

1258
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.610
<v 3>I think it's now because it's now legal and whatever powers to be made it legal</v>

1259
01:14:34.611 --> 01:14:37.850
for whatever crazy reason.
Um,

1260
01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:44.320
I think it's a lot of the guys just think I need it to stay competitive.

1261
01:14:44.361 --> 01:14:46.070
Just like probably most other sports.

1262
01:14:46.071 --> 01:14:49.400
But I wish it wasn't because there was a lot more fun without it.
It's kind of,

1263
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:53.270
to me,
it's almost like the weight cut thing.
The weight cut thing is just gone.

1264
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.890
I mean it's gotten crazy with weight cuts,
rehydration,
Ivs.

1265
01:14:57.891 --> 01:15:01.500
I mean it wasn't like that before.
It is strange,
um,

1266
01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.070
in the amount that they're losing.
It's just staggering.

1267
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:08.690
Some guys just losing 30 pounds,
35 pounds and they're fighting at one 70.
Yeah,

1268
01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:12.020
they're way over 200 pounds for,
they start their car.
I put,

1269
01:15:12.021 --> 01:15:15.830
I put six bags and the guy once after Wayne,
I mean that's a lot.

1270
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:19.640
And you could just see him on the bed after the way and just looked like a

1271
01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:22.640
skeleton and just so lethargic and then,

1272
01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:27.800
and then like two bags in and he's like coming to life and then like six bags

1273
01:15:27.801 --> 01:15:31.270
later,
he's like dancing around,
dancing around and he's like a regular guy again.

1274
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:35.420
It's just so unhealthy.
It's just,
it's crazy electrolyte.
You know,

1275
01:15:35.421 --> 01:15:40.220
you throw your body into this crazy electrolyte imbalance and it's like,
I mean,

1276
01:15:40.221 --> 01:15:43.250
your whole electrolyte is a,
is a,
is a,
you know,

1277
01:15:43.251 --> 01:15:45.440
not only does it affect your acid base,
you know,

1278
01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:47.810
you have all that alkaline acid and he,
and,

1279
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:52.640
and it also affects the electrical wiring and you're in your body because that's

1280
01:15:52.641 --> 01:15:54.800
what makes your electric wiring work,
you know,

1281
01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:59.420
and you have a really important electric wiring between your Aav node in your

1282
01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:04.070
sinus node,
in your heart.
And if that electrical doesn't happen,

1283
01:16:04.071 --> 01:16:06.290
every single beat,
it's not going to beat,
you know,

1284
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.470
so it's such a fun and your brain is all electricity.

1285
01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.660
So to throw that off just to cut weight and you do because you know you have the

1286
01:16:14.661 --> 01:16:18.380
electrons of the,
you know,
you know,
yeah.
The potassium,
the chloride,

1287
01:16:18.381 --> 01:16:20.660
the magnesium that,
you know,
it's just,

1288
01:16:20.661 --> 01:16:25.661
it's a crazy thing that people put themselves in such harms way to make weight

1289
01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:31.100
because they want to be competitive to fight the next day in such another

1290
01:16:31.101 --> 01:16:35.420
dangerous sport.
And they're both becoming almost equally dangerous.

1291
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:40.160
And now you throw TRT into that mix and that was becoming a whole different

1292
01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:40.994
sport.

1293
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.920
<v 4>Yeah.
That weight cutting things a real issue that doesn't seem to have a,</v>

1294
01:16:44.921 --> 01:16:47.910
an easy solution.
I think it does.
What's easy solution?

1295
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:51.370
Wayman the day of the fight.
Wayman walk right when they walk in.
Yeah.

1296
01:16:51.371 --> 01:16:53.620
But what if someone doesn't make the wait?
What are you going to do?

1297
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:57.140
Like there's a lot of guys like Diego,
Brent Al's last fight.
Yeah.

1298
01:16:57.190 --> 01:17:00.430
Perfect example.
Him and Dustin Poirier kid just didn't make Wayne,

1299
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:04.060
he was way over.
So what do you do that,
what happens there?

1300
01:17:04.061 --> 01:17:06.460
What did they do while they let them fight and he got,

1301
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:10.010
but too many guys are going to take of that and they're gonna come in

1302
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:14.840
<v 1>heavier than their opponent.
Not they lose 20 pounds or 20% each time.</v>

1303
01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:18.590
I mean,
that could be a solution.
Have the guy who doesn't make the way,

1304
01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:19.371
but it's still,

1305
01:17:19.371 --> 01:17:23.060
if the guy just keeps winning because he's not cutting weight and you are

1306
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:27.110
cutting weight and you're getting skinnier and he's not and he's coming in full

1307
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:27.944
and healthy,

1308
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:33.070
it just seems to be an unfair advantage to a person who's not like thinking

1309
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:38.240
evenly.
It doesn't,
it doesn't even care about the anytime of the day,

1310
01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.550
day before the day of the day of.

1311
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.270
But I'm saying day off when Waylon Day off.
But,

1312
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.900
but too many people would be like,
yeah,
I guess it didn't make weight,
whatever.

1313
01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:51.500
And they'll come in not weakened at all.
Right.
So,
but then,

1314
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:54.920
but then the guy will step in the ring that made the weight.

1315
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:59.950
He'll be two oh five and the average isn't like that Diego Guy,

1316
01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:04.520
the six he was six pounds or five pounds.
What was he,
how many?
Who's,

1317
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:08.280
I think it was at least five pounds.
I mean for that weight class.
That's crazy.

1318
01:18:08.281 --> 01:18:11.180
Yeah.
Actually I think he was 53 so I believe he was eight pounds over.

1319
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.940
But he had had been in a car accident or a bunch of issues,

1320
01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:18.260
so there was a lot of things wrong.
So if the,
so a guys,

1321
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.060
which is the average and even guys get cut the 20% a pound or a half pound,

1322
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.770
that's what I mean.
It's more,

1323
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.270
that's when they usually over there over by a pound or half pound.
So you,

1324
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.690
so it's this exact same,

1325
01:18:29.691 --> 01:18:34.430
if it'd be the same the day of or the day before he walks in the cage a pound

1326
01:18:34.431 --> 01:18:38.180
over,
he gets 20% and the other guy wait ways then a pound less.

1327
01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:41.170
He's still only outweighing and buy a pound.
Yeah,

1328
01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:44.600
I could see you giving them maybe like five pounds if they're going to do it the

1329
01:18:44.601 --> 01:18:47.480
day of,
if it looks like they have to fall on a five,

1330
01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:51.170
five pound radius or a ratio or it could be,

1331
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.810
or maybe more per like if you,
if you,

1332
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:56.860
if you're a half pound to a pound and a half it's,

1333
01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:00.620
it's x amount of percentage and it could go up accordingly.
Yeah.

1334
01:19:00.621 --> 01:19:04.310
The real worry that people have is that on the day of the fights that people

1335
01:19:04.311 --> 01:19:05.720
would lose weight anyway.

1336
01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.840
It's still dehydrate themselves and not really have enough time to properly

1337
01:19:08.841 --> 01:19:12.950
rehydrate and then it can be really dangerous because most of like the really

1338
01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:16.250
severe injuries that have happened inside a boxing rings,

1339
01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:20.240
especially most of them have taken place in the lighter weight classes because

1340
01:19:20.241 --> 01:19:23.270
there's increased danger because of dehydration.
Right.

1341
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.340
Cause the balances is more.
Yeah.
What do you tell your guys?

1342
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:29.840
Do you ever like a cutoff where they will,

1343
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:34.160
you don't want them losing any more weight than this?
Um,
yes and no.

1344
01:19:34.161 --> 01:19:36.740
I mean more,
most of my guys are pretty good about it.

1345
01:19:36.741 --> 01:19:40.280
I don't have too many crazy wait cutters.
Um,

1346
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:43.910
but I mean,
to be honest,
you know,
I try to train him and I,

1347
01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:46.430
and I try to direct them in a lot of ways,

1348
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:50.750
but to me that's a really personal thing and I can't get in their body and feel

1349
01:19:50.751 --> 01:19:51.531
what they're,
you know,

1350
01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:55.430
how much they're hurting and how much weight and how their body feels.
So like,

1351
01:19:55.431 --> 01:19:57.290
I knew how much I had to cut when I was fighting,

1352
01:19:57.291 --> 01:20:00.470
but I don't want to go into their body,
you know,
and say,
you know,

1353
01:20:00.471 --> 01:20:04.390
you can't do this.
And some guys just look,
you know,

1354
01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:08.040
a lot worse off than they are.
And some guys don't that bad often

1355
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.060
<v 3>are.
So it's hard.
It's a hard one.
I mean,
so they're grown,
man.</v>

1356
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:14.040
They've been doing most of them.
I've been doing it a long time,

1357
01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:18.090
so I let them kind of dictate.
If I see something crazy,
I'll say something.
But,

1358
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:23.220
you know,
do you have any female fighters?
No.
No,
no.
I have in the past.

1359
01:20:23.221 --> 01:20:27.150
I'm not crazy about it at all.
In what way?
Um,

1360
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.230
I mean,
um,
without selling sounding chauvinistic.
Um,

1361
01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:37.320
too late.
No,
I think like this sport,
like,
um,

1362
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:42.950
like my daughter was a basketball player and she got a scholarship to college on

1363
01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:47.480
basketball and did great and she was one of the best basketball players for

1364
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.540
girl.
You know,

1365
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:51.630
and you can say that for a girl because when they play next to the guys,

1366
01:20:51.631 --> 01:20:52.400
you know,
they're not,

1367
01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.890
it doesn't look anything like the same thing except when she played her name's

1368
01:20:55.891 --> 01:20:59.790
Jelly bean and she was great.
I'm going to get so much trouble.

1369
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:04.590
But when you watched two girls fight,
there's no difference.

1370
01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:05.590
These fricking girls are,

1371
01:21:05.591 --> 01:21:09.120
are our animals and they're great and they're their hearts.
I mean,

1372
01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:12.410
they're getting fight of the nights and they're fricking fighting,
but,

1373
01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.150
but when they get cut,
I mean,
when I,
it's just,
it's,
it's a different,

1374
01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:20.870
we're different.
I mean,
we're different gender and,

1375
01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:25.800
and it's more acceptable for a mantic to have his scars in his face,
you know,

1376
01:21:25.801 --> 01:21:29.520
the call flyers and stuff,
but mainly like the scars all over the,
the flat nose.

1377
01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:33.660
It's just more acceptable for,
you know,
for society.
I don't think it will be.

1378
01:21:33.661 --> 01:21:37.230
So when you have now the girls fighting when they're retiring,

1379
01:21:37.231 --> 01:21:41.610
I don't think you'll have a whole different,
um,
you know,
class of girls that are,

1380
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:45.800
that are scarred up and stuff.
I'm that,
that would bother me if,
if,

1381
01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:49.440
if a girl came back and she was one of my fighters and she had a cut it,

1382
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:53.070
I would just throw the towel in.
I just,
I just hate that.
I hate to see that.

1383
01:21:53.071 --> 01:21:57.180
And that's chauvinistic,
but sorry.
But the way they fight is unbelievable.
I mean,

1384
01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.270
these girls are every bit as good.
I mean,
you know what I mean?

1385
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:03.690
You like when you watch most sports and then watch a guy play it.

1386
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.780
It's different sports,
you know?
But when you watch the group,

1387
01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:09.510
two girls find some of these girls and then watch two guys fighting,

1388
01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.480
it's just they have longer hair and it's still there.
I mean,

1389
01:22:12.481 --> 01:22:15.490
they're that good and we should too.
Ain't Ronda Rousey was an amazing class.
Dot.

1390
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.110
Yeah.
And the other girl that's wild and fun.
Yeah.
And they're,
so,
their,

1391
01:22:19.111 --> 01:22:20.940
their skills in their heart is unbelievable.

1392
01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:24.150
But I just don't like the cuts and the damage that's going to,

1393
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:28.560
<v 0>I totally understand where you're coming from.
Uh,
yeah.
I,
for whatever reason,</v>

1394
01:22:28.561 --> 01:22:31.680
except it easier when I see it on the mat as well.
Yeah.

1395
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:36.890
I'm accepting it as when I see women busted up mean it is a part of what it is.

1396
01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:39.660
But if I saw like a really deep gash,
like I've seen like,

1397
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:42.390
like Marvin Eastman or like maybe some of the other guy,

1398
01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.570
like some people have had some pretty bad gashes inside the octagon.

1399
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:46.860
If that's a girl,

1400
01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:50.790
that's going to be interesting how people accept that culturally,
you know?

1401
01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:55.660
<v 3>Yeah.
And then culturally,
you know,
after I left after a career's over,</v>

1402
01:22:55.661 --> 01:22:57.450
I mean,
I mean it should

1403
01:22:57.450 --> 01:23:01.470
<v 0>be known as some badass former fighter chick.
Yeah.
Some people liked that shit.</v>

1404
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.980
They probably,
well they like,
so we can do is like girls with tattoos

1405
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.210
<v 4>all over their bodies and some on their face and yeah,
I like that too.</v>

1406
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:13.800
So they might be scarred,
let's character and a woman John Hackleman.

1407
01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.100
<v 3>Yeah,
that'd be kind of make a little shower chauvinistically but Nah.</v>

1408
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:20.680
<v 4>Well,
you know,
you,
uh,</v>

1409
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.040
I was fucking seven years old when you were a referee in fights.
Yeah.

1410
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:27.210
<v 3>Yeah.
I've been in this business a long time.</v>

1411
01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.670
I remember cutting weight when I was cutting weight and I was like,

1412
01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.430
I didn't know how to cut weight and I didn't have a meet coming up.

1413
01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:37.050
I didn't have,
I didn't have a guy like me coming up.
I was just like,
okay,

1414
01:23:37.051 --> 01:23:39.840
I read a book,
I do this.
So I started cutting weight.
You know,

1415
01:23:39.841 --> 01:23:42.960
you cut weight usually 24 hours out.
Okay.

1416
01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:45.410
And then you start drying out and you,

1417
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.290
that's when your water intake goes down and you're,
you start sweating out.

1418
01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:52.680
You know,
it's not never more than 24 hours or you're not going to,
you know,

1419
01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:54.750
I didn't know that.
I was like,

1420
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.470
I was like a week out and fucking wearing plastic suits and a down jacket,

1421
01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:02.220
you know,
jogging down the down the beach trying to cut my weight.
I was like,

1422
01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.040
I didn't know any different.
A lot of people did it that way for a long time.

1423
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:09.810
A long time.
Yeah.
It just has to be starved themselves up to the fight.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1424
01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:14.400
And,
uh,
and we'd be wearing combat boots and,
and you know,
this is,
yeah.

1425
01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:17.640
So I didn't have a meet coming up,
but,
but that's,

1426
01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:19.500
that's just the way we did it back home.

1427
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:22.250
<v 4>You're a,
you're training methods.</v>

1428
01:24:22.251 --> 01:24:24.550
Like where did you learn all these different things that you,

1429
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:28.940
you like you're famous for having guys do a lot of like manual labor type stuff

1430
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.890
and carry rocks and a fucking wheelbarrow and run up hill with it.

1431
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:37.220
And where'd you,
where'd you come up with this idea?
This,
these routines?

1432
01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:41.240
<v 3>Hmm.
I've been doing them for a long time.
Um,</v>

1433
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.903
I think just,

1434
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:48.470
I've always had that old school chauvinistic.

1435
01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.300
I'm just an old school guy,
you know,
even when I was younger and,
uh,

1436
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:59.240
um,
kind of like the rocky three,
you know,
like a,

1437
01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:04.260
and I actually have a rocky three experience where I was training hard.

1438
01:25:04.461 --> 01:25:08.570
I was like that rocky guy and knocking my guys out.
And then,

1439
01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.660
and then I got,
I got married to an older woman who was,
um,

1440
01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.110
much more,
uh,
more refined and she lived in Woodland Hills,

1441
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:23.420
the suburbs,
and it went from ghetto van eyes.
Um,

1442
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:27.050
a really bad place event.
I'd Delino Street.
Um,

1443
01:25:27.051 --> 01:25:30.020
so she cultured you in the little soft,
a little soft.

1444
01:25:30.021 --> 01:25:33.740
I would do my workouts here in woodland hills.
It might even still be here.

1445
01:25:33.741 --> 01:25:35.950
Racquetball world.
I don't know where that is.
Anyway,

1446
01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.550
I do my workout on the stairmaster and I was like trained for this guy and his

1447
01:25:40.551 --> 01:25:44.900
name was,
uh,
he,
his name was Charlie Archie.
They call him mister c.

1448
01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.300
He had a Mohawk and I got set up to fight him.
He,

1449
01:25:48.301 --> 01:25:51.740
he outweighed me by 31 pounds,
but we thought we'd take them anyway.

1450
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:55.190
And my trainer,
uh,
I was training at the jet center with Benny.
The jet.

1451
01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:57.890
Your kitties.
Yeah,
I remember that.
Yeah.
And um,

1452
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:02.420
I just went in there like smiling and training at the,
you know,
the thing.

1453
01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:06.080
And I went in ring instead of being eye of the tiger,
I went over,
shook his hand,

1454
01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:09.680
you know,
and he dropped me with a body shot.
Wow.

1455
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.510
And I got up and we,
we battled for a little while.

1456
01:26:12.511 --> 01:26:15.470
I dropped him and he dropped me in another body shop.

1457
01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.210
Cause once you get hit with a body shot and it's,
you're pretty much,

1458
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.840
I mean if the guy knows how to do it,
unless you are tour Gaudy,
you know,

1459
01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:27.140
so I think he dropped me three times and two rounds and the referee finally stop

1460
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:28.670
it.
And,
um,

1461
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:34.690
and I just remember just thinking,
I had the tiger,
I got,

1462
01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:38.090
I lost my,
the tech.
And I remember thinking that and thinking I got soft.

1463
01:26:38.091 --> 01:26:39.950
And so I went back to my old gym,

1464
01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:43.640
I swept back to hardcore training and I got a rematch with him and I ended up

1465
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:48.950
fighting him twice more,
uh,
and beat him twice.
But,
uh,
um,

1466
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:52.370
it's that I always had that hardcore eye of the tiger,
you know,

1467
01:26:52.371 --> 01:26:56.840
running the train tracks,
be tough guy,
you know,
just,
it's kind of,
you know,

1468
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:59.150
a lot of it's kind of outdated and stuff,

1469
01:26:59.151 --> 01:27:02.180
but it seems to work for my guys outdated in what way?

1470
01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:07.181
Outdated in the way the current science of physical conditioning approaches.

1471
01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:10.820
It doesn't that shit alter all the time.
It changes.

1472
01:27:10.821 --> 01:27:12.840
There's been so many things and I,
I'm,

1473
01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:17.540
I'm a firm believer in progression and learning new techniques like in the old

1474
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:22.370
pit,
you know,
I mean,
you know,
I came up from a martial art back in Honolulu,

1475
01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:26.540
Hawaii called Kaji Kempo
karate,
judo cook,

1476
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:28.190
Kempo and boxing.

1477
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:33.490
And it was a hardcore art formed in Hawaii by five guys in 1947 mainly for

1478
01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:38.030
street fighting.
And it was,
uh,
it was built that way,
um,

1479
01:27:38.031 --> 01:27:41.390
and it was pretty hardcore,
you know,
growing up in Hawaii,
white kid,
you know,

1480
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.660
kill Holly Day,
et Cetera.
So I wanted to be a tough gal.

1481
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:47.150
Leaf of people don't know is what Hawaiians call white people.

1482
01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:51.940
It's usually fucking Holloway.
How the pride Tattoo.

1483
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:56.980
But Holly Pride Tattoo,
which didn't go over,
but um,
but they don't like,
you know,

1484
01:27:56.990 --> 01:28:00.950
but you know,
so I have how the pride and definitely Hawaiian roots.

1485
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:05.030
I love the islands and I love Hawaii,
but it wasn't easy growing up there.

1486
01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:07.970
It wasn't,
I mean,
I didn't come from a ghetto,
you know,

1487
01:28:07.971 --> 01:28:12.320
my dad was a hardworking newspaper writer and my mom was a great,

1488
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.850
you know,
stay at home mom and,
um,
had a lot of love from my parents.

1489
01:28:16.851 --> 01:28:20.190
But growing up in Hawaii,
they do not like how these,
and,
you know,

1490
01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:23.360
going to school in Hawaii,
it was usually fucking Holly,

1491
01:28:23.361 --> 01:28:26.540
this fucking Holly that go back to the mainland,
how they give me lunch money,

1492
01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:29.420
how they,
what the fuck you looking at how they,
you know,

1493
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:31.220
so there was a lot of that.

1494
01:28:31.221 --> 01:28:36.170
So I started training really early and it was a hardcore art.
Um,
and,
and uh,

1495
01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.270
I always stuck with a lot of those old training things,

1496
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:42.770
training principles and training techniques and stuff.
And I,

1497
01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.310
those kind of stayed with me.
Even though things have comics,
things have gone.

1498
01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.610
I always knew that,
you know,
the old,

1499
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:52.310
old school training techniques weren't going anywhere.
And,
uh,

1500
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:56.480
so I go back and forth with them,
uh,
and they seem to work for me.
And,
uh,

1501
01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:01.540
and then I got,
I got,
I got,
um,
introduced to crossfit,
um,

1502
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.180
and like the early two thousands and I got to be good friends with,
uh,

1503
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:07.800
Greg Glassman,
the owner.

1504
01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:11.490
And we came up together with cross pit because we thought,
you know,

1505
01:29:11.491 --> 01:29:13.570
cross fits great,
but we should,
yeah,

1506
01:29:13.571 --> 01:29:16.320
I wanted it specific for my fighters and my students.

1507
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:19.350
So we started cross pit and,
um,

1508
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:24.500
so it's like crossfit with more of a martial art feel and,

1509
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:29.610
and I consider our system crossfit.
And um,
so that,
you know,

1510
01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:31.350
there's the wheel barrels and stuff.

1511
01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:34.490
<v 4>What do you do specifically?
You have wheelbarrows,
you fill them with rocks,</v>

1512
01:29:34.491 --> 01:29:35.930
you put weights in them.
Like what do you do?

1513
01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:40.850
<v 3>Um,
um,
I put weights in them because I want to know what they way.
So,</v>

1514
01:29:40.851 --> 01:29:43.880
um,
I usually,
there's different workouts I do with them,

1515
01:29:43.881 --> 01:29:48.590
but they're going up a hill because I live on a hill.
Um,
so it's,

1516
01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:52.970
it's different weights for different exercises.
Some are shorter Tabata sprints,

1517
01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:54.620
20 seconds on,
10 seconds off.

1518
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:58.710
<v 4>So you do use scientific training principles is a very good protocol for</v>

1519
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:00.660
conditioning.
Yeah.

1520
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:05.730
And for people listening to this ta be a ta first found out about it,

1521
01:30:05.731 --> 01:30:09.480
cause my friend John Rollo,
he started using it.
Did,
it really helps a lot.

1522
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:13.960
<v 3>It does.
And,
and it was his foreign by some Kenji Tabata,
some Japanese,</v>

1523
01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:18.550
uh,
exercise physiologists,
um,
who came up with that and he's,
he,

1524
01:30:18.850 --> 01:30:23.020
he proved it in his,
you know,
anybody can do their own tests.

1525
01:30:23.021 --> 01:30:28.021
But he proved that by doing these 22nd on a ten second off protocol,

1526
01:30:28.361 --> 01:30:32.770
only eight times,
that's four minutes.
Um,
and then he would have this other group,

1527
01:30:32.771 --> 01:30:36.460
Group B do a five mile run every day.

1528
01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:38.800
And then he proved that his,
uh,

1529
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.540
his four minute tabata protocol would get in better shape than these five mile

1530
01:30:43.541 --> 01:30:47.140
runners every day.
So whatever,
whatever,
whatever that works or not.

1531
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:49.120
I do my Tabatas.
Um,

1532
01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:53.920
I probably do a couple of workouts every week and I throw tomatoes in and I

1533
01:30:53.921 --> 01:30:54.450
think it's a good,

1534
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:58.440
<v 4>does something about,
um,
those old school strength and conditioning drills,</v>

1535
01:30:58.441 --> 01:31:00.600
like manual work type things,

1536
01:31:00.601 --> 01:31:04.920
like the rocky three scenario he's running or was it rocky four ways in Siberia

1537
01:31:04.921 --> 01:31:07.430
and he's carrying logs around.
Yeah.
What does,

1538
01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:11.460
what is it about those old school training methods that are so appealing to us?

1539
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:12.750
I think,
um,

1540
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.330
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1541
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:19.010
<v 3>I think we're wired,
you know,
in our,
in our DNA,
you know,
are,
are,
are,</v>

1542
01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:23.240
are,
you know,
we're,
we're wired to be,
you know,
our,

1543
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:27.380
our endocrine systems and all of our,
you know,
we're,

1544
01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:31.910
we're wired to be either fight or flight.
Right?
Isn't that what I mean?

1545
01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.400
So are,
and,
and

1546
01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.820
flight is running and then fight.
It's fighting.

1547
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.800
So that's how we're wired.
I mean,

1548
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:45.760
so we could play basketball and that's great and run around and,
you know,

1549
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:47.570
throw the ball and stuff.
But I mean,

1550
01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:52.400
we're wired to fight and we're wired to run and we're wired to be strong and

1551
01:31:52.401 --> 01:31:56.460
we're wired to be,
you know,
we're wired to carry

1552
01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.220
<v 4>boulders in this.
No,
that my point,
I feel</v>

1553
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.930
<v 0>like,
like when you saw like George Foreman when he made his comeback,
uh,</v>

1554
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:08.350
one of the things about George Foreman's training routine was he had really

1555
01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:09.280
unorthodox methods.

1556
01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:13.690
Like you would take a jeep and strap it to him and pull it and he'd just be this

1557
01:32:13.691 --> 01:32:18.490
big giant guy pulling a fucking jeep behind him.
He also did a lot of manly shit.

1558
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:21.570
Like he chopped a lot of wood,
you know,
chopped a lot of logs,

1559
01:32:21.571 --> 01:32:24.130
swung and acts all the time and swinging an ax.

1560
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:26.890
It's like basically a crossfit type move.
I mean,

1561
01:32:26.891 --> 01:32:29.980
it really is like a really good strength and conditioning move for your whole

1562
01:32:29.981 --> 01:32:32.810
body.
But it's also manly.

1563
01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:35.980
He's out there getting the fucking firewood chopped up.
He's a man.

1564
01:32:35.981 --> 01:32:37.120
He's getting his work done.

1565
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:41.740
There's something appealing about a guy out there in the snow chopping wood as

1566
01:32:41.741 --> 01:32:45.970
opposed to some Fufu with tights doing crunches in the gym with his feet up in

1567
01:32:45.971 --> 01:32:49.240
the air.
You know,
his little,
a little fucking baby socks on.

1568
01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:54.100
If there's something better about a guy smashing would with a fucking acts,

1569
01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:58.630
right.
It's more manly.
Hell yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Right.
Yeah,
we do that.

1570
01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:01.830
There's a guy named Cameron Hanes and he's a,

1571
01:33:01.831 --> 01:33:06.250
like a famous bow hunter and a,
he also trains for bow hunting.

1572
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:09.100
Gets in like really good shape for a lot of people that don't realize when these

1573
01:33:09.101 --> 01:33:10.000
guys go bow hunting,

1574
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:14.740
they have to carry giant chunks of meat down hills.

1575
01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.090
So if you shoot an elk,

1576
01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:21.190
like you have to stuff your pack with like 150 plus pounds and make it down a

1577
01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:23.080
mountain or make it up a mountain,

1578
01:33:23.081 --> 01:33:25.210
you might have to go to the top and then go over.

1579
01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:28.150
Like these guys have to get in some serious shit cause they get their,

1580
01:33:28.151 --> 01:33:32.320
bring their meat back from where do you have to if you shoot an animal.
Okay.

1581
01:33:32.321 --> 01:33:36.340
Like if you go,
uh,
doing like some camping and bow hunting,

1582
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:40.150
you make a camp and then you got to go into the woods and find the animals.

1583
01:33:40.151 --> 01:33:42.580
They're not going to come to you.
So you have to walk miles in.

1584
01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:45.820
Then you shoot one,
well,
it weighs 1200 pounds,

1585
01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:49.690
John Hackleman and you're gonna have to get that fucking thing back seven miles,

1586
01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:51.220
nine miles to your camp.

1587
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:54.580
And it might take you three days to do it where you're all day.

1588
01:33:54.581 --> 01:33:58.990
All you're doing is walking to the body,
cutting a hundred pounds of meat off,

1589
01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:03.190
putting it in a backpack and walking back to the camp again over and over and

1590
01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:06.220
over again and trying to fill the truck up though.
This guy,
Cameron Hanes,

1591
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:10.270
he trains for that.
Like he gets in shape for it.
He takes a giant rock,

1592
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:14.410
130 pound rock,
puts it in a backpack and walks up to the top of a mountain.

1593
01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:19.690
It's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen on youtube.
It's fantastic.

1594
01:34:19.691 --> 01:34:23.600
But he has the meat we,
he was pretending to meet.
He throws a rock.

1595
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:28.250
He does this to get his meat is exactly getting Vaughn's.
No,
he likes to do,

1596
01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:32.860
you don't get elk at Vons.
He's a hunter.
Well,
he likes,
I think he likes the,

1597
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:35.440
the support of it because like I said,
the challenge,

1598
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:38.770
but is it a competition or just,
well,
yes,
because of the,

1599
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.540
it's one way competition.
You're,
you're competing for the officer,
the elks life.

1600
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:47.560
And if the elk winds,
it gets to run away and dodge that Arrow.

1601
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.130
But if it doesn't smell you in time or doesn't hear you step on a branch,

1602
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:53.380
then you put an Arrow through,
it's hard and you get to eat it.

1603
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.410
That's the competition.
Okay.
I mean,
you wouldn't think it's a sport,

1604
01:34:56.411 --> 01:34:58.130
but you have to be in fucking ridiculous

1605
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:01.880
<v 1>shape to do that.
But this guy,
this old school training method,</v>

1606
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:06.410
it's very appealing.
Like,
here's a rock in his backpack.
He could've had weights,

1607
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:10.970
you know,
it could have had 45 pound plates on his back and stacked it up to,

1608
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:15.020
you know,
130 pounds.
Nope,
no,
no.
He has a fucking rock.

1609
01:35:15.150 --> 01:35:18.080
Just a giant boom.
And he puts it a backpack,

1610
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:20.840
throws it over his shoulder and walks up to the top of a mountain.

1611
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:25.160
There's something about that that's more appealing for some reason to men than

1612
01:35:25.161 --> 01:35:29.930
seeing a guy do some squats and a gym wearing some [inaudible] sneakers.

1613
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:30.621
You know,

1614
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:34.100
getting on that Smith machine where it's all nice and smooth and doing some

1615
01:35:34.101 --> 01:35:37.610
squats.
I'm not doing weights anymore.
I'm going to put fucking rocks now.

1616
01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:43.020
I will be a fucking wimp if I put raw I to go rocks in my fucking wheelbarrows.

1617
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:48.350
It's not a bad idea.
No,
because it'll give them more of a,
I feel.
Yeah.

1618
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:50.600
Just way the rocks.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1619
01:35:50.690 --> 01:35:54.000
There's something to manly is fuck about moving rocks.
Chopping Wood.

1620
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:58.280
Get them a big heavy ass acts.
Don't do that because when guys get tired,

1621
01:35:58.281 --> 01:36:01.450
you don't want to fucking accident like of their knee off fat.

1622
01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:06.050
What about some fat naked chick?
No barrel.
No.

1623
01:36:06.051 --> 01:36:09.200
Put her in the wheelhouse.
Christ hook.
I got confused.

1624
01:36:09.201 --> 01:36:13.640
So what are you going to do to her?
Yeah,
I don't think that's a good idea.

1625
01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:16.400
There's not a lot of motivation there for anybody.
Not for her.

1626
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:19.540
I guess for her it would be a lot of fear.
Yeah.
You know,

1627
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:21.050
maybe that I'm motivated to lose weight,

1628
01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:25.790
but I doubt it probably was like six traumatizor have through a pork out.

1629
01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:30.440
You've just fat shamed.
Do you know that
it's of that,
you know,

1630
01:36:30.441 --> 01:36:34.370
my son's fighting Friday in la.
Yeah.
You're excited about shrine auditorium?

1631
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:38.870
Is it kickboxing or is it MMA?
What does the organization,
it's the RFA.
Oh,

1632
01:36:38.871 --> 01:36:43.040
that's right.
I'll get sworn in.
As far as organization,
do they,

1633
01:36:43.041 --> 01:36:46.910
are they still on access TV or they have an events on access TV?
I hope they do.

1634
01:36:47.410 --> 01:36:51.470
I,
that's one of the things I loved about HD net when it was HD net.
You know,

1635
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:56.390
I just love that they have so many fights on HD fights and they have them on all

1636
01:36:56.391 --> 01:36:58.340
the time,
all day,
all the time.

1637
01:36:58.490 --> 01:37:03.490
So many fights over and over to so many good fights on Hg net and then the boss

1638
01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:08.090
route and show the him and uh,
Kenny Rice,
a lot of MMA on that channel.

1639
01:37:08.190 --> 01:37:11.600
It's a good show.
Yeah.
I hope a RFA is still a with them.

1640
01:37:11.601 --> 01:37:14.660
I'm not sure if they are,
but a,
what is it like having your son fight?

1641
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:16.640
Is that weird?
Yeah,

1642
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:21.650
because the way I feel about fighting and he's 32 mm.
So I mean,

1643
01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.670
he's only a second fight pro fight.
How long has he been training his whole life?

1644
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.870
He's a train set as a kid,
you know,
basically five years old,
six years old.

1645
01:37:29.871 --> 01:37:30.441
He's been training,

1646
01:37:30.441 --> 01:37:35.441
but he just never really wanted to focus on the structured fighting.

1647
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:41.230
Always been a fighter,
always been a great martial artist.
Um,
they just,
you know,

1648
01:37:41.231 --> 01:37:45.840
you know,
I want to fight Pronoun.
I was like,
really?
Okay.

1649
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:50.930
Alright if you want.
But he did.
So he did his first fight.

1650
01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:55.920
It was as far as his first fight,
it was over really quick.
And uh,
he's six,

1651
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:56.370
four

1652
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.203
<v 3>one 85.</v>

1653
01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:02.220
<v 4>Wow.
That's a lot of reach.
Yeah.
I have to tell people at home people,
you know,
um,</v>

1654
01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:04.400
maybe you've never sparred even before,

1655
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:08.360
really have no idea what a massive advantage along reaches.

1656
01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:11.300
It's got a huge,
huge advantage,
you know,

1657
01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:14.060
in the ability to touch a guy when he can't touch you.

1658
01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:17.570
<v 3>Yeah,
I see it that way.</v>

1659
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:20.360
But then I see the other way too

1660
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.750
<v 4>where a guy who's got short arms,
like a Tyson just gets in and then</v>

1661
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:26.030
<v 3>now all of a sudden the advantage turns that quick.</v>

1662
01:38:26.031 --> 01:38:30.470
So I think if you know how to cut off the ring slash cage,

1663
01:38:31.130 --> 01:38:34.250
um,
cause I think if you did it,
if you did a study,

1664
01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.860
I don't know if the like the heavyweight champions and,
and I don't know if the,

1665
01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.140
the height would be that huge

1666
01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:44.150
<v 4>have,
I think it's pretty big.
You know why?</v>

1667
01:38:44.151 --> 01:38:46.670
Because I think that if you have the height,

1668
01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:49.630
you don't necessarily require big power.
Right.
You know,

1669
01:38:49.631 --> 01:38:54.050
like I think John is a tremendous athlete and one of the greatest talents to

1670
01:38:54.051 --> 01:38:57.710
ever fight in the UFC.
But if you had to describe John with one word,

1671
01:38:57.711 --> 01:39:00.380
it wouldn't be power.
You know,
he hits hard,

1672
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:04.290
no doubt about it and I'm sure he's getting better at hitting hard,
but it's,

1673
01:39:04.410 --> 01:39:07.820
it's a different kind of hard then like a chuck hard and you starches all these

1674
01:39:07.821 --> 01:39:11.180
guys with one shot and you realize like these guys got hit.

1675
01:39:11.181 --> 01:39:14.660
Like they got hit by a sniper,
boom.
He had someone there stiffening up.

1676
01:39:14.690 --> 01:39:16.880
You don't see that type of power with John.

1677
01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:20.450
<v 3>Yeah.
And I think,
but you think the height,</v>

1678
01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:24.390
<v 4>but I think that if you have height you can get away with more.</v>

1679
01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:27.120
Whereas if you are short and you got short limbs,

1680
01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:30.900
you better be able to do a lot of damage with every shot you land once you get

1681
01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:34.230
inside.
Like Tyson style.
Yeah.
You're like,
that was the thing about Tyson.

1682
01:39:34.231 --> 01:39:36.480
It wasn't just that he was,
you know,
short do,

1683
01:39:36.481 --> 01:39:38.130
you could do damage when you got inside.
It's just the,

1684
01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:41.880
what he could do in a short amount of time was so tremendous because of the

1685
01:39:41.881 --> 01:39:42.750
amount of power yet.

1686
01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.230
But if you had a guy like Pernell Whitaker that was like a short guy,

1687
01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:47.580
but he was short and stocky,

1688
01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:51.360
but he had that kind of style where it's like very slick and hard to hit but

1689
01:39:51.361 --> 01:39:53.310
really didn't put you out with one shot.

1690
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.340
I think it'd be a way less effective body size,
body type.

1691
01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:01.110
<v 3>Hmm.
Such as thinking.
No,
I mean,
I mean a lot of,</v>

1692
01:40:01.111 --> 01:40:05.760
I mean obviously it's um,
uh,
a common way of thing because they say,
you know,

1693
01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:09.450
you've reached your advantage.
They never say reached disadvantage.
Exactly.

1694
01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.320
But I just never found it that way.
But I,

1695
01:40:12.321 --> 01:40:15.210
I just think it's the skill of different things.
What do you think on the ground?

1696
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:16.860
Do you think height or,
or,

1697
01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.270
<v 4>or plays a part in triangles,
right?
But what Doris Doris was,</v>

1698
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:25.460
what about limbs for,
for getting true?
Yeah,
the shorter guy.
Well,
um,
I think,

1699
01:40:25.461 --> 01:40:29.150
uh,
it's harder to tuck yourself flat when you're defending armbars.

1700
01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:32.780
It's harder to not give up on buses and all that room when you get these big ass

1701
01:40:32.781 --> 01:40:36.470
fucking stork arms.
You know,
there's all room where guys can slip,

1702
01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.120
slip arms and grab hooks.

1703
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:41.840
But there's also so much leverage in long arms and long legs.

1704
01:40:41.841 --> 01:40:45.920
I think more of an advantage,
too long limbs than anything.

1705
01:40:46.190 --> 01:40:50.090
Like you look at a guy like Hodgett Gracie clearly uses his limbs to his

1706
01:40:50.091 --> 01:40:52.370
advantage.
Uh,
Braulio esteem.
Another guy,

1707
01:40:52.371 --> 01:40:56.630
long guy clearly uses that to his advantage.
Like broadly,

1708
01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:01.450
especially one of his,
uh,
signature moves is this sort of upside down triangle.

1709
01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.550
When guys are like trying to pass his garden,

1710
01:41:03.551 --> 01:41:07.300
he slap a triangle on you and it's like really weird,
awkward way.

1711
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.450
And I think that you,
uh,
you know,

1712
01:41:10.451 --> 01:41:14.500
you don't necessarily get that as much with guys with the shorter limbs because

1713
01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:15.460
it's just not available.

1714
01:41:15.461 --> 01:41:18.940
It's hard for like a guy like me with a short stubby legs.
I can't,

1715
01:41:18.941 --> 01:41:21.030
there's certain guys that is not going to triangle them.
Um,

1716
01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.860
cause I'm never going to get it around the back of my knee.
You know,

1717
01:41:23.861 --> 01:41:25.390
a guy who was like 260 pounds,

1718
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:29.470
most likely I'm not going to try and go on the angle that I'd have to cut to

1719
01:41:29.471 --> 01:41:31.930
actually lock that off would be so severe.
It'd be really,

1720
01:41:31.931 --> 01:41:34.970
really hard to pull off in a guy who knows what's going on.
Whereas a guy,

1721
01:41:34.971 --> 01:41:38.500
I'm like,
hundred Gracie,
those fucking legs are so God damn long.

1722
01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:41.070
You get inside of his guard,
all studies moving your route.

1723
01:41:41.071 --> 01:41:44.200
It's swipe and it's on you and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

1724
01:41:44.201 --> 01:41:48.070
It's just they're strong and they're long and the lever of those limbs,

1725
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:50.790
cause I think it's a pretty significant advantage on the ground as well.
Yeah.

1726
01:41:51.190 --> 01:41:54.490
<v 3>So I think,
I don't,
I've done or looked at it as one standing.</v>

1727
01:41:54.491 --> 01:41:57.790
I just think because I think that guy gets inside a lot.

1728
01:41:57.830 --> 01:42:00.850
He's going to have the advantage of the guys outside and I just don't think

1729
01:42:00.851 --> 01:42:04.900
getting inside would be that much of a deal because there's a cage or a ring.

1730
01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:07.670
<v 4>Right,
because you can't go.
Yeah.
You can't just keep moving.</v>

1731
01:42:07.671 --> 01:42:11.600
If it was in a big opener auditorium,
like if guys fought on a basketball court.

1732
01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:15.020
Yeah.
That would be very different.
Completely different sport.
Yeah.

1733
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:20.060
That's actually kind of a fascinating idea to have a,
a basketball court size,

1734
01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.500
like a basketball court sized room where a guy could just run around and you can

1735
01:42:24.501 --> 01:42:26.150
never get him up against the corner.

1736
01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:29.050
<v 3>And then,
and then let's give the other guy the chance to listen.</v>

1737
01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.030
I'm fighting the phone booth.

1738
01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:34.230
<v 4>Yeah.
Take it one round in the basketball court.</v>

1739
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:35.640
One round at a phone booth

1740
01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:38.520
<v 3>they had where you did one round point fighting</v>

1741
01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:44.190
and then one round we could only touch the by like a karate point fight.

1742
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:48.960
And then they put on gloves and then they did one round full kickboxing,

1743
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:52.800
and then they went back and they put on any speak,
loves,
I think.

1744
01:42:52.801 --> 01:42:55.200
And then they did one round.
Anything goes.
Remember that?

1745
01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:00.330
That little guy used to do that?
Uh,
who I know Shonie Carter used to do that.
Tim?

1746
01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:05.190
Yeah.
It was called,
shoot,
I forget the name,
but it was,
came from Hawaii.
Uh,
uh,

1747
01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.920
basically karate roots.

1748
01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:10.770
And so the guys that did it were usually better strikers,
but uh,

1749
01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.350
but um,

1750
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:14.990
<v 4>that's interesting.
You remember a Draka?
Yeah.</v>

1751
01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.390
These two have like kickbox and combined with [inaudible].

1752
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:20.950
<v 3>Yeah.
But you just take him down and then they had to get right back up.
Yeah.</v>

1753
01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.220
That was weird.
Well,
that's what,
isn't that similar to what a Kung leading edge,

1754
01:43:25.221 --> 01:43:27.390
woosh you or whatever?
Um,

1755
01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:31.280
<v 4>well,
yeah,
it's kind of did a lot of that.
The very similar stuff.
Yeah.</v>

1756
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:34.700
What did she,
what did they call it?
No,
no.
Woo Shu.
God Damn it.
What was it called?

1757
01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:39.650
Well,
she wasn't it.
I don't believe so.
I believe it was called that.
Um,

1758
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:43.700
what would that,
what the hell?
I can't believe I can't remember this.

1759
01:43:44.210 --> 01:43:46.180
I have too much information in my head.
John Hackleman.

1760
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:50.510
As I get older I feel like I'm getting stupider.
Sanshou San Shoe.

1761
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:52.070
Do you meditate?

1762
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:55.910
<v 0>Yes.
You do.
I just have too much information,
too much coming in.
I forget.</v>

1763
01:43:55.911 --> 01:43:57.980
But he was a very good wrestler as well,

1764
01:43:58.070 --> 01:44:01.370
so that was one of the reasons why he was good.
His kicking style,

1765
01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:03.440
which is so spectacular,
flamboyant.

1766
01:44:03.441 --> 01:44:05.990
One of the reasons why it's so effective as cousins wrassling was so good.

1767
01:44:05.991 --> 01:44:08.300
He could keep the fight standing and he,
you know,

1768
01:44:08.301 --> 01:44:10.670
he could take his leg when he throws a kick.
And first of all,

1769
01:44:10.671 --> 01:44:13.700
if you try and catch it,
you might get a broken arm.
And second of all,

1770
01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:17.060
if you do catch it as balanced,
as phenomenal.
What ever happened to him,

1771
01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:21.870
he just beat,
um,
rich Franklin.
He knocked out rich Franklin,
but he's got to move.

1772
01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.870
He couldn't one on right now in the UFC.
Oh,
okay.
[inaudible] overhand,
right.

1773
01:44:26.871 --> 01:44:29.960
Or a right hook.
There's a little while ago.
Yeah.
That's the last fight he's had.

1774
01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:35.540
He's busy.
He's got a lot of movie things going on.
Yeah.
I did a pretty big,

1775
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:39.700
um,
uh,
science fiction movie.
What was that?

1776
01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:44.240
Pandora,
is that what it was called?
Let me see what the move film career,

1777
01:44:44.241 --> 01:44:48.710
here we go.
Powerful Wikipedia.
Penn dorm.
Yeah,

1778
01:44:48.711 --> 01:44:50.810
that was the movie.
If you never seen that movie before.

1779
01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:56.000
It's a really interesting movie,
man.
Really interesting science fiction movie.

1780
01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.240
And he plays this dude in the future that is a existing around all these,

1781
01:45:01.791 --> 01:45:01.970
uh,

1782
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:06.970
freaky hybrid monster people that have been created there aren't doing your

1783
01:45:07.001 --> 01:45:11.270
ship.
Oh,
it was a good movie.
But is he good?
Yeah,
he's good man.
He's a good actor.

1784
01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:14.660
He's a good fucking actor.
And he does martial arts in the movie as well.

1785
01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.870
And realistic martial arts,
like,
you know,
he's doing,
you know,

1786
01:45:17.871 --> 01:45:20.990
he says he's a bad motherfucker.
Kang Lake.
These ain't Chuck's commercial.

1787
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:23.090
Which camera?
Oh,
the bud light commercial.

1788
01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:25.440
<v 3>Is it?
I mean like,
and,
and,</v>

1789
01:45:25.441 --> 01:45:30.350
and then watching a rampage on a team.
Yeah.
I these guys,
I mean,

1790
01:45:30.351 --> 01:45:32.360
I love to watch that because I mean,

1791
01:45:32.361 --> 01:45:36.620
it's not easy to read a script then try to portray something or else they actors

1792
01:45:36.621 --> 01:45:39.170
wouldn't make so much money.
It's not easy to do at all.
No.

1793
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:43.190
It's like when people tell you to say,
okay,
act scared and then say this,

1794
01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:48.110
it's hard to do that with oncommand.
Yeah.
And I think chuck is,
I mean,

1795
01:45:48.111 --> 01:45:49.370
he's got that personality.

1796
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:53.300
He's remember that he was on that talk show where he's playing with the dolls

1797
01:45:53.301 --> 01:45:57.080
and he loved to dress up dolls.
Do you remember that?
Yeah.
What was it?

1798
01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:00.980
He did a great job that he was,
I mean,
he's so funny.

1799
01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.570
<v 0>Well,
he can be himself.
You know,</v>

1800
01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:07.100
some people panic when they say ready action and they have so much wrapped up in

1801
01:46:07.101 --> 01:46:09.530
who they are that they'd come off like fake and weird.
Yeah.

1802
01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:12.220
<v 3>Yeah.
He's,
I think he's,
he's,
uh,
you know,</v>

1803
01:46:12.330 --> 01:46:14.690
living in Calabasas living in that lifestyle.

1804
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:19.490
I think he's going to take off in a second career.
You think so?
I do.
I can't.

1805
01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:20.960
I think he could.
I really do.

1806
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:25.250
I think just being him in front of a camera with any,

1807
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:30.680
in any background,
in any,
you know,
any way,
you know,
whether it be a movie or

1808
01:46:30.850 --> 01:46:34.500
<v 0>Randy's doing really well is he?
Yeah.
Randy had a quite a few movies,
man.</v>

1809
01:46:34.501 --> 01:46:37.320
He's in two of the expendables are three of the expendable Louise.

1810
01:46:37.710 --> 01:46:38.970
He's always got things going on.

1811
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:41.100
Randy's always got something cooking acting wise.

1812
01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:44.040
I've never been a was a big fucking movies.
I know,
I've heard about it.

1813
01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:48.030
I never saw it.
Never saw it.
He's got a big part.
Is he working in a sense corner?

1814
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:52.850
I'm not in the UFC.
His son's not in the UFC anymore.
Fine.
Um,

1815
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:54.120
I don't know if he worked to son's corner.

1816
01:46:54.121 --> 01:46:56.250
I know there was a big issue though in the UFC that he couldn't work.

1817
01:46:56.251 --> 01:47:00.480
It sounds corny.
I know.
It's some crazy stuff.
Yeah.
You know what man?

1818
01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.590
I have,

1819
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:06.590
Dana White is a very competitive guy and he has like very strong ideas about

1820
01:47:07.261 --> 01:47:11.730
loyalty and you know,
the UFC has everything to him and you know,

1821
01:47:12.150 --> 01:47:14.190
I'm a different kind of guy,
you know,

1822
01:47:14.191 --> 01:47:18.360
like I don't fault anybody for competing in another organization.

1823
01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.690
I don't fault anybody for,
you know,
I think the world's pretty big.

1824
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:24.420
There's plenty of room living room for a lot.

1825
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:27.450
And if the UFC wasn't using Randy and you know,

1826
01:47:27.451 --> 01:47:30.990
and he goes over and is on Bellator and he's coaching,

1827
01:47:30.991 --> 01:47:33.960
I honestly think it makes the UFC look better.
You know,

1828
01:47:34.530 --> 01:47:38.070
UFC champion is that you wanted to get this UFC champion on your show.

1829
01:47:38.071 --> 01:47:39.480
I think it's a free UFC ad.

1830
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:43.970
I don't think it changes the ratings of the UFC or changes the ratings Abella

1831
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:47.850
tour.
But what it does do is it gives Randy coture money.
You know?

1832
01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.590
I just think that UFC is fine.
It's not going nowhere,

1833
01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:56.610
you know?
And Dana,
it's like you're on my team or you're against me.
You know?

1834
01:47:56.611 --> 01:48:00.440
It's like,
yeah,
more like that by like that.
My team are against me.
Oh,

1835
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:03.090
well listen,
this is a call all hypocritical.

1836
01:48:03.091 --> 01:48:07.710
It's coming because it's coming from me who,
if I leave the UFC,
I'm done.

1837
01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:12.030
Like I'm never doing this for somebody else.
I do this UFC or that's it.

1838
01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:14.210
<v 3>I was going to say this,
but I,
I,</v>

1839
01:48:14.610 --> 01:48:17.880
before even you and Mike,

1840
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:21.440
I know I've told you this before.
I know it's probably like this,
you know,

1841
01:48:21.441 --> 01:48:25.890
it's getting tired.
I mean I have never,
I've been around combat sports,

1842
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:31.070
like I said competitively since 74 I've never heard you'd be considered a color

1843
01:48:32.071 --> 01:48:34.440
commentator and he's the comic.

1844
01:48:34.710 --> 01:48:38.910
I've never heard such a good team ever,
ever.

1845
01:48:38.911 --> 01:48:41.400
I mean I can't even just watching the,
the,

1846
01:48:41.401 --> 01:48:43.980
those fights when you guys are are calling neck fights.

1847
01:48:44.370 --> 01:48:46.530
It's unbelievable watching this fight.
It's the best.

1848
01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.720
It's just the personalities and then,

1849
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:52.770
and then throwing a Bruce buffer in for the announcing.

1850
01:48:54.330 --> 01:48:59.250
The combination is,
is it's,
it's actually magic and,
and between,
you know,

1851
01:48:59.251 --> 01:49:03.600
you guys calling the fights,
it's just such a perfect combination.

1852
01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:06.180
I mean it adds,
it adds to the UFC.

1853
01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.410
<v 0>Well that's so kind of you.
Thank you very much.</v>

1854
01:49:08.411 --> 01:49:11.070
I really appreciate that coming from you.
That means a lot,
man.
You're,

1855
01:49:11.071 --> 01:49:12.750
you're very kind guy.
You've always been very

1856
01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:14.760
<v 3>well.
You know that's true and it's,
it's really,</v>

1857
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:18.690
it's the DFC just happened to step up with with,

1858
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.910
and then everything just seemed to fall into place.

1859
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:25.410
I mean we got you guys calling it,
you've got Bruce buffer.
Then these,

1860
01:49:25.411 --> 01:49:29.760
the the matches and then the fighters and it's,
it's,
it's turned into,

1861
01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.080
it's turned into,
you know,
just something that'll just,
it's great.

1862
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:36.150
<v 0>Do you think about Dana is,</v>

1863
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:41.250
Dana is the one who like this vision of putting this all together.
He's the one,

1864
01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:44.370
he's the one that got me into commentary.
If I,
if it wasn't for Dana White,

1865
01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:49.210
I never asked for this job.
I never pursued it.
I turned down pride.

1866
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:52.120
They offered me the job of being the color commentator for pride.
I was like,

1867
01:49:52.121 --> 01:49:55.680
I don't want to do it.
I'm not going to Japan.
Thank you very much.
No thanks.

1868
01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:59.980
I can't do it.
I'm like,
I'm working too much as it is.
But when Dana said,

1869
01:49:59.981 --> 01:50:03.850
just do this one for me,
like UFC 37 and a half,
I'm like,
okay,
okay,
I'll do it.

1870
01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:04.451
You know,

1871
01:50:04.451 --> 01:50:08.190
I'd gone to a bunch of them and I would always do interviews for them and you

1872
01:50:08.191 --> 01:50:10.600
know,
talk to people about what I loved about the sport.

1873
01:50:10.601 --> 01:50:13.600
But I'd be in the audience when I was doing it and Dana,

1874
01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:17.290
he figured out that I would be a good guy for this.

1875
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:20.860
But like most people would have never hired a guy who's never done any sports

1876
01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:25.861
commentary at all ever and take them and make them a color guy on television for

1877
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:29.530
the first bout.
But this ridiculous.
But he's like,
you could do it.

1878
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:32.110
And then I figured out how to do it along the way.

1879
01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:34.180
But the thing about like Goldberg and me,

1880
01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:37.750
it's like we've been doing it together for so long.

1881
01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:40.210
Like I could finish that dude sentences.

1882
01:50:40.211 --> 01:50:42.220
I know what he's saying before he says it.

1883
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:45.010
He knows what I'm going to say most likely before I say it.

1884
01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:48.220
He knows when I'm saying things when I'm done.
We know,

1885
01:50:48.221 --> 01:50:52.570
like when each other wants to make a point,
we know when each other,
you know,

1886
01:50:52.571 --> 01:50:54.010
wants you to take over.

1887
01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:58.300
It's like we have this like smooth sort of like communication that you only get

1888
01:50:58.301 --> 01:51:02.710
from calling it a thousand plus fights together.
It's a long ass time.

1889
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:07.150
<v 3>Yeah,
I agree.
But I disagree.
I mean,
you could,
you could have two guys,</v>

1890
01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:12.100
you could also have two guys that,
or to,
you know,
a guy in a woman in a marriage.

1891
01:51:12.101 --> 01:51:15.070
It can be married forever and it's just sometimes it's just not going to work.

1892
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:18.460
That's true.
So I think at the chemistry and the,
I mean,

1893
01:51:18.461 --> 01:51:20.660
you have so much knowledge when you're watching it.

1894
01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:25.430
And I remember in the beginning I was thinking,
oh,
he's like grappler base.

1895
01:51:25.431 --> 01:51:29.470
He's a little,
but you know,
that's just me.
But,
um,

1896
01:51:30.130 --> 01:51:34.480
but you just have so much knowledge,
you know?
Um,
I mean,
you know,
so many of the,

1897
01:51:34.810 --> 01:51:38.260
because when it hits the ground,
you know,
obviously a lot of the guys are like,

1898
01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:42.430
you know the fans,
but you always like,
exactly.
You say,

1899
01:51:42.431 --> 01:51:45.430
what's exactly what's going to happen here?
What should happen here,

1900
01:51:45.431 --> 01:51:49.570
what might happen here,
and how this guy should do this.
And it makes it,

1901
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:51.370
it makes it really easy to watch,
you know?

1902
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:54.790
<v 0>Well,
that's awesome man.
I really appreciate that.
It's fun to do.
You know,</v>

1903
01:51:54.791 --> 01:51:58.810
I never thought I would ever be involved in any sports in any way,
shape or form.

1904
01:51:58.990 --> 01:52:03.760
It was never an ambition.
So the fact that it's so seamless and so easy to do,

1905
01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:08.880
but it's just really just because I'm honestly a huge student of martial arts my

1906
01:52:09.131 --> 01:52:09.641
whole life.

1907
01:52:09.641 --> 01:52:14.620
I always have been and always uniquely fascinated by new techniques and drills.

1908
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.440
How a guy's getting over on another guy.
How guy did this,

1909
01:52:17.441 --> 01:52:20.440
when he should have done that.
Like,
I love what,
you know what I love?

1910
01:52:20.441 --> 01:52:23.320
I love watching dudes show real sneaky shit.

1911
01:52:23.321 --> 01:52:26.500
Like Tj Walberger you just see is not TJ.

1912
01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:32.160
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
Um,
in,
uh,
Sacramento.
Yes.
God dammit.
Yeah.</v>

1913
01:52:32.190 --> 01:52:34.830
He was the guy who looks like he's from,
he looks like he's from Boston,

1914
01:52:34.831 --> 01:52:36.900
but he's not Miller Miller,
right?
No,

1915
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:41.880
<v 0>no,
no,
no,
no.
Dillashaw Tj,
Tj Dillashaw.
Oh,
I brain's mush today.
Okay.</v>

1916
01:52:41.881 --> 01:52:44.750
This is one of the worst brain days I've had in weeks.
I'm thinking it's,

1917
01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:47.540
it's trained right before I got here.
I'm exhausted.

1918
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:49.610
So my fucking noodles not working so sweet.

1919
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:53.960
But I'm Tj Dillashaw fought Mike Easton.
Yeah,

1920
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:55.580
in Georgia last week.

1921
01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:01.060
The fucking kid was moving so good doing all this sneaky shit all he's like,

1922
01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.880
you think he's going for a take down?
He throws a head kick.

1923
01:53:04.881 --> 01:53:06.890
You think he's going for a punch?
He throws a knee.

1924
01:53:06.891 --> 01:53:11.750
He was doing all this really subtle shit as far as like his movement and the in

1925
01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:16.490
and out and moving from side to side,
avoiding the attacks of Easton,
but landing,

1926
01:53:16.491 --> 01:53:20.450
let consistent shots over and over again picking his style apart.

1927
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:25.550
So interesting to see these kids like really evolve and grow.

1928
01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:29.120
And when I see a guy like Tj Dillashaw and I see him evolve and grow like that,

1929
01:53:29.121 --> 01:53:32.090
like that's to me one of my favorite things in the sport.

1930
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.320
Seeing a guy who's like,
you'd see him on the ultimate fighter,
he's talented,

1931
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:41.360
he's a raw young kid,
loses,
you know,
to a,
a really scary guy.

1932
01:53:41.361 --> 01:53:45.110
And Dodson.
I mean,
Dodson at that weight as a fucking demon.

1933
01:53:45.111 --> 01:53:48.500
He's a will of the wisp kids so fast and he can knock guys out,

1934
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:51.230
which is a rare thing for 135 pounds.

1935
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:56.530
And then he see Dillashaw go from that to just slowly but surely putting all

1936
01:53:56.631 --> 01:53:58.700
these skills together.
Now you're looking at me go,

1937
01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.560
this kid is a bad motherfucker and you're watching them grow right before your

1938
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:08.360
eyes.
You watching him like step into his,
his future right before your eyes.

1939
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:09.980
That's one of the most exciting things for me.

1940
01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.000
<v 3>Talking to him.
He's like nicest kid in the world.
That's why it's so scary too.</v>

1941
01:54:14.001 --> 01:54:17.430
It's like,
I mean,
you're talking to this guy like a um,

1942
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:22.940
training with Steve.
Steve Mako.
You ever heard of them?
Yes.
Okay.

1943
01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:26.240
So he was over yesterday training and we're going over the hooks,

1944
01:54:26.241 --> 01:54:29.690
which you're going to do a left hook later.
Hope left,
took to your pads.

1945
01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:34.130
I really want us show you the leftover.
Okay.
Um,
it's my favorite punch.

1946
01:54:35.170 --> 01:54:39.950
Um,
but when I met him I thought,
you know,
hey,
what's up man?
How you doing?

1947
01:54:40.090 --> 01:54:44.020
He was the glove.
I thought he's a friend and lowers,
he looked like a,
as a you,

1948
01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:49.040
he looks like a Barney rubble on steroids,
bro.
What do you do?
And he's like,

1949
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:51.980
Oh,
wrestled da Da da Da.
And I was like,
I dunno.
Wrestling.
So,

1950
01:54:52.210 --> 01:54:57.080
but then I find out along the way,
this guy is like a bad ass wrestler.

1951
01:54:57.081 --> 01:55:01.460
I mean,
he's like,
you know,
USA,
this entity,
this Aa,
this,
whatever.

1952
01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:06.710
And he's like the real deal because all the other UFC guys know him and it's

1953
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:07.490
like,

1954
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:12.490
it's scary because guys like that or Tj or this Guy Marcus Alameda here of him.

1955
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:20.790
Marcos Almeida.
Yeah.
Some of the Jujitsu,
the same name or to,

1956
01:55:20.791 --> 01:55:24.410
or something is like,
wait,
he is,
they call him,

1957
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:26.150
his nickname was like fat cheeks.

1958
01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:28.670
I don't know what in everything his name is Marcus,

1959
01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:31.940
all the Meta and he just won some

1960
01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.000
absolute something.

1961
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:37.700
<v 0>Well,
there's another guy named Marcus Alameda who's a singer.</v>

1962
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:42.220
<v 3>Oh,
this guy is a Jujitsu guy.
Yeah,
here it is.</v>

1963
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:45.690
The world guy.
Yeah,
there's,
there's a couple of them.
He was like,

1964
01:55:45.691 --> 01:55:50.550
he was on the show with us.
Um,
the ultimate fighter,
cause we did season 19.

1965
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:54.690
Um,
and I'm walking around with him.
I didn't know who he is.

1966
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:58.440
I don't follow Jujitsu and you know,
a,
you know,
we're walking around in it,

1967
01:55:58.441 --> 01:55:59.600
you know,
somebody asked me,
Oh,

1968
01:55:59.601 --> 01:56:02.940
can I get a picture and this thing and he's like holding the camera and then we

1969
01:56:02.941 --> 01:56:07.500
go behind the scenes behind the,
you know,
the UFC,
the training rooms is,

1970
01:56:07.501 --> 01:56:12.480
one of the UFC is,
was,
was going on.
Um,
and that all the fighters know him.

1971
01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.220
It was like they're running up to them.

1972
01:56:14.221 --> 01:56:16.800
They want to take their picture with them.
And I was walking like,
go,

1973
01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.880
who are you man?
What do you,
what do you do?
I just do Jiu Jitsu and,

1974
01:56:21.170 --> 01:56:23.760
and I find that,
I look him up.
He's like the,
the,

1975
01:56:23.761 --> 01:56:26.750
like the world's Best Jujitsu Guy Right now,
or the wind.

1976
01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:28.590
He's one of the top guys for sure.

1977
01:56:28.591 --> 01:56:33.060
He just won a Abu Dhabi and the absolute division.
Yeah.
So,
so,

1978
01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:37.980
you know,
he had a draw with Heidrick Gracie in Metamorris,
so that's good.

1979
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:39.280
That's pretty fucking impressive.

1980
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:43.050
So is rapper one of the strongest grapplers on earth without a doubt.

1981
01:56:43.051 --> 01:56:46.380
One of the very best guys.
And when you,
and the thing about this sport,

1982
01:56:46.381 --> 01:56:48.120
like the boxers,
you know,
I hung around,
you know,

1983
01:56:48.121 --> 01:56:52.530
I grew up more boxing and hardcore Mahershala guys and that you could just tell,

1984
01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:57.570
but in this sport it's so scary cause like a guy like Steve Mako.

1985
01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.450
Yeah.
I mean you're going to go up to me to him,
you're in a bar,

1986
01:57:00.451 --> 01:57:02.910
you've had a few drinks and you're going to go up to him and say something.

1987
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:04.200
You know,
if you don't do that,
yeah.

1988
01:57:04.201 --> 01:57:08.040
It's like [inaudible] or do you go to go up to someone like Tj Dillashaw and say

1989
01:57:08.041 --> 01:57:11.220
something big mistake.
Huge cheat me.

1990
01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:15.540
I got this guy named Castle Williams of fights.
Me 19 year old kid.

1991
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:19.920
They looks like Bieber,
Justin Bieber,
and um,

1992
01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:23.130
he's one of my,
he's undefeated fighter fighting,
you know,

1993
01:57:23.131 --> 01:57:26.310
King of the cage and he's like,
he looks like,
like I said,

1994
01:57:26.311 --> 01:57:27.330
it looks like Dustin Bieber,

1995
01:57:27.331 --> 01:57:31.560
but he will take your head off and then throw you down and put you in some kind

1996
01:57:31.561 --> 01:57:36.440
of lock and lock something up until it breaks.
We'll Siler is,
oh my gosh.

1997
01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:40.440
Sweet looking kid.
Let me tell you,
I get nice nick next door neighbor boy.

1998
01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:43.050
Like no American kid.
Okay.
Siler.

1999
01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:48.240
Chuck clover.
Um,
all my fighters are great,

2000
01:57:48.241 --> 01:57:52.110
but these guys just before a fight,

2001
01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:54.180
you'll never think they're going to fight.

2002
01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:58.720
You think they're going to go to seven 11.
I mean like Siler before fight is,

2003
01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.670
is the absolute calmness guy I've ever seen before.
Fight.

2004
01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:04.890
He's in the dress room,
like I said,

2005
01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:08.430
playing video games with his opponent and they're laughing.

2006
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.840
I've seen him fight before last.
He's in the,
he's in the,

2007
01:58:12.841 --> 01:58:16.410
in the dressing room with his wife who used to come into corner with them all

2008
01:58:16.411 --> 01:58:18.270
the time.
The last one she didn't,

2009
01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:22.260
but she usually does and they're playing like they're looking on like for cute

2010
01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:26.280
little stuff for the house and the Eggo,
Bro.
We got a warm up now.
He goes coach.

2011
01:58:26.281 --> 01:58:29.880
Okay,
like three more minutes.
Let me look at this.
And walking out to the cage,

2012
01:58:29.881 --> 01:58:33.990
he's just like you fighting Glover before he fought to Hoonah,

2013
01:58:34.290 --> 01:58:36.030
we're walking out and I'm like,
okay Bro,

2014
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.560
I don't want you to slugging with this guy.

2015
01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.840
Why aren't you taking them down real quick?
And you know,
I'm going over this.

2016
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:42.520
The thing is,
coach,
I got this,
I got this.

2017
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:45.730
Then we get up right to the end and birch yelling and there's,
you know,

2018
01:58:45.731 --> 01:58:47.230
it's a massive UFC and,

2019
01:58:47.590 --> 01:58:52.000
and I'm so nervous and Glover turns to me right before we went to take the final

2020
01:58:52.001 --> 01:58:56.830
walk to the cage and he goes,
coach,
fuck,
I don't want to do this man.

2021
01:58:56.831 --> 01:59:00.010
I'm fucking scared.
I want to quit right now.
I don't want to fight.

2022
01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.530
But he didn't smile and he didn't look like he was joking.

2023
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:05.440
What does the trainer do?
I'm not going to make him go out there.

2024
01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:09.700
I just don't want to do this anymore.
Coach and I looked at him,

2025
01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:12.100
I just didn't know what to say cause I'm joking.

2026
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.580
Let's go out and he goes look to,
as I'm talking,
you need to relax my,

2027
01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:20.320
let's go have some fun.
So I mean it was just these guys,

2028
01:59:20.890 --> 01:59:25.480
they're just so cool.
These MMA guys is scary.
This is what over him looks like.

2029
01:59:25.481 --> 01:59:30.220
No.
Yeah,
he's,
he's,
he's lost a lot of weight.
He was down a little bit.
Huh?

2030
01:59:30.270 --> 01:59:33.530
<v 4>He's lost a lot of weight.
I don't know how much,
but that's a good idea.
You know,</v>

2031
01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.250
was carrying so much muscle around with them.

2032
01:59:35.251 --> 01:59:38.370
I mean you saw on the Travis Brown fight,
perfect example.

2033
01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:41.370
I mean he's all over charis bound in the beginning of the first.

2034
01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:44.040
He just couldn't keep up that pace.
She couldn't do it.

2035
01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:48.740
You think a lot of that's HGH as well as the TRT.
Who knows?
Who knows?

2036
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:52.170
Scary one.
You do that well,
you know what it is,
man.

2037
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:56.250
If you looked at how big he was when he was the k one Grand Prix champion,

2038
01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:00.090
the accusations were always there.
So then the accusations,

2039
02:00:00.450 --> 02:00:04.350
he tests positive.
So then when he tests positive and he has this excuse for it,

2040
02:00:04.351 --> 02:00:07.980
but then when he's not on the testosterone,

2041
02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.530
now he shows like low testosterone.

2042
02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:14.580
So I think he's trying to do it legitimately now.
But the problem is,
I think,

2043
02:00:14.581 --> 02:00:16.680
like you talked about before,
a lot of these guys,

2044
02:00:16.681 --> 02:00:19.600
they run the risk of screwing up their endocrine system by,
you know,

2045
02:00:19.650 --> 02:00:23.160
hyper juicing it.
And then they go back to trying to be natural.

2046
02:00:23.161 --> 02:00:25.110
And they're kind of at a big disadvantage.

2047
02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:30.720
<v 3>If you go low,
if your,
if your testosterone is low,
I mean,
yeah,</v>

2048
02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.260
it's easy if you're that big,
I mean,
your testosterone is low.

2049
02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:38.130
There's some fen feminine qualities that are kind of come in because that's what

2050
02:00:38.131 --> 02:00:41.370
happens.
I mean,
it's a competing estrogen,
you know,

2051
02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:45.030
cause we have estrogen as well.
Right.
You know,
I mean,
we don't,

2052
02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:49.070
we don't have nanograms like we do.
Uh,
you know,
we don't have nanograms of,
of,

2053
02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.490
of estrogen.
Like we do testosterone,
we have pico grams,
which is,
you know,

2054
02:00:53.491 --> 02:00:57.090
a trillionth of a gram,
but there's a lot less.

2055
02:00:57.091 --> 02:01:01.140
But when we start messing with that fine balance,
I mean there's,
I mean,

2056
02:01:01.141 --> 02:01:03.780
we're going to grow some boobs and a vagina and I'm just saying,

2057
02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:07.370
<v 4>but think of Ronda Rousey,
who's feminine and Misha Tate is feminine,</v>

2058
02:01:07.371 --> 02:01:11.450
but they're still fucking badass beasts.
You know,
they're still wicked fighters.

2059
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:14.450
Okay.
What's,
how come a man,
when is it,

2060
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.480
is competitiveness in the mind or do you think that the having the extra

2061
02:01:19.491 --> 02:01:22.970
testosterone,
the system actually does make you more aggressive,

2062
02:01:22.971 --> 02:01:24.230
make you more competitive?

2063
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:26.680
<v 3>That would never,
they'll never,</v>

2064
02:01:26.681 --> 02:01:31.681
ever be discovered or proven unless they fight men.

2065
02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:36.310
Yes.
Women fight men.
How do you,
how do you figure that?
Well,

2066
02:01:36.311 --> 02:01:40.640
because if you're saying you're taking testosterone,
so yeah,
because they have,

2067
02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.770
you know,
a low testosterone,
they're women,
they have more estrogen,

2068
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:48.080
but they're fighting each other,
which they look great fighting each other.

2069
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:51.380
Just like when you ever watch a channel 34,
the Mexican channel,

2070
02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:55.940
you can watch two very mediocre Mexican boxers.
They're just,
they look,

2071
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:59.570
they both look like to archer.
God,
he's there going,
I mean,

2072
02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:02.810
but then if you put them in with you,
put them in with the Mayweather,

2073
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:04.910
they're going to look just like amateur.

2074
02:02:04.911 --> 02:02:08.420
So I mean as good as the girls are and they are fantastic.

2075
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:12.440
I don't think they can ever compete because of the testosterone with men.

2076
02:02:12.441 --> 02:02:16.640
That's why they had that Fallon issue.
Yeah,
I agree with you on both counts.

2077
02:02:16.641 --> 02:02:19.830
I think that the,
um,
you know,
the idea that there,

2078
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:24.690
<v 4>that,
that it's somehow another equal.
So then it becomes a matter of like,</v>

2079
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:29.520
if a guy has a really low testosterone because of,
you know,
past steroid use,

2080
02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.620
do you think the guy should be allowed to compete?

2081
02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:34.710
Because if he has a really low testosterone and he's competing with guys like

2082
02:02:34.711 --> 02:02:37.200
Glover who are natural,
who are in really good shape,

2083
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:40.970
it could be potentially like real dangerous.
Like he has a limit to his gas.

2084
02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.233
<v 3>Right?
So,</v>

2085
02:02:42.450 --> 02:02:46.260
and I've had this discussion with people that most people that disagree with me

2086
02:02:46.261 --> 02:02:49.740
and most people do disagree with me on most things for some reason.

2087
02:02:49.741 --> 02:02:52.390
Agree with you most of the time.
How about that?
Thank you.
I'm on your side.

2088
02:02:53.070 --> 02:02:57.570
Most people don't,
I mean it's like I get,
I,
I'm like every,
my political view,

2089
02:02:57.571 --> 02:02:59.190
I have every sports.

2090
02:02:59.191 --> 02:03:03.840
I mean they only agree with me on my left hook and my head kick.
Other than that,

2091
02:03:03.841 --> 02:03:06.330
they're like,
they disagree with almost everything I say.

2092
02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:09.300
But I think if the woman,
you know,

2093
02:03:09.301 --> 02:03:13.470
like the do the Fallon okay.
This,
how was it?
That was a big thing.
Yeah,

2094
02:03:13.471 --> 02:03:16.690
it was a huge thing.
I took a lot of heat from that.
Um,

2095
02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:19.770
if people thought it was being transphobic,
which I'm absolutely not,

2096
02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.400
I couldn't care less what you want to do.
I'm happy if you're happy.

2097
02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:27.540
But I think that the idea that you could be a man for 30 years and then compete

2098
02:03:27.541 --> 02:03:30.990
in mixed martial arts as a woman,
it's pretty preposterous.
It's,
it's actually,

2099
02:03:30.991 --> 02:03:35.910
it's ludicrous.
It's like I'm as gay friendly as as they come.
I mean,

2100
02:03:35.911 --> 02:03:39.660
I could,
uh,
if wasn't for that,
can I,
can I cuss on this?

2101
02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:43.090
If it wasn't for sucking cock?
Hmm.

2102
02:03:43.290 --> 02:03:46.020
Which I would probably be firmly opposed to,

2103
02:03:46.050 --> 02:03:50.460
I could probably be a gay guy because I'm sensitive.
I love chick flicks.

2104
02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:54.780
I hate watching fights when the guy hurts the guy.
I don't,
I,
you know,

2105
02:03:54.781 --> 02:03:56.960
I hate that.
So I,

2106
02:03:57.450 --> 02:04:02.310
but I'm not gay unfortunately.
Uh,
but I think that's,

2107
02:04:02.311 --> 02:04:06.360
I mean,
it's nothing to do with gay or straight.
No,
they'll tell you it is.

2108
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:10.830
They're silly.
They're just being,
what they're doing is they are opposed to your,

2109
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:14.850
your point of view and your point of view is that that's not a woman.

2110
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:16.103
And they want it.

2111
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:17.810
<v 4>You'd accept her as a woman.</v>

2112
02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:21.170
They want you to accept the fact that she has had a sex change and she's a woman

2113
02:04:21.171 --> 02:04:24.740
now.
And I say in all things except for that one.

2114
02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:29.140
And all things except for the bone structure is completely different.
It's been,

2115
02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:32.840
you're involved in a striking art where you're trying to give each other

2116
02:04:32.841 --> 02:04:33.351
concussions.

2117
02:04:33.351 --> 02:04:38.220
And I know for a fact there's some guys even that are just built in a way that

2118
02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:39.290
other guys aren't.
All right.

2119
02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:41.220
And when you see those two guys compete against each other,

2120
02:04:41.221 --> 02:04:44.020
the guy with the bones has a significant advantage.
Yeah.

2121
02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.720
But it's never usually as radical as the idea of a guy competing against a girl.

2122
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:53.430
And so even if you change the hormonal characteristics of this person and make

2123
02:04:53.431 --> 02:04:55.260
them hormonally a woman,

2124
02:04:55.530 --> 02:04:59.550
the bone structure remains the same for 15 years.

2125
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:03.940
They're talking about it like,
like how long it takes to lose the,
you know,

2126
02:05:04.050 --> 02:05:08.670
and d for bone density to start really decreasing to noticeable levels.

2127
02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.260
It takes a long ass time.

2128
02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:14.690
<v 3>Well,
when the,
and when they say that,
just like the guy with the low t from,</v>

2129
02:05:14.691 --> 02:05:18.980
from one hit in the head,
which he's a doctor,
he probably knows more than I do,

2130
02:05:18.981 --> 02:05:21.260
but I would,
I would like to disagree with it and see it.
Yeah.

2131
02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:25.320
<v 4>I think what he's saying is it happens sometimes and he's dealing with those</v>

2132
02:05:25.321 --> 02:05:26.460
people that it happens too.

2133
02:05:26.461 --> 02:05:28.800
If you get the broad range of people that have been hit in the head,

2134
02:05:28.801 --> 02:05:31.230
how many times does it happen?
Is it 1%?

2135
02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:35.100
If it's the only 1% think of how many people are coming to him with traumatic

2136
02:05:35.101 --> 02:05:36.480
brain injury that have low test.

2137
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:41.770
<v 3>But I'm thinking for,
so for the women,
I mean over 15 years,</v>

2138
02:05:41.771 --> 02:05:44.950
I think you're still a man cause he'd been a man for 20 but whatever,

2139
02:05:44.951 --> 02:05:47.080
whatever the d series.
30 Huh?

2140
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:52.160
<v 4>30 30 30 years as a man and then a woman and then becoming a woman fighter.</v>

2141
02:05:52.381 --> 02:05:57.060
It's like,
so it's so the t's lows lost.
She lost one of her recent fights,

2142
02:05:57.061 --> 02:06:00.450
but she lost to a woman who was just really fucking good.
Yeah.
You know,

2143
02:06:00.451 --> 02:06:05.130
and she just,
she's not really fucking good.
The woman she fought,
persevered,

2144
02:06:05.131 --> 02:06:09.690
got through it and finished her off.
You know,
it doesn't mean it's still not,

2145
02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:13.620
it's ridiculous situation.
Yeah.
Just because a woman figured out how to beat her,

2146
02:06:13.621 --> 02:06:16.890
what it means is that that advantage still wasn't enough for her to beat someone

2147
02:06:16.891 --> 02:06:17.510
better than her.

2148
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:19.670
<v 3>So do you think then,
I mean with that,</v>

2149
02:06:21.170 --> 02:06:24.890
so the guy that does the testosterone when he's younger or when he's doing

2150
02:06:24.891 --> 02:06:28.040
steroids,
when he wants to be a body builder,
when he's younger or whatever.

2151
02:06:28.250 --> 02:06:31.760
So now he has a low t.
I mean,
is it fair,
shitty?

2152
02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:36.200
Is it fair to say you can't compete now because you're on TRT?
I think it is.

2153
02:06:36.201 --> 02:06:36.800
I think,

2154
02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:41.800
I think a lot of your past decisions in your life affect you and,

2155
02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:46.340
and if,
I mean,
why should that guy get to do it?

2156
02:06:46.341 --> 02:06:49.780
When this guy who said I wasn't he,
he wasn't doing testosterone,

2157
02:06:49.810 --> 02:06:54.140
why can't he do it?
I mean,
so I think that decision people that just the,

2158
02:06:54.490 --> 02:06:56.870
the disagreement I got was,
well,

2159
02:06:56.871 --> 02:06:59.620
why should you take that away from him from a mistake he made in the past?

2160
02:06:59.630 --> 02:07:01.070
I said,
well,
if he,

2161
02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:05.780
if he made another mistake in the past and now all of a sudden he can't vote or

2162
02:07:05.781 --> 02:07:09.140
he can't go to college because you didn't go to high school.
I mean,

2163
02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.510
he just can't.
There's certain things you can't do.

2164
02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:14.280
<v 4>Hmm.
Yeah.
I see what you're saying.
Look,
if you're a felon,</v>

2165
02:07:14.281 --> 02:07:16.020
you can't own a firearm and you can't be a cop.

2166
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:17.390
<v 3>No.
Now you'll never be a cop.</v>

2167
02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:20.630
Should you take that away from this guy because he didn't make a mistake in the

2168
02:07:20.631 --> 02:07:22.730
past.
Sorry.
That's just the way it goes.

2169
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.360
<v 4>Yeah,
and that'll stop.
If there's a way to stop people from doing it,</v>

2170
02:07:26.361 --> 02:07:29.970
that is the way,
right to say you.
You're,
you can't,
you cannot do,

2171
02:07:29.971 --> 02:07:31.120
you never take it now.
Yeah.

2172
02:07:31.121 --> 02:07:34.430
You can ever say is reserved for people who have a medical condition that didn't

2173
02:07:34.431 --> 02:07:35.700
abuse her father.
That's

2174
02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:39.070
<v 0>if that's the case,
that's where [inaudible] comes into play.</v>

2175
02:07:39.071 --> 02:07:42.490
That's where Vittoria it gets strange because Vito has been caught before.

2176
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:46.310
<v 3>Okay.
And,
and a lot of people do.
And there's a,
I mean,
so many people on it now.</v>

2177
02:07:46.311 --> 02:07:49.540
It's not even,
I mean it's,
I mean it's,
I,

2178
02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:53.750
I'd be willing to bet over 50% of the guys are doing it now.
It's probably lower,

2179
02:07:53.751 --> 02:07:58.040
but I don't,
I,
I think it's close to the heavier guys.

2180
02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.340
<v 0>Do you have any guys,
you don't have to name names.</v>

2181
02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:02.200
Do you have any guys that are on it?
No.
No.

2182
02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:04.270
Is it because of your influence on them?

2183
02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:06.360
<v 3>I have not never let my guys do it,</v>

2184
02:08:06.361 --> 02:08:10.710
but now that it's becoming legal for my most competitive guys,

2185
02:08:10.711 --> 02:08:14.190
I'd have a real hard time looking at them in the face and saying,
sorry,

2186
02:08:14.191 --> 02:08:18.330
your dream to be at a title holder is going to be diminished because,

2187
02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:21.430
because of my,
my old fashions,
yeah.

2188
02:08:21.450 --> 02:08:25.350
Old fashioned ethics in my not too smart thinking but sorry,

2189
02:08:25.351 --> 02:08:26.610
that's just the way it is at the pit.

2190
02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:31.530
I've done a lot of things for my guys and to my thing,
you know,
to my guys and,

2191
02:08:31.890 --> 02:08:34.560
and I've,
I've,
I think I've closed some doors for him.

2192
02:08:34.561 --> 02:08:38.900
There's certain things I don't allow and I,
I don't think I would not,
I,
if,

2193
02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:42.180
if the UFC is going to say it,
you can do it now than I,

2194
02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:44.310
I couldn't look at my guy in there,
I'd say no.

2195
02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:48.150
<v 0>Well I respect that.
I respect that honesty too.
Cause that's a very,
uh,</v>

2196
02:08:48.630 --> 02:08:53.630
what you just gave is a all be controversial and honest response because that's

2197
02:08:54.121 --> 02:08:57.540
one of the things about you and your relationship with fighters that are really,

2198
02:08:57.870 --> 02:09:01.800
really respected.
You really care about those guys.
It's a very obvious,
too much.

2199
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:03.570
So always very obvious.

2200
02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:07.710
There's some guys when you see them in their coaching fighters,
it's um,
it's,

2201
02:09:07.711 --> 02:09:10.680
you know,
it's,
it's certainly personal.
It's certainly emotional,

2202
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:13.080
but not to the degree the degree is with you,

2203
02:09:13.650 --> 02:09:16.500
<v 3>Eh,
these guys are,
yeah,
I think,</v>

2204
02:09:16.501 --> 02:09:18.760
I think a lot of it has to my past and stuff.

2205
02:09:18.761 --> 02:09:23.260
But I mean I actually broke down after a fight once and I've always got real

2206
02:09:23.261 --> 02:09:27.580
nervous after fights by broke down after actually want a Glover's fights.
And,

2207
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:31.180
and after the fight I was sitting in a corner and I was just couldn't stop

2208
02:09:31.181 --> 02:09:36.160
crying and I was just,
I can't remember.
He got hit,
he got rocked a little.

2209
02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:38.650
And then I dunno,
I don't remember.

2210
02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:42.460
I don't remember what site it was cause it just happens now.
Every fight almost.

2211
02:09:42.490 --> 02:09:46.260
Wow.
And I just remember my aunt and I was just thinking I don't,

2212
02:09:46.261 --> 02:09:47.900
I shouldn't be doing the same way.
I just,

2213
02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:51.370
I can't tolerate this watching my guys get hurt,
you know?

2214
02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:52.990
And then it happened real bad.

2215
02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:54.670
<v 0>You'll Maldonado was it that fight?</v>

2216
02:09:55.050 --> 02:09:57.090
<v 3>Yeah.
So that was the second time then.
Yeah.</v>

2217
02:09:57.091 --> 02:10:00.060
And he knew how mad I was after that fight.

2218
02:10:00.061 --> 02:10:03.450
I think he said something to the announcer right after the fight and he knew I

2219
02:10:03.451 --> 02:10:05.760
couldn't even talk to them.
I couldn't even talk to him for hours.

2220
02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:10.260
I have to fight cause he did that.
He dropped his hands.

2221
02:10:10.290 --> 02:10:13.930
He did that in a find the WC once he got caught and he went and knocked the guy

2222
02:10:13.931 --> 02:10:14.670
out right away.

2223
02:10:14.670 --> 02:10:16.860
And the first thing he did when he came back to the corner it was,

2224
02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:19.250
I'm sorry coach,
I know how you feel about that.

2225
02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:22.440
I know cause I just cause they know it's not a joke for me.

2226
02:10:22.850 --> 02:10:26.190
Trauma is no joke for me.
I agree.
And it's like,
I do not,

2227
02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:28.920
I will throw in the towel.
Like,
I mean,

2228
02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:33.170
I'll throw in the towel so quick that,
I mean,
if my guy gets hurt,

2229
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:37.430
the towel is going in like I did.
I mean like with chuck fought rampage,
you know,

2230
02:10:37.431 --> 02:10:41.030
I'm the first one,
he wasn't even really getting hurt,

2231
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:44.960
but I just saw he was hurting inside.
He was,
he was stuck in a half guard.

2232
02:10:44.961 --> 02:10:49.760
He couldn't get up and he was exhausted and,
and it just broke my heart,
you know?

2233
02:10:49.761 --> 02:10:52.040
So it's like getting smashed with elbows.
Yeah.

2234
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:54.690
But they're mostly to the body issues though,
right.

2235
02:10:54.770 --> 02:10:58.280
<v 0>Rampage through some nasty elbows to the body.
That was rampage,</v>

2236
02:10:59.630 --> 02:11:01.250
rampage Jackson and the pride days,

2237
02:11:01.251 --> 02:11:05.100
like when he slammed her Cardwell Rona got Dan,
was that hello?

2238
02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:07.840
<v 3>A lot of that.
Then a little bit of that.
So there's a lot of that.</v>

2239
02:11:07.841 --> 02:11:12.700
And then how do you know about that?
For sure.
No,
just I've heard.
Okay.
But,

2240
02:11:12.701 --> 02:11:17.320
um,
but then he said something on a show once where he was,
when I,
when guys say,

2241
02:11:17.321 --> 02:11:20.620
well,
I got a prescription,
or somebody said not too long ago,
you know about,

2242
02:11:20.621 --> 02:11:22.300
well this guy has levels way up.

2243
02:11:22.301 --> 02:11:25.150
But then they admitted that they had a doctor's prescription and did too.

2244
02:11:25.230 --> 02:11:28.770
<v 0>Well,
rampage got testosterone replacement recently,
but as far as I know,</v>

2245
02:11:28.771 --> 02:11:32.340
I don't know that he's ever said anything about using any sort of steroids in

2246
02:11:32.341 --> 02:11:36.810
the ass.
I think he was just cock strong is an unbelievably strong God.
I mean,

2247
02:11:36.811 --> 02:11:39.250
do you ever see videos of him wrestling in high school?
No.

2248
02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.720
Rampage when in high school was ridiculously strong.

2249
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:45.690
Just lifting guys up and hurling them through the air.

2250
02:11:45.810 --> 02:11:48.900
<v 3>Yeah.
The,
the first time I heard it was actually when he admitted to it,</v>

2251
02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:53.940
I think I'm thinking more of,
uh,
of,
uh,
of the ax murderer.
Oh.

2252
02:11:53.941 --> 02:11:57.210
Vandelay and I never heard,
I never heard him say anything.

2253
02:11:57.390 --> 02:12:02.390
All I know is he came down from like two fucking 30 to whatever in the,

2254
02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:06.150
in,
in a heartbeat.
Well,
he,
there's rampage in high school.
Hold on.
Show that.

2255
02:12:06.151 --> 02:12:08.970
Show that again,
watch this video.
Uh,

2256
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.250
nevermind to I take that back.

2257
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:15.000
<v 0>Why is that one more time?
Look how damn strong he was.
Yeah.</v>

2258
02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:19.290
Rampage was just insanely strong.
If you're listening.
I'm sorry.

2259
02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:22.340
I don't think he was on steroids at all.
I think.
Look at that.
No,

2260
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:25.440
it was so god damn strong.
It was a good wrestler too.

2261
02:12:25.610 --> 02:12:27.990
<v 3>Yeah,
I was,
I was just,
how is that aligned to</v>

2262
02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:32.000
<v 0>oh sorry.
Holy Shit.
Yeah.
Rampage's ridiculous drawn.</v>

2263
02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:36.030
If rampage use that wrestling in that physical strength and really like embraced

2264
02:12:36.031 --> 02:12:36.850
Jujitsu.

2265
02:12:36.850 --> 02:12:40.330
He liked knocking guys out but he would have been an incredible strangler.

2266
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.430
So physically strong.
Yeah.

2267
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:45.520
<v 3>Cause he had the,
I mean his punching was just a,</v>

2268
02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:49.960
his punching was just natural.
Yeah.
It's so hard.
Yeah.

2269
02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:53.840
<v 0>Fucking fight with Randleman and the in pride.
Holy Shit.</v>

2270
02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:55.520
He was terrifying back then.

2271
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.180
Quentin rampage Jackson for people to see saw him like towards the end of his

2272
02:12:59.181 --> 02:13:00.620
career in the UFC.
You know,

2273
02:13:00.621 --> 02:13:04.130
they might judge him when he's dealing with all these injuries and you know,

2274
02:13:04.131 --> 02:13:07.700
it has all sorts of problems like,
and you get to really understand rampage.

2275
02:13:07.701 --> 02:13:10.250
You got to go back to these fights,
that pride fights.

2276
02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:14.270
I mean he was going over there throwing down every couple months against some of

2277
02:13:14.271 --> 02:13:16.120
the best guys in the world.
Fought soccer,

2278
02:13:16.130 --> 02:13:19.340
rob off fraud vendor lay how many times?
Twice at least.
Right.

2279
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.830
And then he knocked out Vandelay in the UFC finally.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2280
02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:27.230
<v 3>But uh,
he was such,
you know who you're reminding me of just personality wise,</v>

2281
02:13:27.231 --> 02:13:31.580
not really fight wise as much.
Um,
um,
uh,

2282
02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:34.590
Mark Coleman.
Ah,
you know why,
why?

2283
02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:38.070
Because when you talk to him or he interview him,

2284
02:13:38.130 --> 02:13:42.420
they have no like egos are macho,
uh,
facades.

2285
02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:44.720
They're both fucking real about everything.
Oh,

2286
02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:49.120
mark home was as real as it can be.
Oh my God,
I never knew him until,
you know,

2287
02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:52.320
we just shot the ultimate fighter season 19.
And,
um,

2288
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:57.950
I had never spent one minute with them and we spent six weeks together and this

2289
02:13:58.141 --> 02:14:00.030
is one of the most,
and rampage is the same way.

2290
02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:03.420
I remember if somebody said something after a fight once with rampage,
he goes,

2291
02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:06.510
well how do you feel about that decision or fighting that guy?
He goes,

2292
02:14:07.050 --> 02:14:10.860
are you crazy?
The guy just kicked my fucking ass.
He fucking won.

2293
02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:14.280
Remember that fight when there was a close fight?
He goes,
he just kicked my ass.

2294
02:14:14.281 --> 02:14:16.560
I don't know.
He said,
I don't know what the referees were looking at,

2295
02:14:16.561 --> 02:14:21.150
but I ain't got my ass whooped and,
and,
and glad against Machida.
I Dunno.

2296
02:14:21.151 --> 02:14:22.080
I didn't remember what you thought it was.

2297
02:14:22.081 --> 02:14:24.570
I remember I had never heard a guy actually say,

2298
02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.460
I don't know what the referees are looking at,
but I just got my ass whipped.

2299
02:14:28.461 --> 02:14:32.790
It was like,
what are you belittling the judges?
They just gave you a decision.

2300
02:14:32.791 --> 02:14:36.740
You're telling them they're crazy.
And,
and Mark Coleman is so much like that.

2301
02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:39.710
He was,
he ended up being such a real guy.
I mean,
he was like,

2302
02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:44.580
he was so honest about every part of his career and everything he's done and

2303
02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:47.760
didn't he fight?
I was getting my ass whooped.
I was so scared and that fight,

2304
02:14:47.761 --> 02:14:50.210
I got my shit.
They got kicked me in the head and he's just,

2305
02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.900
he was such a real guy.
I just loved Hay and these are like the real warriors,

2306
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:59.280
you know?
And then they have no facades of yeah I'm a bad ass football player,

2307
02:14:59.281 --> 02:15:00.630
you know,
walking around or whatever.

2308
02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.400
A basketball player walking around like that.

2309
02:15:02.401 --> 02:15:06.150
You throw a ball through a hoop but these guys,
but these fighters are,

2310
02:15:06.151 --> 02:15:09.900
they have absolutely no facades.
They're just like so real.
Yeah.
We'll,

2311
02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:12.000
Colin was the original heavyweight champion.

2312
02:15:12.001 --> 02:15:15.330
He won the first UFC heavyweight title.
Yeah,
I was there.

2313
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:17.520
I was very be Dan Severen submitted him,

2314
02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:20.070
got him in that crazy side headlock and strangle,

2315
02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:22.410
which he showed me that side hand rock and I couldn't,

2316
02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:26.160
I couldn't sleep right for like a week cause he likes to draw more of a,

2317
02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:29.260
or come here,
let me show you this code de Sensei,
he called me says,

2318
02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:33.480
let me show you this since angle.
And after he did it and he wouldn't stop.

2319
02:15:33.481 --> 02:15:35.160
And I was like,
okay,
I got it.
And he was like,

2320
02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:39.330
you feel it now in like a minute later when we let go.
Yeah,
it wasn't,

2321
02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:42.780
it wasn't pretty.
That was when Mark Coleman was that big and that strong.

2322
02:15:42.781 --> 02:15:44.520
He was making everybody gained weight.

2323
02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:47.850
All the USC got started just piling on the pounds.

2324
02:15:47.851 --> 02:15:50.640
You all saw them getting bigger and bigger because they knew eventually they're

2325
02:15:50.641 --> 02:15:52.380
going to have to face that fucking gorilla.

2326
02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:55.590
Like you couldn't fight him and look like Maury Smith.

2327
02:15:55.591 --> 02:15:58.830
Everybody thought he couldn't.
Like Maurice wasn't,
you know,

2328
02:15:58.831 --> 02:16:02.210
wasn't a big bodybuilder guy wasn't a big power lifting guy was,
you know,
in,

2329
02:16:02.211 --> 02:16:06.660
in shape kickboxer and everybody's like,
oh poor Maurice is fucked.
Yeah,

2330
02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:11.200
not so much.
Yeah.
That was one of the most shocking fights ever.
Yeah.
And,
and,

2331
02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:15.990
and mark has nothing but respect for Morrissey.
All they said was,
you know,

2332
02:16:15.991 --> 02:16:18.870
he basically says he was so real about that fight.

2333
02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:22.680
Then I guess there was that other guy that kicked him in the head.
Oh,

2334
02:16:22.681 --> 02:16:26.280
Pete Williams.
Yeah.
He talks about that fight and his,

2335
02:16:26.281 --> 02:16:30.790
his ups and downs and,
and he just has no censor about any of them.

2336
02:16:30.791 --> 02:16:34.150
No excuses about anything.
He just so fricking reel.

2337
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:37.660
It wasn't very knowledgeable as a wrestler to McComb and knows his shit.

2338
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:40.720
You know,
he'd be a really good coach.
He was a good coach and he was just,

2339
02:16:40.721 --> 02:16:43.900
he loved the guys and he would,
he would get,
he would just,

2340
02:16:44.050 --> 02:16:46.180
even though he just had a hip replacement.
Yeah,

2341
02:16:46.181 --> 02:16:48.940
I was going to say that it wasn't placement as teaching wrestling.
No,

2342
02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:50.950
he wasn't teaching wrestling.
He was wrestling,

2343
02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:55.600
he was doing the takedowns and getting taken down by these young,
you know,

2344
02:16:55.601 --> 02:16:58.180
it was two of fibers.
And they were slamming him and he was like,

2345
02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.150
you could tell you,
you can see his face sometimes,
but he,

2346
02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:05.470
he get up a little slower.
No,
let's do it again.
Do it a different way.
Wow.
Yeah.

2347
02:17:05.471 --> 02:17:06.620
He's,
he's,
he didn't know

2348
02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:08.720
<v 4>allowed to wrestle when you have a hip replacement.</v>

2349
02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:09.980
I thought those days are over.

2350
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:14.400
<v 3>They weren't for him.
And he's,
he's,
he's,
he's a super human.
He's,
he's,
yeah.</v>

2351
02:17:14.401 --> 02:17:15.234
He's the real deal.

2352
02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:20.350
<v 4>Placements are fucking crazy.
No,
that's a nurse.
You know,
knowing what you know,</v>

2353
02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:25.060
how nutty is the idea of song off the end of your fucking femur and putting on

2354
02:17:25.061 --> 02:17:28.420
an artificial joint with a big steel screw and turn,
Dang,
Dang.

2355
02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:30.330
<v 3>Getting it in with,
uh,
with,
uh,
like a,</v>

2356
02:17:30.331 --> 02:17:34.560
it's like one of those railroad fricking nails that goes way into the fricking,

2357
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:38.580
and then you put it with a fake,
you know,
into your bone and it's,

2358
02:17:38.581 --> 02:17:42.040
it's crazy shit.
And then to think he's,
you know,

2359
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:47.100
competing at the level or training at the level he's training now,
you know.

2360
02:17:47.130 --> 02:17:48.030
Yeah.
He's a freak.

2361
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:51.250
<v 4>Well,
they can do that now,
man.
They,
I uh,
had,
uh,</v>

2362
02:17:51.310 --> 02:17:54.730
my friend Graham Hancock was in here and he's in his sixties,
I believe.

2363
02:17:55.090 --> 02:17:58.540
And Graham had just got a hip replacement six weeks later he's walking around.

2364
02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:03.400
No problem.
No pain,
no nothing.
It's like,
what they can do now is just incredible.

2365
02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.290
It's crazy.
It's really crazy.

2366
02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:09.010
A lot of MMA guys like Chuck Norris apparently said hip replacements.

2367
02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:14.910
Yeah,
yeah.
Dan Gables all fucked up.
He's got,
you know,

2368
02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:18.610
huge knee issues.
I believe he's had hip replacements as well.

2369
02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:23.830
The Super Fund.
He had a really bad knee to begin with.
Right.

2370
02:18:23.890 --> 02:18:27.070
That's why you can only throw his left light.
Yeah,
it,
right.
Fascinating.

2371
02:18:27.071 --> 02:18:31.930
And also what a great hook,
kick kick that hasn't made it into MMA yet.

2372
02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.050
I was never good at it.
Hook,
kick.
I never knocked anybody out with a hook kick.

2373
02:18:35.051 --> 02:18:39.490
I never,
I never did it much in sparring.
Well,
I had spinning Hook kick and I,

2374
02:18:39.491 --> 02:18:42.250
you know like I threw it through a frontline roundhouse kick real fast,

2375
02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:46.150
but he figured out,
and Larry Kelly,
you remember Larry Kelly from Amherst,

2376
02:18:46.151 --> 02:18:49.630
Massachusetts.
It was a guy named Larry Kelly from Amherst,
Massachusetts.

2377
02:18:49.631 --> 02:18:51.040
It was famous for his hook kick.

2378
02:18:51.310 --> 02:18:54.740
He had this hook kick that was just like a lightning bolt and he was knocking

2379
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:56.620
dude's out and karate tournaments.

2380
02:18:56.621 --> 02:19:00.050
He not Dell Billy blanks when Billy blanks was like a top uh,

2381
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:03.580
karate points guy before Billy blanks became the Tae Bo guy.

2382
02:19:03.581 --> 02:19:05.710
He was like a serious point karate champion.

2383
02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:08.650
I know that Larry Kelly got knocked him out with a hook kick,

2384
02:19:08.651 --> 02:19:10.570
but I was always in awe of like hook kicks.

2385
02:19:10.571 --> 02:19:13.390
It's such a rare kick to see someone gets super proficient.

2386
02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:15.670
<v 3>Yeah.
So unless you could not,</v>

2387
02:19:15.671 --> 02:19:19.990
you can knock some out with a spinning hook kick or,
but a hook kick.

2388
02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:24.280
You can't unless you're that guy.
Cause I've never seen anyone knock out out.

2389
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:26.110
Anyway.
It's more of a jab flip.

2390
02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:29.710
<v 4>We'll super did,
didn't he?
Didn't he of some chaos with his hook kick?</v>

2391
02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:34.580
<v 3>I don't think so,
but he might've,
I saw him,
I don't know,
but yeah,
check them out.</v>

2392
02:19:34.581 --> 02:19:37.400
But the thing about a hook kick in an MMA fight,

2393
02:19:37.401 --> 02:19:41.140
if you think about it with your leg up in the air like that,
you know,

2394
02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:44.160
you get run over a lot easier and taken down.
Oh yeah.

2395
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:47.390
Where's the spinning Hook kick?
It might not land very often,

2396
02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:51.320
but it's pretty hard to counter as is the spinning jumped,
spinning back kick.

2397
02:19:51.410 --> 02:19:52.140
Yeah.

2398
02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:55.680
<v 4>It's um,
it's interesting too,
when you see a guy like Wallace that can,</v>

2399
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:58.660
that only at the time or other could kick with one leg.
Right.

2400
02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:03.120
How good he got with that one leg was unbelievable.
The shit that he could do.

2401
02:20:03.390 --> 02:20:08.070
Well,
you don't see guys having that kind of dexterity with their kicks anymore.

2402
02:20:08.350 --> 02:20:12.180
And he would do a lot like this is him.
He's,
he's old as shit there,
man.
Yeah,

2403
02:20:12.181 --> 02:20:15.720
he's real.
Yeah.
That's nothing now.
Yeah.
This is,
I mean he's probably,

2404
02:20:15.721 --> 02:20:19.440
he's 70 years old.
60,
68 years.
I just saw him.
Yeah.

2405
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:20.990
So he's still throwing hook kicks.

2406
02:20:21.340 --> 02:20:24.170
<v 3>Benny the jet,
like Benny the jet.
He was,</v>

2407
02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:28.430
he was the freakiest kickboxer ever.
I would find a young stuff,

2408
02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:33.170
the young videos and,
and if he could find Benny the jet spinning back kick,

2409
02:20:34.210 --> 02:20:38.750
it was the best ever.
He was my,
he was my trainer for years.
And you know,

2410
02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:41.590
he teaches right down the street at that,
uh,

2411
02:20:43.850 --> 02:20:48.050
<v 4>this is super foot when he was,
he always fought left leg forward.</v>

2412
02:20:48.051 --> 02:20:50.060
He's a good boxer too.
Yeah,
he's okay.

2413
02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:53.480
I traded the Jetson and when I first came to Hollywood,
when I first moved here,

2414
02:20:53.610 --> 02:20:57.130
<v 3>Ben is teaching over there,
uh,
team karate center right there on,
uh,</v>

2415
02:20:57.250 --> 02:21:00.520
in north Hollywood.
No,
it's right there on,
uh,
on,
uh,

2416
02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:05.850
desoto and,
and victory.
Yeah.
Benny.
It's a guy named fireball Zack.

2417
02:21:05.970 --> 02:21:07.990
Yeah,
it's a hop Quito school,

2418
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:13.090
but they also do like a park core and they do kickboxing and Benny actually

2419
02:21:13.091 --> 02:21:16.180
teaches there now.
It's,
it's,
it's probably the best karate school in the valley.

2420
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:20.210
<v 4>Painted.
Chet had some amazing fights in Japan too.
Oh yeah.
Oh Man.</v>

2421
02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:22.370
He was a tremendous kick.
Did you see his throat

2422
02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:26.320
<v 3>when he threw the guy and ended up knocking him out with the throw and they</v>

2423
02:21:26.321 --> 02:21:28.150
didn't know if they should disqualify him.

2424
02:21:28.151 --> 02:21:33.151
Not because frozen in Thai boxing or kind of like you're allowed to take the guy

2425
02:21:33.161 --> 02:21:36.520
down.
Right.
And I love to use the hip and you're not allowed to use a trip,

2426
02:21:36.730 --> 02:21:40.390
but you're allowed to use upper body throws.
Oh really?
He said there's a really,

2427
02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:43.420
uh,
the rules when they,
a lot of like in Japan,

2428
02:21:43.421 --> 02:21:46.000
they weren't sure about the rules here.
They're not when they,
when the,

2429
02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:49.440
when it's a tie match,
they don't know that there's no takedowns I go,

2430
02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:52.840
I remember had a rules.
He wants him.
The guy told me,
no.
Takedowns I go,

2431
02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:55.800
I thought this was Mu Tyrell's you're allowed to do take downs.

2432
02:21:55.820 --> 02:21:59.680
Just not with your hip or with your,
with your trips.
He goes,
really,
well,

2433
02:21:59.681 --> 02:22:02.060
let's just make it no takedowns I go.
But anyway,
Ben,

2434
02:22:02.061 --> 02:22:03.280
he took a guy down with a hip throw.

2435
02:22:03.281 --> 02:22:07.480
He was also a black belt in judo and he took the guy down and landed on him and

2436
02:22:07.481 --> 02:22:08.680
the guy couldn't go on cause he,

2437
02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:12.190
he likes Landon in his ribs and he heard his ribs so they didn't know what to
do.

2438
02:22:12.191 --> 02:22:16.450
So they ended up disqualifying them.
That it's a great Benny to me.
Ben,

2439
02:22:16.451 --> 02:22:18.550
he was the great,
the greatest kickboxer ever

2440
02:22:18.890 --> 02:22:22.040
<v 4>and he was certainly awesome.
And he was a big time pioneer at the time.</v>

2441
02:22:22.041 --> 02:22:26.130
There's money there in the red pants.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When I first came to Hollywood,

2442
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:29.100
<v 1>it's one of the coolest things when I was so happy that I could train at the jet</v>

2443
02:22:29.101 --> 02:22:32.850
center.
So which one did you train it on?
Fires,
Van Nuys and the one in the fryer?

2444
02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:35.160
Yeah,
the one where there was all the um,

2445
02:22:35.250 --> 02:22:39.560
blinkies after blinky son had died and all the Mexican gang bangers,

2446
02:22:40.090 --> 02:22:43.470
you know,
there was so many gang bangers who were training there.
It was weird.

2447
02:22:43.471 --> 02:22:45.390
They were respectful.
I mean they didn't have any problem,

2448
02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:49.650
but it was a like a point of contention.
Yeah.
I played trained there and 94,

2449
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:51.203
when I first came there,

2450
02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:55.620
<v 3>I was already gone I think.
But uh,
but yeah,
I trained there at,
uh,</v>

2451
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:57.950
I trained there for most of my fights and it was so cool.

2452
02:22:58.190 --> 02:23:01.990
It was like a bowling alley that he turned into a gym.
Yeah.
And uh,
yeah.

2453
02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:05.060
Blinkies a blinky.

2454
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:09.770
Blinky is announcing now those fights that are out of China.
Oh yeah.

2455
02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:12.920
<v 1>Okay.
He was doing,
some are announcing you sued.
See It on TV.</v>

2456
02:23:12.921 --> 02:23:14.210
Every now and then we'd catch it,

2457
02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:18.530
some kickboxing show that they would have and he would announce some white dude.

2458
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:19.483
Don't really know much.

2459
02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:24.520
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
no,
it wasn't.
It was it w I think now.
Is it Steve?
Uh,
who,</v>

2460
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:26.950
who else is doing it with them?
I don't know.
Ah,

2461
02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:28.260
I thought it was the fight doctor.

2462
02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:32.920
<v 1>No,
no,
no.
Maybe it is now.
I don't believe it was back then.
Um,</v>

2463
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:37.360
but the,
um,
the problem with the jet center was that the earthquake fucked it up.

2464
02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:38.710
Oh,
it did?
It started leaking.

2465
02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:42.820
So when the rain came the year after the earthquake,
it just was ruining,

2466
02:23:42.821 --> 02:23:46.570
the gym was fucked.
So then they moved it somewhere in north Hollywood,

2467
02:23:46.571 --> 02:23:51.100
but then it's Sorta,
you know,
huh.
Just wasn't kind of the same situation anymore.

2468
02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:54.150
So he's still teaching out there.
He's still teaching out there.
Hey son,
no,

2469
02:23:54.151 --> 02:23:55.240
he's still teaching right there now.

2470
02:23:55.241 --> 02:23:57.760
And we'll then else and there's a house of champions too,
right?

2471
02:23:57.761 --> 02:24:01.000
Is that still around?
But that's like not his,
it's not affiliated.

2472
02:24:01.001 --> 02:24:02.560
Is that what it is?
The valleys.
Encino.

2473
02:24:02.860 --> 02:24:07.590
<v 3>It how's the champions is in receipt off offshore.
Yeah.</v>

2474
02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:12.340
And he wasn't,
you know,
and it's not affiliated with him per se,
but uh,
uh,

2475
02:24:12.370 --> 02:24:16.270
Mark Para who runs it is actually one of Benny's black belts.

2476
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:17.990
And you keyed or Don?

2477
02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:21.680
<v 1>Uh,
interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those,
uh,</v>

2478
02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:24.240
those are the early days of martial arts man.

2479
02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:27.180
He's one of the real legends of the early days of martial arts,

2480
02:24:27.181 --> 02:24:28.050
especially in Los Angeles.

2481
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:31.780
<v 3>I met Benny when he came down and fun Hawaii when we had MMA,</v>

2482
02:24:31.810 --> 02:24:36.800
the first MMA fights in 1976 and I fought in one and a,

2483
02:24:36.801 --> 02:24:40.630
I was 16,
lied about my age,
said I was 18 and I fought.
And um,

2484
02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:45.400
Benny was fighting as well.
So at the gym he came into our gym and I was like,
Oh,

2485
02:24:45.401 --> 02:24:49.300
you,
you're as part of this guy.
And uh,
it wasn't fun.

2486
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:51.430
I was a 16 year old kid and he had,

2487
02:24:51.431 --> 02:24:53.650
he had the same spinning back kick he has now.

2488
02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:57.970
And he ended up knocking out some big guy named Dana Dana Goodson,

2489
02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:00.040
who was a 200 pound guy.

2490
02:25:00.250 --> 02:25:03.970
And then I ended up fighting and then so he came back and they used me to spar

2491
02:25:03.971 --> 02:25:07.960
with him again and he,
he told me,
if you ever come to Los Angeles,
you know,

2492
02:25:07.961 --> 02:25:10.090
look me up.
So I did.
And uh,
do you remember

2493
02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:15.080
<v 1>Dennis Alexio?
Yeah.
Another Hawaiian Guy,
right?
No,
no,
it wasn't lived in Hawaii.</v>

2494
02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:19.100
<v 3>He lives in Hawaii and then they,
towards the end of his career and he kind of,</v>

2495
02:25:19.130 --> 02:25:20.900
they throw him in with a bunch of 'em,

2496
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:24.040
like they'd find guys on the beach and give them title and,

2497
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:28.390
and he fought and he was a really good promoter and he wore a grass skirt in the

2498
02:25:28.391 --> 02:25:32.930
ring.
And he's from,
uh,
he's from Sacramento area.
Really?
Yeah.

2499
02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:35.230
So he just loved to,
why is that what it was?

2500
02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:38.680
He moved to Hawaii and they kind of adopted him and said he was a,

2501
02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:44.000
and he would fill that arena and it was his Blazedale Bleasdale.
Yeah.

2502
02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:47.410
See if you can find Dennis Alexia and the grass skirt because he would fight

2503
02:25:47.411 --> 02:25:51.370
with a grass skirt on.
Yeah.
It was fucking good though,
man.
He was,
yeah,

2504
02:25:51.470 --> 02:25:54.100
it was good.
You don't like,
you don't think it,
I don't think it was that good.

2505
02:25:54.310 --> 02:25:58.510
Like it's so exciting fights,
man.
Yeah.
But when,
when he fought standalone genus,

2506
02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:02.340
he got broken leg broken and then he,
yeah,
standalone.
Gina,

2507
02:26:02.341 --> 02:26:06.700
this was a really tough,
but well,
Don Wilson to Don Wilson fucked them up.
Yes.

2508
02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:10.450
As well as he did not like link the first guy to really fuck them up with leg

2509
02:26:10.451 --> 02:26:13.110
kicks was don the Dragon Wilson,
who is a really good fighter.

2510
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:16.210
I got a chance to support him once.
Yeah,
it was a honor.

2511
02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:20.200
His sidekick was unbelievable.
His best techniques.
Fucking,

2512
02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:22.000
it was a sneaky dude,
man.

2513
02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:26.620
Really crafty fighter and a really nice guy too.
Yeah,
he's,

2514
02:26:26.621 --> 02:26:30.220
he's like into movies and shit now.
He did this whole series of movies.

2515
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.350
He had a long Cynthia rothrock.
Yup.
There you go.
The point girl,

2516
02:26:35.351 --> 02:26:39.020
she would do like,
uh,
like those forums.
She's like a forms champion karate.

2517
02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:42.030
That was the blue shoe stuff,
wasn't it?
Yeah,
that was woo Shu.
Okay.

2518
02:26:42.970 --> 02:26:47.500
Do you ever remember a movie Khufu old old movie real?

2519
02:26:47.540 --> 02:26:49.180
It was like,
it wasn't even a B movie.

2520
02:26:49.181 --> 02:26:52.660
It's like a see movie and there's a Khufu guy,
white guy,

2521
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:56.800
but he came into room and slept with this woman.
They sit up,
he goes,
get up,

2522
02:26:57.250 --> 02:27:01.540
get dressed,
make the bed and get out.
And she looked at him and she goes,

2523
02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:03.040
who do you think you're talking to?

2524
02:27:03.041 --> 02:27:05.830
Me like crossed his arms and gave her a mean look.
And then she goes,

2525
02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:09.710
would you keep the sheets?
Do you remember that movie?
No.

2526
02:27:10.250 --> 02:27:14.740
Me and chuck used to watch it back in the early nineties.
We,
I had the,

2527
02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:18.550
I had the VHS.
Right?
And we used to love,

2528
02:27:18.551 --> 02:27:22.540
we still make watch that movie all the time.
And then when VHS is went out,

2529
02:27:22.541 --> 02:27:26.650
I threw away all my VHS and I now we can't remember the name of the movie.

2530
02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:29.950
I'll tell ya here,
Twitter,
please tell us.

2531
02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:32.420
Tell him Mr Hackleman what that fucking movie get up.

2532
02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:36.190
I'm sure they'll tell you in five seconds.
I'm sure it will know.

2533
02:27:36.490 --> 02:27:38.030
There's gotta be some freak out there.
That,

2534
02:27:38.031 --> 02:27:42.010
so that was set to a good cause I've said that to so many women now.

2535
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.050
Get up,
get dressed,
make the bed and get out.

2536
02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:51.100
How many women?
More than one?
More than one,

2537
02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:54.460
let's say show Alexia,
Alexia,
throwing those kicks.
He,

2538
02:27:54.461 --> 02:27:58.980
I probably like probably like 33 in the last,
uh,

2539
02:27:59.110 --> 02:28:00.730
10 years.
Yeah.
Look at him.

2540
02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:04.610
A crazy grass skirt and guys were complaining about that grass skirt to it.

2541
02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:07.840
That was back when fighting.
That's a,
that's a standard man.
Yeah.

2542
02:28:07.850 --> 02:28:11.590
The longe needed stopped him.
Yeah.
Launching either send some powerful kicks.

2543
02:28:11.591 --> 02:28:13.500
Yeah.
His leg just gave her no,
I had a demo.

2544
02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.660
I had an exhibition fight with a,

2545
02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:20.200
with a standard man awhile ago when he trained at the jet center.

2546
02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:22.280
Showed that again,
man.
That's crazy.

2547
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.330
<v 1>Yeah.
That's the first round.
He kicked hard like 10 seconds in the first round.</v>

2548
02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:28.970
Broke his leg with the leg kick.
Unbelievable.
Man.

2549
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:32.060
What is wrong with Youtube today?
So sucking it.

2550
02:28:32.061 --> 02:28:35.930
Don't tell us it's our fucking web connection.
You sons of bitches,
get up,

2551
02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:40.850
get dressed,
make the bed and get out.
It's one of my favorite line.

2552
02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:45.680
It stuck with me.
So rude to say.
Have to someone,
let you fuck him.
I know.
I know.

2553
02:28:45.681 --> 02:28:50.150
See this,
I heard it again.
Why is it rude?
Boom.
Why is it rude?

2554
02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:54.980
I was an inside leg kick if no one knows outside was outside,
but okay,
but wait,

2555
02:28:55.010 --> 02:28:58.100
why is it,
why isn't it?
I mean they should be honored that they slept with you.

2556
02:28:58.101 --> 02:29:02.840
Why is it rude?
Have you ever said it to air use John Hackleman.

2557
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:03.950
That's what I have to say.

2558
02:29:03.951 --> 02:29:08.180
How dare that was the voice of John Hackleman saying that they should be on me.

2559
02:29:08.660 --> 02:29:13.340
I'm always happy when a girl says yes.
Always.
Even.

2560
02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:17.390
Even if it's my wife,
I have never thinking that they should be honored.

2561
02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:21.170
I always think that I'm the one who's honored.
Get up.

2562
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:26.840
So I gotta get that says David tweet back cause you have more somber followed in

2563
02:29:26.841 --> 02:29:29.890
seconds,
please.
Folks.
What the fuck is it though?

2564
02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:31.670
Me and chuck would sit down and watch it.

2565
02:29:31.850 --> 02:29:33.950
That's when chick Chucky's asleep on my couch.

2566
02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:37.450
Do you know where Chuck's leaves now that he's had a very nice house?
Yeah,

2567
02:29:37.470 --> 02:29:40.410
he's not in,
he's not on the couch.
He's not an anybody's couch.

2568
02:29:40.411 --> 02:29:44.510
You'll never be on a couch again.
No.
Oh my God.
He said,
well that's the plan.

2569
02:29:44.511 --> 02:29:47.420
Right?
If he was like,
you know,
40 years old on the couch,

2570
02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:49.340
we would have to really think through this thing.

2571
02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:53.450
Then there would be no discussion with Dana.
Would be like,
yeah,
okay,
I'll retire.

2572
02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:57.800
I don't know.
No one's coming up with the answer.
They're fuckers.
Yeah,

2573
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:59.600
we'll find it eventually.
It just might.

2574
02:29:59.601 --> 02:30:02.810
It's going to take a little more time than I thought it would.
Sorry.

2575
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:05.810
You're obscure Kung Fu movie.
That was one of the best.

2576
02:30:05.811 --> 02:30:10.170
That was the one of the best.
Do you,
have you ever seen a foot fist way?
Yes.
Yeah,

2577
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:13.340
it was great.
I make all my guys watch it.
All my guys,

2578
02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:16.460
if I had to watch a bunch of the part of the martial arts that might the pit,

2579
02:30:16.461 --> 02:30:20.670
they have to watch certain movies.
They have to listen to my music.
You know?

2580
02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:24.560
I do love really corny bad movie scenes though,
like that.

2581
02:30:24.561 --> 02:30:27.980
Like my favorite is from superfly.
He ever see superfly.

2582
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:31.910
Superfly is one of the best bad movies of all time.
You know the movie,
right?

2583
02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:34.850
Yeah.
He's a drug dealer.
Yeah.
Ugh.
And he's,

2584
02:30:34.851 --> 02:30:38.270
he's in bed with this white chick and he goes,
this is all I've ever wanted.

2585
02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:43.010
My Hall,
my vines,
White woman,
like you zoom,

2586
02:30:43.011 --> 02:30:46.910
all I ever wanted,
this is America dream.
My Hall.
Meaning his car.

2587
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.260
My vines meaning his clothes and a white girl like you.

2588
02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:54.680
Why is vines clothes?
Cause it's made out of plants.

2589
02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:59.990
You know you make your cotton is a plant civil call vines.

2590
02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:04.700
Yeah.
Not Silk.
Silk is made out of a plant.
It's made out of a fucking bug bug.

2591
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:08.930
Pretty Weird.
Huh?
Silk Sheets.
You mean a sheet on a bug?
Shit.

2592
02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:12.070
How much fucking bugs do you need to make sheets?
What's this really good?

2593
02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:16.130
What's another good line about moving?
No,
just a movie period.
Man.

2594
02:31:16.131 --> 02:31:18.950
There's so many.
There's too many to begin pain.
Don't hurt roadhouse.

2595
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:20.070
That's what you should show people.

2596
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.340
<v 4>Hey Sean roadhouse side.
Show him how to grab the neck.</v>

2597
02:31:23.341 --> 02:31:25.780
Like just show Swayze did.

2598
02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:28.920
I remember when the guys he's thinking could do that.

2599
02:31:28.921 --> 02:31:33.600
Grab the neck and you just rip your neck out.
Fucking shitty neck.

2600
02:31:33.601 --> 02:31:37.710
You would have if somebody can just reach in and grab your neck and pull it out.

2601
02:31:37.980 --> 02:31:42.900
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is crazy.
He's no longer with us.
It's hard to believe,

2602
02:31:42.901 --> 02:31:46.410
man.
Look at him here,
this movie,
and he's no longer with us and a big part,

2603
02:31:46.411 --> 02:31:50.400
ladies and gentlemen,
motherfucking cigarettes,
put those bitches down.

2604
02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:56.370
Yes,
he was.
He most certainly was pancreatic cancer.

2605
02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:59.790
So common one with cigarette smokers,
Bill Hicks,
famous comedian,

2606
02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:03.390
also cigarette smoker,
pancreatic cancer.
It's not a good one.

2607
02:32:03.450 --> 02:32:08.160
What about alkaline water?
Healthy for you,
good for you.
You drink it?
No,
I don't.

2608
02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:11.310
I just drink spring water most of the time.
But uh,

2609
02:32:11.370 --> 02:32:16.290
I think the idea of having an alkaline high diet rather than acidic diet.

2610
02:32:16.340 --> 02:32:20.490
I mean there's a lot of science that shows that alkalinity in your body is,

2611
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:21.030
you know,

2612
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:25.050
it's a good state to have and that cancer has to grow in an acidic environment.

2613
02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:27.000
You know,
this,
I mean,

2614
02:32:27.001 --> 02:32:31.980
there's so much dispute when it comes to a nutrition and health and how you

2615
02:32:31.981 --> 02:32:33.510
should live your life and how you shouldn't,

2616
02:32:33.780 --> 02:32:36.210
what kind of things are important and taking your body,
the,

2617
02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:40.230
the dangers or safety of Gmo foods,
you know,

2618
02:32:40.231 --> 02:32:42.900
there's a lot of contradicting information and articles out there.

2619
02:32:42.901 --> 02:32:46.860
It's really hard to get the full skinny when it comes to something as complex as

2620
02:32:46.861 --> 02:32:50.160
nutrition.
I think.
So do you go by,
um,

2621
02:32:50.161 --> 02:32:51.990
I read as much as possible on it.

2622
02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:56.310
Try to find what makes the most sense and then try to see like what,

2623
02:32:56.460 --> 02:33:01.080
how much of it has a history of use.
You know,
when it comes to like antioxidants,

2624
02:33:01.081 --> 02:33:02.310
when it comes to vitamins,

2625
02:33:02.311 --> 02:33:04.650
I mean there's a lot of shit that they know about vitamins,

2626
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:09.480
vitamin supplements being,
uh,
the,
the,
the way to stop the scurvy from coming on.

2627
02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:12.600
If someone's on a long boat trip and they know we're scurvy came from,

2628
02:33:12.601 --> 02:33:16.660
it came from a vitamin C deficiency or nutrient deficiencies and uh,

2629
02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:20.970
they didn't give vitamin C d today.
No.
Give Orange at the time.
Yeah,
at the time.

2630
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:24.510
But you know,
they've,
they've could,
you can isolate it with vitamin C.

2631
02:33:24.511 --> 02:33:24.931
I mean there's,

2632
02:33:24.931 --> 02:33:28.830
there's ways that they've figured out to isolate essentially every vitamin and

2633
02:33:28.831 --> 02:33:32.280
nutrient known demand.
I mean,
this is not like,
it's not like a guest,

2634
02:33:32.540 --> 02:33:35.880
you know that they figured out how to get B12 they know how to get beat 12 and

2635
02:33:35.881 --> 02:33:37.320
if you think the beat 12 doesn't work,

2636
02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:41.250
it's because you've never tried be 12 be 12 for sure.
Gives you energy.
You know,

2637
02:33:41.251 --> 02:33:44.580
did a lot of wrestlers would take intervene as shots before matches?

2638
02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:49.090
Mami B12 tremendous stuff.
Ali's to be 12 yeah,

2639
02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:51.540
to anybody who says it's not is a silly person.

2640
02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:53.850
So that's proof positive right there.

2641
02:33:53.851 --> 02:33:55.650
You've isolated too in very unfortunate news,

2642
02:33:55.830 --> 02:34:00.240
important nutrients that have noticeable effects C and B 12 and that's just the

2643
02:34:00.241 --> 02:34:01.110
tip of the iceberg.

2644
02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:05.310
I mean there's a giant amount of essential fatty acids,

2645
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:09.930
essential minerals that have been really proven to have a significant part in

2646
02:34:09.931 --> 02:34:11.880
the development of,
of,

2647
02:34:11.881 --> 02:34:15.420
of all sorts of aspects of your body.

2648
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:18.520
Your body's essentially stardust.

2649
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:21.580
I mean your body's essentially carbon and minerals and all these different

2650
02:34:21.581 --> 02:34:25.300
things and you need balance of these essential nutrients,
these minerals.

2651
02:34:25.301 --> 02:34:28.420
And if you don't have them,
osteoporosis,
what's that come from?

2652
02:34:28.421 --> 02:34:30.310
A deficiency of a mineral called calcium.

2653
02:34:30.610 --> 02:34:35.380
And there's so much of that in diet and so important and keeping the body at

2654
02:34:35.381 --> 02:34:38.200
optimum levels,
especially for like a pro athlete,

2655
02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:40.740
it's immensely significant.

2656
02:34:40.741 --> 02:34:44.080
Do you think you think alkaline being alkaline is more important than,

2657
02:34:44.110 --> 02:34:47.860
or more helpful than acid?
I don't necessarily know.

2658
02:34:48.370 --> 02:34:51.370
I wouldn't be able to tell you I'm not smart enough.
I'm not educated enough.

2659
02:34:51.371 --> 02:34:51.970
I don't know.

2660
02:34:51.970 --> 02:34:56.110
But I do know that there's a lot of work that I've read that where people have

2661
02:34:56.111 --> 02:35:00.100
studied the benefits of a high alkaline diet.
It's a lot of them.
Yeah,

2662
02:35:00.101 --> 02:35:00.731
there's a lot of them.

2663
02:35:00.731 --> 02:35:04.930
It seems to be the science is leaning towards that and that vegetables,

2664
02:35:05.290 --> 02:35:08.260
green leafy vegetables,
very them as well,
you know,

2665
02:35:08.261 --> 02:35:10.360
don't eat the same ones all the time.
There's been,
uh,

2666
02:35:10.470 --> 02:35:14.440
quite a few issues apparently with people who to eat kale all day,
every day.

2667
02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.010
And if you do it over long periods of time that people could develop an even

2668
02:35:18.011 --> 02:35:21.130
light a thyroid issues.
Keylight it.
So just make that up.
How dare you,

2669
02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:25.930
I know when he's joking,
at least you're not fooling me.
So what do you get?

2670
02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:27.700
Um,
you can,
well,

2671
02:35:27.710 --> 02:35:31.330
the people have had thyroid issues that are connected to a eating Kale all day,

2672
02:35:31.331 --> 02:35:32.830
every day for long periods of time.

2673
02:35:33.130 --> 02:35:36.190
And they're saying that even though it's a really healthy thing,
it can,
you know,

2674
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:38.730
like,
yeah,
you need,
you need to vary your diet,

2675
02:35:39.250 --> 02:35:42.010
which is really kind of interesting because there's a lot of animals,

2676
02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:44.020
they kind of stick to one thing,

2677
02:35:44.021 --> 02:35:49.021
very specific type of diet and that's to avoid genetic mutation to avoid

2678
02:35:49.841 --> 02:35:51.700
variables that they can't control.

2679
02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:53.560
They know that they can eat this kind of grass.

2680
02:35:53.561 --> 02:35:56.620
They go and eat that kind of grass.
Like cows for instance.
I mean,

2681
02:35:56.621 --> 02:35:57.790
they can eat corn,

2682
02:35:57.791 --> 02:36:01.120
but you don't catch them eating corn anywhere else other than when people feed

2683
02:36:01.121 --> 02:36:03.580
them corn,
most of the time they know what the fuck to do.

2684
02:36:03.581 --> 02:36:06.550
Go eat the grass and he'd get bugs that you're eating in the grass as well and

2685
02:36:06.551 --> 02:36:09.400
you're going to get a little bit of vitamins from them and just they know what

2686
02:36:09.401 --> 02:36:13.960
the fuck to do.
But people,
boy,
we do better when we mix it up.
Huh?

2687
02:36:14.350 --> 02:36:16.960
We do better when we have a little bit of,
I am a creature of habit.

2688
02:36:16.961 --> 02:36:19.510
I got an Itch,
a little bit of Broccoli,
a little bit of celery,

2689
02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:23.530
have some cucumbers.
One day,
have a nice,
you know,
cauliflower salad the next day.

2690
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:25.900
Today,
let's go with Brussel sprouts.
You know,
today,

2691
02:36:25.901 --> 02:36:28.960
let's have some chicken tomorrow.
Let's have some venison the next day.

2692
02:36:28.961 --> 02:36:32.860
Let's have some elk.
Yeah,
you'd do better when you're,
you're firing your diet.

2693
02:36:32.890 --> 02:36:37.540
You do a lot of home.
Not home cooked,
but yeah,
I cook a lot.
But you do a lot of,

2694
02:36:37.541 --> 02:36:42.370
uh,
just hunted animals,
Huh?
Well that's what I'm trying to do and my goal,

2695
02:36:42.610 --> 02:36:47.380
I hunt.
You're a hunter yourself.
Yes.
Yeah.
My goal is by the end of 2014,

2696
02:36:47.381 --> 02:36:49.810
I want to have nothing but gain me in my house.

2697
02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:51.760
I don't want to buy store bought meat.

2698
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.540
I want to buy chicken and I don't want to buy steak.
I don't,

2699
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:58.210
I don't want to participate in factory farming is I want to,

2700
02:36:58.211 --> 02:37:02.830
if I have as little participation in what I think is a bad Karma activity as

2701
02:37:02.831 --> 02:37:05.720
possible,
I'm not buying chicken mcnuggets you know,

2702
02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:09.100
I have to be really fucking starving.
I mean,
I'm not a perfect person.

2703
02:37:09.101 --> 02:37:12.640
If I'm in a bad situation and there's a fucking Arby's and I need some,

2704
02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:16.040
I need some food,
I'll eat that shit if I have to reluctantly.

2705
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:20.000
But I would like it if in my home I never have to.
Hmm.

2706
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:24.890
And so my goal in 2014 it's just shoot a lot of animals.

2707
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:28.460
Yeah.
I got,
I got that in Montana last year.

2708
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:32.180
That deer this year.
Got another one in Wisconsin.

2709
02:37:32.390 --> 02:37:36.170
I just got a wild pig this past weekend.
But when you go,
so when you go,

2710
02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.850
you go away.
So it's a week long trip.
The weekend,
this last time was a weekend.

2711
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:44.200
I went,
went Friday night and uh,
came back Sunday morning.

2712
02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:49.220
And how you bring it back,
you cut it up,
cut it up and put it in the frigerator,

2713
02:37:49.370 --> 02:37:53.810
put it in a cooler and drive it back.
Drive it back.
Yeah.

2714
02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:55.071
Yeah.

2715
02:37:55.071 --> 02:37:57.980
And so I'm going to do that every few months and it'll last you a few months

2716
02:37:57.981 --> 02:38:01.890
each time.
It depends on how big the animal is.
His pig was huge.

2717
02:38:01.891 --> 02:38:05.220
It was like a 200 pound pig,
so that'll last a long time.
Um,

2718
02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:08.360
but I also have a venison in there still.
And uh,

2719
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:11.420
I got some elk from a friend who went hunting and gave me some elk.

2720
02:38:11.810 --> 02:38:15.920
I got some salmon that I froze from,
uh,
last winter,
Alaska.

2721
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:19.940
I didn't catch these.
These were given to me by the guide.
We,
yeah,
we were there.

2722
02:38:19.941 --> 02:38:23.410
There was a catch and release day.
Unfortunately when we went to go fishing,

2723
02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:26.510
it was like a low number and the salmon weird the day before.
So they,

2724
02:38:26.511 --> 02:38:29.180
sometimes they'll change it to go catch them early.
And this guy was like,

2725
02:38:29.181 --> 02:38:31.040
listen dude,
I got way more than enough salmon.

2726
02:38:31.310 --> 02:38:33.710
If you want to bring home with some wild salmon.
I got all this frozen salmon,

2727
02:38:33.711 --> 02:38:36.530
so he gave us like a couple of pounds of frozen salmon,

2728
02:38:36.531 --> 02:38:39.590
so I have some of that leftover.
That's what I want to do,
man.

2729
02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:44.350
I think that participating in this system where we allow people to,

2730
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:49.750
to use animals as like a commodity in such a way that they try to tighten up the

2731
02:38:52.761 --> 02:38:56.360
bottom line so much that you,
you torture these things,

2732
02:38:56.510 --> 02:39:00.650
you give them these horrible existences just in order to make the maximize your

2733
02:39:00.651 --> 02:39:05.330
profits.
I think that's evil.
I think any company that would do that is there.

2734
02:39:05.370 --> 02:39:08.870
They're shortsighted,
cruel assholes,

2735
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:13.040
and even though it's the standard model for these big factory farms,

2736
02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:15.170
I still think there's short sided,

2737
02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:18.230
cruel assholes and I think that shouldn't be an option.

2738
02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:22.490
Shouldn't be an option for humanity to stack chickens 10 on top of each other

2739
02:39:22.491 --> 02:39:23.900
and cut their beaks off when they're young,

2740
02:39:23.901 --> 02:39:25.960
to keep them from poking each other's eyes out to,

2741
02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:30.170
to take pigs and stuffed them into these little pens and,
and you know,

2742
02:39:30.171 --> 02:39:32.450
never let them roam around.

2743
02:39:32.451 --> 02:39:36.350
Just force feed them and pump them up for growth hormone to get them fat and

2744
02:39:36.351 --> 02:39:41.270
huge and then come along and kill him.
That seems disgusting.
But wild animals,

2745
02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:43.430
they're,
they're wild.

2746
02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:47.510
They're living out there as nature intended and all you do is just enter into

2747
02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:50.420
that world and take one out.
And

2748
02:39:52.250 --> 02:39:55.310
I'll never do get it from someone who's a hunter.
Find someone who,
you know,

2749
02:39:55.311 --> 02:39:59.570
that's a hunter that'll hook that up.
I felt bad about myself.
No,
don't feel bad,

2750
02:39:59.571 --> 02:40:03.860
but I could never,
I could never kill an animal if my life depend on it.
You know,

2751
02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:07.310
Steve [inaudible],
who's a friend of mine,
who's a famous hunter,

2752
02:40:07.311 --> 02:40:10.460
he has this TV show called meat eater and he was actually talking about it and

2753
02:40:10.461 --> 02:40:13.950
he was saying,
I don't think everybody should have to go and get food.
Just like,

2754
02:40:13.951 --> 02:40:15.780
I don't think that,
you know,

2755
02:40:15.810 --> 02:40:19.770
like people take advantage of the fact that the government or the city takes

2756
02:40:19.771 --> 02:40:23.490
care of your waist and we should we all be processing your own sewage to be,

2757
02:40:23.491 --> 02:40:27.000
keep it real.
I don't want to,
he's like,
I don't want to process my own sewage,

2758
02:40:27.390 --> 02:40:31.320
you know,
but I like getting my own meat so I do that.
He said,

2759
02:40:31.321 --> 02:40:34.610
but I'm not saying you have to and I think that's a real good way.
Right?

2760
02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:39.850
<v 3>How would a guy and normal karate guy like me,
who's I hate,</v>

2761
02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.830
I couldn't kill him.
I couldn't kill it.
I've never killed an animal on my,

2762
02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:46.870
like you eat meat,
but I love meat.
So I'm a hypocrite because I love animals,

2763
02:40:46.871 --> 02:40:48.040
but I eat a lot of meat.

2764
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:52.340
<v 4>Well,
I love animals too,
man.
I have two cats.
I have two dogs.
I love animals.</v>

2765
02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:53.990
<v 3>So what did,
what does a guy like me do it?</v>

2766
02:40:53.991 --> 02:40:58.991
How do we find on the Internet some guy that cooks or hunts for the food.

2767
02:40:59.071 --> 02:40:59.490
And

2768
02:40:59.490 --> 02:41:03.840
<v 4>I guarantee you there's someone in your area because you're in a nice area,</v>

2769
02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:04.621
you're in a nice area.

2770
02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:08.280
It's very rural and California has a long history of hunting.

2771
02:41:08.281 --> 02:41:10.070
Tj Dillashaw is a hunter.
Yeah.

2772
02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:12.830
Chad Mendez and other guys living out there on the pit

2773
02:41:13.340 --> 02:41:18.170
<v 3>pit.
A elevated the guy that,
you know,
that gym we have in Utah.
Yeah.</v>

2774
02:41:18.171 --> 02:41:22.310
The owner of that will is a huge hundred.
He goes to Africa all the time.

2775
02:41:22.690 --> 02:41:27.380
<v 4>Utah has a rich hunting tradition,
massive elk population,
Utah.
We were there.</v>

2776
02:41:27.770 --> 02:41:30.470
One of the guys who was like a ski instructor at this place that I went to,

2777
02:41:30.471 --> 02:41:32.810
told me on the way to work.
He saw 20 elk,

2778
02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:36.110
giant bull elk just sitting on the side of the road.
I mean,

2779
02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:41.000
Utah Wilderness with a couple of little cities parked in the wilderness,

2780
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:44.740
you know,
beautiful cities,
you know,
Salt Lake and park city.

2781
02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:47.030
But the fucking what surrounds it,

2782
02:41:47.270 --> 02:41:51.500
that's as Dank stir wilderness as it gets.
They have bears,
you know,

2783
02:41:52.690 --> 02:41:57.690
they have bears and elk and they have moose that wander onto ski slopes every

2784
02:41:57.921 --> 02:42:00.700
now and then.
And you've got to get the fuck out of the way.
You know,

2785
02:42:00.701 --> 02:42:05.050
a moose wanders onto your ski slope.
But I,
I mean,
we have deers by sure.

2786
02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:08.870
I have a property that,
but I mean,
you don't have to do it.

2787
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:13.210
I guarantee you someone in your neighborhood is a hunter.
And uh,
you know,

2788
02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:15.090
if they,
if they hunt a lot,
they,

2789
02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:19.190
I'm sure they would be willing to trade some meat for some classes again.

2790
02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:23.240
And so I bet getting guarantee you someone in your gym who hunts would love to

2791
02:42:23.241 --> 02:42:27.620
give you some meat just so you could try it if you cook it right,
we'll live,

2792
02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:31.040
or wild game rather is some of the most delicious food you can buy or you could

2793
02:42:31.041 --> 02:42:35.510
have on whether you could eat so good for you.
It's so,
and it's also,

2794
02:42:35.570 --> 02:42:39.950
I think the most Karma free way of,
uh,

2795
02:42:39.951 --> 02:42:41.360
of acquiring animal meat.

2796
02:42:41.570 --> 02:42:44.750
If somebody hunted it and does it humanely and does it the right way,

2797
02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:49.160
but you know,
no,
everyone shouldn't have to do it.
Yeah,
I couldn't.
Yeah,
it was,

2798
02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:52.370
but factory farmings got to go.
We have as as a society,

2799
02:42:52.371 --> 02:42:55.730
even if we off to turn fucking vegetarian,
we have to stop that shit.

2800
02:42:55.940 --> 02:43:00.530
That's a travesty.
We're,
we're putting out so much bad energy and we're also,

2801
02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:05.630
when people find out about it,
it really lowers our expectations of human beings.

2802
02:43:05.870 --> 02:43:09.770
We find out that we're willing to do things like that to animals.
Just a profit.

2803
02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:12.190
It lowers what we feel like

2804
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:16.510
<v 1>you know,
is possible from the average person,
even already lower than we are.</v>

2805
02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:20.770
I think it's one of the lowest things.
I think in other low things,
seaworld,

2806
02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:24.630
you know another low thing is this dolphin massacre that they're about to do.

2807
02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:27.580
You see that shit.
They have like two and the place where they filmed that movie,

2808
02:43:27.581 --> 02:43:28.414
the cove,

2809
02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:31.960
they've trapped 250 dolphins in there now and they're gonna slaughter him and

2810
02:43:31.961 --> 02:43:34.210
everybody knows about it is not in any way we can do about it.

2811
02:43:35.390 --> 02:43:37.750
That I think that's,
that lowers our,

2812
02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:41.240
our expectations of human beings lowers our,
our,

2813
02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:45.520
our possibilities.
It changes our range.
You know what we look,

2814
02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:50.230
what's normal was this is murdering dolphins normal in my world and your world.

2815
02:43:50.231 --> 02:43:53.020
The fuck it is.
If everybody was John Hackleman or me,

2816
02:43:53.050 --> 02:43:55.180
there'd be no murder of dolphins.
Right?

2817
02:43:55.390 --> 02:43:59.380
Or drones or drones or bicycle riders on the street.

2818
02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:00.970
Fuck bicycle riders and what's true?

2819
02:44:01.090 --> 02:44:03.730
Writers that smoke outside of Starbucks cigarettes.

2820
02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:06.310
How about people that throw cigarettes out there?
Fucking windows,

2821
02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:10.120
those Jack Offs.
I like to just pull them over and beat the shit out of him.

2822
02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:11.770
I'd like to see you do it now.

2823
02:44:12.100 --> 02:44:16.120
Or smokers this watch him in the arm so hard that they can't lift their hands up

2824
02:44:16.121 --> 02:44:19.560
to them to smoke.
Don't knock them out.
You don't have to give a head trauma.

2825
02:44:19.570 --> 02:44:22.210
Just hold them down and just beat their delts up.

2826
02:44:22.450 --> 02:44:26.320
Just pound knuckles right into their shoulders on both sides so that you

2827
02:44:26.321 --> 02:44:28.920
literally can't smoke.
I mean,

2828
02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:32.560
why would somebody smoke when you have to inhale it?
Well,

2829
02:44:32.561 --> 02:44:35.260
because they get caught.
They got caught by the cool bug.

2830
02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:38.710
It's happened to a lot of people that are very intelligent that I know.

2831
02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:43.090
Have you ever asked anyone to,
to put down to Sierra?
Sure,
yes.

2832
02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:46.780
They get to see people get angry.
You know,
it's,
it's an interesting thing.

2833
02:44:46.781 --> 02:44:48.970
They don't mind littering,
you know,
people that uh,

2834
02:44:49.090 --> 02:44:54.000
he's telling me it's 10 minutes left.
People like when they go,
um,
to uh,
uh,

2835
02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:57.490
restaurants and they have like outside seating.
I saw this woman smoking,

2836
02:44:57.491 --> 02:45:01.510
she was on the phone smoking and then just putting her cigarette out in this

2837
02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:06.520
plant.
You know,
this like big,
beautiful Bush and have a little pot,

2838
02:45:06.521 --> 02:45:11.140
a big potter wheel,
you know,
a big,
a potter,
a,
you know,
uh,
plant potting thing.

2839
02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:14.320
She just sticking her cigarettes and they're just poking out like little trees.

2840
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:17.470
She had four cigarettes in there while she was on having a little conversation.

2841
02:45:17.471 --> 02:45:19.300
I was like,
this is disgusting.
You're a gross.

2842
02:45:19.301 --> 02:45:23.140
Litterer like if you took a soda can and threw it in there,
would that be okay?

2843
02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:24.070
No,
it wouldn't be,

2844
02:45:24.250 --> 02:45:27.280
but you think it's okay to take your fucking gross cigarettes and stick them in

2845
02:45:27.281 --> 02:45:31.430
the dirt?
Yeah,
it's a disgusting habit.
If it's disgusting.
I,
I've,
you know,

2846
02:45:31.450 --> 02:45:34.090
I bought for smokers is because I've,
I,

2847
02:45:34.091 --> 02:45:38.070
it's one of my pet peeves then I've asked them if I'm anywhere and I smelled

2848
02:45:38.071 --> 02:45:41.530
smoke,
I'll ask him to put it out.
And most people are really obliging,

2849
02:45:42.190 --> 02:45:45.850
but there's people that haven't been,
I just think what can I do to get Ethan?

2850
02:45:45.851 --> 02:45:50.380
I mean these guys pissed me the fuck off.
I can't spit on him getting in trouble.

2851
02:45:50.590 --> 02:45:52.610
So I buy fart spray and a,

2852
02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:57.540
I got fart spray online and I'm not proud of it.
Um,
but,

2853
02:45:58.660 --> 02:46:01.810
but I remember,
and I remember the first time I did it,

2854
02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:04.960
it backfired cause I was actually at my favorite character bar cause I'm

2855
02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:09.860
probably one of the best karaoke singers of all time probably.
But say

2856
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:12.530
<v 3>I asked her to please not smoke outs,
you know,
it's,</v>

2857
02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:17.150
I'll smoke wherever the fuck I want.
So I said okay.

2858
02:46:17.151 --> 02:46:21.320
So I took on my first spray and I sprayed her.
Okay,
now this thing is hard.

2859
02:46:21.321 --> 02:46:23.120
I don't know if you were a small as far,
it's pretty,
but it's hard.

2860
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:26.030
And I thought I got even with her.
So I walked back in the bar,

2861
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:30.620
she was too drunk to even know it and she ended up coming back in the bar.

2862
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:34.610
So I had to leave the bar because this farts smell was worse than the cigarette

2863
02:46:34.611 --> 02:46:38.560
smoke.
So that was my Karma.
Yeah,

2864
02:46:38.561 --> 02:46:41.000
I got it turned around on you.
Yeah,
it was a bitch.

2865
02:46:41.310 --> 02:46:42.510
<v 4>Yeah.
The cigarette thing,</v>

2866
02:46:42.511 --> 02:46:46.020
people don't think of it as an imposition on anyone but themselves.

2867
02:46:46.021 --> 02:46:49.380
So there'll be outside in front of a place like the opening of a restaurant or

2868
02:46:49.381 --> 02:46:52.290
whatever and just to be sitting there smoking and you're inside the restaurant

2869
02:46:52.291 --> 02:46:55.170
and it comes in,
you're like,
oh,
it's disgusting.

2870
02:46:55.470 --> 02:46:56.940
And it's just someone outside the exit door,

2871
02:46:56.941 --> 02:47:00.870
like they don't realize it smells when you're smoking.
Things are real weird.

2872
02:47:00.871 --> 02:47:02.580
Like weed as another example.

2873
02:47:02.581 --> 02:47:06.810
Like people don't realize that we'd stink so bad when you're smelling like they

2874
02:47:06.811 --> 02:47:09.030
don't know that other people could smell it because there's something that's

2875
02:47:09.031 --> 02:47:12.180
happening when you're smoking weed.
We don't really smell it that much.

2876
02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:15.420
But if you walk into a room and people have been smoking weed,

2877
02:47:15.421 --> 02:47:17.490
you like Jesus fucking Christ.

2878
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:20.460
Do you guys know what this place smells like with the people in it?

2879
02:47:20.910 --> 02:47:24.990
Don't seem to have a grasp on it.
They don't,
you're,
you're all factory sensors.

2880
02:47:24.991 --> 02:47:29.190
Detect changes in smell.
They don't necessarily detect smells

2881
02:47:29.950 --> 02:47:34.740
<v 3>and I don't find it as is.
Uh,
I don't find it as a offensive weed.
Smoking.</v>

2882
02:47:34.741 --> 02:47:39.390
It smells good.
It's like cigars smelled good too.
Who are pipes?
Yes.
Pipe smoke.

2883
02:47:39.391 --> 02:47:43.800
Great.
Like the Nice Cherry tobacco or something like that.
I love it.
That's good.

2884
02:47:44.010 --> 02:47:48.750
My pop,
my Stepdad was a big pot smoker.
Yeah.
From the time he was a musician,

2885
02:47:48.751 --> 02:47:51.990
played in a Bangladesh.
I mean he was a musician,

2886
02:47:52.020 --> 02:47:56.310
a working musician his whole life.
And uh,
here's a dude,

2887
02:47:56.370 --> 02:48:00.010
Larry Kelly knocking out Billy blanks with a head kick.
Watch this.
Oh,
cake.

2888
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:02.190
It's pretty sweet.
He was a really good at it.

2889
02:48:02.850 --> 02:48:05.100
<v 6>Oh,</v>

2890
02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:09.280
<v 3>Pretty Nice,
Huh?
Yeah.
Guy had a hell of a hook kick.
You always heard about it.</v>

2891
02:48:10.060 --> 02:48:12.820
That's a good hint.
But not that often.
You don't see that in UFC.

2892
02:48:12.821 --> 02:48:15.480
But that would work.
Maybe if it worked there,
it would work.
Right.

2893
02:48:15.550 --> 02:48:17.110
Because he was moving back.

2894
02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:20.140
But can you imagine if he threw it while a wrestler was coming in?

2895
02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:24.310
He would get taken down for a show so that would worry fought in white tie guy

2896
02:48:24.311 --> 02:48:28.180
and the guy goes underneath it and a tax that the supporting leg and the way he

2897
02:48:28.181 --> 02:48:29.380
threw it was almost,

2898
02:48:29.410 --> 02:48:33.160
we put his hip forward so it was almost like he was throwing a spinning hook

2899
02:48:33.161 --> 02:48:34.560
kick cause he got it a hip into of a,

2900
02:48:34.561 --> 02:48:38.380
most guys that throw it just bring their back,
their,
their leg back.

2901
02:48:38.381 --> 02:48:41.140
So it's not with that much power.
That one.
Yeah.
Let me see the way he throws,

2902
02:48:41.141 --> 02:48:44.630
he comes back,
he's going to bring his hip forward,
see how he brought us,

2903
02:48:44.670 --> 02:48:47.660
hit forward and then came back.
So we get that hip into it.

2904
02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:50.290
It'd be like throwing a jab up here,

2905
02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:53.200
but then you bring your hand back and forth the jab so it's more like a right

2906
02:48:53.201 --> 02:48:56.540
hand.
That was a nice one though.
Yeah.
He's uh,
he's a,

2907
02:48:56.710 --> 02:49:01.150
he was a talented motherfucker.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jerry tremble.
Yeah,

2908
02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:01.990
Jerry Trauma.

2909
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:03.650
<v 4>I met Jerry Tremble when a,</v>

2910
02:49:03.651 --> 02:49:08.651
I was working somewhere in like Santa Clarita and Jerry Trimble just happened to

2911
02:49:08.791 --> 02:49:11.310
be on the same set doing something completely different.

2912
02:49:11.311 --> 02:49:12.480
I got a chance to say hi to him.

2913
02:49:12.890 --> 02:49:17.540
<v 3>He has,
he has the best,
um,</v>

2914
02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:22.560
highlight video on youtube.
Really.
Jerry tremble.

2915
02:49:22.561 --> 02:49:27.170
He was a hell of a fighter.
He was a hell of a fighter.
Yeah.
And he just has,

2916
02:49:27.171 --> 02:49:31.070
his is a dynamic way and his personality,

2917
02:49:31.490 --> 02:49:34.490
his highlight video is actually my favorite fight.

2918
02:49:34.491 --> 02:49:37.640
Highlight video of anyone there is where there it is.
Ooh.
Yeah.

2919
02:49:37.641 --> 02:49:39.020
His highlight video was,

2920
02:49:39.790 --> 02:49:43.890
<v 4>oh yeah,
Jesus.
Yeah.
He's a bad motherfucker in the PKA days.</v>

2921
02:49:44.010 --> 02:49:47.610
He was one of the few guys that was like super good.
Yeah.

2922
02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:51.990
And really fun to watch together like Benny did.
Yeah.
Because there was a lot of,

2923
02:49:51.991 --> 02:49:53.880
the public of this three 60 roundhouse kicked out.

2924
02:49:53.881 --> 02:49:58.480
He was a lot of people in those pka days that were really boring,
stinking point.

2925
02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:01.050
Point point,
yeah.
Well not just that,

2926
02:50:01.051 --> 02:50:04.200
like they would throw kicks just cause they had to have a minimum amount of

2927
02:50:04.201 --> 02:50:05.070
kicks.
Yeah.

2928
02:50:05.340 --> 02:50:08.520
So they would throw these like halfassed kicks just to get their minimum men and

2929
02:50:08.521 --> 02:50:13.140
then there was guys like trembled there at all these wild techniques.
Yeah.
Damn.

2930
02:50:13.141 --> 02:50:15.780
He was a bad motherfucker.
Sean,
you've Terrio you remember him?

2931
02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:20.200
<v 3>Yes,
I do.
He will.
Who?
Blinky Rodriguez knocked out.
Yeah,
he was good.</v>

2932
02:50:20.201 --> 02:50:21.340
But he didn't do the leg kick.

2933
02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:26.540
<v 4>No.
Terrio a was above the waist guy lost when he did do the leg kicks,</v>

2934
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:29.930
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's from Toronto.
And that's to WHO's beat him up,
didn't he?

2935
02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.060
<v 3>I Dunno,
but I know he's from Toronto.
Yeah,
you have the lake,</v>

2936
02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:36.360
the non lake kit guys.
When they came over to light kick,
they just,
uh,

2937
02:50:36.690 --> 02:50:40.320
it was like a,
it was like a boxer trying to fight a wrestler guy.
Yeah.
He just,

2938
02:50:40.321 --> 02:50:44.160
they could not cope with it.
Like see Cherry Trump out of the best,
uh,
highlight.

2939
02:50:44.190 --> 02:50:47.850
He's,
he has actually had an MMA guys and anyone else.

2940
02:50:47.970 --> 02:50:52.890
He has my favorite highlight video of all time really.
And I don't even know him.

2941
02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:57.510
I just happened to be,
I just saw it once.
I was like,
this is my favorite.

2942
02:50:57.511 --> 02:51:00.090
And I wrote in the comments,
this is my favorite or something.

2943
02:51:00.091 --> 02:51:04.020
And he thanked me for it.
But that's awesome.
Yeah.
He's,
that's,
he's uh,

2944
02:51:04.050 --> 02:51:05.190
he's an awesome guy.

2945
02:51:05.860 --> 02:51:07.610
<v 4>Yeah.
Those,
uh,
it's,</v>

2946
02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:11.740
it's really interesting because those guys from that era there that,

2947
02:51:11.741 --> 02:51:15.880
that is responsible for like holding kickboxing back a little bit for some

2948
02:51:15.881 --> 02:51:17.470
reason.
The PKA.
Yeah.

2949
02:51:17.630 --> 02:51:21.260
<v 3>I was wk.
Oh,
you were Wko.
Yeah,
we fly wk.</v>

2950
02:51:21.261 --> 02:51:25.430
So we did like cakes and then some sometimes needs to,
and then,
uh,

2951
02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:30.470
that was Benny system,
you know,
that's what he liked,
wk and,
and uh,

2952
02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:32.600
they had PK and then,
um,

2953
02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:35.870
and like I said in Hawaii we kind of had to know commission thing,

2954
02:51:35.871 --> 02:51:39.860
so we just kind of fought any system.
Yeah.
That must've been a really nutty time.

2955
02:51:39.861 --> 02:51:43.700
Huh.
It's crazy.
I loved it.
I hate,
I hated growing up in Hawaii,
but uh,

2956
02:51:44.210 --> 02:51:48.150
but I loved,
uh,
I loved the fight,
the fight fighting in Hawaii.
She,

2957
02:51:48.210 --> 02:51:51.680
they have some really good fighters in Hawaii and there's some really good ones

2958
02:51:51.681 --> 02:51:52.910
coming up to right now.

2959
02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:57.980
<v 4>Well,
I'm always has been,
you know what I mean?
To think about like the,
the,</v>

2960
02:51:57.981 --> 02:52:00.870
just the tradition of bad motherfuckers from Hawaii.

2961
02:52:00.890 --> 02:52:05.320
So from Bj Penn was not the first,
but no,
certainly signifies,

2962
02:52:05.650 --> 02:52:06.730
it symbolizes

2963
02:52:06.730 --> 02:52:11.140
<v 1>that style of a,
a fighter.
Well,
this brown other proud Hawaiian.</v>

2964
02:52:12.580 --> 02:52:14.520
Scary fucking dude,
man.
He is,

2965
02:52:14.530 --> 02:52:18.940
he's a beast that those elbows that he does when guys are holding on to that

2966
02:52:18.941 --> 02:52:22.810
single holy shit.
He generates a lot of power with those.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2967
02:52:22.811 --> 02:52:25.510
They have some Hawaii.
Hawaii has always been a fight.

2968
02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:29.950
Culter a lot.
There's been a lot of fights in Hawaii.
I mean,

2969
02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:34.030
the first MMA fight was in Hawaii.
I should,
I should correct myself.

2970
02:52:34.031 --> 02:52:38.260
He lost his John Eve Terrio who,
uh,
Ernesto hoost.
He didn't beat Sean.

2971
02:52:38.261 --> 02:52:42.370
You've Tara.
They fought it blinky.
Okay.
Waste.
Oh,
okay.
That's an ESCO.
Who's,
yeah,

2972
02:52:42.371 --> 02:52:43.240
they fought above the waist.

2973
02:52:43.241 --> 02:52:47.860
They sh they fought Johnny [inaudible] style and then,
uh,
he fought.
Uh,

2974
02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:50.820
he's,
he's funny.
Everybody,
man.
He fought.
Rob came in last,

2975
02:52:50.850 --> 02:52:54.970
it came in and he lost to a John,
you've Terrio again later on in his career.

2976
02:52:55.150 --> 02:52:59.110
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Rick Rufus and another one.

2977
02:52:59.810 --> 02:53:02.740
Duke's products rather.
It was a bad motherfucker in those days.

2978
02:53:02.741 --> 02:53:06.610
He was in one of the other really exciting guys and the PK days.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2979
02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:10.690
But he had a good transition over to two leg kick kickboxing as well.

2980
02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:14.390
I think we're,
I think Duke was better,
but yeah.
More successful.

2981
02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:19.120
That style of fighting.
Yeah.
But he was,
he definitely had his day.

2982
02:53:19.390 --> 02:53:23.380
The other jet.
Yeah.
The other jet.
Yeah.
Well Rick,
the jet,

2983
02:53:23.381 --> 02:53:27.130
Rufus was a fan of Benny the jet,
so he took his nickname.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2984
02:53:27.131 --> 02:53:28.810
I mean that's where,
that's where he got the nickname.

2985
02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:32.720
He got the nickname cause he's a Benny the jet fan.
A huge fan of Benny's.
Yeah.

2986
02:53:32.890 --> 02:53:36.820
Well Ben,
he was like one of the original pioneers.
He was,
yeah,
he,
yeah.

2987
02:53:36.850 --> 02:53:39.820
And he's still,
he's still teaching.
He's still,
he's still hanging in there.

2988
02:53:39.850 --> 02:53:44.110
He said he was the free kind of guy that just could do everything.

2989
02:53:44.260 --> 02:53:48.100
I mean he could stand right in front of you two inches from your face,

2990
02:53:48.130 --> 02:53:52.840
jump up in there and do a spinning back kick.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.

2991
02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:54.940
Good old days.
My friend,
those are the good old days.

2992
02:53:55.630 --> 02:53:59.200
A lot of good old days coming up still today will be the good old days one day.

2993
02:53:59.530 --> 02:54:02.020
So you've got a lot of good like,
yeah,
I mean there's,

2994
02:54:02.790 --> 02:54:07.270
there are some great guys coming up and uh,
I got guys like court coming in and,

2995
02:54:07.271 --> 02:54:12.190
and Glover making it to the top.
What's this an exciting time for MMA?

2996
02:54:12.490 --> 02:54:17.080
You know,
it's,
it's still in its infancy.
It was crazy as it sounds,
it's still,

2997
02:54:17.081 --> 02:54:20.830
I mean when there's a 10 20 year history from now,
from now to today,

2998
02:54:20.980 --> 02:54:22.480
people are going to look back at these times like,

2999
02:54:22.481 --> 02:54:26.000
well this is like when it was really starting to explode from there.

3000
02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:29.350
It'll be the biggest sport in the world.
What do you think it can be changing?

3001
02:54:29.351 --> 02:54:33.200
Like it's changed from boxing?
It's a good question.
Um,

3002
02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:35.260
this is always going to be,
I think once.

3003
02:54:35.460 --> 02:54:38.590
What do you think is the dumbest rule that they should change?
12 to six elbows.

3004
02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:43.360
12 to six elbows are crazy.
It doesn't make any sense.
As my last blog,

3005
02:54:43.810 --> 02:54:48.610
did you write it about 12 to six elbows 12 and six or three to nine.
Stupid.
Well,

3006
02:54:48.730 --> 02:54:52.320
Travis Brown and um,
the,
the reunite the Josh Barnett one.

3007
02:54:52.330 --> 02:54:56.320
That's okay because it's three to nine.
This is so fucking stupid kindie punches.

3008
02:54:56.830 --> 02:55:01.270
It's all of it's so stupid.
Skinny punches are stupid too.
That's a stupid rule.

3009
02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:04.490
You can't kick the kidneys when you're on the bottom.
When you're uh,

3010
02:55:04.750 --> 02:55:08.600
in the guys guard.
That's an effective technique,
man.
Yeah,
you should allow that.

3011
02:55:08.601 --> 02:55:11.390
If you could throw a body kick,
you're kicking the kidneys,
man.

3012
02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:14.750
If you're kicking a guy on his left side,
you're kicking his fucking kidneys.

3013
02:55:14.910 --> 02:55:18.320
Have you hit him on his right side?
You're hitting him in his liver.
It's legal.

3014
02:55:18.530 --> 02:55:20.870
It should be illegal.
Well,
the liver,
the liver,

3015
02:55:21.350 --> 02:55:24.290
you can hit the liver because the liver is in the front.
Right?

3016
02:55:24.410 --> 02:55:26.930
And there's only one.
Yeah.
And you can't live without it.

3017
02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:31.070
Right in the kidneys there's two of them.
And there you can live without them.

3018
02:55:31.071 --> 02:55:33.650
I mean,
you'd have to be on dialysis,
but there's two of them,

3019
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:37.010
so you could live with one just fine,
but you can't kick the kidney,

3020
02:55:37.011 --> 02:55:39.290
but you can kick the liver and you can can hit the brain.

3021
02:55:39.350 --> 02:55:42.080
That's pretty sensitive.
One,
two most sensitive one period,

3022
02:55:42.081 --> 02:55:45.860
the most important one or irreplaceable and you're,
you're,
you're,

3023
02:55:45.890 --> 02:55:48.950
you're actually,
they want you to hit it as hard as you can.

3024
02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:52.400
If we got to wrap this up at three o'clock we turn into a pumpkin or three hours

3025
02:55:52.401 --> 02:55:55.490
in.
All right,
so we are three hours in.
Oh my God,
it's over.

3026
02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:56.930
I thought I was worrying,
thinking.

3027
02:55:57.740 --> 02:56:01.790
Now that time I want to keep you not stopping now get up,

3028
02:56:02.030 --> 02:56:02.863
get dressed,

3029
02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:07.040
make the bed and get the fuck out and we can do it again.

3030
02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:09.500
We'll do it again in the future.
We could easily see,

3031
02:56:09.501 --> 02:56:12.950
I knew that it would be easy,
like the conversations,

3032
02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:14.840
the conversations that I've had with you in the past,

3033
02:56:14.841 --> 02:56:17.560
I knew it would be easy to do three hour things like that.

3034
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:19.400
There's stuff I wasn't,
I didn't talk about yet.

3035
02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:23.630
Do you have anything really important to mom?
Is she write all that down?

3036
02:56:23.631 --> 02:56:26.690
What about sodomy?
Sunday?
We have not talked to us about that anymore.

3037
02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:32.000
They've changed that rule.
How does the Monday people want to get ahold of you?

3038
02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:36.200
Uh,

3040
02:56:39.710 --> 02:56:43.840
Look for Pitt.
Underscore master pitmaster is John Hackleman.
Do you,

3041
02:56:43.841 --> 02:56:48.740

I love it.
It's,

3042
02:56:48.770 --> 02:56:52.820

I appreciate you coming over.
