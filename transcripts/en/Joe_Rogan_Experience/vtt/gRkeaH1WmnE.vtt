1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
<v Speaker 1>That's everything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that on the podcast.</v>

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>What were you just saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I love fanny packs and I've been using</v>
<v Speaker 2>them continuously.</v>

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

5
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get scared that the Illuminati and</v>

6
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to keep you from embracing the</v>

7
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to.</v>

8
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>They want to emasculate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not them.</v>

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 2>That's like some group name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've heard of the rat pack where the</v>

10
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:23.724
<v Speaker 2>fanny pack.</v>

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Brian's never dared one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

12
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I have yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wear it all the time.</v>

13
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Never seen more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

14
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>it's cool it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's little ones that stretch.</v>

15
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like super small and they like stretch</v>

16
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could put like a couple of things</v>

17
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>in it or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

18
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And you can't really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Those things are good for jogging the</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

20
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled tight to you.</v>

21
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a smaller pocket though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't see.</v>

22
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>The thing with these things is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel as much as we do,</v>

23
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>you just have all your shit in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you just drop it off.</v>

24
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Just take any thought out of your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have about getting laid.</v>

25
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>That won't be happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are a single person,</v>

26
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you're a single man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Single girl could pull it off.</v>

27
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a fuck.</v>

28
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Pennypack would not make her any less</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>No need to put a condom in a fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never use it.</v>

30
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Your fanny pack though isn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheesy or anything.</v>

31
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>It's actually cool looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's root slim.</v>

32
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sell them.</v>

33
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>They put a higher primate logo on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roots does,</v>

34
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's a roots fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the ones that dice was wearing.</v>

35
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>That's how I found out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dice came in and I had instant fanny</v>

36
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>pack envy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

37
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you have here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have?</v>

38
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the one I got</v>

39
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in the line at Tsa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eyeball everybody that's emptying</v>

40
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker 2>their pockets and I just look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody and then I get snap and drop</v>

41
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:46.060
<v Speaker 2>it like a mic into the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody just saw me</v>

42
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>and it zips up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your pockets don't zip up.</v>

43
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.953
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

44
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Everything falls out of pockets on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane.</v>

45
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 2>There's something about it</v>

46
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I've worn on stage maybe four times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've worn it on word,</v>

47
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>on stage in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets in the way though.</v>

48
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Flopping around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're moving too much.</v>

49
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain places where I.</v>

50
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't wear a fanny pack in one way it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would work because if you actually moved</v>

51
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>it to your fanny and there's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about that.</v>

52
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:15.070
<v Speaker 1>That's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have a fanny pack,</v>

53
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be in the front</v>

54
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>and waterproof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broader proof.</v>

55
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Fanny packs might be next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

56
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Shower with soap in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull it out.</v>

57
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>If you have like a secret and you keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in that fanny pack,</v>

58
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>so I a picture of your deck or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

59
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:37.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't want anybody having an actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical picture was the one body Kelly</v>

60
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>always had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was wearing.</v>

61
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 1>It was like when I went over your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder roll a Bandolero.</v>

62
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fanny pack that's on your</v>

63
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like for people who are scared of</v>

64
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 1>wearing a fanny packs or they pretend</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're world travelers with skinny</v>

65
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those dudes who were like suede</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know those kind of guys and they</v>

71
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.280

<v Speaker 1>I like to take those people,</v>

72
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>satchels from them and just wear them</v>
<v Speaker 1>around my waist.</v>

73
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>She just turned my Satchel into a fanny</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>

74
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a butcher's apron.</v>

75

86
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>We're just a bunch of Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pubic hair and it's filled with</v>

00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how crazy this show was.</v>

119
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

120
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:35.821
<v Speaker 1>I got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started pitching that people would</v>

121
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>have to drink donkey come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts my mind that it was on NBC.</v>

122
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then other people said,</v>

123
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:42.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

124
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like what you're saying.</v>

125
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

126
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>NBC is as mainstream as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

127
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

128
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>come watch the nightly news with Tom</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brokaw as mainstream as possible.</v>

129
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And the girl it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's</v>

130
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 2>pretending like she didn't love it</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

131
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.434
<v Speaker 2>She liked it.</v>

132
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even her first time drinking</v>

133
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:04.454
<v Speaker 1>donkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

134
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.650
<v Speaker 1>It was so ridiculous at the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to abstain.</v>

135
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So silly.</v>

136
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>That's overkill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like being able to look at the donkey.</v>

137
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

138
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>You're just yelling at these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

139
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.150
<v Speaker 1>chug it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy just shucked it so quick.</v>

140
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>They're hugging on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So strange.</v>

141
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they get to throw up.</v>

142
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>They have to hold it in their mouth for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a few seconds or something.</v>

143
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>His buddies up and he didn't even drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

144
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to relive this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can stop now.</v>

145
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

146
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing that that was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual show.</v>

147
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

148
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As amazing to me as it is anybody that</v>

149
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>was watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even feel like it was me.</v>

150
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I watch it now and even though I know it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was me and I'm like,</v>

151
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.134
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do that.</v>

152
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because most shows like for</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians to host suck and aren't fun at</v>

153
00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:01.320
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

154
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.730
<v Speaker 2>But eat that show seems like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were surprised.</v>

155
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.200

160
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.573
<v Speaker 1>You've got to root them on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so I said I went to just for a goof,</v>

166
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:32.950

<v Speaker 1>It's more of in your head than anything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The actual taste and now that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big a deal.</v>

173
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Those were the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The juicy.</v>

174
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Madagascar hissing cockroach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it alive?</v>

179
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a young lady that was on the</v>

180
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:17.170
<v Speaker 1>show and she was going to get kicked off</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she didn't do something else.</v>

181
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Like she had to do something to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

182
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:19.930
<v Speaker 1>It was all for charity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

183
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>So because it was a celebrity fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor out.</v>

184
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Alison Sweeney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe her name is from days of our</v>

185
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:28.540
<v Speaker 1>lives and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know who came up with this idea,</v>

188
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 1>someone in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the office,</v>

189
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stay.</v>

191
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.850

<v Speaker 3>two ridges.</v>

249
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.850
<v Speaker 3>When you pull the tab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the contents don't squirt in your face.</v>

250
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.460

<v Speaker 1>sort of crazy.</v>

269
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>If you think about fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how amazing they are.</v>

270
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like trick candy and a rapper</v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

271
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

272
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a delivery system trick.</v>

273
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like there are seeds inside these</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants and if you eat it,</v>

274
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 1>it goes through your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shit it out.</v>

275
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>So it like literally comes with manure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's got a seed,</v>

276
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 1>it's got some manure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got shit to the seed,</v>

277
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:48.874
<v Speaker 1>can grow in.</v>

278
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like literally comes out with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer.</v>

279
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with like animals like</v>

280
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>undulates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cows and stuff like that.</v>

281
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Like they're shitting out like almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mulch.</v>

282
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 1>They're shitting out compost mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take cows shit and you take that</v>

283
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 1>shit and you grow things with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a great fertilizer.</v>

284
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.350
<v Speaker 1>People use it on their crops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's in a lot of ways I would</v>

285
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just me thinking that this is</v>

286
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.770
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like some sort of a like a</v>

287
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 1>transportation device for seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

288
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

289
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of it that way though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

290
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 1>animals eat the seeds and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pooping out the next thing.</v>

291
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It's don't have seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

292
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do that.</v>

293
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 1>If it was really Jesus as if it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really an atheist nightmare,</v>

294
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I think there'd be seeds seedless</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

295
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.180
<v Speaker 1>If bananas at seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be bunk.</v>

296
00:13:38.181 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Man Fits into math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

297
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I wonder that dummy knows that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like changed the shape of</v>

298
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.770
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

299
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to wild banana.</v>

300
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Those little scrubby ass bitch ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>

301
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like those Dole Bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those big whopper bananas were like</v>

302
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:54.190

<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

304
00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Like these Gmo bananas are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

307

<v Speaker 1>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the way Jesus made this benign.</v>

308
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>He's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just such a strange argument,</v>

309
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you want to believe.</v>

310
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to believe that God</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed a banana so perfectly to let</v>

322
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 1>going to get more and more expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of global warming and stuff like</v>

323
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the price of chocolate and the</v>

324
00:14:58.191 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>price of coffee is just going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the roof.</v>

325
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Pistachios I guess this year or like</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like on a shortage.</v>

326
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.930

<v Speaker 1>like double in price in the next couple</v>

327
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.090
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

328
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what foods are on the endangered</v>
<v Speaker 1>species list almost.</v>

329
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we shouldn't live in a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really fucking hot right now when</v>

330
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.110
<v Speaker 1>the earth is getting hotter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean what the fuck is la going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>

332
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.350

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

333
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Like Phoenix is like a bump hotter than</v>
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>

334
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say a lot like a bump,</v>

335
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 1>a good solid bump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything's shifted.</v>

336
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes,</v>

337
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:37.580
<v Speaker 1>everything's kind of like Oklahoma had</v>
<v Speaker 1>an earthquake the other day,</v>

338
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's because of fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a.</v>

340
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>That is no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

341
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.420

<v Speaker 1>They're having so many earthquakes</v>

342
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 1>because of fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Oklahoma just put some.</v>

343
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 1>They put a pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

344
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a pause on drilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>new wells or it's a pause on.</v>

345
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>It can't be a pause and operating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>

346
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 41 different</v>

347
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 1>fracking sites.</v>

348
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>July me.</v>

349
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 1>They're going crazy with fracking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>From earth here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from America.</v>

353
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma orders shut down of 37 wells</v>
<v Speaker 1>after earthquake.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a hot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the new thing isn't really super</v>

358

<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has this like supermodel lady.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the Fox News girls?</v>

360
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 1>They're all like seven feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to her,</v>

361
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:44.441
<v Speaker 1>but let's watch her face move that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting the hottest women.</v>

362
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.690
<v Speaker 1>That Mexican weather girl with the but</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

363
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that lady love her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

364
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.710
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of like a gimmick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

366
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.350
<v Speaker 1>A CNN like?</v>

367
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just hiring the best looking</v>

368
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

369
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 1>You for sexy</v>
<v Speaker 1>light skin,</v>

370
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:03.150
<v Speaker 1>black check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

371
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 1>And she's talking to this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will I believe in Jesus and Jesus wants</v>

372
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 1>us to dig oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at my tie.</v>

373
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Look at my haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's conservative as is my approach to</v>

374
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ma'Am.</v>

375
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 1>You won't hear me using any forbidden</v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

376
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to keep the oil prices low.</v>

377
00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:26.061
<v Speaker 1>The way to keep the oral process flow is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue safe and ethical fracking.</v>

378
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

379
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 1>get back to the hot chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see her faith.</v>

380
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are they doing?</v>

381
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Like all these shows like Fox News and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the there.</v>

382
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be something to like the</v>

383
00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 1>fact that propaganda being delivered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is so hot.</v>

384
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>You just want to stare him like those.</v>

385
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Those Fox ice queens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

386
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.950
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

387
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.640
<v Speaker 1>they're so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want to look at their face like</v>

388
00:17:56.641 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 1>little kids get compelled to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty women's faces.</v>

389
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Fox News has a bunch of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategically to keep you watching,</v>

390
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:06.810
<v Speaker 1>like spinning things and it's all like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all mental dude.</v>

391
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 1>We were watching once and who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the Megan Kelly lady that was</v>

392
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 1>crossing and uncrossing your legs like</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 fucking times and she's wearing this</v>

393
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:17.190
<v Speaker 1>little skirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out.</v>

394
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It might not have been her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been one of those other</v>

395
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 1>hotties that was high as other Fox</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotties,</v>

396
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:23.800
<v Speaker 1>but it was ridiculous because she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing literally like she's got a</v>

397
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Napkin over vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a small napkin.</v>

398
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not as much of a skirt at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

399
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 1>She has these super long legs and high</v>
<v Speaker 1>heels on and she's doing this.</v>

400
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:35.540
<v Speaker 1>She should she have a little Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you see her.</v>

401
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a chance to say she's</v>

402
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very calculated,</v>

403
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>very calculated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I was staying with a dude who</v>

404
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:42.930
<v Speaker 1>moved his legs that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

405
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you okay?</v>

406
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Why keep crossing your legs are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket.</v>

407
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:49.690
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to sing me a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that?</v>

408
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 1>You see the girl that was twerking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>her butt popped up in her underwear?</v>

409
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.133
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

410
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's related.</v>

411
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Brian watches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox News.</v>

412
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Fox News is hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I keep hearing Fox News is hurting.</v>

413
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I watched routers and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was it that was saying that they had</v>

414
00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 1>heard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

415
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember who was telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>me this.</v>

416
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Was it you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you telling me the thing about a</v>

417
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.930
<v Speaker 1>trump and a television network?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was trying to remember what,</v>

418
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.800
<v Speaker 1>where I heard it and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a radio show or</v>

419
00:19:22.801 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there's a lot of those,</v>

420
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.180
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people use added like Sean</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannity and I think that God has taken</v>

421
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 1>over his campaign that used to run fox</v>
<v Speaker 1>or taken over his spot and I don't know</v>

422
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:32.720
<v Speaker 1>how they're going to transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he loses,</v>

423
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.850
<v Speaker 1>but that trump news channel is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be started up next year,</v>

424
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 1>the end of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump news,</v>

425
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:40.080
<v Speaker 1>24 hour trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what he does.</v>

426
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 1>If he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was smart,</v>

427
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's obviously smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not right.</v>

428
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.930
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously really good at making</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

429
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.771
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

430
00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever you can say about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageous shit that he says,</v>

431
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 1>that guy's ridiculously successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculously right.</v>

432
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

433
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 1>his dad gave him a big loan to start out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

434
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck ever at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

435
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 1>that guy's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculously successful.</v>

436
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.740
<v Speaker 1>If he wanted to open a good television</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable network and use that as a platform</v>

437
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:09.730
<v Speaker 1>to set them up for four years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

438
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.780
<v Speaker 1>like the kind of fucking shit that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say about Hillary and like other</v>

439
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:19.560
<v Speaker 1>candidates that no one would have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls to say like he takes it to this</v>

440
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 1>non political place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

441
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 1>like he insults Hillary Clinton all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

442
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 1>He calls her crooked Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been to presidential</v>

443
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>candidates or one of them had nicknames</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the other people?</v>

444
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made fun of everybody,</v>

445
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted,</v>

446
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps repeating it,</v>

447
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who she is.</v>

448
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:42.380
<v Speaker 1>That's crooked hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

449
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing what he did.</v>

450
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>If she just started calling him like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orange Donald or something,</v>

451
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 4>it'd be Keller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could really fire back.</v>

452
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 4>She needs a little like roast help</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's digging in deep.</v>

453
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable sound that she makes when</v>

454
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>she speaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she gives speeches,</v>

455
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.370
<v Speaker 1>they're not soothing and they don't draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in like as much as she is way more</v>

456
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:08.880
<v Speaker 1>qualified to be a leader than he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

457
00:21:08.881 --> 00:21:12.970
<v Speaker 1>He knows way more about foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knows way more about how Washington</v>

458
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's deep,</v>

459
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:17.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she'd be a way more qualified</v>

460
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:19.430
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the quality of</v>

461
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.570
<v Speaker 4>voice she needs to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some donkey come.</v>

462
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.610
<v Speaker 4>Which by the way is like the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the democratic.</v>

463
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Think you're going to jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the democratic.</v>

464
00:21:28.531 --> 00:21:31.080
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked her just because she at least</v>

465
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:34.560
<v Speaker 4>has built the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not billing anymore,</v>

466
00:21:34.561 --> 00:21:35.910
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's bill enough.</v>

467
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 4>Bills stay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

468
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of</v>

469
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.530
<v Speaker 1>the stand back and take naps in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background guy.</v>

470
00:21:42.531 --> 00:21:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Now if you noticed that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech he was giving,</v>

471
00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>he was falling asleep in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speech and you know,</v>

472
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.700
<v Speaker 1>he just in really poor health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently his body's just not doing so</v>

473
00:21:52.701 --> 00:21:53.534
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

474
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when the blowjob</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 4>You just can't help yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

477
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.570
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a machine back in the day and now</v>

478
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.130
<v Speaker 4>just came too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all dried out.</v>

479
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:06.760
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ya know,</v>

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.610
<v Speaker 1>so many loads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor guy.</v>

482
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he was a two term president.</v>

483
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the best guy.</v>

484
00:22:18.001 --> 00:22:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Made a mad run for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean regardless of all the Dick pulling</v>

485
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:25.020
<v Speaker 1>out and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a madman.</v>

486
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Would you expect from madman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing some mad man type shit.</v>

487
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 4>All I remember is everybody was taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>vacations,</v>

488
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 4>owning houses and gas prices were like</v>
<v Speaker 4>forty five cents a gallon.</v>

489
00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:36.041
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

490
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean he should.</v>

491
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about the economic</v>

492
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 1>cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that the people that are</v>

493
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 1>smart that talk about it say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like these upturns and downturns</v>

494
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 1>that you can almost calculate that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to happen and then we have a</v>

495
00:22:51.341 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 1>weird economy and that these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the experts,</v>

496
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.080
<v Speaker 1>they can kind of predict how things</v>
<v Speaker 1>start happening and deregulation moves</v>

497
00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:01.300
<v Speaker 1>things along a little bit and this moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along.</v>

498
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Tax Incentive moves things a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

499
00:23:03.401 --> 00:23:06.280
<v Speaker 1>a little further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then somewhere along the line the</v>

500
00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:08.770
<v Speaker 1>house of cards comes falling down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

501
00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see the big one was the mortgage</v>

502
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:17.440
<v Speaker 1>crisis of 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We avoided an even bigger one with the</v>

503
00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:20.440
<v Speaker 1>commercial real estate crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>

504
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.740
<v Speaker 1>there were saying that they were worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that more than anything because if</v>

505
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 1>you drive down like any place in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>valley,</v>

506
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.190
<v Speaker 1>just go drive down the valley and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all the buildings for sale.</v>

507
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Look at all the buildings for lease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

508
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's way more than you used to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as you're driving down,</v>

509
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:40.240
<v Speaker 1>you see available for re release</v>
<v Speaker 1>available for sale,</v>

510
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:41.470

512
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:46.100

<v Speaker 1>Like that</v>

513
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 5>could fall apart too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

514
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 5>Apparently that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently there's like a lot of people</v>

515
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:54.470
<v Speaker 5>that are like leveraging all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>commercial properties and moving things</v>

516
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:56.000
<v Speaker 5>around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>selling things here.</v>

517
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 5>But there's a lot of vacant office shit.</v>

518

<v Speaker 6>he ended up,</v>

521
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.350
<v Speaker 6>I ended up sticking on it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like trying to convince everybody that</v>

522
00:24:10.351 --> 00:24:12.510
<v Speaker 6>they can just go buy a house and flip it</v>
<v Speaker 6>and sell it.</v>

523
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.310
<v Speaker 6>Make money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so easy.</v>

524
00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:15.280
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he just come in,</v>

525
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.000
<v Speaker 6>tear down a wall and then sell it for</v>
<v Speaker 6>twice as much more.</v>

526
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:18.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their character.</v>

527
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 5>There's two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

528
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 5>They're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do my own grout out there,</v>

529
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 5>laying tiles and shit.</v>

530
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.360
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they edit it down and make it</v>

531
00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:29.350
<v Speaker 6>look like it took 12 seconds on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This old house,</v>

532
00:24:29.351 --> 00:24:31.090
<v Speaker 6>you remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was one of my favorite shows</v>

533
00:24:31.091 --> 00:24:35.020
<v Speaker 6>growing up with Bob Vila.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty much the original flipping</v>

534
00:24:35.021 --> 00:24:37.480
<v Speaker 6>houses show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they made it a whole story on this</v>

535
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.190
<v Speaker 6>went on for days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened to Bob Vila see alive?</v>

536
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.230
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is a good question.</v>

537
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.230
<v Speaker 6>I forgot about them like huge until he</v>
<v Speaker 6>was a hero.</v>

538
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This old house was done was like a giant</v>

539
00:24:49.991 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 6>show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or at least it was for me growing up</v>

540
00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:55.870
<v Speaker 6>because we watched it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That in the antique roadshow is another</v>

541
00:24:55.871 --> 00:24:59.400
<v Speaker 6>one that had just love on pbs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was for me to still rocking.</v>

542
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.780
<v Speaker 6>That might be real 1 million followers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

543
00:25:01.781 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Speaker 6>Look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Verified handsome bastard.</v>

544
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:08.080
<v Speaker 6>He looks exactly the senior AC coils</v>
<v Speaker 6>mean higher efficiency and lower energy</v>

545
00:25:08.081 --> 00:25:08.440
<v Speaker 6>bills.</v>

546
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Speaker 6>How clean are yours?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just had that one of those air</v>

547
00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:15.220
<v Speaker 6>conditioning's fucked me for life fucked</v>
<v Speaker 6>you because it has like a drain and it's</v>

548
00:25:15.221 --> 00:25:17.800
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be tilted a little so it</v>
<v Speaker 6>could drip out.</v>

549
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.650
<v Speaker 6>Mine was dripping the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I didn't even know it was going</v>

550
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.340
<v Speaker 6>underneath my carpet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so now it got underneath a to my wood</v>

551
00:25:24.341 --> 00:25:27.940
<v Speaker 6>floors and now there's big buckles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when you walk it's like speed bumps</v>

552
00:25:27.941 --> 00:25:31.390
<v Speaker 6>underneath my carpet and fun and there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably black mold in there and</v>

553
00:25:31.391 --> 00:25:34.780
<v Speaker 6>probably go die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that help with black mold is from</v>

554
00:25:34.781 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

555
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.420
<v Speaker 6>Like water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's</v>

556
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 5>moisture from water damage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has to be present,</v>

557
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and asked to be present and then it can</v>

558
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 5>grow like a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm,</v>

559
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 5>well Tom Lucas was a big one because he</v>
<v Speaker 5>would talk about it on television or on</v>

560
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:50.960
<v Speaker 5>the radio rather like his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his whole house had to be gutted,</v>

561
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 5>like down to the studs that was in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood.</v>

562
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.730
<v Speaker 5>He's feeling like shit for years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like just health was poor,</v>

563
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 5>just really didn't have any energy</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to fill out what the fuck was</v>

564
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

565
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 5>they brought in a black mold specialists</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>

566
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking houses infected.</v>

567
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:13.390
<v Speaker 5>So he's breathing in all these spores,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these black mold sports just being</v>

568
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:15.230
<v Speaker 5>poisoned all the time.</v>

569
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.400
<v Speaker 6>Did they have home tests for that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet you anything.</v>

570
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:20.160
<v Speaker 6>I have so much black,</v>
<v Speaker 6>black matters people.</v>

571
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 6>Fucking son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's</v>

572
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.860
<v Speaker 6>got to keep an eye on it.</v>

573
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 5>The jokes they come,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just come.</v>

574
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.750
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah man.</v>

575
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:33.950
<v Speaker 5>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

576
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 5>they do a lot of testing for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should probably get it checked out.</v>

577
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.480
<v Speaker 5>Some people have it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

578
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.920
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever ever seen one of Jim Norton?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jim Norton was a gym and Bobby Jimmy and</v>

579
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 5>Kelly lived in an</v>

580
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.820
<v Speaker 1>apartment and they had black mold on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>walls so bad that you would take the</v>

581
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 1>picture off the wall and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

582
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 1>you could see it all over behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

583
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It's probably isn't as common though in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles since we're a desert and</v>

584
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 1>everything's dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

585
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if there's water,</v>

586
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>like if you have water damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you have a leaky pipe or</v>

587
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.580
<v Speaker 1>something like that for long periods of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

588
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 1>see that shit dripping down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's black mold juice hose lines.</v>

589
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Now Watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick up the uh,</v>

590
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cribs.</v>

591
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to find it as the video and</v>

592
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:22.821
<v Speaker 1>they say brace yourself so they push us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking wall is just covered</v>

593
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:26.910
<v Speaker 1>with black mold behind the photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like someone spray painted all</v>

594
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a priest to come in and give an</v>

595
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 1>extra systems of health.</v>

596
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 1>How did it happen though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was you speaking?</v>

597
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.830
<v Speaker 1>They're slobs to fucking slobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

598
00:27:35.831 --> 00:27:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Somebody might have come on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

599
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Jim Norton.</v>

600
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows he's a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at him playing chess.</v>

601
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Listen to cds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much your apartment.</v>

602
00:27:45.241 --> 00:27:50.241
<v Speaker 1>Red Band Department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much every comedian.</v>

603
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

604
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.590
<v Speaker 1>That black molds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No jokes.</v>

605
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

606
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I keep an eye on all the black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the black mold.</v>

607
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

608
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think is there more than one</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of black mold and does it have</v>

609
00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:09.810
<v Speaker 1>to be like water damage for a long time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm sure my carpet probably</v>

610
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:10.770
<v Speaker 1>dried out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 1>if I caught it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

612
00:28:13.471 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough.</v>

613
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

615
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 1>that mold and spores thrive in moist</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

616
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the forest but have no idea,</v>

617
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:23.694
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

618
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's creepy.</v>

619
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fungus and mold and shit like that.</v>

620
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like these,</v>

621
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 1>these lifeforms that live on life forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave her a pair,</v>

623
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 1>leave it sitting around somewhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about it.</v>

624
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Come back in a couple of days and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got this little green civilization</v>

625
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:44.940
<v Speaker 1>growing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who are you,</v>

626
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.260
<v Speaker 1>where'd you guys come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

627
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:47.530
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you.</v>

628
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the banana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a skin that protects it from</v>

629
00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 1>these things because Jesus loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>bananas.</v>

630
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 1>He gave him a southern accent and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though he's from New Zealand,</v>

631
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.780
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting choice.</v>

632
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I hit a bunch of mold the other day late</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night and we bought strawberries,</v>

633
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like underneath the strawberry,</v>

634
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.230
<v Speaker 1>like green and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea because it was dark eating</v>

635
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.610
<v Speaker 1>strawberries and the next day I go in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some more and I'm like,</v>

636
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:12.630
<v Speaker 1>they're all moldy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

637
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.700
<v Speaker 1>was I was reading moldy strawberry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

638
00:29:16.701 --> 00:29:17.534
<v Speaker 1>and the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

639
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not even that bad for you.</v>

640
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.160
<v Speaker 1>It's probably just all in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

641
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.060
<v Speaker 1>otherwise people would be dying left and</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

642
00:29:25.061 --> 00:29:25.660
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

643
00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody eats strawberries and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't pay attention or blueberries.</v>

644
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always fucking mold on on cheese.</v>

645
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes blueberries have mold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

646
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you buy them,</v>

647
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you buy them and bring them home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

648
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're already molding.</v>

649
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trader Joe's a lot of times cheese to</v>

650
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.851
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slice of cheese.</v>

651
00:29:41.851 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Not even</v>

652
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.480
<v Speaker 6>realize half of it's white and green.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

653
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.210
<v Speaker 6>some cheeses to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian.</v>

654
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.000
<v Speaker 6>Nobody else is eating Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will.</v>

655
00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 6>What were you leaving your cheese?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember?</v>

656
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:55.290
<v Speaker 6>My mom would always say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just pull off the mold part and just,</v>

657
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:56.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's still good.</v>

658
00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.580
<v Speaker 6>I would if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

659
00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 6>but pull the cheese out of the glove</v>
<v Speaker 6>compartment and screen you're eating it.</v>

660
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think that the economy</v>

661
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.670
<v Speaker 5>mold that we're talking about as toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just bet it's not like Jamie lookup</v>

662
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.270
<v Speaker 5>mold on strawberries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>

663
00:30:11.271 --> 00:30:12.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Katie Moldy food.</v>

664
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 5>What was it say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>May cause may have visible bacteria</v>

665
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:18.960
<v Speaker 5>along with the mold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

666
00:30:18.961 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 5>some old cause,</v>
<v Speaker 5>allergic reactions,</v>

667
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 5>respiratory problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a few molds in the right conditions.</v>

668
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 5>Produce Mycotoxins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>poisonous substances that can make you</v>

669
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 5>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

670
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just Google strawberries,</v>

671
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.070
<v Speaker 5>moldy strawberry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you eat mostly</v>

672
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 6>strawberries?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Google can Brian,</v>

673
00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:38.360
<v Speaker 6>red bandy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>moldy stressing.</v>

674
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.250
<v Speaker 6>You've done something like this before</v>
<v Speaker 6>to think of your fruit had mold and it's</v>

675
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 6>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just bought this also.</v>

676
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 6>So have you ate mode?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>

677
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure I have</v>

678
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.490
<v Speaker 5>quick answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most likely result of eating moldy</v>

679
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:54.450
<v Speaker 5>fruit is absolutely nothing unless the</v>
<v Speaker 5>person eating the mold is allergic.</v>

680
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.640
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while the majority of molds are not</v>

681
00:30:56.641 --> 00:30:59.220
<v Speaker 5>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>moldy fruit is more likely to be spoiled</v>

682
00:30:59.221 --> 00:31:03.420
<v Speaker 5>and spoiled fruit may cause illness</v>
<v Speaker 5>because mold may form on fruit without</v>

683
00:31:03.421 --> 00:31:06.570
<v Speaker 5>the fruit spoiling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simply cutting the moldy area off is</v>

684
00:31:06.571 --> 00:31:10.260
<v Speaker 5>also a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most molds are not harmful,</v>

685
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.760
<v Speaker 5>somewhere even beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

686
00:31:11.761 --> 00:31:14.310
<v Speaker 5>mold is actually a form of fungus</v>
<v Speaker 5>similar to mushrooms.</v>

687
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.740
<v Speaker 5>Mold grows and damp environments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fruit skin,</v>

688
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:18.151
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

689
00:31:18.151 --> 00:31:18.481
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

690
00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:18.821
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

691
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:20.200
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

692
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always been scared of mold</v>

693
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 5>fungus in general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so freaky freaky organism because it's</v>

694
00:31:29.111 --> 00:31:34.111
<v Speaker 5>not really a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A fungus actually breathes in oxygen and</v>

695
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 5>breathe out carbon dioxide and they say</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's closer to an animal that it is to a</v>

696
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 5>plant in like what it is like what kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a being it is.</v>

697
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.400
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very bizarre.</v>

698
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.650
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a magic mushrooms does to the brain.</v>

699
00:31:47.651 --> 00:31:50.350
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's definitely some stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>going on there.</v>

700
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

701
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what that feels like.</v>

702
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.350
<v Speaker 5>You're communicating with like a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you tap in through this</v>

703
00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:03.351
<v Speaker 5>organism to this matrix of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just like plant intelligence,</v>

704
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.460
<v Speaker 5>but the intelligence of the actual earth</v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

705
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.440
<v Speaker 5>It feels like almost like you're being</v>
<v Speaker 5>transmitted in a way where you can now</v>

706
00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:15.630
<v Speaker 5>understand all these things that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>around you all the time,</v>

707
00:32:15.631 --> 00:32:18.960
<v Speaker 5>but they're muted because he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just lacked the ability to perceive</v>

708
00:32:18.961 --> 00:32:20.280
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the earth itself.</v>

709
00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:22.080
<v Speaker 5>Like we walk around and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

710
00:32:22.081 --> 00:32:24.630
<v Speaker 5>so pretty today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but do you really.</v>

711
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.660
<v Speaker 5>You don't really feel what the earth is</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way you feel it when you're on</v>

712
00:32:29.791 --> 00:32:30.930
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're on mushrooms,</v>

713
00:32:30.931 --> 00:32:34.770
<v Speaker 5>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel the actual grass as like a type</v>

714
00:32:34.771 --> 00:32:36.810
<v Speaker 5>of an organism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a thing like this,</v>

715
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.240
<v Speaker 5>that grass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it stops like a couple of leaves and</v>

716
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:45.410
<v Speaker 5>some dirt and some it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it becomes instead this feeling</v>

717
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 5>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're connected to this like almost</v>

718
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

719
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.820
<v Speaker 5>like a circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

720
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:54.470
<v Speaker 5>like a biological circuit.</v>

721
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 5>That's what like a beautiful thick lawn</v>
<v Speaker 5>feels like when you're on mushrooms,</v>

722
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 5>like when you're standing in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel like you're connected to this</v>

723
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:05.340
<v Speaker 5>very strange life form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is what it is.</v>

724
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 5>That's not even a hallucinatory sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a feeling,</v>

725
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:14.531
<v Speaker 5>but I think pretty much everybody that</v>
<v Speaker 5>that does any sort of psychedelic plant</v>

726
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 5>based,</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic mushrooms,</v>

727
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.220
<v Speaker 5>animal base,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever you want,</v>

728
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.100
<v Speaker 5>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fungus based.</v>

729
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 5>You reach these weird places where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

730
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:25.190
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my talking to that thing that I eat,</v>

731
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:26.930
<v Speaker 5>that thing that thing's talking to me</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

732
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.240
<v Speaker 5>Like is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it communicating with me?</v>

733
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 5>Threw me digesting it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what's happening?</v>

734
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me go into some strange dimension</v>

735
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:35.624
<v Speaker 5>when I eat it.</v>

736
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.470
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss this year shroom fest.</v>

737
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.720
<v Speaker 2>That's normally the one time a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I do it.</v>

738
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.220
<v Speaker 2>We go out in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had like,</v>

739
00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I was on the road or something and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>miss it,</v>

740
00:33:44.771 --> 00:33:46.180
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm overdue for one.</v>

741
00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like it'll be so connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe and you feel it.</v>

742
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:50.703
<v Speaker 2>You feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.310
<v Speaker 2>you just try to remember what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you try to stay in that,</v>

744
00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.300
<v Speaker 2>but it goes away and it's amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like you're out in the desert or</v>

745
00:33:58.301 --> 00:34:01.570
<v Speaker 2>at least that's where I normally do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're looking at the rocks and the</v>

746
00:34:01.571 --> 00:34:06.571
<v Speaker 2>moon and the stars are just beaming out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you'll feel,</v>

747
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is lost in the universe has ever.</v>

748
00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you'll hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of your buddies Fart,</v>

749
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back and laughed for 20 minutes</v>

750
00:34:13.871 --> 00:34:14.704
<v Speaker 2>straight about it.</v>

751
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange life form.</v>

752
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Very strange thing that you take into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body that does that.</v>

753
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a gang of them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so weird.</v>

754
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know what's going on with</v>

756
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

757
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it crazy that it comes from cow</v>
<v Speaker 2>poop?</v>

758
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's where it grows,</v>

759
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.350
<v Speaker 1>but really come from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

763
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.400
<v Speaker 1>that manure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so rich for things to grow in</v>

764
00:34:47.401 --> 00:34:48.030
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 1>which I do the thing with my finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of fucking we need to</v>

766
00:34:56.251 --> 00:34:58.740
<v Speaker 1>grow these mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a manure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The leader of the real ghost busters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed him in the new movie.</v>

815
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.300
<v Speaker 1>The new ghostbusters movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill Bill Murray.</v>

816
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.710
<v Speaker 1>They can go kill themselves because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never watched it.</v>

817
00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.470
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really kill him.</v>

818
00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.340
<v Speaker 1>He's a skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

819
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

820
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.003
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

821
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what my point was about</v>

822
00:37:31.611 --> 00:37:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Asheville is that there were so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids getting high off mushrooms off of</v>

823
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.620
<v Speaker 1>these cows because they're up in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>farm area and it's raining all the time</v>

824
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:44.210
<v Speaker 1>and everything's wet as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lush and green and these mushrooms</v>

825
00:37:44.211 --> 00:37:49.211
<v Speaker 1>just grew like weeds everywhere and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so bad that they had to give the</v>

826
00:37:50.061 --> 00:37:55.040
<v Speaker 1>cows food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that special food that made their,</v>

827
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.970
<v Speaker 1>their manure so that the mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they did grow in them,</v>

828
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.440
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be potent.</v>

829
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't.</v>

830
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.230
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when we were in college would</v>

831
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:08.660
<v Speaker 1>go to certain places and get trash bags</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth of mushrooms because some areas</v>

832
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.840
<v Speaker 1>just because of the weather and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>farms and stuff like that,</v>

833
00:38:11.841 --> 00:38:16.250
<v Speaker 1>it just grew mushrooms like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be so careful though with</v>

834
00:38:16.251 --> 00:38:17.750
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you're taking,</v>

835
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.810
<v Speaker 1>like if you think it's one kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom,</v>

836
00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:24.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's another kind of mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some mushrooms that'll kill you</v>

837
00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:28.010
<v Speaker 1>in seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened recently on this old folks</v>

838
00:38:28.011 --> 00:38:28.791
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

839
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:31.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these old folks were hanging out and</v>

840
00:38:31.371 --> 00:38:34.350
<v Speaker 1>this lady went out and gathered up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some mushrooms should probably out</v>

841
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking head on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

842
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of Alzheimer's medicine or</v>

843
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 5>anything they give them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're in old folks homes,</v>

844
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will throw some pills down your</v>

845
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 5>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

846
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get to choose how fucked up you want</v>

<v Speaker 5>there picking mushrooms and just got a</v>

848

<v Speaker 5>gang of poison once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cooked them all up for everybody to.</v>

849
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:55.880
<v Speaker 5>Everybody died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

850
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.123
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 6>She cooked him at the old folks' home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brought them back.</v>

852
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She cooked him for the old folks at the</v>

853
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 6>old folks' home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just whack the whole crew.</v>

854
00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember how many people died,</v>

855
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 6>but it was more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you hear about all these people dying</v>

856
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 6>for elderly women die for people sick</v>
<v Speaker 6>and after eating white wild mushrooms.</v>

857
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So crazy shit here about all those</v>

858
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:21.940
<v Speaker 6>people dying from heroin overdoses</v>
<v Speaker 6>because there was a bad batch of heroin</v>

859
00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:26.870
<v Speaker 6>in like Ohio or something and like 41</v>
<v Speaker 6>people I've overdosed on like the same</v>

860
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 6>heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did hear about that.</v>

861
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.510
<v Speaker 6>I did hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

862
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:31.790
<v Speaker 5>you hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

863
00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 5>how do you say that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cross home.</v>

864
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.550
<v Speaker 5>How do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keratome k r a t o,</v>

865
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:37.510
<v Speaker 5>m.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you say it?</v>

866
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 5>Tony Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kratom.</v>

867
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 5>Maybe Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to say it.</v>

868
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.490
<v Speaker 5>I've never said it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've read about it a lot and uh,</v>

869
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a plant that helps people overcome</v>

870
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:54.901
<v Speaker 5>opioid addiction apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the FDA just moved into schedule one</v>

871
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:58.810
<v Speaker 5>or they're going to move it to schedule</v>
<v Speaker 5>one or the dea I should say.</v>

872
00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:00.190
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's the Dea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

873
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.900
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a plant</v>

874
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.150
<v Speaker 5>and apparently it helps a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have a heroin addiction problems</v>

875
00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 5>and opiate addiction problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even some people said it helps with</v>

876
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 5>a marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not marijuana,</v>

877
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:15.010
<v Speaker 5>but alcohol withdrawals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

878
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 5>alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they try to break free and get</v>

879
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 5>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This stuff can help with that too.</v>

880
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know enough about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

881
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have someone on to talk</v>

882
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:25.060
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>

883
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:28.040
<v Speaker 5>there's no need to make anything else</v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal like this,</v>

884
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:32.380
<v Speaker 5>this thing where they're doing what</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing is they're behaving like</v>

885
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:33.670
<v Speaker 5>an archaic society.</v>

886
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 5>They're not behaving like America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two Thousand and 16,</v>

887
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:41.050
<v Speaker 5>they're behaving like the people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>enacted the very first sweeping</v>

888
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.920
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic laws of 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're behaving like they behave.</v>

889
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:49.750
<v Speaker 5>If you've got this plant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Kratom or however you say it,</v>

890
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't have any history of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people like dropping dead from it,</v>

891
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 5>it's not like some threat to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>communities.</v>

892
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 5>It's not like this a terror that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweeping the streets and it's ruining</v>

893
00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:02.320
<v Speaker 5>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not hearing that.</v>

894
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 5>All I'm hearing is it helps people with</v>
<v Speaker 5>heroin addiction.</v>

895
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.810
<v Speaker 5>We all know how many people are addicted</v>
<v Speaker 5>to heroin,</v>

896
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.760
<v Speaker 5>so the fact that they just want to step</v>
<v Speaker 5>in and immediately not just make this</v>

897
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 5>like a schedule two or schedule three or</v>
<v Speaker 5>have some scientists come in and testify</v>

898
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:21.190
<v Speaker 5>about it and have some sort of public</v>
<v Speaker 5>hearings where they discuss the merits</v>

899
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:23.560
<v Speaker 5>of keeping this drug legal and should</v>
<v Speaker 5>this be regulated?</v>

900
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 5>Should it be prescribed by doctors like</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable adults would do if they</v>

901
00:41:26.621 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 5>actually gave a fuck about each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but instead they have these fucking</v>

902
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:36.930
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous amounts of power where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>could just step in and just make things</v>

903
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 5>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a ridiculous amount of power</v>

904
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to legislating what we can</v>
<v Speaker 5>and can't do with our bodies because</v>

905
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 5>it's not something anybody's voting on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kratom stuff.</v>

906
00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.890
<v Speaker 5>So for the dea to just step in and make</v>
<v Speaker 5>that schedule one,</v>

907
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.260
<v Speaker 5>it's blasphemy like what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>

908
00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 5>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's such an abuse of the function of</v>

909
00:41:58.251 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 5>the office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea of the office is you're</v>

910
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:03.430
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be protecting people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protect people from math,</v>

911
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 5>protect people from bad ship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't.</v>

912
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:10.490
<v Speaker 5>Don't let people come home to find their</v>
<v Speaker 5>children that have overdosed because</v>

913
00:42:10.491 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 5>someone gave them bath salts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

914
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what everybody wants from</v>

915
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 5>something like the dea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're so far reaching with their</v>

916
00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 5>efforts that they step into all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>areas where we know you're full of shit.</v>

917
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 5>Now you step in these areas like</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana or you're going to save people</v>

918
00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:30.770
<v Speaker 5>from pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Congratulations you fucking cock</v>

919
00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:31.990
<v Speaker 5>blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you gonna?</v>

920
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.680
<v Speaker 5>Do you're gonna say people from giggling</v>
<v Speaker 5>or eating yummy food or having a good</v>

921
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:37.680
<v Speaker 5>time with their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you going?</v>

922
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:38.630
<v Speaker 5>What are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you stopping?</v>

923
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 5>These are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not anything that we should</v>

924
00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not not anything we should ever asked</v>

925
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:47.830
<v Speaker 5>for from our leaders in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and definitely not anything we should</v>

926
00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:51.890
<v Speaker 5>ever tolerate for no reason whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason whatsoever why they</v>

927
00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:54.640
<v Speaker 5>would keep marijuana illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason whatsoever other,</v>

928
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.050
<v Speaker 5>whether it would make this kratom stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>scheduled ones.</v>

929
00:42:57.051 --> 00:42:58.640
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's money.</v>

930
00:42:58.850 --> 00:42:59.600
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

931
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.650
<v Speaker 5>It's a sure sign that it's a corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 5>system and if that,</v>

932
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:05.660
<v Speaker 5>if that kratom stuff helps with alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 5>withdrawals,</v>

933
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:10.661
<v Speaker 5>then you got to know that these big</v>
<v Speaker 5>companies would.</v>

934
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 5>Why wouldn't they pitched them some</v>
<v Speaker 5>money to be like,</v>

935
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:15.740
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lets you don't want me drinking.</v>

936
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.660
<v Speaker 5>Even if they didn't do it blatantly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if they didn't do a blatantly,</v>

937
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 5>if they're entangled with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can best believe that if you were</v>

938
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 5>entangled with some sort of an alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 5>company,</v>

939
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.920
<v Speaker 5>you're going to do your best to maximize</v>
<v Speaker 5>the profits of that alcohol company.</v>

940
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.540
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just the way it is.</v>

941
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:37.490
<v Speaker 5>If you're entangled with some donor to</v>
<v Speaker 5>some political campaign or some some</v>

942
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.780
<v Speaker 5>foundation that you run and they give</v>
<v Speaker 5>millions of dollars,</v>

943
00:43:41.781 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 5>like you guys have a little agreement</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on there.</v>

944
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to even say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to have it written down.</v>

945
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:50.300
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to be stupid about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's pretty obvious.</v>

946
00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 5>If someone gives you millions of bucks</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

947
00:43:52.761 --> 00:43:55.400
<v Speaker 5>you know you guys are how your guys are</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing business.</v>

948
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Something's happening here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're to do nice things for</v>

949
00:43:58.911 --> 00:44:02.780
<v Speaker 5>each other now and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where a lot of this shit comes</v>

950
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:05.690
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the fact that we,</v>

951
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.660
<v Speaker 5>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are supposed to be</v>

952
00:44:08.661 --> 00:44:13.661
<v Speaker 5>represented by these clowns can sit back</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just be frustrated and not do</v>

953
00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:16.340
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could vote for it when it comes up in</v>

954
00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 5>our states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but federally it's a giant issue.</v>

955
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:22.400
<v Speaker 5>Federally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>federally is the real problem because</v>

956
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of states now that made</v>
<v Speaker 5>it illegal including Washington dc.</v>

957
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.740
<v Speaker 5>It's a bunch of states that have made</v>
<v Speaker 5>pot legal there.</v>

958
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.331
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

959
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:31.990
<v Speaker 5>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't the science and Fit p?</v>

960
00:44:31.991 --> 00:44:34.920
<v Speaker 5>And then they start taxing it and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make unbelievable amounts of money</v>

961
00:44:34.921 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 5>and then they have massive research that</v>
<v Speaker 5>says in their economy like you're seeing</v>

962
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 5>in Colorado and now you're seeing in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seattle in Washington state as well.</v>

963
00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 5>What they're doing is they're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're being ironical like these.</v>

964
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:49.260
<v Speaker 5>These,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not like reasonable people</v>

965
00:44:49.261 --> 00:44:54.261
<v Speaker 5>acting in a reasonable way that they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>locking people up for a long time.</v>

966
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was this fucking thing the other</v>

967
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 5>day where they were comparing that kid</v>
<v Speaker 5>who raped the girl in.</v>

968
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 5>What University was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's got like a ridiculously short</v>

969
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 5>amount of time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

970
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:08.260
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a mic on Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stanford.</v>

971
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy.</v>

972
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 5>So they compared that guy to some poor</v>
<v Speaker 5>bastard that.</v>

973
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:20.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he got 30 years for growing pot.</v>

974
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that picture?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see it too?</v>

975
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 5>I think it was even longer than 30</v>
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>

976
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might've been.</v>

977
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.920
<v Speaker 5>It might've been like 30 to life or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

978
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 5>but it's just the idea that you would</v>
<v Speaker 5>lock that guy away for that long for</v>

979
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:37.950
<v Speaker 5>something so fucking innocuous will loan</v>
<v Speaker 5>book below the law.</v>

980
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.060
<v Speaker 5>It's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got a law and you don't want to break</v>

981
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:41.913
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

982
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 5>You took your consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're adults here.</v>

983
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 5>We're all adults.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These laws are stupid.</v>

984
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:50.010
<v Speaker 5>We're being handicapped by these ancient</v>
<v Speaker 5>systems,</v>

985
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.260
<v Speaker 5>these ancient systems of control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

986
00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 5>They're not valid anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't just lock people up for pot.</v>

987
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>

988
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 5>Lee.</v>

<v Speaker 5>served a life sentence in prison without</v>

990
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 5>parole for being caught growing three</v>
<v Speaker 5>dozen marijuana plants behind my son's</v>

00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:08.694
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm also promised that with good</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior that would be cut down to three</v>

996

<v Speaker 6>armed protestors outside of his house.</v>

1002
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.150

<v Speaker 6>don't do it on a pile of marijuana</v>

1003
00:46:35.151 --> 00:46:36.920
<v Speaker 6>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what we learned here.</v>

1004
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:40.710
<v Speaker 6>That'd be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Plus three months.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He thought he was taking a bath or</v>

1042
00:48:13.011 --> 00:48:15.020
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1043
00:48:15.021 --> 00:48:17.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're running a business and that</v>

1044
00:48:17.091 --> 00:48:18.920
<v Speaker 1>guy walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

1045
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:23.240
<v Speaker 1>They're super nice to him too because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's there every day just sleeping on</v>

1046
00:48:23.241 --> 00:48:24.830
<v Speaker 1>the bench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The homeless thing is weird,</v>

1047
00:48:24.831 --> 00:48:26.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because those are people.</v>

1048
00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:30.200
<v Speaker 1>They are people but goddamn they stink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1049
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's like when they're around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1050
00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.970
<v Speaker 1>they're reaching their hands out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you run into one of them cookie</v>

1051
00:48:34.971 --> 00:48:38.070
<v Speaker 1>homeless people that doesn't bathe ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

1052
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.750
<v Speaker 1>they have like those dirty caked feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're wandering around.</v>

1053
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.240
<v Speaker 1>What I see is like a mentally ill</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1054
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I see is like a failure of the</v>

1055
00:48:46.371 --> 00:48:49.280
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system or like how do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let this person wander around like</v>

1056
00:48:49.281 --> 00:48:51.050
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is like they're having</v>

1057
00:48:51.051 --> 00:48:54.380
<v Speaker 1>conversations with themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rummaging through their fucking shopping</v>

1058
00:48:54.381 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 1>cart.</v>

1059
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a very serious problem in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other day I saw something gross</v>

1060
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:01.330
<v Speaker 2>right in my neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right at my intersection,</v>

1061
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I saw a homeless lady sitting on a bus</v>
<v Speaker 2>bench and it looked like she was</v>

1062
00:49:07.391 --> 00:49:10.810
<v Speaker 2>wiggling her pants down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did and she's just sitting on the</v>

1063
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 2>bench and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has those greats.</v>

1064
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not just like a solid bench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes through and she paid just</v>

1065
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Speaker 2>through right through the greats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was nothing.</v>

1066
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Just p flying out of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1067
00:49:22.541 --> 00:49:26.860
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't stop watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden I'm just like,</v>

1068
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing because you're,</v>

1069
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at the amount of Pii</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's coming out of this human being.</v>

1070
00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.390
<v Speaker 2>This guy sad</v>

1071
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 1>because we just leave those people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I think this guy's a vet.</v>

1072
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what's even crazier that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought for us and now he can't get</v>

1073
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.980
<v Speaker 1>medical attention for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1074
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.530
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them you have to think probably</v>

1075
00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 1>just left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to deal with the</v>

1076
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to be medicated all the</v>

1077
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to stay in a loony bin.</v>

1078
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 1>But then there was like Rayon during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan administration that they let them</v>

1079
00:49:57.941 --> 00:50:00.820
<v Speaker 1>loose on the streets like zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed the,</v>

1080
00:50:00.821 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the standard of treatment,</v>

1081
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1082
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.040
<v Speaker 1>had to treat someone if they're x amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crazy like that,</v>

1083
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own crazy flux and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pushed them out into the street and</v>

1084
00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:12.280
<v Speaker 1>there was just an influx of homeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1085
00:50:12.281 --> 00:50:14.780
<v Speaker 1>You find them all over the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1086
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.080
<v Speaker 1>it was real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big problem.</v>

1087
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think San Francisco,</v>

1088
00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.740
<v Speaker 1>it was a big deal up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real big deal in places like</v>

1089
00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where homelessness is a big deal</v>

1090
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 1>because when they're out there they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking free solid.</v>

1091
00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 1>You can die out there.</v>

1092
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with Jeff Ross when he taped his</v>

1093
00:50:35.621 --> 00:50:40.180
<v Speaker 2>special roast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the police where we did ride alongs with</v>

1094
00:50:40.181 --> 00:50:45.181
<v Speaker 2>the Boston police department during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter and these cops,</v>

1095
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.680
<v Speaker 2>they know all the homeless people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single one of them and they show</v>

1096
00:50:49.681 --> 00:50:51.670
<v Speaker 2>genuine concern and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1097
00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.520
<v Speaker 2>that they have to go up to these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

1098
00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shelter,</v>

1099
00:50:55.421 --> 00:50:56.410
<v Speaker 2>it's open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1100
00:50:56.411 --> 00:50:58.810
<v Speaker 2>get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole thing.</v>

1101
00:50:59.100 --> 00:50:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1102
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.470
<v Speaker 2>that's actually during the winter time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of their main things,</v>

1103
00:51:02.471 --> 00:51:04.060
<v Speaker 2>and this is when all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1104
00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.580
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's been a cop shootings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this and that,</v>

1105
00:51:06.581 --> 00:51:09.190
<v Speaker 2>but their main concern for the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

1106
00:51:09.191 --> 00:51:13.810
<v Speaker 2>what we did on these ride alongs was</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell homeless people to get to the</v>

1107
00:51:13.811 --> 00:51:16.450
<v Speaker 2>shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to freeze.</v>

1108
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:20.050
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much what Boston cops are</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing during the winter unless there's a</v>

1109
00:51:20.051 --> 00:51:20.884
<v Speaker 2>crazy call.</v>

1110
00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a sad aspect of our society,</v>

1111
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 1>like the people that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just for whatever reason,</v>

1112
00:51:28.431 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a mental issue just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

1113
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.210
<v Speaker 1>There's just something that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>clicking in there.</v>

1114
00:51:32.211 --> 00:51:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then just wandering around through</v>

1115
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.990
<v Speaker 1>the streets and there's no one with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1116
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just living in this strange</v>

1117
00:51:38.631 --> 00:51:42.320
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder like what is reality to</v>

1118
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:42.890
<v Speaker 1>those people?</v>

1119
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I was just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wonder what they're thinking.</v>

1120
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes it seems like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>having so much fun.</v>

1121
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that Robin Williams</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

1122
00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Robin Williams played a crazy homeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that lives in central park and used</v>

1123
00:51:55.141 --> 00:51:57.010
<v Speaker 1>to think he was a night or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1124
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was that movie?</v>

1125
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:04.630
<v Speaker 1>It was like a mental illness movie was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie about a Fisher King.</v>

1126
00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:05.860
<v Speaker 1>The Fisher King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Robin Williams was completely out of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind</v>

1128
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.720
<v Speaker 1>and he played this really I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

1129
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.720
<v Speaker 1>if there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's the plot of the movie.</v>

1130
00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I hope we're not fucking it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the thing is that this guy</v>

1131
00:52:18.951 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 1>was seeing some things that just weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1132
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously when you see those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk to themselves or something</v>

1133
00:52:24.261 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 1>going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it's like the simpsons ride at</v>

1135
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:30.770
<v Speaker 1>universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything they see is like,</v>

1136
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1137
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I like to think that they're smarter</v>
<v Speaker 1>than us and they like talking to people</v>

1138
00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 1>that they can see that are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1139
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 1>but we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't figure it out.</v>

1140
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.320
<v Speaker 1>A former radio DJ suicidally despondent</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of terrible mistakes he made,</v>

1141
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 1>finds redemption in helping a deranged</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless man who was an unwitting victim</v>

1142
00:52:52.281 --> 00:52:53.880
<v Speaker 1>of that mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1143
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember much about this movie.</v>

1144
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Suicidally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despondent.</v>

1145
00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1146
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever written that a simpsons</v>

1147

<v Speaker 1>Drop everything I have with the shooting</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1152
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.200

1153
00:53:17.201 --> 00:53:19.480
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The car moves around a little bit left</v>

1154
00:53:19.481 --> 00:53:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything that's happening is</v>

1155
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:25.240
<v Speaker 1>happening on the screen in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the screen,</v>

1156
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.580

1157
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.990
<v Speaker 6>high def screen where you're in a first</v>
<v Speaker 6>person perspective and you know it's</v>

1162
00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 6>and it smells like when Maggie's on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>screen.</v>

1163
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.700
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the best rides ever.</v>

1164
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 4>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really surprised at the</v>

<v Speaker 4>I didn't like it.</v>

1168
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:57.320

<v Speaker 6>ride is really long.</v>

1178

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.880
<v Speaker 6>Did you talk about this George Carlin's</v>
<v Speaker 6>cd that are uh,</v>

1192
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 6>that he recorded the day before nine</v>
<v Speaker 6>slash 11?</v>

1193
00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:57.540
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you heard about this?</v>

1194
00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 6>He recorded a special the day before</v>
<v Speaker 6>nine slash 11.</v>

1195
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.630
<v Speaker 6>It was actually called.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I kinda like it when a lot of people</v>

1196
00:55:03.631 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 6>die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh No.</v>

1197
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:07.650
<v Speaker 6>And then the following day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nine slash 11 happened.</v>

1198
00:55:07.651 --> 00:55:12.120
<v Speaker 6>So they had to shelve it and I guess</v>
<v Speaker 6>even in it he talks about Osama bin</v>

1199
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.160
<v Speaker 6>Ladin Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit like that.</v>

1200
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 6>And so there were about to release it or</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just released it.</v>

1201
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.980
<v Speaker 6>They've held onto it this long is</v>
<v Speaker 6>because of nine slash 11.</v>

1202
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.573
<v Speaker 6>It's really creepy.</v>

1203
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.720
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of weird nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1204
00:55:23.721 --> 00:55:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I looked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found a couple yesterday actually it</v>

1205
00:55:26.871 --> 00:55:29.240
<v Speaker 2>was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a band that was called.</v>

1206
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.420
<v Speaker 2>We are the World Trade Center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the World Trade Center.</v>

1207
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It was like a synth pop band in April of</v>
<v Speaker 2>2001.</v>

1208
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.220
<v Speaker 2>They released a song again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of the band.</v>

1209
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:45.250
<v Speaker 2>We are the World Trade Center and track</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 on that album that came out in April.</v>

1210
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Track 11 was called September.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you look at their albums near</v>

1211
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.980
<v Speaker 2>the World Trade Center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 dot September,</v>

1212
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.570
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So insane.</v>

1213
00:55:56.571 --> 00:55:57.130
<v Speaker 2>And then there's</v>

1214
00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:57.963
<v Speaker 4>another thing.</v>

1215
00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Then there's another thing I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember which cartoon and it's either</v>

1216
00:56:01.421 --> 00:56:03.490
<v Speaker 2>like Futurama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is,</v>

1217
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's the craziest thing I saw in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time in one of these weird</v>

1218
00:56:07.301 --> 00:56:10.930
<v Speaker 2>cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a moment where it pans over</v>

1219
00:56:10.931 --> 00:56:13.840
<v Speaker 2>from them and there's a movie poster on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall and it.</v>

1220
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:16.960
<v Speaker 2>And this was before nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right before nine slash 11.</v>

1221
00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:21.340
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like a World Trade Center</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking like blatantly.</v>

1222
00:56:21.341 --> 00:56:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like a world trade center fire.</v>

1223
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.240
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1224
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 4>it says coming soon on the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a movie poster just says coming</v>

1225
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:34.210
<v Speaker 4>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're blatantly a world trade</v>

1226
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:37.780
<v Speaker 4>center smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the craziest thing I've seen in a</v>

1227
00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:38.700
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's either.</v>

1228
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:39.723
<v Speaker 4>Futurama,</v>

1229
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.150
<v Speaker 5>I think though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much content as people put out and</v>

1230
00:56:42.151 --> 00:56:45.330
<v Speaker 5>the World Trade Center was always these</v>
<v Speaker 5>iconic references.</v>

1231
00:56:45.331 --> 00:56:47.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was in a Biggie Song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1232
00:56:47.071 --> 00:56:49.050
<v Speaker 5>blow up like the world trade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cover.</v>

1234
00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those people did try to blow it up</v>

1235
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:54.900
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was it like 96 or something like that?</v>

1236
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.970
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they blew up that car bomb inside the</v>

1237
00:56:56.971 --> 00:57:00.120
<v Speaker 5>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it makes sense that somebody would</v>

1238
00:57:00.121 --> 00:57:02.250
<v Speaker 5>have caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that 11 and September,</v>

1239
00:57:02.251 --> 00:57:03.730
<v Speaker 5>that's bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.940
<v Speaker 5>That's some fucking premonition shit</v>

1241
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:09.980
<v Speaker 4>it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think they planned that?</v>

1242
00:57:09.981 --> 00:57:12.380
<v Speaker 4>Like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like knowing that nine slash 11 not but</v>

1243
00:57:12.381 --> 00:57:14.490
<v Speaker 4>like knowing that if we do it on nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>slash 11,</v>

1244
00:57:14.491 --> 00:57:17.120
<v Speaker 4>it's nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like emergency numbers,</v>

1245
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:18.620
<v Speaker 4>marketing one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was easier,</v>

1246
00:57:18.621 --> 00:57:20.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew it was going to be a bigger</v>

1247
00:57:20.031 --> 00:57:23.180
<v Speaker 4>deal because it's 9:11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine slash 11,</v>

1248
00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.160
<v Speaker 4>you know the maybe</v>

1249
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.430
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it would have happened in nine</v>

1250
00:57:28.431 --> 00:57:33.431
<v Speaker 5>slash 12 and been just as fucked up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>people find reasons to attach numbers in</v>

1251
00:57:34.761 --> 00:57:38.300
<v Speaker 5>meanings to things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's totally possible that they know</v>

1252
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.901
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1253
00:57:38.901 --> 00:57:41.000
<v Speaker 5>obviously they know nine slash 11 is for</v>
<v Speaker 5>emergency,</v>

1254
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:42.980
<v Speaker 5>that they did it on nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of that,</v>

1255
00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:45.020
<v Speaker 5>but would have made any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was nine,</v>

1256
00:57:45.021 --> 00:57:46.940
<v Speaker 5>nine or 9:10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

1257
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:50.930
<v Speaker 5>It was a devastating attack and tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other stuff is just like,</v>

1258
00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:51.710
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

1259
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:54.800
<v Speaker 4>If they did it on July 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven slash 11 would have gone out of</v>

1260
00:57:54.801 --> 00:57:56.870
<v Speaker 4>business everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven.</v>

1261
00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were you going with that?</v>

1262
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.460
<v Speaker 4>If there's going to be more to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

1263
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 4>But like thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about people for seven,</v>

1264
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 4>11 July fourth will be a big smack in</v>
<v Speaker 4>our face and march would be really good</v>

1265
00:58:07.891 --> 00:58:10.460
<v Speaker 4>if it was March 11th at 3:11.</v>

1266
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1267
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.320
<v Speaker 4>that band?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 4>They make good weed pens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1269
00:58:15.881 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just one of the first people to smoke</v>

1270
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 4>the prototype last year on the 3:11</v>
<v Speaker 4>crews with peanut.</v>

1271
00:58:20.681 --> 00:58:22.120
<v Speaker 4>The Bass player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How strong is that,</v>

1272
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Ben?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make their own weed pens.</v>

1273
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 4>It's a very strong move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the coolest man.</v>

1274
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:29.170
<v Speaker 4>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they've always been ahead of the</v>

1275
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:30.580
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Live show.</v>

1276
00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.450
<v Speaker 4>It's because they're all generic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1277
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 4>like Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1278
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.400
<v Speaker 4>models.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyone can make their own weed pen by</v>

1279
00:58:36.401 --> 00:58:39.040
<v Speaker 4>just putting a logo on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can buy them in bulk.</v>

1280
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen all the same.</v>

1281
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:42.730
<v Speaker 4>We'd pins you can go to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this website you can buy like</v>

1282
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 4>300 of them and they'll even like put a</v>
<v Speaker 4>logo on it for you.</v>

1283
00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:47.520
<v Speaker 4>So it looks like your we'd pin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were red.</v>

1284
00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:49.290
<v Speaker 4>They were really hands on with this one</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1285
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:53.830
<v Speaker 4>This they like tried out a ton of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know because he told us all about it</v>

1286
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:57.650
<v Speaker 5>but that would just be like the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they tried out a ton of canisters to.</v>

1287
00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.320
<v Speaker 4>I just know that it took them like they</v>
<v Speaker 4>should,</v>

1288
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:04.020
<v Speaker 4>like they went through a long process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So probably both.</v>

1289
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:07.760
<v Speaker 4>It's good stuff comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A highly approved.</v>

1290
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.840
<v Speaker 4>You try the orange one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what one I tried.</v>

1291
00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:13.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what I remember is it tasted like</v>
<v Speaker 4>an actual orange and got me correct.</v>

1292
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:14.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No that's good stuff.</v>

1293
00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 4>Atheist's nightmare acs night man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this.</v>

1294
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Well it</v>

1295
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.040
<v Speaker 1>is intelligent design though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody made it there.</v>

1296
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those bands also.</v>

1297
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of band is three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1298
00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1299
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.620
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 is really their own type of thing</v>

1300
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 2>because it's like ray gay mixed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy rock,</v>

1301
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 2>like they go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's,</v>

1302
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:42.470
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'll just forget that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're about to like drop.</v>

1303
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Like they have killer guitarist and high</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

1304
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:49.370
<v Speaker 2>They have two lead singers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one guy with a really smooth voice and</v>

1305
00:59:49.371 --> 00:59:52.770
<v Speaker 2>the other guys sorta like a rapper do</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this while they're high.</v>

1306
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:53.803
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1307
00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd imagine so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also like,</v>

1308
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a lot of those guys have</v>

1309
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 2>families now and stuff and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might calm down a little bit,</v>

1310
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to get stoned.</v>

1311
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I used to like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard anything from them in a</v>

1312
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:09.800
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they made a greatest hits album way</v>

1313
01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:12.680
<v Speaker 2>back in like 98 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1314
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 2>that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are notorious for being one of the</v>

1315
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:21.821
<v Speaker 2>best live bands to see if there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole cruise ship with them.</v>

1316
01:00:22.311 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1317
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.790
<v Speaker 2>It was the coolest thing I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thought it was about,</v>

1318
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually five days.</v>

1319
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I did two shows and I was like shaky</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it because this was back when like</v>

1320
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.580
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like toilets exploded on that one cruise</v>

1321
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:35.690
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody died.</v>

1322
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is freaking out.</v>

1323
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:38.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

1324
01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>one where the guy was trying to wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His girlfriend came around with the boat</v>

1325
01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1326
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>hit the ground and killed like a ton of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1327
01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of people.</v>

1328
01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about carnival one that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1331
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.030

<v Speaker 2>That happened right around then and I'm</v>

1332
01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:53.631
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But I knew three slash 11 was an awesome</v>

1334
01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 2>life band like I did out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them actually quite a few</v>

1335
01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:01.100
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in high school and stuff,</v>

1336
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:01.953
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a railing</v>

1337
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>below that railing is the ocean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going 50 miles an hour.</v>

1338
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

1339
01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.060
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

1340
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I had so much fun because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>performing on the main deck.</v>

1341
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Fun cruises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1342
01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Fuck cruises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me what it was like.</v>

1343
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.520
<v Speaker 2>It was the greatest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back from that five day cruise</v>

1344
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:24.521
<v Speaker 2>and got everything in my life done like</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy because it's so.</v>

1345
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:30.430
<v Speaker 2>It's literally perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to Jamaica on the most boring part</v>

1346
01:01:30.431 --> 01:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>of the whole trip was the half a day we</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent in Jamaica before getting back on</v>

1347
01:01:34.211 --> 01:01:36.160
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stepped on some needle.</v>

1348
01:01:36.161 --> 01:01:38.620
<v Speaker 2>These sponge in the ocean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sucks.</v>

1349
01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Get back on this luxury cruise ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of shows going on.</v>

1350
01:01:42.221 --> 01:01:45.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a casino you can get away to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your room if you want to disappear.</v>

1351
01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:49.480
<v Speaker 2>It's really a thousand times better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to be.</v>

1352
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.170
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't like Jamaica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's now</v>

1353
01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:55.391
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1354
01:01:55.391 --> 01:01:58.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'll go ahead and try the chicken.</v>

1355
01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.540
<v Speaker 2>It was like just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's cooking and it's just dirty.</v>

1356
01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:05.230
<v Speaker 2>There's bees everywhere in nature like</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks,</v>

1357
01:02:05.231 --> 01:02:07.830
<v Speaker 2>but cruise ships are great because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fake name.</v>

1358
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Going 50 miles an hour with Caribbean</v>
<v Speaker 2>era around you is perfect.</v>

1359
01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the perfect life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>being in the ocean.</v>

1382

<v Speaker 1>If you have a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no road.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have to go here.</v>

1384
01:03:08.571 --> 01:03:11.210
<v Speaker 1>You have to take a right there and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the 1:10 to the 18th.</v>

1385
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:12.241
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1386
01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:14.000

<v Speaker 1>What do you want to go?</v>

1387
01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>You want to go to Catalina?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to Catalina.</v>

1388
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.690
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life under there.</v>

1389
01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:19.830
<v Speaker 4>You throw a fishing pole out to catch</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1390
01:03:19.831 --> 01:03:22.350
<v Speaker 4>You throw it on the grill right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just scan it.</v>

1391
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.830
<v Speaker 4>Pam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't even have to get up or down.</v>

1392
01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're finding out that a lot of those</v>

1393
01:03:28.121 --> 01:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>tropical fish are making their ways into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waters around southern California</v>

1394
01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>because of the global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're having like yellowfin tuna or</v>

1395
01:03:36.431 --> 01:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>all over southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water's.</v>

1396
01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>We used to have to go to like Hawaii to</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch those things so we can catch them</v>

1397
01:03:41.621 --> 01:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>right here now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

1398
01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Getting your boats on.</v>

1399
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.230
<v Speaker 4>Then the cruise ship thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you.</v>

1400
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a whole thing,</v>

1401
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.630
<v Speaker 4>but what if someone's really annoying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just fall.</v>

1402
01:03:52.631 --> 01:03:54.380
<v Speaker 4>You were on that cruise ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't happen.</v>

1403
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:56.000
<v Speaker 4>Stuck on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't happen now.</v>

1404
01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.800
<v Speaker 4>You can lose them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could lose him.</v>

1405
01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Did you have a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to understand how huge this is.</v>

1406
01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:03.890
<v Speaker 4>Like a mall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a small city.</v>

1407
01:04:03.891 --> 01:04:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a giant mall or a small city.</v>

1408
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:11.210
<v Speaker 4>How long does it take to walk around?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was also like six or seven floors.</v>

1409
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.820
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So boom,</v>

1410
01:04:12.821 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

1411
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's all like a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost like a Vegas hotel.</v>

1412
01:04:16.761 --> 01:04:18.410
<v Speaker 4>It's floating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's like.</v>

1413
01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:20.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like a vegas style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge hotel.</v>

1414
01:04:20.811 --> 01:04:24.290
<v Speaker 4>Like how the mgms connected to the New</v>
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>

1415
01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:28.370
<v Speaker 4>New York or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like super duper huge and the main</v>

1416
01:04:28.371 --> 01:04:30.650
<v Speaker 4>deck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're doing shows at nighttime</v>

1417
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.040
<v Speaker 4>and it is unbelievable going to a normal</v>
<v Speaker 4>concert where you're just not moving</v>

1418
01:04:36.711 --> 01:04:37.790
<v Speaker 4>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like,</v>

1419
01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm missing something here.</v>

1420
01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>They must have cruises that go</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully every day to their</v>

1421
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smooth.</v>

1422
01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has a great experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no issues whatsoever.</v>

1423
01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it takes is one poopy mistakes.</v>

1424
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>There's one dude who wants a wave at his</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and beaches the boat and</v>

1425
01:04:58.211 --> 01:05:03.211
<v Speaker 1>drowned a bunch of people or one husband</v>
<v Speaker 1>who throws his wife over the side to</v>

1426
01:05:04.421 --> 01:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>hear about that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who through his wife</v>

1427
01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:12.901
<v Speaker 1>over the side like newlyweds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some fucking creepy people out</v>

1428
01:05:14.021 --> 01:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1429
01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a cruise ship website like</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruise ship reports.org</v>

1430
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.530
<v Speaker 6>or something like that and it tells you</v>
<v Speaker 6>every time there's a problem with a</v>

1431
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:22.990
<v Speaker 6>cruise ship and it's shocking how many</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are.</v>

1432
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 6>There's like problems all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1433
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:28.630
<v Speaker 6>and it shows how many people died and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff and why and how and how often do</v>

1434
01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:31.120
<v Speaker 6>people die from cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crazy shit happens on cruise.</v>

1435
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:32.380
<v Speaker 6>Like you sold the elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1436
01:05:32.381 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 6>The guy that got stuck in the elevator</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it started dripping down blood of</v>

1437
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:40.060
<v Speaker 6>his body because he got crushed on the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the cruise ship in a couple months</v>

1438
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.470
<v Speaker 6>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dripping down black.</v>

1439
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 6>This guy working on an elevator and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>elevator crushed them.</v>

1440
01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 6>And so he was working on the elevator</v>
<v Speaker 6>and went up to the top and then.</v>

1441
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:51.970
<v Speaker 6>So there's video of just blood gushing</v>
<v Speaker 6>down the elevator door and people are</v>

1442
01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:53.110
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the heck is that?</v>

1443
01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 6>And it's just blood like it looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>horror movie.</v>

1444
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1445
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:58.540
<v Speaker 6>But there's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1446
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.790
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck it.</v>

1447
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's on the video.</v>

1448
01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:02.550
<v Speaker 6>You got to see that.</v>

1449
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:05.530
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sets a weird way to go though.</v>

1450
01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Get squashed in an elevator.</v>

1451
01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 6>This is why I don't work on elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People ask me all the time,</v>

1452
01:06:13.821 --> 01:06:15.410
<v Speaker 6>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have a problem with the elevator.</v>

1453
01:06:15.411 --> 01:06:16.790
<v Speaker 6>Can you get on top of it and fix it?</v>

1454
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Innovator before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1455
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a little kid.</v>

1456
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1457
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like seven years old,</v>

1458
01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:23.830
<v Speaker 1>but have only 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.870
<v Speaker 1>like probably blew a fuse or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1460
01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York recently at one of the</v>

1461
01:06:29.951 --> 01:06:32.950
<v Speaker 1>theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the beacon and they have</v>

1462
01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:35.590
<v Speaker 1>this dude who runs the elevator back</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1463
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with you.</v>

1464
01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:38.530
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that the guy had like the</v>

1465
01:06:38.531 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 1>handle and the exchanging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like old school.</v>

1466
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>The old school elevator where you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have an operator is like you.</v>

1467
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.490
<v Speaker 1>There's no buttons to press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy had to get you up and down.</v>

1468
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.010
<v Speaker 1>So it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be saved from the 19 twenties</v>

1469
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1470
01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.620
<v Speaker 1>it might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1471
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:56.790
<v Speaker 1>What's that might have been before that</v>
<v Speaker 1>net total.</v>

1472
01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>29.</v>

1473
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1474
01:06:58.151 --> 01:06:59.440
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a video of the dude.</v>

1475
01:06:59.441 --> 01:07:01.510
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that brother Jose?</v>

1476
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a old elevator.</v>

1477
01:07:06.081 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>We're in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long has this kind of elevator been</v>

1478
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.510
<v Speaker 1>here for 20 night.</v>

1479
01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:15.881
<v Speaker 1>I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1480
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:19.930
<v Speaker 1>it was the old ones on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only get 15 seconds or 30</v>

1481
01:07:19.931 --> 01:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>seconds or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1482
01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>but that dude was operating that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you had.</v>

1483
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:30.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a little lever to pull up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull down bad ass hold elevator,</v>

1484
01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure they fix it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1485
01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.040
<v Speaker 1>This thing up to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always.</v>

1486
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always that thing on the inside.</v>

1487
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>That was in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an elevator from the 1800,</v>

1488
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>the hotel at a 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of elevator.</v>

1489
01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super weird.</v>

1490
01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>There's old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys shut the door and shut the door</v>

1491
01:07:48.861 --> 01:07:50.590
<v Speaker 1>and get to get inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll still work,</v>

1492
01:07:50.591 --> 01:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just leave the door open.</v>

1493
01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just door open and grab the</v>

1494
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 1>floor as you're passing and rip your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking arms off.</v>

1495
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>He could do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at like how many people</v>

1496
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 1>died from elevators versus how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have died from coconuts.</v>

1497
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.100
<v Speaker 1>You'd be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's scared of coconuts,</v>

1498
01:08:09.101 --> 01:08:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but coconuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up about 150 people here should</v>

1499
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1500
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>do you know when people die deer every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year?</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 in the United States.</v>

1502
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.570

<v Speaker 1>Every year you're driving down the road</v>

1504
01:08:28.221 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>listening to led Zeppelin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you hit this stupid fucking county</v>

1505
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>forest horse and it goes flying through</v>
<v Speaker 1>your windshield and kicks your brains</v>

1506
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:37.904
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1507
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred people a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people do you think die on</v>

1508
01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:47.010
<v Speaker 1>average in elevators per year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know pretty in the US.</v>

1512
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 6 million elevators every year in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

1513

<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many die from coconuts?</v>

1514
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.060

<v Speaker 1>I think so worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say worldwide.</v>

1516
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 1>More than 100 people a year die from</v>
<v Speaker 1>coconuts.</v>

1517
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Coconuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coconuts falling on their head.</v>

1518
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Not Allergy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skin jacked.</v>

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.220
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1522
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if it was all in Jakarta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Jakarta,</v>

1523
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:26.170
<v Speaker 1>coconuts and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking home from school with your</v>

1524
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:31.010
<v Speaker 1>buddies to have them die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just a chest an embarrassing way to</v>

1525
01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:31.844
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1526
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1527
01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>that Husky sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things clobbering you on the head</v>

1528
01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.170
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you hear is your friends</v>

1529
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:44.630
<v Speaker 1>laughing at you because that's probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they figured out.</v>

1530
01:09:44.631 --> 01:09:47.270
<v Speaker 1>The coconuts were edible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It killed someone's friend.</v>

1531
01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Someone freaked out and hit it with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock and went,</v>

1532
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.300
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

1533
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:54.730
<v Speaker 1>This is some shit in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I killed my friend back then you are</v>

1534
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:57.380
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know that a coconut wasn't</v>

1535
01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:59.090
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something came out of the sky and</v>

1536
01:09:59.091 --> 01:10:02.000
<v Speaker 1>killed your friend and you know you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>so stupid that you didn't even have</v>

1537
01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:04.280
<v Speaker 1>clothes yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the first people that</v>

1538
01:10:04.281 --> 01:10:08.120
<v Speaker 1>figured out they could eat coconuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like the first balls,</v>

1539
01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:08.954
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fruits.</v>

1540
01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Mike probably sort of just hearing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They realized they could play soccer and</v>

1541
01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 1>stuff for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

1542
01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1543
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:19.610
<v Speaker 5>I saw a demonstration of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've showed demonstrations that lie</v>

1544
01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:22.820
<v Speaker 5>next stuff before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this was the most ridiculous one lie</v>

1545
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:27.360
<v Speaker 5>next is this plastic stuff that they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>spray on things and they sprayed on like</v>

1546
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:30.060
<v Speaker 5>the undercarriages of some trucks and</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1547
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.910
<v Speaker 5>like four wheelers that go out into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

1548
01:10:32.911 --> 01:10:34.830
<v Speaker 5>You know those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those dudes do those four.</v>

1549
01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.920
<v Speaker 5>We'll crawl fucking things and smashed</v>
<v Speaker 5>up against rocks.</v>

1550
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:39.960
<v Speaker 5>They'll lie next to their whole truck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll.</v>

1551
01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.910
<v Speaker 5>That'll be the paint for the outside of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1552
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they took a watermelon.</v>

1553
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.060
<v Speaker 5>They sprayed a watermelon with lynette</v>
<v Speaker 5>and dropped it off of like,</v>

1554
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:53.070
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like from 450 feet up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the brick one.</v>

1555
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.890
<v Speaker 5>This is when we've already seen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this one's kind of fascinating to</v>

1556
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:58.830
<v Speaker 5>like check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like just show how they did it before.</v>

1557
01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.920
<v Speaker 5>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they drop this brick off the top of the</v>

1558
01:11:01.921 --> 01:11:06.921
<v Speaker 5>building now and without the Linacs oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>

1559
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.220
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when they shot the walls,</v>

1560
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.340
<v Speaker 5>the watermelon video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a bunch of shit before it.</v>

1561
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:12.910
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it the watermelon woman?</v>

1562
01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

1563
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 5>There.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

1564
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Trying to find it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there,</v>

1565
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1566
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>there's one of them where they're on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tower.</v>

1567
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>The tower one is a watermelon one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a different one.</v>

1568
01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same video.</v>

1569
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.183
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take all of these are in there.</v>

1571
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a different one because this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's red,</v>

1572
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess they just couldn't hit it</v>

1573
01:11:35.431 --> 01:11:38.280
<v Speaker 1>with a hammer here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sprayed this shit on a watermelon,</v>

1574
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but the watermelon just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like hitting it with a hammer.</v>

1575
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just bouncing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not as impressive.</v>

1576
01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Cv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could find the one where they</v>

1577
01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:47.370
<v Speaker 1>dropped the watermelon off the tower</v>
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>

1578
01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watermelon,</v>

1579
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:51.630
<v Speaker 1>450 feet drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they threw this watermelon off</v>

1580
01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:55.600
<v Speaker 1>the tower without the line x and it hits</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street and literally vaporizes just.</v>

1581
01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>They hit it.</v>

1582
01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 1>The throw the [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hits the ground.</v>

1583
01:11:59.851 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 1>It bounces 10 feet in the air that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of it was just watermelon juice.</v>

1584
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 1>It just became watermelon juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this stuff is so tough.</v>

1585
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:11.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just some weird freaky plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fun to like Prank Gallagher</v>

1586
01:12:11.221 --> 01:12:15.360
<v Speaker 1>before he goes onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sprays water break is back,</v>

1587
01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:18.390
<v Speaker 1>open its arms would literally fly off</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

1588
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:20.930
<v Speaker 1>So you can you buy this consumer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1589
01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:23.130

<v Speaker 1>where they spray trucks with this stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>are going to drive in the woods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>branches are going to smack up against</v>

1594
01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 1>it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just spray their whole truck with</v>

1595
01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:40.050
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It hits the ground.</v>

1612
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1613
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now can you cut into it like is it</v>

1614
01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:39.090
<v Speaker 1>possible to get to that watermelon now</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it like,</v>

1615
01:13:39.091 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can cut it into,</v>

1616
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 1>but look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how hits the ground.</v>

1617
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like a medicine ball,</v>

1618
01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.250
<v Speaker 1>like someone threw a medicine ball.</v>

1619
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 1>What about bullet versus that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1620
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:53.070
<v Speaker 1>No bullet would go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just it has a unique ability to</v>

1621
01:13:53.071 --> 01:13:56.670
<v Speaker 1>disperse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shock and rebound and not break open.</v>

1622
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.950
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you find those trucks,</v>

1623
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Dev Rolo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called.</v>

1624
01:14:00.391 --> 01:14:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like some Russian company</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1625
01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:07.371
<v Speaker 1>They make these souped up cars that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in this shit about a lot of</v>

1626
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 1>companies do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess cover business line shit to</v>

1627
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 1>protect it from accidents then yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would definitely protect you more</v>

1628
01:14:14.921 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>from accidents and not having it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1629
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It would definitely make it harder for</v>
<v Speaker 1>an impact to get,</v>

1630
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if your.</v>

1631
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.200
<v Speaker 1>If your car has a certain thickness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>steel on the door and you had double</v>

1632
01:14:27.911 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 1>that thickness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just assume there'll be safer.</v>

1633
01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that make sense?</v>

1634
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:36.350
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes you wonder like if it caves in</v>

1635
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:39.440
<v Speaker 6>then that also absorbs a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>energy.</v>

1636
01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:42.890
<v Speaker 6>But if you have bounced off it seems</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there'd be more snapping.</v>

1637
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:44.703
<v Speaker 6>Snapping.</v>

1638
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the snapping to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrating.</v>

1639
01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.340
<v Speaker 1>That's how you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body gets crushed by a truck</v>

1640
01:14:50.341 --> 01:14:52.290
<v Speaker 1>hitting you on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1641
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a combination of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1642
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I'm</v>

1643
01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.250
<v Speaker 1>just make sense that if it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thicker,</v>

1644
01:14:59.251 --> 01:15:01.530
<v Speaker 1>stronger material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you were driving around in a</v>

1645
01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:03.240
<v Speaker 1>tissue paper car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel real nervous.</v>

1646
01:15:03.241 --> 01:15:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to reason that if you</v>

1647
01:15:05.401 --> 01:15:07.320
<v Speaker 1>would get thicker and thicker gauge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal,</v>

1648
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:11.520
<v Speaker 1>so if you took like a regular gauge</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal that they have on like a Chevy</v>

1649
01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Silverado or something like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>spray this line,</v>

1650
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:15.570
<v Speaker 1>x shit over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has got to make it stronger.</v>

1651
01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:20.340
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's what it does with a watermelon</v>

1652
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:21.870
<v Speaker 1>off a 450 foot tower,</v>

1653
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.320
<v Speaker 6>what was you remember Saturn's where you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can scratch them.</v>

1654
01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:29.230
<v Speaker 6>You could kick them and they never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were made out of plastic.</v>

1655
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:33.730
<v Speaker 6>Is that plastic?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wouldn't that be like a safety hazard</v>

1656
01:15:33.731 --> 01:15:35.660
<v Speaker 6>then if it was plastic?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1657
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because as long as it's</v>

1658
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:39.830
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like plastics can be really fucking</v>

1659
01:15:39.831 --> 01:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's certain types of plastics,</v>

1660
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:47.350
<v Speaker 1>like certain types of composite fibers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that elect technically plastics that are</v>

1661
01:15:47.601 --> 01:15:51.290
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they use resins and they have these</v>

1662
01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.510
<v Speaker 1>types of plastics that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:57.260
<v Speaker 1>they can make plastic where you can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plastic knife.</v>

1664
01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:01.250
<v Speaker 1>We could kill somebody with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean plastic can be really hard.</v>

1665
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.350
<v Speaker 6>That's why it's such a good feature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That car,</v>

1666
01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:07.160
<v Speaker 6>I loved my Saturn and when I sold it it</v>
<v Speaker 6>was like 12 years old and it looked like</v>

1667
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.580
<v Speaker 6>the day I bought it or like brand new</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it didn't scratch her.</v>

1668
01:16:10.581 --> 01:16:12.650
<v Speaker 6>Did they make those anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now they went out of business,</v>

1669
01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:16.340
<v Speaker 6>but that technology that you think they</v>
<v Speaker 6>would use it in other cars are and it's</v>

1670
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:20.210
<v Speaker 6>probably not gonna last.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think cars want to break and go get</v>

1671
01:16:20.211 --> 01:16:22.220
<v Speaker 6>more parts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like gms are like,</v>

1672
01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.470
<v Speaker 6>they like that thick at these trials.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a pocket</v>

1673
01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.670
<v Speaker 1>immobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1674
01:16:26.671 --> 01:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>That looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing insane.</v>

1675
01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:31.920
<v Speaker 1>One Mile per gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Click on one of the pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like the interceptor,</v>

1677
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.770
<v Speaker 1>the challenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expedition.</v>

1678
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all that stuff is linacs there.</v>

1679
01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.500
<v Speaker 1>The entire outside of the truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bumpers.</v>

1680
01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything is covered in that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>X Shit does it God damn tank.</v>

1681
01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.900
<v Speaker 1>That thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a little Dick.</v>

1682
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:53.790
<v Speaker 1>That's your ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1683
01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to distract you.</v>

1684
01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Like bullet bullet tests on it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1685
01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.750
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will they do have bulletproof versions</v>

1686
01:17:00.751 --> 01:17:02.760
<v Speaker 1>of the car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that stuff is</v>

1687
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:04.350
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would doubt that it is,</v>

1688
01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:08.460
<v Speaker 1>but I would say it's definitely better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than not having it on,</v>

1689
01:17:08.461 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>but look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So manly.</v>

1690
01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got you to Ben and Kevin prayers.</v>

1691
01:17:12.111 --> 01:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Auto drive car the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1692
01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 1>the Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took you froze.</v>

1693
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool man.</v>

1694
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:16.990
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that.</v>

1695
01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he did it,</v>

1696
01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:22.910
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to trust that like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird him just like letting go.</v>

1697
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:25.820
<v Speaker 1>And he said when he first bought it he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really scared and nervous,</v>

1698
01:17:25.821 --> 01:17:26.830
<v Speaker 1>but now he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1699
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.270
<v Speaker 1>laptop out like doing shit you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing.</v>

1700
01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I watched it like detect the,</v>

1701
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the side car and stuff like that.</v>

1702
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It slowed down</v>

1703
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.440
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy that designed the self driving</v>

1704
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 4>car was Asian and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1705
01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:45.110
<v Speaker 4>how do you know his age limit Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Asian computer people.</v>

1706
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 4>This is a bad attempt at some racist</v>
<v Speaker 4>humor and I'm not going to get.</v>

1707
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:53.990
<v Speaker 4>I can guarantee you the person that find</v>
<v Speaker 4>it engineered the self driving cars and</v>

1708
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Asian.</v>

1709
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:55.450
<v Speaker 1>If you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to suck.</v>

1710
01:17:55.451 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Brian Cochran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show him.</v>

1711
01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a couple of strokes in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

1712
01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the donkey cousin.</v>

1713
01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:08.311
<v Speaker 1>Just real quick little but the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the figure wrong that the IPAD or</v>

1714
01:18:08.981 --> 01:18:10.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the display and stuff.</v>

1715
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Crazy screen sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does it well,</v>

1716
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I would think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would use up a lot of juice.</v>

1717
01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you have such a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen?</v>

1718
01:18:17.981 --> 01:18:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if you have a true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:21.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1720
01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about the fast charging</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we always talked about this in</v>

1721
01:18:23.621 --> 01:18:26.260
<v Speaker 1>the past about how like you can't drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to vegas though,</v>

1722
01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:29.200
<v Speaker 1>where they also have a stop in Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you plug it in for five minutes and</v>

1723
01:18:29.201 --> 01:18:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you get like two more hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's his effect though.</v>

1724
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:33.760
<v Speaker 1>What was the last time you drove to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas?</v>

1725
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove up for the fight.</v>

1726
01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:39.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the five months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always drive.</v>

1727
01:18:39.371 --> 01:18:40.570
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cheap.</v>

1728
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cheap,</v>

1729
01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but don't you get annoyed being in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car for four hours now.</v>

1730
01:18:45.281 --> 01:18:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to four hours of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and pete smoke jolene wholly on like,</v>

1731
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:51.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you were driving back</v>
<v Speaker 1>though when you were in that Vegas</v>

1732
01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:53.530
<v Speaker 1>traffic on the way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

1733
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just owned you.</v>

1734
01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're stuck though.</v>

1735
01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It's two lanes for 400 miles to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the stop.</v>

1736
01:19:04.331 --> 01:19:06.070
<v Speaker 1>You'd be three hours away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>

1737
01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1738
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not just one thing.</v>

1739
01:19:12.521 --> 01:19:14.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got a really good point.</v>

1740
01:19:14.471 --> 01:19:17.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're stuck in that crazy vegas</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic coming home,</v>

1741
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you know how ridiculous I traffic is</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic that makes you wake up at 4:00</v>

1742
01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:22.820
<v Speaker 1>in the morning just to avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1743
01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it once and I barely made it</v>

1744
01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.420
<v Speaker 1>because I left at 7:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1745
01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get up before everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1746
01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.130
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are already up and driving at</v>

1747
01:19:33.131 --> 01:19:33.964
<v Speaker 1>7:30.</v>

1748
01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:37.910
<v Speaker 4>It messed me up last week and coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>back from Mcgregor Diaz because they're</v>

1749
01:19:37.911 --> 01:19:39.740
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta gotta gotTa beat the traffic.</v>

1750
01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:40.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1751
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.480
<v Speaker 4>If we get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1752
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.910
<v Speaker 4>I ended up missing the summer slam</v>
<v Speaker 4>party.</v>

1753
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.610
<v Speaker 4>I Miss Summer Slam last week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was huge.</v>

1754
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Poor baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take you to drive home?</v>

1755
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:51.650
<v Speaker 1>It was like six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven hours,</v>

1756
01:19:51.651 --> 01:19:53.030
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1757
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.460
<v Speaker 1>that is fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never been caught in that.</v>

1758
01:19:56.461 --> 01:19:59.310
<v Speaker 1>So ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had a gasoline,</v>

1759
01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.060
<v Speaker 1>like a buddy of mine has a 50 gallon</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank in his truck.</v>

1760
01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Fifty gallons so he could just drive it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fills that bitch up</v>

1761
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 5>and just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it gets shitty gas mileage.</v>

1762
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:12.870
<v Speaker 5>There's a catch 22 because you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>packing around all that weight,</v>

1763
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.620
<v Speaker 5>but if he's driving from vegas he</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have to pull over.</v>

1764
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like the opposite of a tesla.</v>

1765
01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried like my car's dead right now and</v>

1766
01:20:22.441 --> 01:20:26.610
<v Speaker 6>I tried to jump start my car with my</v>
<v Speaker 6>girlfriend's car,</v>

1767
01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:29.220
<v Speaker 6>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a Prius Prius and he can't do that.</v>

1768
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:32.940
<v Speaker 6>It was the second little 12 volt battery</v>
<v Speaker 6>inside those cars.</v>

1769
01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not a regular it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't do it.</v>

1770
01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 6>It says in the book do not do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could just destroy this car.</v>

1771
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:40.650
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be crazy if you blew that car</v>

1772
01:20:40.651 --> 01:20:43.320
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know those cars blow up,</v>

1773
01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:44.690
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How'd your car died?</v>

1774
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:47.780
<v Speaker 6>My car's got dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So many things wrong with her.</v>

1775
01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:48.460
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever see</v>

1776
01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.490
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A member,</v>

1777
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 5>when those fiscal Karmas blew up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fisker Karma was that dope looking</v>

1778
01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 5>space age electric car that actually had</v>
<v Speaker 5>a solar panel on the roof and that solar</v>

1779
01:21:00.881 --> 01:21:04.390
<v Speaker 5>panel on the roof charged up your radio</v>
<v Speaker 5>so your radio wasn't draining the</v>

1780
01:21:04.391 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 5>battery as you were driving around and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were cool looking cars like</v>

1781
01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.120
<v Speaker 5>definitely the best looking out of all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the electric cars and they left a bunch</v>

1782
01:21:13.121 --> 01:21:16.360
<v Speaker 5>of them on a dock in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was,</v>

1783
01:21:16.361 --> 01:21:18.640
<v Speaker 5>or a no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>North Carolina or something like that.</v>

1784
01:21:18.641 --> 01:21:21.400
<v Speaker 5>Anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere by the water and the water</v>

1785
01:21:21.401 --> 01:21:25.480
<v Speaker 5>came in the sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rose flooded the parking lot and all the</v>

1786
01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:27.910
<v Speaker 5>cars went underwater and started</v>
<v Speaker 5>exploding.</v>

1791
01:21:34.301 --> 01:21:35.230

<v Speaker 6>It's like the space x rockets that keep</v>
<v Speaker 6>blowing up on the thing.</v>

1802
01:21:59.571 --> 01:22:00.051

01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:46.800
<v Speaker 6>hit the mirrors and all these people</v>
<v Speaker 6>were like flying off the freeway.</v>

1825
01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:49.530

<v Speaker 1>I think this is all electric.</v>

1841
01:23:21.461 --> 01:23:22.960
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing is sweet.</v>

1842
01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 1>That is sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1843
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:27.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so much better looking than all</v>

1844
01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the other ones because that looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maserati or something,</v>

1845
01:23:31.031 --> 01:23:33.370
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of like the BMW.</v>

1846
01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:35.800
<v Speaker 1>That's like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a Maserati fucked at</v>

1847
01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Jaguar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's electrical at the beer that we go</v>

1848
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:43.201
<v Speaker 1>on a vacation and come on Friday came in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Jaguar and made that thing.</v>

1849
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:47.320
<v Speaker 1>What's the BMW electric sports car that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of looks like that?</v>

1850
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1851
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1852
01:23:49.961 --> 01:23:51.550
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cool looking on the</v>

1853
01:23:51.551 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the issue is it has a really skinny</v>

1854
01:23:53.771 --> 01:23:58.000
<v Speaker 1>tires and it does piss poor performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fast car.</v>

1855
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:01.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a super expensive car and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>super space age car,</v>

1856
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:04.720
<v Speaker 1>but he looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like zero to 60 in comparison to</v>

1857
01:24:04.721 --> 01:24:08.380
<v Speaker 1>like other cars at bmw makes like the m</v>
<v Speaker 1>four and look at.</v>

1858
01:24:08.381 --> 01:24:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like track time or trackability</v>
<v Speaker 1>sales.</v>

1859
01:24:10.621 --> 01:24:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His tires are.</v>

1860
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.350
<v Speaker 1>See the back tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are really skinny,</v>

1861
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.770
<v Speaker 1>like that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1862
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:17.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what it comes with.</v>

1863
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:22.470
<v Speaker 1>This is not like a performance car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful sleek piece of amazing</v>

1864
01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:26.590
<v Speaker 1>automotive engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's design is incredible,</v>

1865
01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A car that looks like that and actually</v>

1866
01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:32.260
<v Speaker 1>goes fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>

1867
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it probably goes fast in</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to a lot of shit,</v>

1868
01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but if you compare the numbers I bet to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like between that and like a porsche</v>

1869
01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:41.890
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would probably not even close.</v>

1870
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Kevin did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tesla like zero to 70 while I was</v>

1871
01:24:44.861 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 1>in the car and I've been in like your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars before in the past,</v>

1872
01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but it was like three seconds and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no engine sounds so it kind of</v>

1873
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:54.150
<v Speaker 1>freaked you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like being on a roller coaster.</v>

1874
01:24:54.151 --> 01:24:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took my breath away.</v>

1875
01:24:55.151 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 1>It was like those cars are ridiculously</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

1876
01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:00.370
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're four wheel drive too,</v>

1877
01:25:00.371 --> 01:25:00.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1878
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It's four wheel drive and it has this</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous engine where there's no</v>

1879
01:25:04.361 --> 01:25:06.490
<v Speaker 1>transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of like gears,</v>

1880
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:11.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like a direct drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just just goes like instant on the</v>

1881
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:15.430
<v Speaker 1>solar roof will create enough energy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>power the car.</v>

1882
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:19.030
<v Speaker 1>No other vehicle sold in us has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>offered this capability.</v>

1883
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Our owners consider our solar roof and</v>
<v Speaker 1>important element in our brand identity.</v>

1884
01:25:24.610 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 1>And we listened today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about to come out.</v>

1885
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in two days it comes out.</v>

1886
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.870
<v Speaker 1>This whole episode has been a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>

1887
01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:35.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is dope though.</v>

1888
01:25:35.321 --> 01:25:36.570
<v Speaker 1>That the fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1889
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.920
<v Speaker 1>especially in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in La,</v>

1890
01:25:38.921 --> 01:25:42.310
<v Speaker 1>that means you can drive that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>around all the time because it's always</v>

1891
01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:44.920
<v Speaker 1>sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if that thing actually can power the</v>

1892
01:25:44.921 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

1893
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:49.720
<v Speaker 1>It does not seem right to soon as that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits a rock,</v>

1894
01:25:49.721 --> 01:25:51.070
<v Speaker 1>it's going to explode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is it?</v>

1895
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.490
<v Speaker 1>How much is this car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume we'll find out in two</v>

1896
01:25:54.491 --> 01:25:55.960
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1897
01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I would bet it's over 100 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those are super expensive cars.</v>

1898
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:03.230
<v Speaker 1>See if you could find out how much the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karma was.</v>

1899
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that just the power</v>

1900
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 5>of the car for like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the electronics and display but not</v>

1901
01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:08.080
<v Speaker 5>driving?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1902
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 5>Saying the first one and be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>power the car.</v>

1903
01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.290
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1904
01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.860
<v Speaker 5>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is insane.</v>

1905
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:14.600
<v Speaker 5>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they really did figure that out,</v>

1906
01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:17.960
<v Speaker 5>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could figure out a way to make a</v>

1907
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:20.990
<v Speaker 5>car run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially here where it's sunny every</v>

1908
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:23.780
<v Speaker 5>day just on solar power and you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to radio.</v>

1909
01:26:23.890 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no restrictions and if you're</v>

1910
01:26:25.611 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 5>stuck in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not only is it not like draining</v>

1911
01:26:28.071 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 5>your battery is probably better because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just not using as much energy,</v>

1912
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 5>but it's just being blasted by the sun</v>
<v Speaker 5>and recharging.</v>

1913
01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:37.020
<v Speaker 5>Nighttime you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1914
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 5>but it feel like you would store enough</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a tesla does.</v>

1915
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it kept it at 100 percent,</v>

1916
01:26:42.261 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 5>I'd be just like a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Amazing,</v>

1917
01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:44.760
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1918
01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.900
<v Speaker 5>If they could figure out how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be amazing.</v>

1919
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:52.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean that would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least around here in Arizona and</v>

1920
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:54.920
<v Speaker 5>places like Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>places where it's sunny,</v>

1921
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 5>they would put other cars out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>business.</v>

1922
01:26:57.230 --> 01:27:01.250
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem possible though because</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sets a small solar panel I didn't</v>

1923
01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that powerful enough to actually</v>

1924
01:27:03.771 --> 01:27:06.320
<v Speaker 5>power a car?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think solar panels are getting more</v>

1925
01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:08.570
<v Speaker 5>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They must be.</v>

1926
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that Elon Musk has this new solar</v>

1927
01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:15.550
<v Speaker 5>bank thing that they're doing for your</v>
<v Speaker 5>house where it's.</v>

1928
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.840
<v Speaker 5>They'll put solar in your house and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>batteries themselves are so much smaller</v>

1929
01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.510
<v Speaker 5>than they've ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're cool looking and they like stick</v>

1930
01:27:23.511 --> 01:27:26.720
<v Speaker 5>to your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll like you have have the mounted on</v>

1931
01:27:26.721 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 5>the wall and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like a whole room like you used</v>

1932
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:34.040
<v Speaker 5>to need like a whole room filled with</v>
<v Speaker 5>batteries to run a house on solar power,</v>

1933
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.940
<v Speaker 5>so not really that way anymore and as</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things are just going to get,</v>

1934
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:41.870
<v Speaker 5>if just the idea that you could power a</v>
<v Speaker 5>house on solar power today is crazy but</v>

1935
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:42.560
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>

1936
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.430
<v Speaker 5>So if you can power a house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a matter of time before that</v>

1937
01:27:46.431 --> 01:27:49.100
<v Speaker 5>stuff gets better and better and better</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the point where.</v>

1938
01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could probably wind up doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>it in Seattle with what minimal sun</v>

1939
01:27:52.911 --> 01:27:55.430
<v Speaker 5>comes through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The clouds that's going to happen.</v>

1940
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.280
<v Speaker 5>They're going to keep making these</v>
<v Speaker 5>things better just like they've done</v>

1941
01:27:58.281 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 5>with everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's televisions or cell phones</v>

1942
01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:04.400
<v Speaker 5>or cars themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cars today,</v>

1943
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:08.060
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the golden era for automobiles.</v>

1944
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.640
<v Speaker 5>Like there's people look back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1945
01:28:10.641 --> 01:28:12.710
<v Speaker 5>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody designs cars like they didn't</v>

1946
01:28:12.711 --> 01:28:16.460
<v Speaker 5>sixties to look at to look at your</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1947
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those sixties cars were amazing to look</v>

1948
01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:20.450
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but try steering one of those pieces of</v>

1949
01:28:20.451 --> 01:28:22.730
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try hitting the brakes if fucking</v>

1950
01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:25.710
<v Speaker 5>stroller rolls out in front of your car</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1951
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:29.060
<v Speaker 5>Those things were terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were terrible handling.</v>

1952
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 5>They're terrible on every corner.</v>

1953
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:35.950
<v Speaker 5>The car went bent sideways and then he</v>
<v Speaker 5>had to like hang on onto it while it</v>

1954
01:28:36.051 --> 01:28:38.870
<v Speaker 5>righted itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole car was made out of like</v>

1955
01:28:38.871 --> 01:28:41.540
<v Speaker 5>a flexible piece of aluminum tray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like w,</v>

1956
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.951
<v Speaker 5>w,</v>
<v Speaker 5>w,</v>

1957
01:28:41.951 --> 01:28:43.970
<v Speaker 5>w,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were shit.</v>

1958
01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.600
<v Speaker 5>Those cars were pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The design was terrible.</v>

1959
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:51.260
<v Speaker 5>Like they literally would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The air would hit them when they would</v>

1960
01:28:51.261 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 5>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were not only were they not</v>

1961
01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.950
<v Speaker 5>aerodynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will like scoops.</v>

1962
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:59.360
<v Speaker 5>There were like a sale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like driving with a sale.</v>

1963
01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:03.990
<v Speaker 5>Like the front actually caught the air</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it slowed the car down.</v>

1964
01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:08.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't know much about old cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have a dad growing up.</v>

1965
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:12.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Portrait you being.</v>

1966
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Well I didn't learn from my dad either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Dad really doesn't give a shit about</v>

1967
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.640
<v Speaker 5>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my stepdad.</v>

1968
01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.360
<v Speaker 5>But if you ever seen like an old like</v>
<v Speaker 5>show a 1970 dodge charger.</v>

1969
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.720
<v Speaker 5>Here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This shit is so an aerodynamic but</v>

1970
01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.390
<v Speaker 5>undeniably dope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorite movies,</v>

1971
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 5>death proof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure that's around the type</v>

1972
01:29:35.941 --> 01:29:37.650
<v Speaker 5>of car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a dodge challenger.</v>

1973
01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:40.840
<v Speaker 5>That's a challenger or charger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a challenge,</v>

1974
01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.500
<v Speaker 5>but if your car and death proof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that movie?</v>

1975
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:44.390
<v Speaker 5>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

1976
01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.990
<v Speaker 5>That's a 70.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

1977
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:48.660
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was a 69.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they did something different to</v>

1978
01:29:48.661 --> 01:29:51.480
<v Speaker 5>the bumper cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A 70 it let go right above it.</v>

1979
01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.920
<v Speaker 5>Go right above it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one,</v>

1980
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:53.720
<v Speaker 5>the black one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

1981
01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:54.570
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one too,</v>

1982
01:29:54.571 --> 01:29:57.170
<v Speaker 5>but that black one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a 70 car.</v>

1983
01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.080
<v Speaker 5>The bumper goes around the top all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way around like a fish with its mouth</v>

1984
01:30:01.081 --> 01:30:04.620
<v Speaker 5>open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that other one is a 69.</v>

1985
01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:06.390
<v Speaker 5>The far left one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that far left one.</v>

1986
01:30:06.391 --> 01:30:08.190
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that thing.</v>

1987
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:11.280
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a 69 now.</v>

1988
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:15.390
<v Speaker 5>Unless maybe they changed the bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look how fucking sick that is.</v>

1989
01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen death proof?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1990
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Is that the Quentin Tarantino thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:20.880
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would love it.</v>

1992
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.890
<v Speaker 5>Look what they just did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just reversed the picture.</v>

1993
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>left hand drive.</v>

1994
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.330
<v Speaker 5>They just flip this picture around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1995
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:32.350
<v Speaker 5>that thing so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that that car was in that movie that</v>

1996
01:30:32.731 --> 01:30:36.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm not exactly sure of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's the car right there.</v>

1997
01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:38.490
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

<v Speaker 5>There was one that they had in fast and</v>

1999
01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:48.171
<v Speaker 5>furious that was all bare metal and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>costs more than a million dollars to</v>

<v Speaker 5>Silver Dodge charger.</v>

2011
01:31:23.381 --> 01:31:28.020
<v Speaker 5>metal and it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it took forever to make the car.</v>

2012
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.530
<v Speaker 5>Took years to make it like literally a</v>
<v Speaker 5>rolling work of art.</v>

2013
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:34.970
<v Speaker 7>Hm.</v>

2016
01:31:38.691 --> 01:31:39.560
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

2017
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:43.850
<v Speaker 5>it was just not sorted outright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is not built correctly.</v>

2018
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:47.150
<v Speaker 5>And that Reggie Bush guy had to do a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of things to it after I did a</v>

2019
01:31:47.151 --> 01:31:50.660
<v Speaker 5>bunch of things to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep calling that Reggie Bush guy.</v>

2020
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.520
<v Speaker 5>You're hearing this Reggie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just high.</v>

2021
01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:54.580
<v Speaker 5>Don't listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they?</v>

2022
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:57.410
<v Speaker 5>No disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they make electric motorcycles?</v>

2023
01:31:57.650 --> 01:31:59.740
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is a dope car though.</v>

2024
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.190
<v Speaker 5>I miss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I miss it.</v>

2025
01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a fun car to drive though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell you that.</v>

2026
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Is that you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2027
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:10.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to say it looks like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a I am,</v>

2028
01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:16.410
<v Speaker 5>but I had that car made in like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a for a TV show in like 2005 or</v>

2029
01:32:16.841 --> 01:32:19.150
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a.</v>

2030
01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:22.480
<v Speaker 5>It was really pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the insides and the way it drove,</v>

2031
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:24.280
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was designed to look really pretty.</v>

2032
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't designed to drive well the</v>
<v Speaker 5>sound of it.</v>

2033
01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:28.420
<v Speaker 5>When you would pull into the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>store though,</v>

2034
01:32:28.421 --> 01:32:30.280
<v Speaker 5>it was so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was ridiculous.</v>

2035
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.050
<v Speaker 5>Giant engine five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>28.</v>

2036
01:32:32.051 --> 01:32:36.130
<v Speaker 5>Hemi just roared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was 600 and something horsepower.</v>

2037
01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:41.610
<v Speaker 5>Such a stupid car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just sounds like Joey Diaz murdering it</v>

2038
01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.250
<v Speaker 5>sounds like war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounded like some death machine,</v>

2039
01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just wasn't safe.</v>

2040
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.580
<v Speaker 5>Like I had to get a bunch of things done</v>
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>

2041
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.080
<v Speaker 5>The suspension detached from the frame</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my driveway.</v>

2042
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 5>After I'd been on the highway going 70</v>
<v Speaker 5>miles an hour,</v>

2043
01:32:55.751 --> 01:33:00.751
<v Speaker 5>just 10 minutes before I pulled in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulled into my driveway and my car went</v>

2044
01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:02.650
<v Speaker 5>sideways and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

2045
01:33:02.651 --> 01:33:06.790
<v Speaker 5>And I get out and the wheel is like half</v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging off and dug into the quarter.</v>

2046
01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.230
<v Speaker 5>The fender.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2047
01:33:08.231 --> 01:33:10.090
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just on the highway.</v>

2048
01:33:10.330 --> 01:33:14.080
<v Speaker 5>Like if that broke loose on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could've easily been dead.</v>

2049
01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:15.820
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're going 70 miles an hour,</v>

2050
01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:17.590
<v Speaker 5>you start flipping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good luck.</v>

2051
01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.670
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what's going to happen is once</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a car,</v>

2052
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:23.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm going fast on the freeway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Tripoli and have all these guys</v>

2053
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.350
<v Speaker 5>were on a road trip and a tire popped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2054
01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.170
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2055
01:33:27.170 --> 01:33:29.520
<v Speaker 5>Dangerous itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just dead.</v>

2056
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very dangerous.</v>

2057
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ran over a,</v>

2058
01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those metal things.</v>

2059
01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:35.610
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the,</v>

2060
01:33:35.611 --> 01:33:36.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the railroad.</v>

2061
01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:40.750
<v Speaker 5>When you think of a railroad tie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the wooden.</v>

2062
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:42.460
<v Speaker 5>Not Wooden piece,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2063
01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:46.810
<v Speaker 5>That's what would that be a metal bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the metal stuff that would be a piece of</v>

2064
01:33:46.811 --> 01:33:50.830
<v Speaker 5>like a railroad track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody had left a piece of a railroad</v>

2065
01:33:50.831 --> 01:33:55.120
<v Speaker 5>track on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a 12 inch section of it and I hit</v>

2066
01:33:55.121 --> 01:33:58.690
<v Speaker 5>that thing and it was like someone shot</v>
<v Speaker 5>my tire out with a rifle.</v>

2067
01:33:58.870 --> 01:34:03.400
<v Speaker 5>He just my car when my car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like literally caught air.</v>

2068
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.850
<v Speaker 5>It was a small car too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was my supra caught air,</v>

2069
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:11.560
<v Speaker 5>blew my fucking wheel apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like literally blew it apart and blew</v>

2070
01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:13.960
<v Speaker 5>the tire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Half a part two and I was in the middle</v>

2071
01:34:13.961 --> 01:34:18.130
<v Speaker 5>of the highway and it was a mile from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the exit and I was gonna pull over and I</v>

2072
01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:21.070
<v Speaker 5>was going to call aaa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but kid I went to high school with,</v>

2073
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:24.040
<v Speaker 5>did that and died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got hit by a car.</v>

2074
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:25.360
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2075
01:34:25.570 --> 01:34:28.420
<v Speaker 5>on the side of the road and he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to change a tire and a guy just</v>

2076
01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:31.840
<v Speaker 5>plowed right into him and killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I never forgot that.</v>

2077
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:36.180
<v Speaker 5>And I just drove gangster style on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely blown out.</v>

2078
01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Randall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was banging and sparking and it</v>

2079
01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:42.540
<v Speaker 5>smelled like fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like bang,</v>

2080
01:34:42.541 --> 01:34:43.081
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>

2081
01:34:43.081 --> 01:34:43.914
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>

2082
01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.451
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>

2083
01:34:44.451 --> 01:34:45.284
<v Speaker 5>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>

2084
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:49.810
<v Speaker 5>Just sparks and it's the rubber because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rubber was like half hanging on,</v>

2085
01:34:49.811 --> 01:34:50.650
<v Speaker 5>half hanging off.</v>

2086
01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:55.300
<v Speaker 5>It was just ripping and flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I was driving I drove all the way</v>

2087
01:34:55.301 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 5>to that fucking exit and all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the side.</v>

2088
01:34:57.621 --> 01:35:00.440
<v Speaker 5>I just kept driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was chewing up the sidewalk.</v>

2089
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:04.110
<v Speaker 5>It was probably fucking up the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all the asphalt asphalts not that</v>

2090
01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2091
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:06.970
<v Speaker 5>fuck your rooms up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember?</v>

2092
01:35:07.210 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 5>Said?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2093
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no rim left.</v>

2094
01:35:09.490 --> 01:35:12.620
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a rim anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was just the whole outside of</v>

2095
01:35:12.621 --> 01:35:15.950
<v Speaker 5>it was just completely destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucked up a lot of suspension parts</v>

2096
01:35:15.951 --> 01:35:18.020
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if I remember correctly,</v>

2097
01:35:18.021 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 5>but they towed it and fixed it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was like,</v>

2098
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 5>at least I'm alive bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2099
01:35:21.741 --> 01:35:25.070
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would way rather or I would have left</v>

2100
01:35:25.071 --> 01:35:29.360
<v Speaker 5>it there and just ran down the side of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the road and made sure I was like way</v>

2101
01:35:29.361 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 5>off to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not staying in my fucking car on the</v>

2102
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 5>road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just too goddamn dangerous.</v>

2103
01:35:34.881 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 5>Especially today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see so many people fucking on their</v>

2104
01:35:38.811 --> 01:35:42.860
<v Speaker 5>phones driving on the highway at night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We see their face lit up by the phone.</v>

2105
01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:44.450
<v Speaker 5>It's so distracting.</v>

2106
01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.410
<v Speaker 2>You see cops with their lights on</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hit continuously.</v>

2107
01:35:48.411 --> 01:35:52.280
<v Speaker 2>So I mean a normal car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to happen all the time.</v>

2108
01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:53.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2109
01:35:53.691 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 5>It's happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2110
01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.460
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was the most fucked up thing I</v>

2111
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:00.440
<v Speaker 5>ever drove over in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But God damn,</v>

2112
01:36:00.441 --> 01:36:01.930
<v Speaker 5>that was loud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like black.</v>

2113
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.720
<v Speaker 5>I saw it too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like last second I was like,</v>

2114
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:06.580
<v Speaker 5>fuck the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2115
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just realize there's not a goddamn</v>

2116
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:11.390
<v Speaker 5>thing you can do if you swerve and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't hit that.</v>

2117
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2118
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:15.050
<v Speaker 5>if I swerve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably gonna flip this car or</v>

2119
01:36:15.051 --> 01:36:16.640
<v Speaker 5>something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to happen.</v>

2120
01:36:16.641 --> 01:36:17.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm definitely going to lose control of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2121
01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.360
<v Speaker 5>I might be able to just ride out this</v>
<v Speaker 5>impact.</v>

2122
01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:21.920
<v Speaker 5>That's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing,</v>

2123
01:36:21.921 --> 01:36:25.220
<v Speaker 5>but</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's nothing.</v>

2124
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 5>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2125
01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.820
<v Speaker 5>I watched this video once of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A car was on a snowy road and they were</v>

2126
01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:35.570
<v Speaker 5>driving in one direction and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>semi driver in the other direction and</v>

2127
01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:39.080
<v Speaker 5>the car in the snowy road starts</v>
<v Speaker 5>fishtailing and they lose control of the</v>

2128
01:36:39.081 --> 01:36:44.000
<v Speaker 5>car and they go right into the oncoming</v>
<v Speaker 5>lane and get hit by a semi and literally</v>

2129
01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:47.870
<v Speaker 5>disintegrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is one of the best examples of how</v>

2130
01:36:47.871 --> 01:36:51.080
<v Speaker 5>fleeting life could be like you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching these people that drive in this</v>

2131
01:36:51.081 --> 01:36:56.081
<v Speaker 5>car and then it goes sideways and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're facing the truck and the truck</v>

2132
01:36:57.681 --> 01:37:02.420
<v Speaker 5>hit them head on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sixty miles an hour over.</v>

2133
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:06.350
<v Speaker 5>It just destroys the car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The car just becomes like little pieces</v>

2134
01:37:06.351 --> 01:37:09.680
<v Speaker 5>of things that go all up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>

2135
01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:12.380
<v Speaker 5>it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look up man.</v>

2136
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:18.030
<v Speaker 2>This weekend I did the odd ball comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fest in a Detroit,</v>

2137
01:37:18.281 --> 01:37:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Chicago and Toronto and Brian Regan has</v>
<v Speaker 2>his own tour bus.</v>

2138
01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:28.140
<v Speaker 2>That stuff is crazy because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even feel like you're moving at all.</v>

2139
01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.880
<v Speaker 2>You're just chilling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out,</v>

2140
01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:34.160
<v Speaker 2>just hanging out in his apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has got the relocation,</v>

2141
01:37:34.410 --> 01:37:36.460
<v Speaker 2>real state of the art one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the newest,</v>

2142
01:37:36.461 --> 01:37:37.420
<v Speaker 2>newest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>newest,</v>

2143
01:37:37.421 --> 01:37:40.570
<v Speaker 2>and he helped design it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff like he like got to like</v>

2144
01:37:40.571 --> 01:37:42.940
<v Speaker 2>play architect with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want this there,</v>

2145
01:37:42.941 --> 01:37:46.720
<v Speaker 2>I want to counter their chairs there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make those captain chairs instead of</v>

2146
01:37:46.721 --> 01:37:51.220
<v Speaker 2>couches and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like being in the future because</v>

2147
01:37:51.221 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>you're moving in a house that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like it's moving.</v>

2148
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 2>So does he stay in hotels or did you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stay in his tour?</v>

2149
01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Bus Holidays in the tour bus has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>master bedroom,</v>

2150
01:38:01.231 --> 01:38:03.750
<v Speaker 2>has everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't ever need to do anything.</v>

2151
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird relationship he has with that guy</v>

2152
01:38:06.301 --> 01:38:09.720
<v Speaker 2>who drives him around where he hit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that drives them around is a second</v>

2153
01:38:09.721 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 2>generation tour bus driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing it 30 years.</v>

2154
01:38:13.141 --> 01:38:18.141
<v Speaker 2>His father was a tour bus driver for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these big things and he basically bottom</v>

2155
01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.640
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when he's on tour,</v>

2156
01:38:20.641 --> 01:38:24.390
<v Speaker 2>that's his guy and he's a super pro so</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows what he's doing,</v>

2157
01:38:24.391 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 2>like a surgeon and he's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously he doesn't bother him or</v>

2158
01:38:28.531 --> 01:38:29.580
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2159
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 2>What a weird life it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable,</v>

2160
01:38:33.361 --> 01:38:37.620
<v Speaker 2>and it's the best thing ever because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how after a shell we have to go</v>

2161
01:38:37.621 --> 01:38:41.160
<v Speaker 2>back to the hotel and then the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning you have to get up and go to the</v>

2162
01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:45.090
<v Speaker 2>airport and that takes an hour and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to spend an hour there early.</v>

2163
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.720
<v Speaker 2>He leaves the venue and immediately</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of whatever the closest back</v>

2164
01:38:51.241 --> 01:38:55.380
<v Speaker 2>door is is the door to his bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the house,</v>

2165
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:56.360
<v Speaker 2>so then you.</v>

2166
01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.720
<v Speaker 2>You leave the venue in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're immediately at your own after</v>

2167
01:38:58.721 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're immediately where you want to be.</v>

2168
01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Whoever you invite can come with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you leave then and that driver</v>

2169
01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:07.620
<v Speaker 2>drives all night to wherever you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to.</v>

2170
01:39:07.621 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 2>When you wake up the next morning in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bed at your destination,</v>

2171
01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 2>instead of waking up at a hotel and</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to go to the airport and then</v>

2172
01:39:16.381 --> 01:39:19.500
<v Speaker 2>having to get on the plane and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to get out of lax or wherever you</v>

2173
01:39:19.501 --> 01:39:22.500
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just walk out that door that you</v>

2174
01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:25.220
<v Speaker 2>walked in from the venue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk out the door again and you're</v>

2175
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:29.610
<v Speaker 2>at your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that this is the actual,</v>

2176
01:39:29.670 --> 01:39:31.890
<v Speaker 2>like new goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got new goals.</v>

2177
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:33.910
<v Speaker 2>It's called bus goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>

2178
01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:36.120
<v Speaker 2>trying to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slams on the brakes.</v>

2179
01:39:36.121 --> 01:39:37.800

<v Speaker 2>Didn't Ralphie have a boss?</v>

2181
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Ralphie is a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ralphie is a mansion.</v>

2182
01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:45.511
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2183
01:39:45.511 --> 01:39:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Ralphie has a bus but this and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2184
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:51.270
<v Speaker 2>But this bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on some cool buses.</v>

2185
01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm friends with John Rich who's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge country music star.</v>

2186
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Awesome bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this bus,</v>

2187
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:57.510
<v Speaker 2>state of the art</v>

2188
01:39:58.330 --> 01:40:00.700
<v Speaker 1>says a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did the bus thing for awhile.</v>

2189
01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a bus and you would bring the bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a movie sets to like as kids can hang</v>

2190
01:40:05.901 --> 01:40:07.250
<v Speaker 1>out on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bus was dope.</v>

2191
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Fully set up and then he drove across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country in the bus.</v>

2192
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And what he did was his family was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bus and he was behind them on a</v>

2193
01:40:14.001 --> 01:40:19.001
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he could just ride his Harley on the</v>

2194
01:40:19.221 --> 01:40:23.180
<v Speaker 1>fucking highway right behind the bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the country.</v>

2195
01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just living fantasies.</v>

2196
01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:26.233
<v Speaker 1>This point.</v>

2197
01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Can I put a c do on top of my bus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2198
01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.770
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy you ever worked with Brian</v>

2199
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Regan?</v>

2200
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done some stuff with him.</v>

2201
01:40:36.571 --> 01:40:39.270
<v Speaker 1>He's done this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've done some gigs with them</v>

2202
01:40:39.271 --> 01:40:40.710
<v Speaker 1>back in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like back in the day.</v>

2203
01:40:40.711 --> 01:40:42.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:47.490
<v Speaker 2>was so much fun and I've gotten to meet</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my heroes.</v>

2206
01:40:47.491 --> 01:40:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Ron White's been hanging out like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal at the store,</v>

2207
01:40:50.521 --> 01:40:52.830
<v Speaker 2>which is super surreal because it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and Brian Regan.</v>

2208
01:40:52.831 --> 01:40:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Where are comedy central guys growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2209
01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of like all you had that</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was a super surreal weekend because</v>

2212
01:41:02.051 --> 01:41:04.470
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very ron white,</v>

2213
01:41:04.471 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>so you know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's down to hang with comedians.</v>

2214
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.140
<v Speaker 2>He's funny all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not one of those guys that like</v>

2215
01:41:11.141 --> 01:41:16.141
<v Speaker 2>shuts down and he was just a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he is that guy.</v>

2216
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:18.670
<v Speaker 2>So like if there's ever a dull moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

2217
01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:22.250
<v Speaker 2>just he can pretty much say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because just sorta like</v>

2218
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2219
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just laying everybody out.</v>

2220
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.780
<v Speaker 2>It was a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those great ones,</v>

2221
01:41:28.781 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 2>like they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't meet your heroes,</v>

2222
01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 2>but like he was a fun one.</v>

2223
01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can meet some of them.</v>

2224
01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.880
<v Speaker 1>You can meet Ron White.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

2226
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool time at the store.</v>

2227
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Ron White hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's hanging out there now.</v>

2228
01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.830
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told Brian Regan all about it.</v>

2229
01:41:46.831 --> 01:41:47.531
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2230
01:41:47.531 --> 01:41:50.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to come because he really</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoys La.</v>

2231
01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he does.</v>

2232
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he really does it if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

2233
01:41:55.561 --> 01:41:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's like the will will turn or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2234
01:41:58.610 --> 01:41:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was talking to him,</v>

2235
01:41:59.711 --> 01:42:04.180
<v Speaker 1>he was saying he pretty much just kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of writes and does the material at his</v>

2236
01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:05.330
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2237
01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it just writes new shit and does it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>his shows in front of his audiences.</v>

2238
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2239
01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my second year doing these</v>

2240
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:15.530
<v Speaker 2>oddballs and I've never seen comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>or myself.</v>

2241
01:42:15.531 --> 01:42:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I haven't laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was laughing at him since I was a</v>

2242
01:42:18.771 --> 01:42:22.190
<v Speaker 2>child since I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I very first started standup.</v>

2243
01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.890
<v Speaker 2>You know how when you really start and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching guys for the first time</v>

2244
01:42:24.891 --> 01:42:26.090
<v Speaker 2>and you're just dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

2245
01:42:26.091 --> 01:42:28.340
<v Speaker 2>how are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like that.</v>

2246
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:32.960
<v Speaker 2>His justice premises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his delivery is everything.</v>

2247
01:42:32.961 --> 01:42:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Like it was surreal to watch every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single joke that he went into.</v>

2248
01:42:36.141 --> 01:42:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how have I never thought of that?</v>

2249
01:42:39.561 --> 01:42:43.040
<v Speaker 2>One of those things where over and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again and you're like,</v>

2250
01:42:43.130 --> 01:42:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's about to talk about that.</v>

2251
01:42:44.571 --> 01:42:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I thought only I noticed that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching an amphitheater</v>

2252
01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.980
<v Speaker 1>continuously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly touring to.</v>

2253
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Brian's.</v>

2254
01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:57.600
<v Speaker 1>He's everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all he does now.</v>

2255
01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.540
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of those guys like I feel</v>

2256
01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:02.120
<v Speaker 2>like bill burr and Chappelle are always</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the thing.</v>

2257
01:43:02.210 --> 01:43:03.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he is.</v>

2258
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying he's bad or whatever,</v>

2259
01:43:05.931 --> 01:43:06.820
<v Speaker 2>but I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2260
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:07.760
<v Speaker 2>he's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:11.480
<v Speaker 1>You know the differences though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's clean and so people think of him as</v>

2262
01:43:11.481 --> 01:43:14.300
<v Speaker 1>being not as funny because he's clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you go,</v>

2263
01:43:14.301 --> 01:43:15.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can take your kids to go see</v>

2264
01:43:15.651 --> 01:43:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Brian Regan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2265
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lays them out,</v>

2266
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:21.380
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even notice that he's not clean,</v>

2267
01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.600
<v Speaker 2>so everybody is clean because he's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

2268
01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It's totally irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just funny,</v>

2270
01:43:26.250 --> 01:43:27.810
<v Speaker 1>but there was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spend a lot of guys like that.</v>

2271
01:43:27.811 --> 01:43:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Like Mitch Hedberg is perfect example</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mitch Hedberg,</v>

2272
01:43:30.451 --> 01:43:31.830
<v Speaker 1>people forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very clean.</v>

2273
01:43:32.370 --> 01:43:35.370
<v Speaker 1>He hardly ever swore and if he did it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was totally unnecessary.</v>

2274
01:43:35.371 --> 01:43:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It was just having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like has jokes.</v>

2275
01:43:37.771 --> 01:43:40.700
<v Speaker 1>We're all like surreal Weirdo jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2276
01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:44.010
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jerry Seinfeld,</v>

2277
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:47.340
<v Speaker 1>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not only was he clean,</v>

2278
01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.850
<v Speaker 1>like he didn't even ever touch on</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial subjects.</v>

2279
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I had to follow</v>

2280
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:55.580
<v Speaker 2>him at the comedy store a few weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about Mitzi shore and how she</v>

2281
01:43:55.581 --> 01:43:59.480
<v Speaker 2>has Parkinson's and she said he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny three decades before.</v>

2282
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was unbelievable.</v>

2283
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Out of everything I've done in standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>in nine years,</v>

2284
01:44:04.761 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I've never been in a tougher position</v>
<v Speaker 2>than following Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

2285
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:12.911
<v Speaker 2>I always like following good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just like went off on a rant</v>

2286
01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:17.981
<v Speaker 2>about how this lady that owns this club</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me 38 years ago,</v>

2287
01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:19.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy number.</v>

2288
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I know it's more than 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 30 for 36 days.</v>

2289
01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:24.800
<v Speaker 2>She told me 37 years ago that I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

2290
01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 2>What's the deal with that brow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2291
01:44:27.891 --> 01:44:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Like the room was just dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

2292
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Speaking can many basically dropped the</v>

<v Speaker 5>So what happened?</v>

2302
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2303
01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:00.990
<v Speaker 2>this is the sixth roasts that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>written for the third one that I've been</v>

2304
01:45:00.991 --> 01:45:05.991
<v Speaker 2>a staff writer on and it's always</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting when someone gets booked,</v>

2305
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's gonna happen,</v>

2306
01:45:07.561 --> 01:45:08.281
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

2307
01:45:08.281 --> 01:45:13.281
<v Speaker 2>And Ann Coulter was one of the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>bookings that we had and I was excited</v>

2308
01:45:13.321 --> 01:45:15.420
<v Speaker 2>to help her and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2309
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:18.900
<v Speaker 2>she didn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't want to do anything that the</v>

2310
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:20.900
<v Speaker 2>writers told her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2311
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:23.130
<v Speaker 2>that she sort of had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to be funny.</v>

2312
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:25.980
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't think anything was funny.</v>

2313
01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:29.880
<v Speaker 2>So she rewrote everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the script that we originally wrote</v>

2314
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:32.280
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she bombed really bad.</v>

2315
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:34.400
<v Speaker 5>She bombed really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what was she trying to avoid?</v>

2316
01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.490
<v Speaker 5>Like when you said she didn't want to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they wanted to do?</v>

2317
01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Well we wanted her to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had one,</v>

2318
01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.420
<v Speaker 2>we had stuff in her voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with her angle and a little bit of</v>

2319
01:45:43.421 --> 01:45:45.970
<v Speaker 2>self deprecating at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2320
01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Like it was supposed to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the Rob Lowe Roast.</v>

2323

<v Speaker 2>is cut out and there's bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the stuff's rewritten.</v>

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:34.700
<v Speaker 4>What does he say?</v>

2408
01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Or seeing the Mexicans or have to leave</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're going to have to go through</v>

2409
01:49:38.161 --> 01:49:41.550
<v Speaker 5>the proper channels in order to legally</v>
<v Speaker 5>immigrate to the United States.</v>

2410
01:49:41.551 --> 01:49:43.530
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexico first.</v>

2411
01:49:44.670 --> 01:49:45.510
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he knows.</v>

2412
01:49:45.511 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 5>No one's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's going back to Mexico.</v>

2413
01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:48.693
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop.</v>

2414
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:50.410
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you know that?</v>

2415
01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.210
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was it that,</v>

2416
01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:53.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tweeted this,</v>

2417
01:49:53.141 --> 01:49:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Pete Dominick tweeted this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there is like a literally zero</v>

2418
01:49:57.761 --> 01:50:02.761
<v Speaker 5>percent gross migration from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the amount of people that come over</v>

2419
01:50:04.781 --> 01:50:08.950
<v Speaker 5>here from Mexico versus the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that leave here and go to Mexico,</v>

2420
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:13.660
<v Speaker 5>it evens out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like a zero percent migration.</v>

2421
01:50:13.690 --> 01:50:15.880
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like a steady written by a</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexican.</v>

2422
01:50:18.150 --> 01:50:19.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering whether or not it takes</v>

2423
01:50:19.931 --> 01:50:22.330
<v Speaker 5>into account illegal immigration and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does,</v>

2424
01:50:22.331 --> 01:50:23.950
<v Speaker 5>how could they possibly know what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>numbers are?</v>

2425
01:50:24.730 --> 01:50:27.340
<v Speaker 5>It seems like they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise you're watching the people</v>

2426
01:50:27.341 --> 01:50:29.050
<v Speaker 5>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're counting them and then you know</v>

2427
01:50:29.051 --> 01:50:30.750
<v Speaker 5>where they are and then you're just</v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

2428
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:33.610
<v Speaker 5>You're like a part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like letting them come over the</v>

2429
01:50:33.611 --> 01:50:34.900
<v Speaker 5>border.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how many people come over the</v>

2430
01:50:34.901 --> 01:50:36.670
<v Speaker 5>border every day and get away with it a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot?</v>

2431
01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know like five people that came over</v>

2432
01:50:40.421 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 5>here from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just come over.</v>

2433
01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:45.880
<v Speaker 5>Come over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2434
01:50:45.881 --> 01:50:48.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think I would too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

2435
01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:52.440
<v Speaker 5>I just think</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's.</v>

2436
01:50:52.441 --> 01:50:54.430
<v Speaker 5>There's two ways to handle this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what I think.</v>

2437
01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:59.640
<v Speaker 5>I think if you want to like go into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>magical mystery world of of impossible</v>

2438
01:51:00.281 --> 01:51:04.810
<v Speaker 5>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best impossible ideas help Mexico so</v>

2439
01:51:04.811 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 5>much that they don't want to come over</v>
<v Speaker 5>here because it's awesome over there to</v>

2440
01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:10.930
<v Speaker 5>like help them figure out how to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexico awesome,</v>

2441
01:51:11.590 --> 01:51:15.460
<v Speaker 5>but they're not going to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best way to get people to work for a</v>

2442
01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:20.461
<v Speaker 5>bucket day and some fucking underarmour</v>
<v Speaker 5>factory or Nike factory or whatever they</v>

2443
01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.990
<v Speaker 5>do down in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is totally legal.</v>

2444
01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:24.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they want to do that down in Mexico</v>

2445
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:26.360
<v Speaker 5>or Volkswagen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:51:26.370 --> 01:51:29.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean a bunch of companies make shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>down in Mexico and the reason why they</v>

2447
01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:32.280
<v Speaker 5>do it is they bring jobs to impoverished</v>
<v Speaker 5>communities.</v>

2448
01:51:32.281 --> 01:51:35.590
<v Speaker 5>These people get a chance to make money</v>
<v Speaker 5>more than they ever would have made on</v>

2449
01:51:35.591 --> 01:51:39.400
<v Speaker 5>their own without these plants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're working for significantly</v>

2450
01:51:39.401 --> 01:51:41.560
<v Speaker 5>less than they would if they were living</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the United States.</v>

2451
01:51:42.130 --> 01:51:45.310
<v Speaker 5>So it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets real weird.</v>

2452
01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:47.100
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2453
01:51:47.101 --> 01:51:48.820
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it better for them than it used to</v>

2454
01:51:48.821 --> 01:51:50.260
<v Speaker 5>be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2455
01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 5>But is it as good for them as it is here</v>
<v Speaker 5>and fuck?</v>

2456
01:51:52.901 --> 01:51:56.230
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well is it okay for a company to keep</v>

2457
01:51:56.231 --> 01:51:59.500
<v Speaker 5>people in a position where they're never</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be in as good a position as</v>

2458
01:51:59.501 --> 01:52:02.290
<v Speaker 5>they would if they were working in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>United States with our laws?</v>

2459
01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:03.573
<v Speaker 5>Is it okay?</v>

2460

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.350

<v Speaker 5>you kinda of a part of the problem.</v>

2463
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:12.330
<v Speaker 5>If you bind sneakers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely you're not making sleek</v>

2464
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:15.190
<v Speaker 5>sneakers in Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hyphens in Mexico City,</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2466
01:52:16.590 --> 01:52:18.580

<v Speaker 5>Did they make some of them in Mexico?</v>

2467
01:52:18.581 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 5>Mexico.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2469
01:52:21.851 --> 01:52:23.320
<v Speaker 5>because you're fucking hard work and</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2470
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.280
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to dive off the</v>
<v Speaker 5>building like a pussy.</v>

2471
01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:29.050
<v Speaker 5>They're going to finish their job and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to have some Tequila and</v>

2474
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:35.990
<v Speaker 5>They're the wrong people to hate</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexicans,</v>

2475
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.230
<v Speaker 5>to have awesome food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're festive.</v>

2476
01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:40.750
<v Speaker 5>They're very family oriented there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2477
01:52:40.751 --> 01:52:42.100
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's drug violence,</v>

2478
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:46.580
<v Speaker 5>but that's just human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the Mexican culture is pretty</v>

<v Speaker 5>Koreans that want to kill you.</v>

2483
01:52:56.010 --> 01:52:57.440

<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the past.</v>

2492
01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:21.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched an amazing documentary on</v>

2493
01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Netflix about bullfighting watering.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think that the big ones are in Spain.</v>

2495
01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:31.230
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna have to do it soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a feeling they're gonna slowly</v>

2496
01:53:31.231 --> 01:53:32.550
<v Speaker 5>make that shit illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People.</v>

2497
01:53:32.551 --> 01:53:33.570
<v Speaker 5>There's so much pressure.</v>

2498
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Wait till you see the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any stadiums filled.</v>

2499
01:53:36.901 --> 01:53:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like.</v>

2500
01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.453
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand,</v>

2501
01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:42.240
<v Speaker 5>but there's also a lot of protestors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even these European countries or it's</v>

2502
01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.280
<v Speaker 5>been a tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2503
01:53:44.490 --> 01:53:47.340
<v Speaker 5>it's fucked up way for these animals to</v>
<v Speaker 5>die,</v>

2504
01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is very weird.</v>

2505
01:53:49.590 --> 01:53:52.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean occasionally the matador gets it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's,</v>

2506
01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:54.000
<v Speaker 5>that's something that you don't see in</v>
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>

2507
01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:57.660
<v Speaker 5>There's not a single thing that we do</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you have that much of a</v>

2508
01:53:57.661 --> 01:54:02.010
<v Speaker 5>possibility of getting mercked by a huge</v>
<v Speaker 5>animal with horns on his head.</v>

2509
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:04.680
<v Speaker 5>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean bull riding I guess Sorta,</v>

2510
01:54:04.681 --> 01:54:07.290
<v Speaker 5>but I guess those guys do get stomped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2511
01:54:07.291 --> 01:54:08.980
<v Speaker 5>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not trying to kill the bull.</v>

2512
01:54:09.010 --> 01:54:10.290
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a totally different kind of an</v>

2513
01:54:10.291 --> 01:54:13.470
<v Speaker 5>exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bull rider is a guy who's just</v>

2514
01:54:13.471 --> 01:54:16.020
<v Speaker 5>trying to hang on for eight seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The matador.</v>

2515
01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:19.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean that shit will take a while and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to stab the fuck a thing.</v>

2516
01:54:19.681 --> 01:54:21.420
<v Speaker 5>People are going to hand them different</v>
<v Speaker 5>swords.</v>

2517
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:25.170
<v Speaker 5>He's going to try to stab it in the back</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the neck and you got a bunch of</v>

2518
01:54:25.171 --> 01:54:27.840
<v Speaker 5>people that are helping them to and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're poisoning that thing and</v>

2519
01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.550
<v Speaker 5>throwing poison darts into it,</v>

2520
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:33.860
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it to get like bigger to get more</v>

2521
01:54:33.861 --> 01:54:37.070
<v Speaker 2>famous as a matador.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you take more chances,</v>

2522
01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you know there's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one move where like you just get down on</v>

2523
01:54:40.071 --> 01:54:44.570
<v Speaker 2>your knees and spread your legs before</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let the bowl out and your whole</v>

2524
01:54:44.571 --> 01:54:47.360
<v Speaker 2>thing is like that first move because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes up with the.</v>

2525
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:51.080
<v Speaker 2>You see it coming around the corner when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they release it and you have your back</v>

2526
01:54:51.081 --> 01:54:53.480
<v Speaker 2>to the bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are starting like,</v>

2527
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:54.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like down,</v>

2528
01:54:54.711 --> 01:54:58.510
<v Speaker 2>not not back to the bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down on your knees and someone's going</v>

2529
01:54:58.511 --> 01:55:01.420
<v Speaker 2>to do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be your back to bowling.</v>

2530
01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a little blade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wesley snipes.</v>

2531
01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Jump up and slice it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snake off as it comes towards you.</v>

2532
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matador would be a great show.</v>

2533
01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Wesley snipes versus a bowl.</v>

2534
01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:16.520
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the most recent bull attack</v>
<v Speaker 5>matador thing where it went up?</v>

2535
01:55:16.521 --> 01:55:19.970
<v Speaker 5>His asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The horn literally went up,</v>

2536
01:55:19.971 --> 01:55:24.290
<v Speaker 5>his asshole tore his insides apart in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing has just ragdoll on him with</v>

2537
01:55:24.291 --> 01:55:27.890
<v Speaker 5>a horn in his asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he died.</v>

2538
01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he died,</v>

2539
01:55:29.151 --> 01:55:29.984
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:31.960
<v Speaker 5>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2541
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:37.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean that shit can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean I think they eat the bowl,</v>

2542
01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:39.780
<v Speaker 5>but it's just a fucked up way to do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

2543
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:41.190
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's a,</v>

2544
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 5>it's a tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You kind of think this is</v>

2545
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:48.030
<v Speaker 1>like a barbaric tradition from days gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>by when people didn't know any better.</v>

2546
01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a very slow death to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they eat all those dead reindeers?</v>

2547
01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I got electrocuted by lightening</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

2548
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This reindeer good meat.</v>

2549
01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Caribou rain,</v>

2550
01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.270
<v Speaker 1>deer and Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the same thing.</v>

2551
01:55:59.271 --> 01:56:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just different names for it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribou is one of the most delicious of</v>

2552
01:56:02.461 --> 01:56:04.200
<v Speaker 1>all game animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

2553
01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:09.510
<v Speaker 1>They're also one of the rare deer where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the females have antlers too,</v>

2554
01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:12.540
<v Speaker 1>like the male and the female have</v>
<v Speaker 1>antlers.</v>

2555
01:56:13.110 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 1>They all have antlers is to fight off</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves apparently.</v>

2556
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:19.800
<v Speaker 1>So the males have antlers to like head</v>
<v Speaker 1>butt each other and I'm like,</v>

2557
01:56:19.801 --> 01:56:23.170
<v Speaker 1>what bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the females I'm antlers to like</v>

2558
01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:25.980
<v Speaker 1>protect their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's just a theory.</v>

2559
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're all androgynous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2560
01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Or they just live it up in the Tundra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just makes hard bitches.</v>

2561
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.360
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the women have in Alaska looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they could be.</v>

2562
01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:38.820
<v Speaker 1>It's Pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the female theorists are giant</v>

2563
01:56:38.821 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 1>lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard life up there for Caribou.</v>

2564
01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Plus they're all on this migration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2565
01:56:44.821 --> 01:56:46.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see Caribou's marching across</v>

2566
01:56:46.801 --> 01:56:48.810
<v Speaker 1>the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see like maybe even hundreds of</v>

2567
01:56:48.811 --> 01:56:49.980
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all online.</v>

2568
01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Like your father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a line of them.</v>

2569
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.910
<v Speaker 1>So you see them coming from like a mile</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2570
01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:56.100
<v Speaker 1>So you just get in position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out where they're going to be.</v>

2571
01:56:56.430 --> 01:57:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Go down past where there are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be going in this direction.</v>

2572
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Sit Down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2573
01:57:01.710 --> 01:57:03.370
<v Speaker 1>set the gun up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

2574
01:57:03.371 --> 01:57:04.470
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them walk close.</v>

2575
01:57:04.750 --> 01:57:06.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they let him walk?</v>

2576
01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Close and bubbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blam blam were eating ham.</v>

2577
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Delicious Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good though.</v>

2578
01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Caribou's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 300 of them died because they were</v>

2579
01:57:18.061 --> 01:57:23.010
<v Speaker 1>all in a rainstorm and they were all on</v>
<v Speaker 1>wet grass and the electricity hit the</v>

2580
01:57:23.011 --> 01:57:24.690
<v Speaker 1>lightening bolt hit and they all got</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked.</v>

2581
01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been crazy video.</v>

2582
01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:29.250
<v Speaker 1>It says five still walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this showed up,</v>

2583
01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:31.960
<v Speaker 1>they had to put them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2584
01:57:32.230 --> 01:57:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Because they saw too much crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PTSD,</v>

2585
01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam vets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

2586
01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It just look what they did to my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all sad.</v>

2587
01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who lightening is fucking crazy.</v>

2588
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You really stop and think about the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are these things that float</v>

2589
01:57:51.691 --> 01:57:56.691
<v Speaker 1>in the sky and out of them come</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossibly powerful beams of electricity</v>

2590
01:57:57.211 --> 01:58:00.480
<v Speaker 1>that split trees down the middle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cook people.</v>

2591
01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:05.760
<v Speaker 1>My friend remy who was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier where his dad owns that a lie,</v>

2592
01:58:05.770 --> 01:58:09.910
<v Speaker 1>next place he got hit by lightning when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in high school and he.</v>

2593
01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.920
<v Speaker 1>He talked about it on the podcast and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said it was just like you didn't even</v>

2594
01:58:13.921 --> 01:58:17.010
<v Speaker 1>realize what happened until after it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened way after it happened.</v>

2595
01:58:17.011 --> 01:58:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It was just trying to come to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why the fuck he was on the</v>

2596
01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:24.510
<v Speaker 1>ground and like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just shut your whole system.</v>

2597
01:58:24.511 --> 01:58:25.344
<v Speaker 1>Just gets</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is that he lost his face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

2613
01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:06.380
<v Speaker 4>This is a black and white picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can't really tell that he's green</v>

2614
01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:11.150
<v Speaker 6>version of the story so you can read it</v>
<v Speaker 6>or he lost his eyes.</v>

2615
01:59:11.151 --> 01:59:12.290
<v Speaker 6>Nose and one arm.</v>

2616
01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:14.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got electrocuted.</v>

2617
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:16.370
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a,</v>

2618
01:59:16.371 --> 01:59:19.530
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a store that I seen on some me,</v>

2619
01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.390
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was a youtube video the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other day of this guy was hiking and he</v>

2620
01:59:23.391 --> 01:59:26.870
<v Speaker 5>saw a bear that was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his giant bear,</v>

2621
01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:32.200
<v Speaker 5>and he went up to it and poked it with</v>
<v Speaker 5>his knife and immediately exploded in</v>

2622
01:59:33.381 --> 01:59:35.330
<v Speaker 5>electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He lost his arm,</v>

2623
01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.240
<v Speaker 5>lost his vision last,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it lost his hearing.</v>

2624
01:59:38.241 --> 01:59:42.290
<v Speaker 5>My wife lost one of his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just got hit with an impossible bolt of</v>

2625
01:59:42.291 --> 01:59:46.730
<v Speaker 5>electricity because the bear had dug</v>
<v Speaker 5>into a power wire and bitten into the</v>

2626
01:59:46.731 --> 01:59:49.640
<v Speaker 5>power wire and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by touching it with his knife,</v>

2627
01:59:49.641 --> 01:59:53.720
<v Speaker 5>he just tapped right into that power and</v>
<v Speaker 5>blew his arm completely off of his body.</v>

2628
01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:55.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:59:55.110 --> 01:59:59.430
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a few of those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's crazy about electricity also</v>

2630
01:59:59.431 --> 02:00:02.490
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of people don't factor in is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it sticks you right where you are.</v>

2631
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.690
<v Speaker 4>I once got electrocuted really badly at</v>
<v Speaker 4>my grandma's house when I was a kid.</v>

2632
02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:07.500
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

2633
02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:10.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had like these old old type of light</v>

2634
02:00:10.711 --> 02:00:15.711
<v Speaker 4>bulbs that were like old fluorescents</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2635
02:00:17.701 --> 02:00:20.910
<v Speaker 4>little metal handle on the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember I grabbed the handle and</v>

2636
02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:23.730
<v Speaker 4>blind and you can't get your hand on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>handle.</v>

2637
02:00:23.731 --> 02:00:26.130
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing with electricity is</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're stuck.</v>

2638
02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:29.640
<v Speaker 4>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sucks and you can't pull away.</v>

2639
02:00:29.641 --> 02:00:32.220
<v Speaker 4>You're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it sticks you there.</v>

2640
02:00:32.250 --> 02:00:36.540
<v Speaker 4>So I imagine like a lot of people just</v>
<v Speaker 4>had creepy fucking deaths from</v>

2641
02:00:36.541 --> 02:00:39.060
<v Speaker 4>electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't get away from it.</v>

2642
02:00:39.061 --> 02:00:40.030
<v Speaker 4>It keeps you there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2643
02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:42.480
<v Speaker 4>Electric fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was a kid I was trying to climb</v>

2644
02:00:42.481 --> 02:00:45.960
<v Speaker 4>up this fence to hang out with some cows</v>
<v Speaker 4>or horses or something.</v>

2645
02:00:45.961 --> 02:00:47.730
<v Speaker 4>And I grabbed onto it and was electric</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2646
02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:49.320
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't let go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember just,</v>

2647
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:54.030
<v Speaker 4>and it's like five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it feels like for ever electricity.</v>

2648
02:00:54.110 --> 02:00:57.110
<v Speaker 5>So bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that we have electrical signals</v>

2649
02:00:57.111 --> 02:00:59.840
<v Speaker 5>in our own body and that electricity is</v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

2650
02:00:59.841 --> 02:01:02.990
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's like this room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about how much you take</v>

2651
02:01:02.991 --> 02:01:05.930
<v Speaker 5>electricity for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how much it's shaped modern life.</v>

2652
02:01:06.230 --> 02:01:08.930
<v Speaker 5>It's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not around electricity,</v>

2653
02:01:09.230 --> 02:01:12.470
<v Speaker 5>but electricity itself is only like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of hundred years old.</v>

2654
02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Like as an invention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people harnessing it.</v>

2655
02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:17.900
<v Speaker 5>Like what the Ben Franklin when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when was that experiment?</v>

2656
02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:22.960
<v Speaker 5>If you had to guess when there's been</v>
<v Speaker 5>Franklin had that kite where the key key</v>

2657
02:01:23.601 --> 02:01:24.434
<v Speaker 5>hanging from it?</v>

2658
02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.410
<v Speaker 4>17.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to guess 60,</v>

2659
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:29.090
<v Speaker 6>17,</v>
<v Speaker 6>16,</v>

2660
02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:31.480
<v Speaker 6>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2661
02:01:31.481 --> 02:01:35.380
<v Speaker 6>That's a crazy one to think of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eighteen 76.</v>

2662
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:37.990
<v Speaker 5>Well he was like 1776 guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2663
02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 5>So he was a part the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was one of the founding fathers.</v>

2664
02:01:41.631 --> 02:01:44.960
<v Speaker 5>So 1750 2:17,</v>
<v Speaker 5>52.</v>

2665
02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:47.180
<v Speaker 5>This motherfuckers out there with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>kite.</v>

2666
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:50.450
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how ball or must America been back then?</v>

2667
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:52.100
<v Speaker 5>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2668
02:01:52.130 --> 02:01:55.280
<v Speaker 5>no lights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Benjamin Franklin was a beast</v>

2669
02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:57.460
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did like a lot of stuff.</v>

2670
02:01:57.490 --> 02:01:59.200
<v Speaker 4>Smoked a lot of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>

2671
02:01:59.290 --> 02:02:00.310
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just made it up.</v>

2672
02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:03.990
<v Speaker 4>That's from like dazed and confused or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2673
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.680
<v Speaker 4>How high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're huge.</v>

2674
02:02:05.681 --> 02:02:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Pothead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each other.</v>

2675
02:02:07.931 --> 02:02:08.860
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what'd you say?</v>

2676
02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:12.460
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't how high that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His Bong at the end of the method man</v>

2677
02:02:12.461 --> 02:02:16.980
<v Speaker 4>movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably was a pothead because</v>

2678
02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.620
<v Speaker 5>I think he grew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't make sense for sure.</v>

2679
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2680
02:02:20.931 --> 02:02:23.830
<v Speaker 5>If you look Google Ben Franklin weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure he.</v>

2681
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:28.010
<v Speaker 5>Not only did he grow it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he talked about smoking it dazed</v>

2682
02:02:28.011 --> 02:02:29.930
<v Speaker 5>and confused.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was that whole scene about how he</v>

2683
02:02:29.931 --> 02:02:32.920
<v Speaker 5>grew weed and had been frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2684
02:02:32.921 --> 02:02:36.610
<v Speaker 5>he agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all were getting high back then.</v>

2685
02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:38.060
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they knew about it.</v>

2686
02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:39.890
<v Speaker 5>If they knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were using.</v>

2687
02:02:39.891 --> 02:02:42.170
<v Speaker 5>It just didn't have the stigma does</v>
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

2688
02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 5>America's founding fathers loved hamp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2689
02:02:44.931 --> 02:02:47.480
<v Speaker 5>Didn't he write something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Washington wrote something about</v>

2690
02:02:47.481 --> 02:02:48.314
<v Speaker 5>it as well.</v>

2691
02:02:48.370 --> 02:02:50.770
<v Speaker 4>I sort of saw it said that he had a hemp</v>
<v Speaker 4>paper mill.</v>

2692
02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:52.753
<v Speaker 4>Franklin did.</v>

2693
02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.060
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is back when they,</v>

2694
02:02:54.061 --> 02:02:57.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing that fucked hemp up was</v>

2695
02:02:57.570 --> 02:03:01.380
<v Speaker 5>the cotton gin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When Eli Whitney came up with a cotton</v>

2696
02:03:01.381 --> 02:03:03.660
<v Speaker 5>gin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it made it easier for them to process</v>

2697
02:03:03.661 --> 02:03:07.050
<v Speaker 5>cotton because before they had to use</v>
<v Speaker 5>slaves and it was a.</v>

2698
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:09.930
<v Speaker 5>It was a real pain in the ass and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing with hemp,</v>

2699
02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:13.470
<v Speaker 5>like what would they had to use with</v>
<v Speaker 5>hemp was they used to have to beat it</v>

2700
02:03:13.471 --> 02:03:17.280
<v Speaker 5>down to get to the fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used to have to smash it and like it</v>

2701
02:03:17.281 --> 02:03:21.510
<v Speaker 5>was a like a long laborious process,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what they use for everything</v>

2702
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:24.750
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason why canvas is called canvas</v>

2703
02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:29.960
<v Speaker 5>is from the word cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hemp is what the actual paper that's</v>

2704
02:03:30.121 --> 02:03:33.810
<v Speaker 5>used to make canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you make a painting you see</v>

2705
02:03:33.811 --> 02:03:38.100
<v Speaker 5>like the Leonardo Da Vinci paintings or</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mona Lisa or something like that.</v>

2706
02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:42.330
<v Speaker 5>That stuff is all on hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they made them on him.</v>

2707
02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Like one of the first drafts of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>declaration of independence.</v>

2708
02:03:45.301 --> 02:03:48.540
<v Speaker 5>They wrote it on hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hemp paper was real common,</v>

2709
02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:53.900
<v Speaker 5>but then they came up with a more</v>
<v Speaker 5>economically efficient way to process</v>

2710
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:56.220
<v Speaker 5>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hemp fell off.</v>

2711
02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:01.520
<v Speaker 5>Then when slavery became abolished,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hemp really fell off because it wasn't</v>

2712
02:04:02.341 --> 02:04:06.510
<v Speaker 5>economically feasible until the 19</v>
<v Speaker 5>thirties than the 19 thirties.</v>

2713
02:04:06.511 --> 02:04:09.720
<v Speaker 5>They invented this thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 5>decorticator and the decorticator</v>

2714
02:04:09.721 --> 02:04:13.190
<v Speaker 5>allowed them to like really effectively</v>
<v Speaker 5>and almost instantly processed the hemp</v>

2715
02:04:13.191 --> 02:04:13.920
<v Speaker 5>fires.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This group,</v>

2716
02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.100
<v Speaker 5>big crazy machine crank and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 5>that came out,</v>

2717
02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:21.000
<v Speaker 5>that's when William Randolph hearst</v>
<v Speaker 5>started running all those ads about</v>

2718
02:04:21.001 --> 02:04:24.720
<v Speaker 5>black people and Mexicans smoking</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana and raping white women.</v>

2719
02:04:24.721 --> 02:04:27.420
<v Speaker 5>It was all just to try to stop the hemp</v>
<v Speaker 5>industry.</v>

2720
02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:31.230
<v Speaker 5>They turned it into a marijuana thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're still suffering to this day.</v>

2721
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:32.703
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

2722
02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:34.310
<v Speaker 4>You can grow hemp now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2723
02:04:34.311 --> 02:04:37.440
<v Speaker 4>In the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some spots on it getting yet.</v>

2724
02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2725
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.060
<v Speaker 5>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're being real careful with being real</v>

2726
02:04:42.061 --> 02:04:45.000
<v Speaker 5>careful with this marijuana thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>because well,</v>

2727
02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:48.240
<v Speaker 5>one day we're for sure going to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in either Colorado or</v>

2728
02:04:48.241 --> 02:04:51.480
<v Speaker 5>Washington state for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why wouldn't we sell like super healthy?</v>

2729
02:04:51.481 --> 02:04:54.200
<v Speaker 5>We'd will find it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>

2730
02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:57.780
<v Speaker 5>This is just to touch and go right now</v>
<v Speaker 5>with legalization,</v>

2731
02:04:57.781 --> 02:04:59.910
<v Speaker 5>it's too sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Federal government is still telling</v>

2732
02:04:59.911 --> 02:05:03.960
<v Speaker 5>people that they can't get guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the most recent ruling that you</v>

2733
02:05:03.961 --> 02:05:06.030
<v Speaker 5>can't have a gun if you have a medical</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana card,</v>

2734
02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:09.930
<v Speaker 5>which is fucking insane because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>could drink booze all day long.</v>

2735
02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:13.050
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could take pharmaceutical pills,</v>

2736
02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:18.090
<v Speaker 5>opiates all day long if you want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do a bunch of different mind</v>

2737
02:05:18.091 --> 02:05:20.250
<v Speaker 5>altering things and still legally</v>
<v Speaker 5>possess a gun,</v>

2738
02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:23.880
<v Speaker 5>but you can't smoke pot if there's any</v>
<v Speaker 5>drug that you should have while you're</v>

2739
02:05:23.881 --> 02:05:25.680
<v Speaker 5>high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's when you have a gun,</v>

2740
02:05:25.681 --> 02:05:26.514
<v Speaker 5>rather it's pot.</v>

2741
02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.470
<v Speaker 5>If there's any drug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pot because that's the drug that's</v>

2742
02:05:30.471 --> 02:05:32.010
<v Speaker 5>gonna make you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I shoot anybody,</v>

2743
02:05:32.011 --> 02:05:32.780
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2744
02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:34.380
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all the other ones are gonna</v>

2745
02:05:35.010 --> 02:05:38.640
<v Speaker 5>displace your reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the other ones are going to put you</v>

2746
02:05:38.641 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 5>in a position where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're probably gonna feel less</v>

2747
02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:44.940
<v Speaker 5>inhibition and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're probably more likely to shoot</v>

2748
02:05:44.941 --> 02:05:46.950
<v Speaker 5>someone if you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're probably more likely to shoot</v>

2749
02:05:46.951 --> 02:05:47.480
<v Speaker 5>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2750
02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:50.250
<v Speaker 5>On pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy fucks.</v>

2751
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That whole pot things messed up.</v>

2752
02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:54.180
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2753
02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 5>back to Ann Coulter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2754
02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:58.170
<v Speaker 5>So this silly bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what does she try to do?</v>

2755
02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:00.690
<v Speaker 5>She tries to write our own jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then.</v>

2756
02:06:01.170 --> 02:06:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know this,</v>

2757
02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I worked with Martha Stewart for</v>

2758
02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:06.900
<v Speaker 2>the Bieber Roast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She crushed it,</v>

2759
02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:09.740
<v Speaker 2>crushed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing she said to me is,</v>

2760
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I want to kill as hard as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Hook it up and I'm like,</v>

2761
02:06:13.110 --> 02:06:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Stuart's done time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want you to do.</v>

2762
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the best ever.</v>

2763
02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:20.360
<v Speaker 5>She's been in the pokey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She stands shit at a level and culture</v>

2764
02:06:20.361 --> 02:06:23.660
<v Speaker 5>where they're privileged lifestyle of</v>
<v Speaker 5>white people everywhere she goes.</v>

2765
02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so ann coulter basically says that,</v>

2766
02:06:28.770 --> 02:06:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't like this joke.</v>

2767
02:06:30.161 --> 02:06:32.020
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't like that joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She writes this,</v>

2768
02:06:32.021 --> 02:06:35.440
<v Speaker 2>she puts a pitch for a book at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>

2769
02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>she was like a third to last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was second.</v>

2770
02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:40.240
<v Speaker 2>So Rob Lowe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went Ann Coulter,</v>

2771
02:06:40.241 --> 02:06:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rob Lowe,</v>

2772
02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:42.550
<v Speaker 2>and to show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2773
02:06:42.551 --> 02:06:45.040
<v Speaker 2>So all these people went before Ralph</v>
<v Speaker 2>Masaccio,</v>

2774
02:06:45.370 --> 02:06:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Nikki Glaser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pete Davidson,</v>

2775
02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Carr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blah blah blah,</v>

2776
02:06:49.641 --> 02:06:51.250
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2777
02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:55.270
<v Speaker 2>and she got lit up and I mean big time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peyton Manning,</v>

2778
02:06:55.271 --> 02:06:56.740
<v Speaker 2>jewel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

2779
02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.750
<v Speaker 2>They'd hit everybody on the day as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2780
02:06:58.810 --> 02:07:01.410
<v Speaker 2>because you always make fun of everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a roast of course,</v>

2781
02:07:01.450 --> 02:07:03.670
<v Speaker 2>and then you get the main target at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of your thing.</v>

2782
02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:07.480
<v Speaker 2>But when people went in on Ian Coulter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went in hard,</v>

2783
02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:11.590
<v Speaker 2>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Jimmy Carr had this one joke which</v>

2784
02:07:11.591 --> 02:07:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm going to completely</v>

2785
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:18.670
<v Speaker 2>destroy right now because I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how he set up,</v>

2786
02:07:18.671 --> 02:07:23.671
<v Speaker 2>but it was something like Ann Coulter is</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and you ugly ratchet faced piece of</v>

2787
02:07:24.221 --> 02:07:25.510
<v Speaker 2>shit scum bucket.</v>

2788
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:29.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like five insulting words just gag</v>

2789
02:07:29.291 --> 02:07:31.630
<v Speaker 2>that I can't get a gang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

2790
02:07:31.631 --> 02:07:34.720
<v Speaker 2>you are one of the most insufferable</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings on the planet,</v>

2791
02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:37.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's not too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can change.</v>

2792
02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:41.440
<v Speaker 2>You could kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the crowd just home.</v>

2793
02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean just everybody hated her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she was great to have on the Deus.</v>

2794
02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could have killed me and Mike</v>

2795
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a huge pro wrestling fan and Sarah</v>

2796
02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Tiana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's an old school pro wrestling fan.</v>

2797
02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:55.870
<v Speaker 2>We looked at her like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2798
02:07:55.871 --> 02:07:58.870
<v Speaker 2>we can write her as a heel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll own it.</v>

2799
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:02.200
<v Speaker 2>It'll be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to look like superstars</v>

2800
02:08:02.201 --> 02:08:04.330
<v Speaker 2>because we were able to make ann coulter</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

2801
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:08.020
<v Speaker 2>but instead halfway through the week we</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>

2802
02:08:08.050 --> 02:08:10.450
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't get it and she wants to do</v>

2803
02:08:10.451 --> 02:08:14.170
<v Speaker 2>this and you don't want to scare away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from not being on the roast.</v>

2804
02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:15.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be like,</v>

2805
02:08:15.341 --> 02:08:16.174
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to,</v>

2806
02:08:16.410 --> 02:08:20.440
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do terrible because then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know there's a chance that you</v>

2807
02:08:20.441 --> 02:08:22.900
<v Speaker 2>might not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we wanted her there because you</v>

2808
02:08:22.901 --> 02:08:24.520
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna show she's going to do</v>

2809
02:08:24.521 --> 02:08:25.210
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2810
02:08:25.210 --> 02:08:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's gonna Shit on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

2811
02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:28.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse comes to worse.</v>

2812
02:08:28.691 --> 02:08:31.810
<v Speaker 2>People love a train wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was a train wreck.</v>

2813
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Super trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was</v>

2814
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:37.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was like a gift of a train wreck.</v>

2815
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It just going to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

2816
02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:40.570
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was terrible.</v>

2817
02:08:40.571 --> 02:08:44.920
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing comedy central did do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious,</v>

2818
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:49.540
<v Speaker 2>is the reaction shots that they chose</v>
<v Speaker 2>for her jokes,</v>

2819
02:08:49.541 --> 02:08:51.900
<v Speaker 2>like when she was on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2820
02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:54.910
<v Speaker 2>are hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it just cuts to just.</v>

2821
02:08:54.911 --> 02:08:57.760
<v Speaker 2>People just started just studying.</v>

2822
02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she made her bones in the safest,</v>

2823
02:09:00.871 --> 02:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>softest world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the world of like political</v>

2824
02:09:04.111 --> 02:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>commentary where there's five different</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and everybody's shouting over</v>

2825
02:09:07.141 --> 02:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody and you don't have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's really relevant and</v>

2826
02:09:09.991 --> 02:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>especially her because she's just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>button pusher.</v>

2827
02:09:12.330 --> 02:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>She's a white lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>button pusher and she gets up there and</v>

2828
02:09:14.521 --> 02:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>she says crazy things like if Canada</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like it will invade them.</v>

2829
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>She says stupid shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even mean,</v>

2830
02:09:20.670 --> 02:09:21.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like this is what she does.</v>

2831
02:09:21.991 --> 02:09:25.760
<v Speaker 1>She pushes buttons and Bill Maher calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>her his friend and they laugh together.</v>

2832
02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she lives in the soft world.</v>

2833
02:09:29.310 --> 02:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>That world that she stepped into is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one of the hardest worlds,</v>

2834
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but for a person like her to go on after</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Jimmy Carr and get washed</v>

2835
02:09:40.170 --> 02:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>and then attempt to plug her book and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that Jazz,</v>

2836
02:09:44.070 --> 02:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>like I bet she has no idea what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>average person's perception of her is</v>

2837
02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:52.970
<v Speaker 1>because she's dealing with that bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking talk show and shit.</v>

2838
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Crazy idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2839
02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 1>That weird bubble where she's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate in that bubble and you know,</v>

2840
02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>she's the button pusher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2841
02:09:59.761 --> 02:10:02.250
<v Speaker 1>here it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2842
02:10:02.370 --> 02:10:03.510
<v Speaker 1>she thinks she's wacky</v>

2843
02:10:03.930 --> 02:10:05.130
<v Speaker 2>and another thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2844
02:10:05.131 --> 02:10:08.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the main things that are roast is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get made fun of you should</v>

2845
02:10:08.791 --> 02:10:10.000
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2846
02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Because it shows that you have a sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of humor.</v>

2847
02:10:12.571 --> 02:10:14.790
<v Speaker 2>That's like the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why trump did it.</v>

2848
02:10:14.791 --> 02:10:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Now he's could be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Sheen did it.</v>

2849
02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Pro Trump can be president because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a roast.</v>

2850
02:10:19.770 --> 02:10:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Hey</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin Bieber's the number one artist in</v>

2851
02:10:23.911 --> 02:10:25.460
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2852
02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:28.430
<v Speaker 2>it's all gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can handle the road trying to</v>

2853
02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.010
<v Speaker 2>talk you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get you to want to do a</v>

2854
02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan rose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we want out of here.</v>

2855
02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>

2856
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So when Ann Coulter does</v>

2857
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm changing the subject immediately</v>

2858
02:10:35.931 --> 02:10:36.840
<v Speaker 2>looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing.</v>

2859
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being mean to you and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want you being mean to me,</v>

2860
02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:43.940
<v Speaker 2>but when you do this roast with Ann</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coulter,</v>

2861
02:10:43.941 --> 02:10:45.740
<v Speaker 2>what happens when people are joking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about her?</v>

2862
02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2863
02:10:47.231 --> 02:10:51.820
<v Speaker 2>that's the best thing is she did not</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh at anything about her and she</v>

2864
02:10:51.821 --> 02:10:55.000
<v Speaker 2>always just had the same look on her</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and it stuck.</v>

2865
02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:58.780
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single joke like you just put in</v>

2866
02:10:58.781 --> 02:11:00.490

2867
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:03.250
<v Speaker 2>we want you to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the look that it would cut back</v>

2868
02:11:03.251 --> 02:11:05.050
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the crowd when you're watching it on</v>

<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks ago.</v>

2873
02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Peyton manning annihilated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a guy who,</v>

<v Speaker 2>top of her set,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't agree with everything that I've</v>

2887
02:11:55.451 --> 02:11:59.110
<v Speaker 2>heard up here tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a person who hates Ann Coulter,</v>

2888
02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:04.810
<v Speaker 2>she annihilated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's so good.</v>

2889
02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:06.650
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2890
02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I wrote for her</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a sort of the room a hands on.</v>

2891
02:12:11.471 --> 02:12:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Ella was a guy named George Ryan Black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good roast writer.</v>

2892
02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:20.650
<v Speaker 1>they're smart Tiana's in on that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a smart move to pair them up with</v>

2894
02:12:20.651 --> 02:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach them through it.</v>

2895
02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:23.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2896
02:12:23.081 --> 02:12:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean then they wouldn't have a chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own.</v>

2897
02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean as far as entertainment</v>

2898
02:12:26.681 --> 02:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could have been a gross</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's show business.</v>

2903
02:12:38.590 --> 02:12:40.660

<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2906
02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:46.290
<v Speaker 1>she's the best ever roaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just</v>

2907
02:12:46.650 --> 02:12:49.380
<v Speaker 2>freakishly great human being at</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything she does.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's a baller dude.</v>

2909
02:12:52.050 --> 02:12:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Not only did she have more prison time</v>
<v Speaker 2>than all those other people in the day</v>

2910
02:12:55.081 --> 02:12:58.560
<v Speaker 2>is like snoop and shy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just a Keller.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They put her in jail for some weird shit</v>

2913
02:13:04.091 --> 02:13:04.750
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2914
02:13:04.750 --> 02:13:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Was it like knowledge of a stock sale or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

2915
02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Insider trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

2916
02:13:10.121 --> 02:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a stock,</v>

2917
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:13.601
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then I do that.</v>

2926
02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to just sit by and not do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and lose money.</v>

02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:36.210
<v Speaker 6>shit's going down and I should bail out</v>
<v Speaker 6>immediately and I don't bail out.</v>

2930
02:13:36.211 --> 02:13:38.970

<v Speaker 6>Then I got to stay out of jail.</v>

2931
02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:41.310
<v Speaker 6>Is that how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure.</v>

2932
02:13:41.311 --> 02:13:43.650
<v Speaker 6>Like you just can't be super blatant</v>
<v Speaker 6>about it.</v>

2933
02:13:43.651 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 6>Like the SEC or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

2934
02:13:46.290 --> 02:13:50.190
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a securities and exchange council.</v>

2935
02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:54.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they commissioned like if they see</v>

2936
02:13:54.031 --> 02:13:58.680
<v Speaker 6>that you just sold millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 6>worth of stocks that day or two before</v>

2937
02:13:58.681 --> 02:14:00.930
<v Speaker 6>something absurd happens with that</v>
<v Speaker 6>company,</v>

2938
02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:03.330
<v Speaker 6>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's sort of blatant.</v>

2939
02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:04.220
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever see it?</v>

2940
02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Stuff that's connected to nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another nine slash 11 thing.</v>

2941
02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So how many people sold American</v>
<v Speaker 1>Airlines stock?</v>

2942
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:14.080

<v Speaker 1>Airlines stock would crash and it's all</v>

2943
02:14:14.081 --> 02:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>like Illuminati type bloom bloom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bloomberg.</v>

2944
02:14:17.890 --> 02:14:20.750
<v Speaker 1>What are those people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilderberg Bilderberg characters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Selling American airline stock.</v>

2946
02:14:23.691 --> 02:14:25.490

<v Speaker 6>under the seat.</v>

<v Speaker 6>belt.</v>

2985
02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:02.800
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's just a cook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Top of pocket.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2988
02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:09.770
<v Speaker 6>I stuffed my fanny pack</v>

2989
02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:12.650
<v Speaker 1>being a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've all seen that,</v>

2990
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:15.010
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2991
02:16:15.610 --> 02:16:18.580
<v Speaker 6>People remember that Airbus that used to</v>
<v Speaker 6>take you to Columbus.</v>

2992
02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:20.620
<v Speaker 6>What was that bust?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was Airbus.</v>

2993
02:16:20.621 --> 02:16:23.650
<v Speaker 6>There's called Airbus wasn't jet blue?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2994
02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:26.990
<v Speaker 6>no it wasn't jet blue airlines called</v>
<v Speaker 6>airpod there.</v>

2995
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:29.050
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like $40 million when we.</v>

2996
02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 6>Once we</v>

2997
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.040
<v Speaker 1>took this shit once and the guy fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up his landing and had to start all over</v>

2998
02:16:35.081 --> 02:16:38.500
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went down and then pulled out and we</v>

2999
02:16:38.501 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 1>go back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3000
02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:43.600
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker just had a panicky tie</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that happened to me a few months ago.</v>

3001
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:45.220
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>

3002
02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$40 a ticket so cheap.</v>

3003
02:16:48.281 --> 02:16:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And there was a direct flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they don't have that they've one</v>

3004
02:16:50.951 --> 02:16:52.450
<v Speaker 1>direct flight to Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio nowadays.</v>

3005
02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.433
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3006
02:16:53.670 --> 02:16:57.280
<v Speaker 1>That's why I had that happen to me a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks or months ago or something.</v>

3007
02:16:57.281 --> 02:17:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was flying back home to la and</v>

3008
02:17:00.850 --> 02:17:05.470
<v Speaker 1>that was not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a scary thing because you're,</v>

3009
02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you get used to landing your first</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3010
02:17:09.701 --> 02:17:10.900
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 flights.</v>

3011
02:17:10.901 --> 02:17:11.890
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're landing,</v>

3012
02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:14.590
<v Speaker 2>look out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you get so used to it that,</v>

3013
02:17:14.591 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens,</v>

3014
02:17:15.551 --> 02:17:17.540
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a jerk a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

3015
02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:21.760
<v Speaker 2>what's crazy is that to get it back up</v>
<v Speaker 2>after going down,</v>

3016
02:17:21.761 --> 02:17:24.350
<v Speaker 2>like they have to go full steam all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3017
02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Engines that are normally are actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty chill because like a bird,</v>

3018
02:17:28.001 --> 02:17:29.470
<v Speaker 2>they sort of just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3019
02:17:29.471 --> 02:17:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to go full blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they do go full blast shit gets</v>

3020
02:17:32.951 --> 02:17:35.650
<v Speaker 2>crazy and they really had to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3021
02:17:35.651 --> 02:17:38.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are down like we are very close to</v>

3022
02:17:38.771 --> 02:17:43.771
<v Speaker 2>landing but he was coming in too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said afterwards you just hear bond</v>

3023
02:17:44.210 --> 02:17:45.990
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Don,</v>

3024
02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.730
<v Speaker 2>like engines and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's shaking and you're like,</v>

3025
02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:53.820
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to like really pull apart.</v>

3026
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:55.450
<v Speaker 2>It was scary man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rice.</v>

3027
02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:56.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3028
02:17:56.141 --> 02:17:57.670

<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

3029
02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That probably that happens too.</v>

3030
02:18:00.050 --> 02:18:03.300
<v Speaker 1>There was a trump plane that didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the landing gear pop out once.</v>

<v Speaker 1>something at the end of October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it gets cold though.</v>

3091
02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't really get it as a joke like</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>

3092
02:20:45.531 --> 02:20:46.430
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke,</v>

3093
02:20:46.431 --> 02:20:48.170
<v Speaker 1>it's always warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Australia,</v>

3094
02:20:48.171 --> 02:20:53.171
<v Speaker 1>like Sydney's pretty much perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they say it's like the Dallas of</v>

3095
02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Australia feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a show or the city.</v>

3096
02:20:59.050 --> 02:21:00.860
<v Speaker 1>The city of Dallas.</v>

3097
02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>How did he remember that TV show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

3098
02:21:03.650 --> 02:21:05.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call them?</v>

3099
02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Cashed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bogans.</v>

3100
02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to cash out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bogan is.</v>

3101
02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:10.460
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to learn this</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology.</v>

3102
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:13.880
<v Speaker 1>A cashed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bogans is like a really rich redneck,</v>

3103
02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:17.210
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy in Dallas had like a,</v>

3104
02:21:17.211 --> 02:21:20.090
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jeep wrangler with fucking 45 inch</v>

3105
02:21:20.091 --> 02:21:22.150
<v Speaker 1>tires and a light bar on the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3106
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:26.360
<v Speaker 1>and he's driving by the club with music</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan and he's got a rolex on with</v>

3107
02:21:26.361 --> 02:21:30.250
<v Speaker 1>diamonds on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's obviously trash that,</v>

3108
02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:34.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a cashed up Bogan in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it.</v>

3109
02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:36.410

<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's gonna be some cashed</v>

3110
02:21:36.411 --> 02:21:39.560
<v Speaker 1>up bogans at some of my shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll definitely be there for sure.</v>

3111
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:42.200
<v Speaker 1>They're going to know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have woody think about</v>

3112

<v Speaker 1>Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might she going to fuck you?</v>

3113
02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:47.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often I get that by the way,</v>

3114
02:21:47.301 --> 02:21:50.570
<v Speaker 1>just randomly I was at the grocery store</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day and someone hit me with</v>

3115
02:21:50.571 --> 02:21:51.380
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3116

<v Speaker 1>explode.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's everything to get you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>headlock.</v>

3121
02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could put me in a headlock.</v>

3122
02:22:05.730 --> 02:22:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll grab her deck and squeeze that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother fuckers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That 30 days and night performance.</v>

3205
02:25:30.941 --> 02:25:34.120
<v Speaker 1>That's when I first found out about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played like the vampire familiar.</v>

3206
02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.550
<v Speaker 1>They had these vampires who would go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska because it wouldn't get.</v>

3207
02:25:36.650 --> 02:25:39.610
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't get light out for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3208
02:25:39.611 --> 02:25:42.190
<v Speaker 1>there's like spots in Alaska where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a never ending winter.</v>

3209
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever Work Alaska?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3210
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got.</v>

3211
02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:48.610
<v Speaker 1>We got to do a Gig in the summer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anchorage.</v>

3212
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:53.830
<v Speaker 1>So it take me a trip now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need some more.</v>

3213
02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.540
<v Speaker 1>It's hard enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't hold your hand,</v>

3214
02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but fishing is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fishing in Alaska is fucking awesome to</v>

3215
02:26:03.370 --> 02:26:05.140
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salmon fishing and they do shows at</v>

3216
02:26:05.141 --> 02:26:06.040
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come out,</v>

3217
02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:08.200
<v Speaker 1>he'd do a midnight show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 2:30 in the morning.</v>

3218
02:26:08.201 --> 02:26:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's light out.</v>

3219
02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:11.770
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slight.</v>

3220
02:26:11.890 --> 02:26:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just barely gets dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets dark for like the tiniest amount</v>

3221
02:26:15.221 --> 02:26:16.840
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really dark.</v>

3222
02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It gets like 7:30 PM dark and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes light again.</v>

3223
02:26:21.130 --> 02:26:22.330
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it</v>

3224
02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:24.760
<v Speaker 2>that those are my hours that night as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

3225
02:26:24.761 --> 02:26:26.200
<v Speaker 2>P when the sun's up for me.</v>

3226
02:26:26.430 --> 02:26:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska is cool as fuck to anchorage and</v>

3227
02:26:29.731 --> 02:26:32.790
<v Speaker 1>particular people up there are super</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>

3228
02:26:32.970 --> 02:26:35.040
<v Speaker 1>like normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fun.</v>

3229
02:26:35.350 --> 02:26:37.070
<v Speaker 1>You can hang out with them and talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they're.</v>

3230
02:26:37.071 --> 02:26:39.180
<v Speaker 1>They're very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hardy people.</v>

3231
02:26:39.330 --> 02:26:42.050
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not a lot of pussies that</v>

3232
02:26:42.051 --> 02:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>live up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just really can't.</v>

3233
02:26:43.801 --> 02:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You really can't be a pussy and survive</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Atlanta in Alaska.</v>

3234
02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:51.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not the way the people are and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the way the environment is like.</v>

3235
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:55.350
<v Speaker 1>In order to survive in that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be a self sustaining</v>

3236
02:26:55.351 --> 02:26:56.970
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be able to change a tire.</v>

3237
02:26:56.971 --> 02:26:59.450
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to dig yourself out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a snow storm.</v>

3238
02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:02.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to start a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might have to make a nice tent,</v>

3239
02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:07.380
<v Speaker 1>one of those ice Igloos to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where jewels from she is.</v>

3240
02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you know her family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the those people that are on that</v>

3241
02:27:10.741 --> 02:27:12.210
<v Speaker 1>reality show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3242
02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Somebody had the joke like they're like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kardashians.</v>

3243
02:27:16.101 --> 02:27:16.940
<v Speaker 2>If they were freezing,</v>

3244
02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:21.390
<v Speaker 1>she seems very smart too.</v>

3245
02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Jewel eminent and telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3246
02:27:23.691 --> 02:27:25.100
<v Speaker 2>this was the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she,</v>

3247
02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean her and Peyton both like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like for example,</v>

3248
02:27:28.611 --> 02:27:31.640
<v Speaker 2>one of the cool things just like doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound check earlier in the afternoon.</v>

3249
02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:34.340
<v Speaker 2>She's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a part where like they had to</v>

3250
02:27:34.341 --> 02:27:35.960
<v Speaker 2>reload the prompter or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3251
02:27:35.961 --> 02:27:38.840
<v Speaker 2>She's just doing a run through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she did her performance with a</v>

3252
02:27:38.841 --> 02:27:42.410
<v Speaker 2>guitar in her hand and she would only</v>
<v Speaker 2>play in between while like people are</v>

3253
02:27:42.411 --> 02:27:47.411
<v Speaker 2>dying of laughter to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop and she would start her next joke.</v>

3254
02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

3255
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:52.340
<v Speaker 2>What a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you have all the writers of</v>

3256
02:27:52.341 --> 02:27:53.660
<v Speaker 2>the roasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laughing,</v>

3257
02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:56.240
<v Speaker 2>then you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3258
02:27:56.241 --> 02:27:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Because we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been laughing about these jokes</v>

3259
02:27:58.461 --> 02:28:00.980
<v Speaker 2>for a week already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're watching you.</v>

3260
02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:05.390
<v Speaker 2>You're a third time saying them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse still cracking up.</v>

3261
02:28:05.391 --> 02:28:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Then</v>

3262
02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:08.130
<v Speaker 1>what did you think about roast battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>being on television?</v>

3263
02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Were you happy with the way it came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>or did you feel like it was too big?</v>

3264
02:28:11.881 --> 02:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

3265
02:28:12.330 --> 02:28:13.740
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

3266
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's like UFC one.</v>

3267
02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that makes sense.</v>

3268
02:28:19.530 --> 02:28:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that it should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular.</v>

3269
02:28:21.621 --> 02:28:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that it should get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they shouldn't just make it a</v>

3270
02:28:24.321 --> 02:28:26.540
<v Speaker 2>once a year special event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see it every week.</v>

3271
02:28:26.541 --> 02:28:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I want to see it get bigger and breathe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let it grow and get the cameras</v>

3272
02:28:30.111 --> 02:28:31.940
<v Speaker 2>right often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should they have Ralphie may back.</v>

3273
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Ralphie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it anymore.</v>

3274
02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:40.410
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that they like the way</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're doing it right now and these big</v>

3275
02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:42.000
<v Speaker 6>environments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you think that it takes anything away</v>

3276
02:28:42.001 --> 02:28:43.530
<v Speaker 6>from it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like don't you think that like I was</v>

3277
02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:45.630
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was watching it and I'm like looking</v>

3278
02:28:45.631 --> 02:28:48.570
<v Speaker 6>at where the judges are and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>performers are and everything's all so</v>

3279
02:28:48.571 --> 02:28:50.770
<v Speaker 6>lit up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is not the belly room.</v>

3280
02:28:50.771 --> 02:28:54.250
<v Speaker 6>Like part of the beauty of roast battle</v>
<v Speaker 6>is how intimate it is.</v>

3281
02:28:54.251 --> 02:28:55.860
<v Speaker 6>You're preaching to the choir on that</v>
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>

3282
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:57.210
<v Speaker 6>Why don't they just do it in the belly</v>
<v Speaker 6>room?</v>

3283
02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Air Preaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3284
02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy that literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been annoying,</v>

3285
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:04.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff and Brian and everybody about this</v>

3286
02:29:04.251 --> 02:29:07.160
<v Speaker 2>since they started eight years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally was going,</v>

3287
02:29:07.161 --> 02:29:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you should be doing with this show what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing with kill Tony and just get</v>

3288
02:29:10.611 --> 02:29:11.480
<v Speaker 2>it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3289
02:29:11.481 --> 02:29:12.670
<v Speaker 2>and have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they had,</v>

3290
02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:17.630
<v Speaker 2>if they put that thing on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be huge,</v>

3291
02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.810
<v Speaker 2>huge and people would be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be you get up.</v>

3292
02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:24.830
<v Speaker 2>You become a bigger fan as you see it</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and you learn the characters more.</v>

3293
02:29:24.831 --> 02:29:29.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's like literally like 75</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC analogies with this thing with roast</v>

3294
02:29:29.901 --> 02:29:33.380
<v Speaker 2>battle because you know there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>different styles and all this stuff and</v>

3295
02:29:33.381 --> 02:29:36.500
<v Speaker 2>you sorta have to be good at everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to hit a rebuttal</v>

3296
02:29:36.501 --> 02:29:41.420
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be able to just do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke right in the pocket and you know,</v>

3297
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:43.910
<v Speaker 2>it's timing and execution and</v>

3298
02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:45.240
<v Speaker 6>haters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Table Two,</v>

3299
02:29:45.241 --> 02:29:46.680
<v Speaker 6>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's been like clipped.</v>

3300
02:29:46.681 --> 02:29:48.210
<v Speaker 6>It's been edited.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's been censored.</v>

3301
02:29:48.211 --> 02:29:52.050
<v Speaker 6>It's not the roast battle that we know</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's kind of like the TV version</v>

3302
02:29:52.051 --> 02:29:56.430
<v Speaker 6>of a wave didn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The racist stuff that scaple says is so</v>

3303
02:29:56.431 --> 02:29:59.020
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous and over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's so hilarious.</v>

3304
02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Certainly some things aren't gonna make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to comedy central.</v>

3305
02:30:01.651 --> 02:30:03.180
<v Speaker 2>They already have a limit to.</v>

3306
02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:05.890
<v Speaker 6>They should have just done it on youtube</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the jump.</v>

3307
02:30:05.980 --> 02:30:07.410
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where the podcasts,</v>

3308
02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:10.630
<v Speaker 6>you know you can download the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's that deaf squad and that's</v>

3309
02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:13.390
<v Speaker 6>pretty roast battle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's called verbal violence.</v>

3310
02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:17.620
<v Speaker 6>So we have the roast battle uncensored</v>
<v Speaker 6>on there so you can hear all the easier.</v>

3311
02:30:17.621 --> 02:30:18.454
<v Speaker 6>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3312
02:30:18.820 --> 02:30:21.250
<v Speaker 6>How can you just talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Play the roast battles?</v>

3313
02:30:21.310 --> 02:30:22.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's called verbal violence.</v>

3314
02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:26.680
<v Speaker 6>We're on like a lot of episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've been doing it for awhile.</v>

3315
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:28.990
<v Speaker 6>How come you never talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always talk about it.</v>

3316
02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:31.060
<v Speaker 6>I've never heard you talk about that</v>
<v Speaker 6>once.</v>

3317
02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:31.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3318
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:35.290
<v Speaker 6>I have literally never heard you talk</v>
<v Speaker 6>about a podcast where you take all the</v>

3319
02:30:35.291 --> 02:30:36.124
<v Speaker 6>roast battles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3320
02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:38.530
<v Speaker 6>put it online.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the roasters all know they're being</v>

3321
02:30:38.531 --> 02:30:39.550
<v Speaker 6>put online.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3322
02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:42.100
<v Speaker 6>It's been on for over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3323
02:30:42.430 --> 02:30:45.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian Moses and Jamie,</v>

3324
02:30:45.671 --> 02:30:48.100
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>coach t record them all or it sounded</v>

3325
02:30:48.101 --> 02:30:50.950
<v Speaker 6>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Coach t does a real good job on it.</v>

3326
02:30:50.980 --> 02:30:51.451
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3327
02:30:51.451 --> 02:30:52.241
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3328
02:30:52.241 --> 02:30:56.020
<v Speaker 6>they is something like if Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll have Kim as a guest can congdon</v>

3329
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:58.900
<v Speaker 6>then they'll interview her about her</v>
<v Speaker 6>battle and they'll play the whole</v>

3330
02:30:58.901 --> 02:31:00.010
<v Speaker 6>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then uh,</v>

3331
02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.320
<v Speaker 6>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they make it like special events.</v>

3332
02:31:02.321 --> 02:31:04.810
<v Speaker 6>So it's not like last night's is gonna</v>
<v Speaker 6>be on there.</v>

3333
02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:06.640
<v Speaker 6>They just pick out all the good ones.</v>

3334
02:31:07.340 --> 02:31:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3335
02:31:08.970 --> 02:31:12.480
<v Speaker 2>they interview the people and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflect on the battles that they don't</v>

3336
02:31:12.481 --> 02:31:13.100
<v Speaker 2>play the whole</v>

3337
02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:14.750
<v Speaker 6>also the whole way through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3338
02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:16.860
<v Speaker 6>They don't play all of them now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they'll pay,</v>

3339
02:31:16.930 --> 02:31:20.930
<v Speaker 6>they'll play the whole thing and then in</v>
<v Speaker 6>between interrupted literally just edits</v>

3340
02:31:20.931 --> 02:31:22.680
<v Speaker 6>it and does whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It cuts in and out of it.</v>

3341
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:25.010
<v Speaker 6>So it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's good for podcasts because they see,</v>

3342
02:31:25.170 --> 02:31:28.350
<v Speaker 6>they kind of have to explain some of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>battles because a lot of the battles are</v>

3343
02:31:28.351 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 6>inside jokes and stuff and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's why they have like kind of cuts</v>

3344
02:31:32.431 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 6>in between where they talked about how</v>
<v Speaker 6>you film it.</v>

3345
02:31:34.690 --> 02:31:35.491
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they did.</v>

3346
02:31:35.491 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 6>They film it on periscope and she put it</v>
<v Speaker 6>on Youtube.</v>

3347
02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:40.080
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3348
02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:43.120
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why they don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something that they're allowed to</v>

3349
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:44.370
<v Speaker 6>do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3350
02:31:44.430 --> 02:31:46.410
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>With the comedy central deal in new</v>

3351
02:31:46.411 --> 02:31:46.861
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3352
02:31:46.861 --> 02:31:48.150
<v Speaker 6>But they could have they been doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

3353
02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:51.320
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying is they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I don't even think.</v>

3354
02:31:51.490 --> 02:31:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think these networks get it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if they had,</v>

3355
02:31:56.050 --> 02:31:59.290
<v Speaker 2>if they had built a huge built in</v>
<v Speaker 2>following,</v>

3356
02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:02.560
<v Speaker 2>then you get those numbers when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch over,</v>

3357
02:32:02.561 --> 02:32:04.960
<v Speaker 2>those people are always going to go find</v>
<v Speaker 2>the TV show.</v>

3358
02:32:05.020 --> 02:32:05.711
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured it out.</v>

3359
02:32:05.711 --> 02:32:07.150
<v Speaker 5>What this has done happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3360
02:32:07.330 --> 02:32:10.180
<v Speaker 5>They figured it out with red show</v>
<v Speaker 5>already show started out as a comedy</v>

3361
02:32:10.181 --> 02:32:14.440
<v Speaker 5>central Internet show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was basically uncensored and had</v>

3362
02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:18.040
<v Speaker 5>much longer stories like Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could tell like a 10 minute story or</v>

3363
02:32:18.041 --> 02:32:20.770
<v Speaker 5>something on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas now everything has to fit into</v>

3364
02:32:20.771 --> 02:32:23.680
<v Speaker 5>those commercial breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're editing a lot of stories,</v>

3365
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:25.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they chopped stories up and they short</v>

3366
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:27.910
<v Speaker 5>numb and take a little of this out and</v>
<v Speaker 5>take a little of that out.</v>

3367
02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:31.800
<v Speaker 5>The best way is to see him live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3368
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:33.040
<v Speaker 5>especially roast battle.</v>

3369
02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with the actual roast to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish that it was more alive and you</v>

3370
02:32:36.811 --> 02:32:41.010
<v Speaker 2>would see like the highest and the lows</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes the highs a lot better.</v>

3371
02:32:41.170 --> 02:32:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they do them live?</v>

3372
02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:45.920
<v Speaker 5>Want to just have a live event?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it too difficult to film a live TV</v>

3373
02:32:45.921 --> 02:32:46.754
<v Speaker 5>event?</v>

3374
02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:48.410
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3375
02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:51.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot more expensive if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get to go in and really perfect it.</v>

3376
02:32:51.930 --> 02:32:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Like in that little bit that I did watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>last night,</v>

3377
02:32:55.010 --> 02:32:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3378
02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Joel Gallon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Aep of that roast who's done every</v>

3379
02:32:58.791 --> 02:33:01.280
<v Speaker 2>single roast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the MTV video awards,</v>

3380
02:33:01.281 --> 02:33:05.030
<v Speaker 2>like he's the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a genius and to get to see the</v>

3381
02:33:05.031 --> 02:33:08.510
<v Speaker 2>reaction shots that he does match them</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with that.</v>

3382
02:33:08.511 --> 02:33:10.910
<v Speaker 2>You can only get like halfway there</v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

3383
02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:12.320
<v Speaker 2>but to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3384
02:33:12.321 --> 02:33:15.560
<v Speaker 2>you get more bang for your buck because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the joke,</v>

3385
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:19.940
<v Speaker 2>then you get the reaction from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who was made fun of.</v>

3386
02:33:19.970 --> 02:33:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Then you get the audience and like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you match all those things up,</v>

3387
02:33:22.881 --> 02:33:24.680
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the joke reaction,</v>

3388
02:33:24.681 --> 02:33:26.120
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your laughing at like four</v>

3389
02:33:26.121 --> 02:33:28.850
<v Speaker 2>things at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think going in and doing the</v>

3390
02:33:28.851 --> 02:33:31.160
<v Speaker 2>surgery to that probably benefits the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

3391
02:33:31.161 --> 02:33:33.860
<v Speaker 2>but still I think that's too long of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>turnover a week.</v>

3392
02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:36.560
<v Speaker 2>She'd be like the next night or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something they could do that.</v>

3393
02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Tony's another show</v>

3394
02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:41.740
<v Speaker 5>works best in that little room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great in the big room,</v>

3395
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:43.750
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just not as good.</v>

3396
02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:46.770
<v Speaker 2>We're getting better at it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing every other Monday in</v>

3397
02:33:46.771 --> 02:33:49.890
<v Speaker 2>the main room and it's getting big and</v>
<v Speaker 2>man cool.</v>

3398
02:33:49.891 --> 02:33:54.870
<v Speaker 2>We got Pat Reagan and Jeremiah Watkins</v>
<v Speaker 2>in is just has a different feeling when</v>

3399
02:33:54.871 --> 02:33:56.730
<v Speaker 2>you do the bigger ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting bigger and better.</v>

3400
02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:59.370
<v Speaker 2>We're getting better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you prefer?</v>

3401
02:34:00.570 --> 02:34:02.550
<v Speaker 2>It gets really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

3402
02:34:02.551 --> 02:34:06.240
<v Speaker 2>I sorta like what we're doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really should just take over Mondays</v>

3403
02:34:06.241 --> 02:34:09.120
<v Speaker 2>in the main room and commit to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have special ones,</v>

3404
02:34:09.121 --> 02:34:11.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a chill one,</v>

3405
02:34:11.041 --> 02:34:14.700
<v Speaker 2>be in the belly room once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a throwback episode because I'm</v>

3406
02:34:14.701 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 2>starting to fall in love with the main</v>
<v Speaker 2>room and I think that if we keep doing</v>

3407
02:34:17.711 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 2>it there,</v>

3408
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:22.810
<v Speaker 4>it's just going to keep getting bigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to have the chance of having 400</v>

3409
02:34:22.811 --> 02:34:27.400
<v Speaker 4>people every Monday at 8:00 PM,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like have it be like a fuck Monday's</v>

3410
02:34:27.430 --> 02:34:30.130
<v Speaker 4>show pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which it's sort of turning into like we</v>

3411
02:34:30.131 --> 02:34:32.610
<v Speaker 4>had like 100 people that are on our last</v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

3412
02:34:32.611 --> 02:34:36.970
<v Speaker 4>You got this amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now with dom I rera the old is the only</v>

3414
02:34:41.141 --> 02:34:43.690
<v Speaker 4>whole time.</v>

3415
02:34:43.691 --> 02:34:46.450
<v Speaker 4>creepy about watching so many bomb in</v>
<v Speaker 4>front of 80 people though?</v>

3416
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Because like there's a feeling in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the belly room when someone's eating</v>

3417
02:34:51.071 --> 02:34:53.710
<v Speaker 4>a plate of shit in the belly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different feeling.</v>

3418
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:55.210
<v Speaker 4>You hear their heartbeat.</v>

3419
02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:02.830
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucked up that you smell them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You see the sweat start to put more on.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but according to some of our friends in</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's actually a company that just takes</v>

3430
02:35:35.861 --> 02:35:38.410
<v Speaker 4>a lot of west coast is ideas like roast</v>
<v Speaker 4>battles.</v>

3431
02:35:38.411 --> 02:35:41.410
<v Speaker 4>They made like a generic version of</v>
<v Speaker 4>roast battle afforded in east coast.</v>

3432
02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:43.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they just kind of picking and</v>

3433
02:35:43.571 --> 02:35:46.920
<v Speaker 4>choosing what you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they want to steal and they rebrand</v>

3434
02:35:46.921 --> 02:35:48.010
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3435
02:35:48.260 --> 02:35:50.380
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was upset the first day or so,</v>

3436
02:35:50.410 --> 02:35:51.240
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3437
02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:53.200
<v Speaker 4>like Tony said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just see what happens because it's</v>

3438
02:35:53.350 --> 02:35:54.690
<v Speaker 4>a big joker.</v>

3439
02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:56.980
<v Speaker 4>Sin and a couple other people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3440
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:59.240
<v Speaker 4>like I got like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Ari hit me up and it's like Yo,</v>

3441
02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:01.120
<v Speaker 4>just laying a Bennington guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

3442
02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let it die out.</v>

3443
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:05.530
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like alright you got me because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love those guys.</v>

3444
02:36:05.531 --> 02:36:07.130
<v Speaker 4>So I mean if they're saying that and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3445
02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:09.570
<v Speaker 4>we're basically like others across the</v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

3446
02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:14.290
<v Speaker 4>It's sketchy though is because Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast has been on serious so you know,</v>

3447
02:36:14.291 --> 02:36:16.660
<v Speaker 4>for like the last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's on anymore but they</v>

3448
02:36:16.661 --> 02:36:20.200
<v Speaker 4>used to rebroadcast it and for years</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about killed Tony and the</v>

3449
02:36:20.201 --> 02:36:23.260
<v Speaker 4>format and stuff and the same show is on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same network.</v>

3450
02:36:23.261 --> 02:36:26.800
<v Speaker 4>So that's an little kind of creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've had everybody on the show.</v>

3451
02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys have been doing to kill Tony</v>

3452
02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:30.310
<v Speaker 4>for how many years now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over three years.</v>

3453
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knows about it.</v>

3454
02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:34.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not a surprise and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting format.</v>

3455
02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:38.020
<v Speaker 4>It's a funny format in limiting them to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a minute.</v>

3456
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:40.510
<v Speaker 4>It like gives plenty of time for</v>
<v Speaker 4>awkwardness,</v>

3457
02:36:40.511 --> 02:36:43.810
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't let it get completely out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of control and that's the part where</v>

3458
02:36:43.811 --> 02:36:45.160
<v Speaker 4>they messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they were,</v>

3459
02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:46.720
<v Speaker 4>if they were going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were going to take,</v>

3460
02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:50.110
<v Speaker 4>if they were going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's they made a huge fundamental</v>

3461
02:36:50.111 --> 02:36:53.800
<v Speaker 4>mistake because they just made it so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the comedian I guess can just ring</v>

3462
02:36:53.801 --> 02:36:56.710
<v Speaker 4>a bell at any point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which of course these New Yorkers,</v>

3463
02:36:56.770 --> 02:36:59.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's hilarious to probably</v>

3464
02:36:59.441 --> 02:37:01.330
<v Speaker 4>interrupt seven seconds thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3465
02:37:01.331 --> 02:37:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I got one full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo know what I mean?</v>

3466
02:37:05.450 --> 02:37:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Comedy just unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

3467
02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have a problem with New York</v>

3468
02:37:09.701 --> 02:37:10.720
<v Speaker 4>comedians?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

3469
02:37:10.721 --> 02:37:12.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

3470
02:37:12.650 --> 02:37:14.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

3471
02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Anybody that knows what I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

3472
02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:16.320
<v Speaker 4>No toss</v>

3473
02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:21.080
<v Speaker 1>because west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

3474
02:37:21.081 --> 02:37:22.130
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elbows,</v>

3475
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:24.310
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing here?</v>

3476
02:37:25.170 --> 02:37:26.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the best out there.</v>

3477
02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:30.230
<v Speaker 1>You mocking New York comedians now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be mocking them</v>

3478
02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:34.730
<v Speaker 1>west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need to know to know where I</v>

3479
02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:37.680
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in a East Coast soon and</v>

3480
02:37:37.681 --> 02:37:40.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in November and I don't want any issues.</v>

3481
02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say that I was born in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>

3482
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:45.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with east coast in some ways.</v>

3483
02:37:46.310 --> 02:37:51.290
<v Speaker 1>I actually think east coast comics are</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer and less back stabby and more real</v>

3484
02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:53.053
<v Speaker 1>goal</v>

3485
02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:54.670
<v Speaker 2>to New York for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

3486
02:37:55.310 --> 02:37:57.470
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean they're nice to you when</v>

3487
02:37:57.471 --> 02:37:58.740
<v Speaker 2>they're in town and want to do your job?</v>

3488
02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:00.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3489
02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because out here it's like</v>

3490
02:38:02.611 --> 02:38:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3491
02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:07.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fake shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that is true.</v>

3492
02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:11.780
<v Speaker 1>This is a climate of fakeness with</v>
<v Speaker 1>auditions and you know,</v>

3493
02:38:11.790 --> 02:38:14.970
<v Speaker 1>meeting producers and all the bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes with trying to be a working</v>

3494
02:38:14.971 --> 02:38:17.760
<v Speaker 1>actor in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely tastes comedy.</v>

3495
02:38:18.060 --> 02:38:19.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that you all</v>

3496
02:38:19.711 --> 02:38:24.240
<v Speaker 1>know that are like semi comedians that</v>
<v Speaker 1>do like a little stand up here and</v>

3497
02:38:24.241 --> 02:38:26.190
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never record anything and the</v>

3498
02:38:26.191 --> 02:38:29.130
<v Speaker 1>occasionally go on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really what they do is they work as</v>

3499
02:38:29.131 --> 02:38:31.950
<v Speaker 1>actors and then they kinda like dabble</v>
<v Speaker 1>in comedy.</v>

3500
02:38:32.430 --> 02:38:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all.</v>

3501
02:38:33.570 --> 02:38:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Those are weird fuckers because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fully in and so the way they behave</v>

3502
02:38:38.071 --> 02:38:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and talk and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like just a little a shade off.</v>

3503
02:38:41.310 --> 02:38:44.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hybrid between an actor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedian.</v>

3504
02:38:45.370 --> 02:38:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

3505
02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:48.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3506
02:38:48.850 --> 02:38:50.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't want different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're different.</v>

3507
02:38:50.141 --> 02:38:51.010
<v Speaker 2>In New York it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3508
02:38:51.011 --> 02:38:53.080
<v Speaker 2>I did 17 sets tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3509
02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:54.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's good.</v>

3510
02:38:54.281 --> 02:38:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Well how much do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much value are you putting on those</v>

3511
02:38:57.311 --> 02:38:58.990
<v Speaker 2>17 sets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

3512
02:38:59.130 --> 02:39:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I did one set at the comedy store and</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that this new two minutes works</v>

3513
02:39:04.421 --> 02:39:07.780
<v Speaker 2>exactly like this and like it's a higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

3514
02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how much time you getting.</v>

3515
02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:13.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing 15 minutes of the comedy</v>

3516
02:39:13.541 --> 02:39:14.970
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3517
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:18.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a decent amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems with those short</v>

3518
02:39:18.101 --> 02:39:21.640
<v Speaker 1>sets is you're doing like five and seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute sets and there's a bunch of</v>

3519
02:39:21.641 --> 02:39:24.460
<v Speaker 1>people doing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are really hard to get anything</v>

3520
02:39:24.461 --> 02:39:28.000
<v Speaker 1>weird going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really hard to express points of</v>

3521
02:39:28.001 --> 02:39:30.970
<v Speaker 1>view on things and like elaborate on</v>
<v Speaker 1>those points of view and have those</v>

3522
02:39:30.971 --> 02:39:33.610
<v Speaker 1>points of view tie in with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things that you noticed in</v>

3523
02:39:33.611 --> 02:39:35.170
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have enough time.</v>

3524
02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I love New York comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

3525
02:39:37.971 --> 02:39:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hating on this show</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>

3526
02:39:39.921 --> 02:39:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Like what I heard of this show that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the.</v>

3527
02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:45.260
<v Speaker 2>The people said whether kill Tony Rip</v>
<v Speaker 2>off is just a bunch of people ringing</v>

3528
02:39:45.261 --> 02:39:50.000
<v Speaker 2>the bell immediately and they don't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the poor comic even do their first</v>

3529
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:52.160
<v Speaker 2>job without bashing them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3530
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:56.870
<v Speaker 2>It's funny to interrupt course and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>like without that tension being built</v>

3531
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:59.990
<v Speaker 2>over 60 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know whether you like them,</v>

3532
02:39:59.991 --> 02:40:03.080
<v Speaker 2>whether you hate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just know that this person on the</v>

3533
02:40:03.081 --> 02:40:04.940
<v Speaker 2>panels just being annoying.</v>

3534
02:40:05.050 --> 02:40:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Well when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I do your show,</v>

3535
02:40:06.311 --> 02:40:09.700
<v Speaker 1>it's always this weird combination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like try to be funny,</v>

3536
02:40:09.701 --> 02:40:12.940
<v Speaker 1>but this part of me that just wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give actual advice that's part of,</v>

3537
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like a balance of the</v>

3538
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:17.610
<v Speaker 4>two and then part of me wants to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>let people know like whatever you're</v>

3539
02:40:17.611 --> 02:40:20.730
<v Speaker 4>thinking is happening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever you think like this is</v>

3540
02:40:20.731 --> 02:40:21.564
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3541
02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:24.180
<v Speaker 4>this is a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like someone needs to explain this to</v>

3542
02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:26.010
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this is all a mess and like if you</v>
