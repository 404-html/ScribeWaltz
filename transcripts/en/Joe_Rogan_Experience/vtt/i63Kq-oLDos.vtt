1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden pull back.</v>

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know back.</v>

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it's corruption.</v>

4
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

6
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if it's good then I'll go.</v>

7
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>In other words where I mean is that,</v>

8
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the system in place is the only way you,</v>

9
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

10
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>that's perfect.</v>

11
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

12
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>So I mean they're not going to fix that system of that system has made them</v>

14
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.004
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars.</v>

15
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do whatever meager patchwork they need to do within their</v>

16
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 1>lifetime to keep on the majority of the wealth that they've acquired.</v>

17
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.001
<v Speaker 1>I've said before,</v>

18
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:25.441
<v Speaker 1>I try it,</v>

19
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>try getting rid of a law now try,</v>

20
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.073
<v Speaker 1>just try.</v>

21
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's skip.</v>

22
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's step outside of the boundaries cause I tire of these,</v>

23
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>these questions and these,</v>

24
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:35.731
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

25
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:36.271
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

26
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:41.271
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why I tire of it is because everyone seems to have some</v>

27
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:47.451
<v Speaker 1>sort of a position in this machine and everyone is describing all the varieties</v>

28
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>of issues within these positions of these,</v>

29
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>these different statements and different belief systems that everybody has a</v>

30
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>subscribed to when it comes to this world.</v>

31
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>And how everything runs.</v>

32
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>What's the ideal way to do it?</v>

33
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>

34
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>if you were a guy,</v>

35
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>and I know that you've thought of this,</v>

36
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>if you were a guy that could stop everything and figure out how to make an even</v>

37
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:14.941
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

38
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

39
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>How would you engineer it?</v>

40
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>If someone came up to you and said,</v>

41
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:19.951
<v Speaker 1>listen dude,</v>

42
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna let you go on television.</v>

43
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You have a year to formulate a plan.</v>

44
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I think you're a smart guy and I think this is what the world needs.</v>

45
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>The world's needs a smart dude who thinks out of the box.</v>

46
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.373
<v Speaker 1>You get together,</v>

47
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you have one year come up with a fucking plan as to how to redistribute the</v>

48
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>whole thing had had a refigure out where where the money gets stored and what's</v>

49
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the money is based on and you know,</v>

50
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

51
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>what are acceptable interest rates.</v>

52
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And I would probably do,</v>

53
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I would probably start with a flat tax.</v>

54
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is I would have,</v>

55
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>no matter who you are,</v>

56
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:50.214
<v Speaker 1>where you stand,</v>

57
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you pay 30% you pay 30% across the board.</v>

58
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>So instead of having 6,000 pages of taxes,</v>

59
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I know there are problems with it,</v>

60
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.261
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

61
00:01:58.261 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd make it as fair as possible.</v>

62
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>May Not be as fair to,</v>

63
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>rich people pay more,</v>

65
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna pay more ultimately.</v>

66
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:04.351
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

67
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>poor people still have to pay 30% right now.</v>

68
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of poor people don't pay any taxes at all.</v>

69
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.361
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's good.</v>

70
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:09.541
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

71
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>this is where I would step back and the tax code is so fucking complicated.</v>

72
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Did I might just say flat tax across the board,</v>

73
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:16.494
<v Speaker 1>no matter who you are,</v>

74
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>you pay 30% of your income.</v>

75
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I think if you are poor and you are struggling,</v>

76
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you should have to pay much less.</v>

77
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think that a guy like me should have to pay more.</v>

78
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

79
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

80
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:27.501
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

81
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a creepy argument.</v>

82
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:29.454
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

83
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

84
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

85
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>this is the caveat though,</v>

86
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>if I believed that it was being spent wisely,</v>

87
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>if I believe that that was the answer and I don't,</v>

88
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.320
<v Speaker 1>this brings me back to the doers.</v>

89
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>And the question is that I don't believe there's any way.</v>

90
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that any large bureaucracy,</v>

91
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if it's a corporation,</v>

92
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>especially not the US government,</v>

93
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>because there's no accountability and you don't have to have a bottom line.</v>

94
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to produce a profit,</v>

95
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

96
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

97
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.511
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

98
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no marketplace telling you,</v>

99
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:56.111
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

100
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:56.791
<v Speaker 1>you go out of business.</v>

101
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean since what was it?</v>

102
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:00.990
<v Speaker 1>1960 fucking letters problem.</v>

103
00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:01.824
<v Speaker 1>It's a business.</v>

104
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.111
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

105
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:02.441
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

106
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>how many fortune five hundreds are have the 500 companies that were in</v>

107
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

108
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It started when they started tracking the fortune 500 how many are in existence</v>

109
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.020
<v Speaker 1>since 1967 how many earnings?</v>

110
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not the 500 I believe eight are still running.</v>

111
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Companies go out of business all the fucking time.</v>

112
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

113
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.353
<v Speaker 1>They just run out.</v>

114
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>They just run out of product to whatever their ship.</v>

115
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>That's how it goes.</v>

116
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:24.971
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>

117
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>These rooms for another startup.</v>

118
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

119
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.041
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

120
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Where that hasn't happened,</v>

121
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>the pharmaceutical industries there are so fucking big that they control the</v>

122
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>FDA.</v>

123
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>A whole nother story.</v>

124
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>So the point is this,</v>

125
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>my feeling,</v>

126
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.380
<v Speaker 1>my feeling is that the only way that you are always going to have private look</v>

127
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:41.351
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

128
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:42.810
<v Speaker 1>look at the military industrial complex.</v>

129
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>You are always going to have private sector people manipulating tax dollars and</v>

130
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>government agencies to their,</v>

131
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>to their benefit then and as a result,</v>

132
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible for the government not to get involved in the marketplace.</v>

133
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

134
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a free market,</v>

135
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a market system anymore,</v>

136
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>especially not in the banking industry has been regulated since fucking 1900</v>

137
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

138
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>So what I would do very simply is I'd have a flat tax and I would ultimately get</v>

139
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>rid of all subsidies,</v>

140
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>all except for Medicare,</v>

141
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.901
<v Speaker 1>Medicaid,</v>

142
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>and that I would hope and including social security,</v>

143
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:21.091
<v Speaker 1>I would overhaul in that I would find out who deserves fucking Medicare.</v>

144
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of very wealthy people who get it to shows all the sudden become</v>

145
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>a really boring political debate.</v>

146
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:27.814
<v Speaker 1>The issues,</v>

147
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

148
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>but it goes on forever.</v>

149
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>It does real specific where your points,</v>

150
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:32.451
<v Speaker 1>and I was starting to fade.</v>

151
00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>You should talk about the corruption in Avon and corporations.</v>

152
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Avon because pink cars,</v>

153
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>every time you talk about question,</v>

154
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I think both to bring it down to a general thing.</v>

155
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.051
<v Speaker 1>People understand.</v>

156
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

157
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>you just got to realize that.</v>

158
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Just always ask yourself,</v>

159
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck would I react in that situation?</v>

160
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>If you really learned about this stuff,</v>

161
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this shit is you get into these like these guys get in and stuff and</v>

162
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:50.900
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

163
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>that guy's fucking evil.</v>

164
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And in movies you see the evil guy with the black hat,</v>

165
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Shit's always way more complicated and way more fucking gray than that because</v>

166
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:58.931
<v Speaker 1>corporate,</v>

167
00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you know me,</v>

168
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 1>you've seen the documentary of the corporation,</v>

169
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

170
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Where they detail how corporations act as sociopath's,</v>

171
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>the act of psychopaths.</v>

172
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>They ask these people who don't care about the repercussions because there's a</v>

173
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>diffusion of responsibility because there's a million people in the corporation.</v>

174
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.063
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

175
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.593
<v Speaker 1>Deep Shit guys.</v>

176
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.423
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

178
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>when I look at what's going on right now,</v>

180
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I see a bunch of different factors and the big factor that I think is a not</v>

181
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:28.531
<v Speaker 1>being paid as much attention to in all of this is that the whole problem is the</v>

182
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>access to information and that this system has always been corrupt and the</v>

183
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>system has always been running fairly,</v>

184
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't know it.</v>

185
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what the way we know it now.</v>

186
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>And the access to information is unprecedented now.</v>

187
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>And because of the people were starting to exchange information and because of</v>

188
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>this access to information and social networking,</v>

189
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to do it in real time and they're organized.</v>

190
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:50.670
<v Speaker 1>It's also easy to manipulate information,</v>

191
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the irony of it is like you got you,</v>

193
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you have so much access to information,</v>

194
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy to manipulate.</v>

195
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>You see political parties do that shit all the time.</v>

196
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

197
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.851
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

198
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

199
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it's going to,</v>

200
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.860
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be something that allows people to know whether something not,</v>

201
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.703
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

202
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's when things are going to get really strange.</v>

203
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's really not that big of a deal to be able to exclude disinformation and</v>

204
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>incorrect information to have some way of proving things to be factually correct</v>

205
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.531
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

206
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:15.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>they released and spread their will.</v>

208
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not that far outside of the realm of possibility.</v>

209
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>So right now there's a,</v>

210
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 1>you mean it's whether or not you can prove something to be true and factual,</v>

211
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:25.661
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

213
00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:25.881
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

214
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:26.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>like when you look at like these databases like Wolfram Alpha and you know,</v>

216
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like Siri,</v>

217
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.861
<v Speaker 1>the Siri thing,</v>

218
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>we talking to the apple thing and it goes to the web and find out information</v>

219
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>and brings it back to you.</v>

220
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.860
<v Speaker 1>There's going to eventually be a very clear system of finding out what is true</v>

221
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>and what is not true.</v>

222
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.611
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a,</v>

223
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be very easy to detect what is propaganda,</v>

224
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>what is actual fact,</v>

225
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna be able to know it in real time.</v>

226
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>

227
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to be way harder to pull off corruption.</v>

228
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

229
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.721
<v Speaker 1>that's what I,</v>

230
00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I just keep wondering,</v>

231
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>like I always find myself asking how are things going to get better in 20 years?</v>

232
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Worst,</v>

233
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.921
<v Speaker 1>how about 40?</v>

234
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.401
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

235
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

236
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>here's what everybody's woe is being about.</v>

237
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

238
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

239
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>there was a study recently that I tweeted the talked about violence that it was</v>

240
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.090
<v Speaker 1>a um,</v>

241
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Kurt's well study violence is at an all time low in per capita.</v>

243
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Like people are much,</v>

244
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>much less violent and much it's life today as much safer than it's ever been at</v>

245
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>any other time in human history.</v>

246
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Things are getting better.</v>

247
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just right now I think we're in the process of a birth,</v>

248
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>we're in the process of a,</v>

249
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>another stage and it's really close to bottlenecking.</v>

250
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.863
<v Speaker 1>There's with the,</v>

251
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.201
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

252
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 1>the influx of technology and information into the world of the monkey is,</v>

253
00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:39.091
<v Speaker 1>is so complete right now and we are biologically struggling to keep up with all</v>

254
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 1>this new shit that's going on around us all the time and all this new</v>

255
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>information and all these new challenges and all this,</v>

256
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

258
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

259
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 1>these new issues that are presenting themselves to us.</v>

260
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's thing because of technology,</v>

261
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>it almost feels like,</v>

262
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.200
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about the planet and it's warming and all that stuff.</v>

264
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

265
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like is that,</v>

266
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 1>is that essentially like,</v>

267
00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

268
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

269
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

270
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we keep growing as like literally an organism where we're going to</v>

271
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 1>have to mesh with machines just to survive in an environment.</v>

272
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 1>It's all kind of part of it,</v>

273
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

274
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:09.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>there's also the idea that machines are a life form in and of itself.</v>

276
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.130
<v Speaker 1>You look like,</v>

277
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

278
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.021
<v Speaker 1>I've always said this,</v>

279
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like,</v>

280
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm stupid,</v>

281
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I could keep old computers.</v>

282
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.101
<v Speaker 1>I have like an old,</v>

283
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 1>a gray,</v>

284
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:20.361
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>

285
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:20.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

286
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Tan Apple fucking towers.</v>

287
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It's in my garage somewhere.</v>

288
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work anymore.</v>

289
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I have an old laptop with a little track wheel on it and it doesn't work anymore</v>

290
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

291
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Those are skeletons.</v>

292
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Those are dead animals.</v>

293
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are things that they,</v>

294
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:31.971
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

295
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>their predecessors,</v>

296
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:33.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

297
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:34.830
<v Speaker 1>or rather there were,</v>

298
00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Speaker 1>there they are,</v>

299
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>the predecessors from today's sleek laptops,</v>

300
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

302
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>they're old shitty,</v>

303
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:41.431
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

304
00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:42.231
<v Speaker 1>they're clunky.</v>

305
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>They make weird noises when he turned them on.</v>

306
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

307
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are essentially the monkeys of the,</v>

308
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>in comparison to us and I think it's real possible.</v>

310
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>But if we do have some sort of an artificial intelligence and we do create a</v>

311
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>life form out of computers,</v>

312
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>is able to recreate other life forms,</v>

313
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably the next stage.</v>

314
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so we,</v>

315
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>when we personally think that it's so important that we continue this,</v>

316
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.740
<v Speaker 1>this animal struggle with emotions and sperm and eggs and biology as we know it,</v>

317
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>when biology is we're knowing might be biology,</v>

318
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>we might be much more comfortable inside of a robot.</v>

319
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.041
<v Speaker 1>But I was going to say,</v>

320
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

321
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.521
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

322
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:20.721
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

323
00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:20.871
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

324
00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>but human beings,</v>

325
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>it seems are on the verge of actually creating a whole,</v>

326
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>a whole new kind of bio synthetic biology that we're going to be able to match.</v>

327
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>But who's to say that that's synthetic biology?</v>

328
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't be just as way better or a better way better man.</v>

329
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.121
<v Speaker 1>This is like a,</v>

330
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.491
<v Speaker 1>W we,</v>

331
00:09:36.491 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>we have is like an old car that's made out of cardboard.</v>

332
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:39.421
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

333
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:44.421
<v Speaker 1>And we're on our way to building some fucking carbon fiber fiber optic laced</v>

334
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Speaker 1>electronic fucking mid engine beast,</v>

335
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 1>constructing ears that can hear a mile away,</v>

336
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:49.921
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

337
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

338
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it keeps raining and our fucking cardboard house slowly falling</v>

339
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:54.331
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

340
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>But like Jesus Christ,</v>

341
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.990
<v Speaker 1>hurry up,</v>

342
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.460
<v Speaker 1>fix this cardboard car,</v>

343
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>the cardboard cars all fucked up and the new cars not ready yet.</v>

344
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of whether or not we can complete our cycle of,</v>

345
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.401
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

346
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>of technology and artificial intelligence.</v>

347
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And then combined with it before we blow ourselves up,</v>

348
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:10.931
<v Speaker 1>you have very,</v>

349
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:11.860
<v Speaker 1>very smart people.</v>

350
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

351
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:12.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

352
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.570
<v Speaker 1>reengineering,</v>

353
00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.280
<v Speaker 1>reverse engineering the brain,</v>

354
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.031
<v Speaker 1>the eardrum,</v>

355
00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:16.864
<v Speaker 1>the eye,</v>

356
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.890
<v Speaker 1>the red blood cell.</v>

357
00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:20.770
<v Speaker 1>We just reverse engineered the red blood cell of a dog.</v>

358
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.120
<v Speaker 1>And that means that if you reverse engineer it and you know exactly how it</v>

359
00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:25.391
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

360
00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.030
<v Speaker 1>you can make a replica of it with synthetic material.</v>

361
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

362
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.610
<v Speaker 1>and which would be a Nano Bot because it can,</v>

363
00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:31.750
<v Speaker 1>it's about that big.</v>

364
00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:31.961
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

365
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:36.040
<v Speaker 1>so pan on nanotechnology and then re replicating what you just reverse</v>

366
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:36.790
<v Speaker 1>engineered.</v>

367
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.960
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that,</v>

368
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>then it is.</v>

369
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It is clear and it follows up.</v>

370
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:41.081
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

371
00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:43.660
<v Speaker 1>we're also doing with an I or doing it with an eardrum,</v>

372
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.470
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

373
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.790
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that well,</v>

374
00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:49.360
<v Speaker 1>when is the brain when they're already working on trying to reverse engineer the</v>

375
00:10:49.361 --> 00:10:49.840
<v Speaker 1>brain?</v>

376
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.660
<v Speaker 1>It really fucking is really cool questions.</v>

377
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It really does,</v>

378
00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:54.431
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

379
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:58.030
<v Speaker 1>because if you can do that and you can create a machine,</v>

380
00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.140
<v Speaker 1>it's the blade runner question.</v>

381
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.450
<v Speaker 1>When does it become a person you know when fucking,</v>

382
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.060
<v Speaker 1>what's her name and blade runner?</v>

383
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:05.800
<v Speaker 1>The Really Daryl Hannah.</v>

384
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 1>When she cried when she was sad.</v>

385
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel sad for her?</v>

386
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.453
<v Speaker 1>She's beautiful.</v>

387
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 1>She's a robot robot robot.</v>

388
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:12.024
<v Speaker 1>The want some deck.</v>

389
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.873
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

390
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.460
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

391
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.293
<v Speaker 1>You can kill you.</v>

392
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.953
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

393
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd like if you fuck a robot that's really lifelike.</v>

394
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Is that cheating?</v>

395
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

396
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

397
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.231
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen?</v>

398
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Because the robot's going to go to your house and kill your wife because your</v>

399
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>wife wants to unplug it.</v>

400
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Robots have emotions,</v>

402
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:28.051
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

403
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:28.771
<v Speaker 1>They build them in.</v>

404
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:29.670
<v Speaker 1>If they build an emotion,</v>

405
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.421
<v Speaker 1>if they're going to build in,</v>

406
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 1>something's going to be kind to you.</v>

407
00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>The only way kindness counts is if you earn it kindness.</v>

408
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're just an emperor and you walk in and everybody just sucks your Dick</v>

409
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:38.210
<v Speaker 1>after awhile,</v>

410
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>the chicken is boring.</v>

411
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>You know the Yin and the Yang of things is there for a reason.</v>

412
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to have struggled in order to appreciate the good times.</v>

413
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You cannot,</v>

414
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't appreciate relaxing unless I put in hard work.</v>

415
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:48.474
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

416
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest question was a lot of computer scientists who are saying when</v>

417
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>these robots will,</v>

418
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 1>which means they,</v>

419
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.501
<v Speaker 1>when you say that,</v>

420
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 1>and when they develop consciousness,</v>

421
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>meaning they are conscious of their own existence,</v>

422
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>the nature of anything that is conscious of its own existence or even just</v>

423
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>having its own existence,</v>

424
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a cancer cell and aunt or a human being,</v>

425
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 1>is that you want to replicate and stay alive forever and,</v>

426
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

427
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>but those are biological instincts because they're,</v>

428
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 1>they're programmed into the world that we operate.</v>

429
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 1>We are creating,</v>

430
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 1>computers are going to be essentially the exact,</v>

431
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:23.734
<v Speaker 1>the mimic.</v>

432
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 1>We are mimicking ourselves,</v>

433
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily true because there's no benefit to staying alive.</v>

434
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.640
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

435
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 1>What benefit does the computer have to maintain in consciousness?</v>

436
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:32.861
<v Speaker 1>If there's no,</v>

437
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 1>if there's no cells or genetics or hormones pumped into your system telling you</v>

438
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 1>stick it in there and shoot off loads because you want to breed.</v>

439
00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

440
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.171
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

441
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>where's the incentive?</v>

442
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.820
<v Speaker 1>What happens does not the computer,</v>

443
00:12:43.821 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>if it's infinitely wise,</v>

444
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 1>doesn't embrace the notion that it does not have to be a complete because what</v>

445
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 1>it is is a part of everything in the first place and there's the idea of life is</v>

446
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>not really necessary.</v>

447
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just we hold onto it because biologically it's how we spread our work.</v>

448
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>We spread our work and you're never going to die anyway.</v>

449
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.061
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

450
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:01.391
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

451
00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 1>The computer should be smart enough to know,</v>

452
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

453
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Shut me off bitch.</v>

454
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That's I'm here forever.</v>

455
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:05.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

456
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:05.801
<v Speaker 1>they had seen that.</v>

457
00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:08.560
<v Speaker 1>What about when they start making computers that are smarter than them and all</v>

458
00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

459
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

460
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.440
<v Speaker 1>they become infinitely smart almost immediately.</v>

461
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that people always say,</v>

462
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:12.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

463
00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 1>if they're going to have respect for our biological heritage and what they don't</v>

464
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.450
<v Speaker 1>realize that we're going to be changing too.</v>

465
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're going to be changing case.</v>

466
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I think when you start talking about computers being this advanced,</v>

467
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about human beings because I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

468
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they got a bio,</v>

469
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:26.134
<v Speaker 1>chem,</v>

470
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 1>bio compatible machine that I can download information into et Cetera,</v>

471
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.171
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

472
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have it in your body attached already to my fucking phone.</v>

473
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:36.171
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

474
00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>my phone is a part of me.</v>

475
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>When I leave my house and I don't have my iPhone,</v>

476
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm missing a part of my body.</v>

477
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:41.891
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

478
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:43.210
<v Speaker 1>if you read Tim Ferriss's book,</v>

479
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>did you read the part about having a cell phone in your pocket?</v>

480
00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:47.100
<v Speaker 1>How it cooks your fucking ball?</v>

481
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

482
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he did was he did a test on his sperm count and he did a</v>

483
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 1>test and found out that a sperm count was fairly low and he's a really good</v>

484
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:56.770
<v Speaker 1>shape and he's young and he was like,</v>

485
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:57.850
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

486
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.690
<v Speaker 1>So then he starts doing all this reading on different studies and one of the</v>

487
00:14:01.691 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>things he comes to his studies about cell phone usage and keeping your cell</v>

488
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>phone in your front pocket and how it affects your sperm count.</v>

489
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>The radiation from your fucking cell phone diminishes your sperm count.</v>

490
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:13.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

491
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:14.410
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even carry it on him anymore.</v>

492
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:14.651
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

493
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:16.490
<v Speaker 1>he shuts it off and he puts on his pocket and</v>

494
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

495
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.293
<v Speaker 1>I've always done anyway,</v>

496
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.520
<v Speaker 1>but I have it in my pocket all the time and he said that he took,</v>

497
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.730
<v Speaker 1>took the time off,</v>

498
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.420
<v Speaker 1>stopped having the phone in his pocket.</v>

499
00:14:26.421 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 1>It started eating Brazil nuts.</v>

500
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they have zinc in them and it's a very healthy for bringing back your</v>

501
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 1>sperm count in a misnomer for everybody listening.</v>

502
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Brazil nuts can also be very,</v>

503
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:36.671
<v Speaker 1>very allergic.</v>

504
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:37.504
<v Speaker 1>My mother will die.</v>

505
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>My mother will die if she eats one.</v>

506
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

507
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 1>if I want one,</v>

508
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:41.920
<v Speaker 1>my whole throat closes.</v>

509
00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat some right in front of you.</v>

510
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.573
<v Speaker 1>Brazil nuts.</v>

511
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.053
<v Speaker 1>Just make sure you're not,</v>

512
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.013
<v Speaker 1>you're not allergic.</v>

513
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

514
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.120
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

515
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.590
<v Speaker 1>good call.</v>

516
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.841
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

517
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>so either way I take zinc supplements or do whatever the fuck is Ferris did.</v>

518
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>And by taking the phone out of his pocket,</v>

519
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:55.980
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

520
00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 1>radically increase the sperm count.</v>

522
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.230
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

523
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.063
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good book.</v>

524
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.363
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

525
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

526
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 1>that was in with that in the second chapter.</v>

527
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

528
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno what chapters did.</v>

529
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I read it on the toilet.</v>

530
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.340
<v Speaker 1>So I pick it up and I'll read it.</v>

531
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

532
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I've been eating so well,</v>

533
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>my toilet trips have been shorter and shorter.</v>

534
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.051
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

535
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:12.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 1>when I was just eating straight,</v>

537
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:14.760
<v Speaker 1>meet Brock Lesnar status.</v>

538
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

539
00:15:15.251 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>take these giant dinosaurs shits that would take 20 minutes and I would look</v>

540
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>just like orange fears,</v>

541
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 1>jug out my legs would go numb,</v>

542
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>my feet would go numb.</v>

543
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a hard time standing up,</v>

544
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.371
<v Speaker 1>but I've been,</v>

545
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

546
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 1>drinking this a Kale shake.</v>

547
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I make every morning now.</v>

548
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

549

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

550
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I cut it in this crazy Vitamix blender.</v>

551
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I throw in cucumbers and Kale and man,</v>

552
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I feel so good.</v>

553
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 1>You have so much energy.</v>

554
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:38.271
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

555
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:38.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

556
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.273
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have energy for days.</v>

571
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.900
<v Speaker 1>It's just incredible.</v>

572

<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that,</v>

576
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

577
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I know food tastes fucking delicious.</v>

578
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:03.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

579
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

580
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first guy after a comedy show,</v>

581
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:05.811
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

582
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:10.490
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to canter's and I'll have a giant fucking Pastrami Reuben with French</v>

583
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:11.031
<v Speaker 1>fries.</v>

584
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And you're getting the nutrition you need.</v>

585
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Most people are walking around and malnourished.</v>

586
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:13.951
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

587
00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

588
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.550
<v Speaker 1>And then the shit food treats.</v>

589
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

590
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.011
<v Speaker 1>And you're not,</v>

591
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 1>not just vitamins either.</v>

592
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I used to try to just do it with vitamins.</v>

593
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think multivitamins are important.</v>

594
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to recommend to,</v>

595
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if like,</v>

596
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I think certain people with certain demands have higher demands.</v>

598
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Like especially if you're an athlete,</v>

599
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing a lot of Jujitsu,</v>

600
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 1>like when people say,</v>

601
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you know what you need for a,</v>

602
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:37.401
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

603
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 1>your recommended daily requirement of vitamins and protein,</v>

604
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:40.574
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

605
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I always look at them and I go,</v>

606
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:42.020
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

607
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 1>but what are you doing physical?</v>

608
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing what I'm doing man,</v>

609
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 1>because I'm fighting for my life?</v>

610
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

611
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think people understand that.</v>

612
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

613
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:49.911
<v Speaker 1>I did a thing,</v>

614
00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

615
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 1>men's fitness this month,</v>

616
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing on my workout,</v>

617
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:53.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:53.401
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

619
00:16:53.401 --> 00:16:53.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

620
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.311
<v Speaker 1>they did this whole,</v>

621
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

622
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 1>thing on my kettlebell workout and now Steve Mack Walls Maxwell's in town and</v>

623
00:16:58.341 --> 00:16:59.720
<v Speaker 1>we'll working out this weekend together too.</v>

624
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm super excited about that.</v>

625
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 1>This week I'm going to do some hardcore kettlebell drills.</v>

626
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.820
<v Speaker 1>People don't fucking realize how hard some people work out and I don't work out</v>

627
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>nearly as hard as the guy like Cain Velasquez does,</v>

628
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>or a guy like George Saint Pierre does.</v>

629
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I just simply don't put in the amount of sessions in a week that they do.</v>

630
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>But when I do do it,</v>

631
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I go fucking all out and you can't do that and just eat spaghetti.</v>

632
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't do that and not have vitamins and not have protein.</v>

633
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

634
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I have one of the things that I've done over the course of being involved in</v>

635
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:31.580
<v Speaker 1>combat sports since I was literally a child,</v>

636
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

637
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:32.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

638
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had a moment since I was 14 years old that I wasn't learning or</v>

639
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>practicing some type of martial art.</v>

640
00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 1>It became an obsession super early in my life and that there's a direct</v>

641
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:45.800
<v Speaker 1>correlation to me with good performance,</v>

642
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.910
<v Speaker 1>good movement,</v>

643
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 1>healthy body,</v>

644
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:48.681
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

645
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:49.080
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>

646
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.440
<v Speaker 1>and Diet by when I've eaten sheriff tillers talking about,</v>

647
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:52.741
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

648
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 1>food is a drug and how you,</v>

649
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.680
<v Speaker 1>the way you combine it,</v>

650
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the kind of food you take in,</v>

651
00:17:57.061 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 1>it will react within your body exactly the way a drug,</v>

652
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

653
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 1>either it will have a positive hormonal effect,</v>

654
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>a negative hormonal.</v>

655
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>The problem is good food.</v>

656
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of shit foods,</v>

657
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:07.971
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

658
00:18:07.971 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it's got no or very little nutrients,</v>

659
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 1>but God damn it tastes good.</v>

660
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

661
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I have a pineapple and anchovy pizza.</v>

662
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my big fucking problems.</v>

663
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.951
<v Speaker 1>I've got a problem.</v>

664
00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I like double and pineapple,</v>

665
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 1>double anchovies.</v>

666
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.011
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

667
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 1>That's filled with arsenic and all kinds of creepy fucking shit and that ocean,</v>

668
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 1>that ocean is just filled with heavy metal poisoning and a,</v>

669
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

670
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking,</v>

671
00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I got a real problem,</v>

672
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 1>but after I eat it,</v>

673
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I feel like shit.</v>

674
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like I got harpooned like I got shot with some animal</v>

675
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 1>tranquilizer.</v>

676
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that the way that to start eating better is first of all to to educate</v>

677
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>yourself and start eating better,</v>

678
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but then just start noticing the difference.</v>

679
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is you start getting a pleasurable response when you eat</v>

680
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 1>well and what's good for your body and a negative response when you go out and</v>

681
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.480
<v Speaker 1>eat a whole pizza at pizza or whatever you,</v>

682
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.091
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

683
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

684
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you won't feel as good as if you have a shake.</v>

685
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking about it.</v>

686
00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:57.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

687
00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>my point was this was,</v>

688
00:18:59.131 --> 00:18:59.851
<v Speaker 1>this is my point.</v>

689
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:02.670
<v Speaker 1>My point is in all my years I've done it both ways.</v>

690
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I've done it where I eat shit food and I've done it where I really good food and</v>

691
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:06.760
<v Speaker 1>when I do,</v>

692
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>when I really good food,</v>

693
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I have a different body.</v>

694
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>

695
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It works way better.</v>

696
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.820
<v Speaker 1>It just works way better.</v>

697
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Nobody before they get into the UFC eats fucking three Carls jr break bacon</v>

698
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburgers and fries and a large coke.</v>

699
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>You just don't do that because if you do,</v>

700
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:22.350
<v Speaker 1>your body's going to perform like shit.</v>

701
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

702
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Because your body is fighting off poison.</v>

703
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Your body is in a war to process all this shit.</v>

704
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Saturated fats and trans fats and those fats with Dick's,</v>

705
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 1>right Brian?</v>

706
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.253
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

707
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:35.881
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

708
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

709
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.523
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

710
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I was just kidding about the making out with the transvestite.</v>

711
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And my friends thought,</v>

712
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:43.950
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

713
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 1>somebody needs to,</v>

715
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.900
<v Speaker 1>somebody needs to create a guide for life and have all these different ideas in</v>

716
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

717
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 1>And one of them has got to be the importance of diet and exercise.</v>

718
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:58.200
<v Speaker 1>And even though I know a lot of smart fucking people,</v>

719
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I know so many intelligent people who are really super creative and really</v>

720
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 1>interesting and they don't take care of their fucking shell.</v>

721
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.670
<v Speaker 1>They don't take care of their body man.</v>

722
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.061
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

723
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand.</v>

724
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And they'll look at you like your a frivolous or like you're,</v>

725
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

726
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

727
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of negative connotation.</v>

728
00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like when I call you a health nut,</v>

729
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

730
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a health nut or you're an exercise freak.</v>

731
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:19.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

732
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:19.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

733
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you're narcissistic because the inclination,</v>

734
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.850
<v Speaker 1>the implication.</v>

735
00:20:22.851 --> 00:20:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Now I just know that I feel way better and way more productive when I,</v>

736
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 1>when I'm,</v>

737
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 1>when I'm like this,</v>

738
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 1>then I will,</v>

739
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have a belly when I'm fucking,</v>

740
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.930
<v Speaker 1>45 50 55 they say a certain percentage of people who have chimpanzee DNA.</v>

742
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I have chimpanzee Danae I mean not just chimpanzee DNA,</v>

743
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 1>rather neanderthal DNA.</v>

744
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>

745
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I got some of the on a tall in my past,</v>

746
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about it.</v>

747
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I this was like a certain percentage of humans and large number.</v>

748
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

749
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 1>We somehow or another assimilated with the neanderthals.</v>

750
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.790
<v Speaker 1>They didn't use to think that they take that now muscular like stronger.</v>

751
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.291
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

752
00:20:55.291 --> 00:20:55.511
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

753
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I think you know that that has to do with what part of environment,</v>

754
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:58.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:20:58.391 --> 00:20:58.571
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

756
00:20:58.571 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 1>your DNA comes from,</v>

757
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:00.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

758
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:05.011
<v Speaker 1>whether you or your family were Sicilian peasants that are carrying rocks all</v>

759
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.273
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

760
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.861
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

761
00:21:07.861 --> 00:21:08.191
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

762
00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 1>and endomorphs seem to be a function of society and in Diet and also the,</v>

763
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they're finding out is a stress from inside the womb.</v>

764
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:16.970
<v Speaker 1>If they're the,</v>

765
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

766
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.160
<v Speaker 1>the mother during pregnancy is malnourished in any way.</v>

767
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.280
<v Speaker 1>The kid has an inclination to hold on to carbs and fats and they're like,</v>

768
00:21:25.281 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

769
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.591
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

770
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>there was another part of that zeitgeists thing that was really interesting.</v>

771
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:29.600
<v Speaker 1>It was a whole,</v>

772
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that that,</v>

773
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

774
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.700
<v Speaker 1>the Zike is the part that I watch the only watch the first 15 minutes or so.</v>

775
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.271
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

776
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:34.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

777
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:36.640
<v Speaker 1>what was really interesting about it was all the different things they were</v>

778
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:37.211
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

779
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:39.200
<v Speaker 1>about health and cancer and,</v>

780
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.780
<v Speaker 1>and illnesses and about,</v>

781
00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

782
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.370
<v Speaker 1>people who develop breast cancer.</v>

783
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:43.280
<v Speaker 1>There's like a gene,</v>

784
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.103
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

785
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get breast cancer and they can find that gene and say,</v>

786
00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 1>you are susceptible to breast cancer.</v>

787
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 1>People who have breast cancer,</v>

788
00:21:50.771 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 1>only three out of 10 have that gene.</v>

789
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Seven out of 10 don't have that gene.</v>

790
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

791
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

792
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.650
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to figure out,</v>

793
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:56.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

794
00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 1>what is it that causes people to get cancer?</v>

795
00:21:58.930 --> 00:21:59.201
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

796
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 1>it causes people to be,</v>

797
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

798
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.450
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

799
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 1>to have a violent behavior?</v>

800
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:03.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

801
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:04.121
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

802
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 1>what are their genes for violent behavior?</v>

803
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:06.401
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

804
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

805
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:07.130
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

806
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.150
<v Speaker 1>they're realizing people who've been abused at childhood have a different</v>

807
00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 1>genetic structure.</v>

808
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Then people haven't been in their body,</v>

809
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:14.530
<v Speaker 1>their body reboots or jacks,</v>

810
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 1>your body triggers to structure can change your body changes to deal with this</v>

811
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>horrible environment and this horrible hand we live in dealt with evolution,</v>

812
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:23.224
<v Speaker 1>immediate evolution.</v>

813
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.323
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>

814
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 1>the system is is all set up to respond to whatever is coming in made sense</v>

815
00:22:29.111 --> 00:22:29.291
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

816
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 1>You know it's like I was talking to John Brenkus who does that show sports</v>

817
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 1>science and they were talking about feel Max and they were,</v>

818
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 1>they tried to tire can't Velazco guys out and they hadn't been running,</v>

819
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.640
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't get his heart rate over 165 a based no matter what they do,</v>

820
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking with that guy.</v>

821
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.900
<v Speaker 1>And some of it is that there's definitely like some people have like a certain</v>

822
00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:52.690
<v Speaker 1>genetic structure where they can utilize oxygen better,</v>

823
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.750
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it's,</v>

824
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

825
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
<v Speaker 1>it's also repetition and practice and body kids incredibly adapt.</v>

826
00:22:59.410 --> 00:22:59.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

827
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't have that kind of cardio if you didn't train.</v>

828
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got definitely,</v>

829
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 1>he's got some freak genetics,</v>

830
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 1>but guess what a lot of Mexicans do.</v>

831
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Mexicans have amazing endurance.</v>

832
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You know Julio Cesar Chavez was known for barely training and he had amazing</v>

833
00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:13.690
<v Speaker 1>endurance like at some of his fights.</v>

834
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:16.090
<v Speaker 1>He like he would just come in and just beat the fuck out of guys,</v>

835
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:17.750
<v Speaker 1>break them down the pace and you never done,</v>

836
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.673
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

837
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.140
<v Speaker 1>you just rake your body.</v>

838
00:23:20.141 --> 00:23:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

839
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a documentary on Gilbert Melendez is the strike force lightweight</v>

840
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:24.311
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

841
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:25.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a Mexican dude.</v>

842
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Amazing endurance.</v>

843
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:27.184
<v Speaker 1>His kid is,</v>

844
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 1>he's known for just putting it on people and he has even said that he thinks</v>

845
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:32.260
<v Speaker 1>that part of his endurance is genetic.</v>

846
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Obviously works as hard as any professional athlete on the planet,</v>

847
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 1>but as long distance runners come from Peru and so that's a different,</v>

848
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 1>that's activity in Peru I'm saying.</v>

849
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

850
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.610
<v Speaker 1>but different activity,</v>

851
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:44.360
<v Speaker 1>long distance running is all,</v>

852
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.513
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

853
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a different,</v>

854
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of cardio that you haven't fighting where you have</v>

855
00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 1>anaerobic and aerobic all mixed in together.</v>

856
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 1>That's like real combat,</v>

857
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.630
<v Speaker 1>like sort of cardio.</v>

858
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of cardio.</v>

859
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.210
<v Speaker 1>I asked me why I liked,</v>

860
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.073
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

861
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.600
<v Speaker 1>why I love MMA so much that it's the Ross.</v>

862
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Was this a girl or a guy that was asking this question?</v>

863
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.310
<v Speaker 1>If you did,</v>

864
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you grab her by the nape of the hair in the back of her neck and you just,</v>

865
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.960
<v Speaker 1>just gently wrap your cock or on their lips slop.</v>

866
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:13.521
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>

867
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I got to get a spanking.</v>

868
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

869
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 1>And then put it back in your pants.</v>

870
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.611
<v Speaker 1>Don't even have a socket.</v>

871
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Just put a bug in your parents just,</v>

872
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.231
<v Speaker 1>just to,</v>

873
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 1>just for the fuck out of her dirty bitch.</v>

874
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Why do I like what?</v>

875
00:24:22.031 --> 00:24:22.331
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

876
00:24:22.331 --> 00:24:23.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just so I got,</v>

877
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I just got a little bit of a bonus just now,</v>

878
00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:26.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

879
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it's literally like,</v>

880
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:29.420
<v Speaker 1>it's the Ross form of competition.</v>

881
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.283
<v Speaker 1>Of course guys fight,</v>

882
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:31.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:31.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

884
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.590
<v Speaker 1>the movie warrior did not get its fair shake.</v>

885
00:24:33.591 --> 00:24:35.590
<v Speaker 1>You were in warrior and you had a great roles.</v>

886
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:35.861
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

887
00:24:35.861 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 1>it was a fun role,</v>

888
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.450
<v Speaker 1>but that movie did not get its fair shake.</v>

889
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:39.340
<v Speaker 1>That was a great movie.</v>

890
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.210
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even factual.</v>

891
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.201
<v Speaker 1>It was silly.</v>

892
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 1>They fought for two days in a row and it was a little crazy tournament,</v>

893
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't matter.</v>

894
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 1>The just the story itself and maybe they could have worked around that where</v>

895
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have a two day tournament or whatever,</v>

896
00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:55.160
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't matter though the story and the movie worked.</v>

897
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.270
<v Speaker 1>It was a good movie.</v>

898
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

899
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It was decent.</v>

900
00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It was great and a very few.</v>

901
00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck moments I like to do shows nobody watches like death valley by the</v>

902
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:04.034
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

903
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.083
<v Speaker 1>That's not tonight.</v>

904
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Tonight.</v>

905
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Monday at 11 nobody's watching it.</v>

906
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.551
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

907
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great show man.</v>

908
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Really funny to watch it tonight.</v>

909
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.721
<v Speaker 1>I told you I'll do it.</v>

910
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to play a werewolf man.</v>

911
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.581
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

912
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:14.211
<v Speaker 1>if we get picked up,</v>

913
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:14.841
<v Speaker 1>I already talked to them.</v>

914
00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:17.180
<v Speaker 1>They loved the idea that like Joe Rogan play Werewolf.</v>

915
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>It'd be awesome.</v>

916
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.793
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to play.</v>

917
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 1>How good are the special effects?</v>

918
00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to play a tape.</v>

919
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I watched ginger snaps last night.</v>

920
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me to rent ginger snaps like dude's good mood werewolf movie.</v>

921
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny for a long time.</v>

922
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:29.551
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fun.</v>

923
00:25:29.551 --> 00:25:31.900
<v Speaker 1>It's about two girls that are going through high school and they're,</v>

924
00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:32.601
<v Speaker 1>they're loners,</v>

925
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of outsiders and they're sisters and they're kind of golf and one</v>

926
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:37.010
<v Speaker 1>of them gets bit by a werewolf.</v>

927
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking funny.</v>

928
00:25:38.031 --> 00:25:42.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good stuff to it up until you see the Werewolf and it's like</v>

929
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.251
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

930
00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you have any budget?</v>

931
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

932
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:50.231
<v Speaker 1>it looks like they take a balloon and drew a Werewolf scary face on the blue and</v>

933
00:25:50.451 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 1>stuck it in your face.</v>

934
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the wolf man.</v>

935
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So bad.</v>

936
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.670
<v Speaker 1>A great special effects man.</v>

937
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of the show.</v>

938
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.491
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>

939
00:25:58.491 --> 00:25:59.324
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really funny.</v>

940
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's on MTV.</v>

941
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:01.634
<v Speaker 1>What time?</v>

942
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.640
<v Speaker 1>11 o'clock on Monday tonight.</v>

943
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Watch it tonight.</v>

944
00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:10.031
<v Speaker 1>Schedule it on my phone right now and I think tomorrow we got Josh McDermitt.</v>

945
00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Josh supposed to be doing it because we started doing this thing from the Ice</v>

946
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.070
<v Speaker 1>House live at the Ice House and it's on,</v>

947
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.290
<v Speaker 1>it's broken up into two parts.</v>

948
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:21.380
<v Speaker 1>One part is on my iTunes,</v>

949
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 1>on the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

950
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 1>And the other part is on desk squad and a desk squad is the one that Brian runs.</v>

951
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.880
<v Speaker 1>And what it essentially is,</v>

952
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.481
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

953
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:29.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

954
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.200
<v Speaker 1>it's all of our friends that have podcasts like Thompson Guerra.</v>

955
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.831
<v Speaker 1>We're talking,</v>

956
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Brian counted doing one.</v>

957
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.070
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do one now too.</v>

958
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

959
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I am Sam triple.</v>

960
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 1>He does it all these different people do it.</v>

961
00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And we decided to,</v>

962
00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:40.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

963
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.070
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good way to also promote death squads.</v>

964
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 1>We have it set up.</v>

965
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it on that red bands.</v>

966
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.603
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

967
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that's fine yet.</v>

968
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And we start Brendan Walsh,</v>

969
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:48.731
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

970
00:26:48.731 --> 00:26:49.240
<v Speaker 1>this week too.</v>

971
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'm gonna start my podcast just going to be,</v>

972
00:26:51.081 --> 00:26:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say,</v>

973
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have,</v>

974
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm just gonna ask them like 10 really good questions.</v>

975
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to do that,</v>

976
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:56.431
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

977
00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:57.370
<v Speaker 1>You're a conversationalist.</v>

978
00:26:57.371 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Just anything that's interesting to you.</v>

979
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Just sit down and talk about it though there.</v>

980
00:27:00.011 --> 00:27:00.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

981
00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:00.871
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

982
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you should have a podcast.</v>

983
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

984
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 1>You're a fascinating dude and you know,</v>

985
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be fun in it.</v>

986
00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It helps you evolve ideas and people call you on your bullshit and it helps you.</v>

987
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It also helps you realize like how many times you repeat the same things over</v>

988
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

989
00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:15.270
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

990
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:19.020
<v Speaker 1>how many subjects you obsess on it and it becomes a normal part of your everyday</v>

991
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

992
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.390
<v Speaker 1>But when you start trying to pump that on a podcast,</v>

993
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:21.691
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>

994
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 1>look bitch,</v>

995
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.973
<v Speaker 1>I heard that already.</v>

996
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Stop fucking freaking out about the same thing every God damn week.</v>

997
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

998
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you gotta evolve.</v>

999
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Well we talked about occupy Wall Street like three times in a row now,</v>

1001
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're,</v>

1002
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 1>we're also doing it with different people just sort of get their different</v>

1003
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 1>reactions because I think this is a pretty important part of human history right</v>

1004

<v Speaker 1>What inspires you is not even so much the person but the effort.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Africa can suck my dick insects the size of your fucking forearms.</v>

1052
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.510
<v Speaker 1>How about the parasites?</v>

1053

00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:13.680

1058
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 1>it camped out in my body and grew and made a chain all the way to my brain and</v>

1059
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 1>it started sucking brain juice out of my big toe and I went to the doctor's</v>

1060
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:20.461
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1061

<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's going on?</v>

1066
00:29:24.201 --> 00:29:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Or there's a pipeline between your fucking brain and your toe created by some</v>

1067
00:29:26.821 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 1>parasite.</v>

1068

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1069
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe I just made it up.</v>

1070
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.040
<v Speaker 1>But maybe it could be true.</v>

1071
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.020
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of shit inside Africa that can Africa twice.</v>

00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:34.651
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you up.</v>

1088
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>In Africa for example,</v>

1089
00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 1>we've been banging around the idea of a cell phones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's been out there for God since the Hutu Rwanda massacre and this motherfucker</v>

<v Speaker 1>He wasn't bloody.</v>

1323
00:35:59.581 --> 00:36:02.180
<v Speaker 1>And then he became bloody and they killed him.</v>

1324
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.590
<v Speaker 1>They beat the fuck out of him and killed him and they don't show the video of</v>
