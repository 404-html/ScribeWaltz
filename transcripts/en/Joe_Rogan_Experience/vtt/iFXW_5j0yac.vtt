00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.110
<v Speaker 1>My day,</v>

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>So you were asking me before this about the fights this weekend.</v>

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.911
<v Speaker 1>What are you feeling?</v>

5
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Finger because where they were counter starker that's why they,</v>

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>they keep the distance and they'd know exactly that.</v>

7
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think a lot of people were like pissed off.</v>

8
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>It was boring.</v>

9
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's because they just want to see people beat the fuck out of</v>

10
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:22.681
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

11
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>which I understand that's why you tuned into cage fighting.</v>

12
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>But to me the way I always described martial arts is it's high level problem</v>

13
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>solving with dire physical consequences.</v>

14
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you run in on Tyron Woodley,</v>

15
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you got some dire physical consequences.</v>

16
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking powerhouse.</v>

17
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And if Woodley charges at Thompson,</v>

18
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>there's dire physical consequences cause he was getting tagged when he would he</v>

19
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>need set it to me after the fight.</v>

20
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:48.091
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

21
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>he caught me a few times as I was charging towards him.</v>

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>So Woodley has a different style in Thompson.</v>

23
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Thompson has that wide stance,</v>

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>that karate style and he's excellent at moving in and moving out and almost like</v>

25
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>point fighting you.</v>

26
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>He's just jabbing you,</v>

27
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>hitting you with these,</v>

28
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>clean left hands,</v>

30
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>sliding out of the way.</v>

31
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally throwing kicks.</v>

32
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>But mostly what he's doing is making you wonder what he's gonna do and when he's</v>

33
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>coming at you and Woodley had to pick his battles and figure out when he could</v>

34
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>launch himself at them.</v>

35
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>So at any moment something could have happened,</v>

36
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of shit didn't happen.</v>

37
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>So the people watching at home,</v>

38
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>but that was more boring forever.</v>

39
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's because those moments are so critical.</v>

40
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Those moments are so dangerous.</v>

41
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't just,</v>

42
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>they would like it to be like Frankie Edgar Gray Maynard just fucking chaos or</v>

43
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>punches throwing wild.</v>

44
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Not going to happen like that.</v>

45
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that with Wonderboy.</v>

46
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>You can't charge at him like that.</v>

47
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>He will fucking counter you and you look,</v>

48
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>you will be one of those people on his highlight reel.</v>

49
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>So Tyron Woodley was very smart and that he knew that he couldn't charge Adam</v>

50
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>and Wonderboy.</v>

51
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to charge a willy either.</v>

52
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:55.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

53
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>he got an almost knocked the fuck out in the first fight.</v>

54
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>He almost got knocked the fuck out in the,</v>

55
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>in the fifth round or the second fight to Woodley's a powerhouse man.</v>

56
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>He hits so goddamn hard.</v>

57
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So everybody had to be on their toes.</v>

58
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>They both had to be minding their p's and q's.</v>

59
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And that translated for a boring fight to a lot of people,</v>

60
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.613
<v Speaker 1>but not to me.</v>

61
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.251
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

62
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

63
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>anything could happen at any moment in the fifth round or almost did when,</v>

64
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

65
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>when Woodley connected and Thompson's knees went out,</v>

66
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:21.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

67
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:22.291
<v Speaker 1>he slumped,</v>

68
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:22.881
<v Speaker 1>he was out,</v>

69
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

70
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>He was out for at least a half,</v>

71
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>a second or a moment.</v>

72
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>there was a moment where his legs gave out.</v>

74
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>His body went limp and they could've stopped the fight right there.</v>

75
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad they didn't,</v>

76
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>glad they kept going.</v>

78
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a big John McCarthy in the cage after the fight ago,</v>

79
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>how close we were to stop in that fight.</v>

80
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.034
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

81
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.401
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

82
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.151
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't close to stop.</v>

83
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>And I fight.</v>

84
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.721
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

85
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:42.841
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

86
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:43.561
<v Speaker 1>You were looking right?</v>

87
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

88
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.873
<v Speaker 1>I was looking.</v>

89
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

90
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.411
<v Speaker 1>you were looking to close.</v>

91
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:46.651
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

92
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll never admit it.</v>

93
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.111
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

94
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:48.271
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

95
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

96
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was almost out right.</v>

97
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.281
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

98
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:51.114
<v Speaker 1>he was almost out.</v>

99
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>It might've been out for half a second,</v>

100
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

101
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.091
<v Speaker 1>I gave him a chance.</v>

102
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I know you did a great job.</v>

103
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>He did an amazing job.</v>

104
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why big John McCarthy is so important.</v>

105
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>The guy with that kind of experience and if he fucked that up,</v>

106
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>everybody would be so mad at him.</v>

107
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>But he did it perfect.</v>

108
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect.</v>

109
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>He has the most difficult job in the sport.</v>

110
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Other than the fighters.</v>

111
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Fighters have the most difficult job.</v>

112
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Second most difficult job is the referee.</v>

113
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Third most difficult job is a judges.</v>

114
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

115
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

116
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's going to interpret the trauma.</v>

117
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

118
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>40 other people.</v>

119
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Well he has to be,</v>

120
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.981
<v Speaker 1>he has to look,</v>

121
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>he has to be at the right angle.</v>

122
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Like they're moving around and they're fast and they could go to his left and he</v>

123
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:29.891
<v Speaker 1>can be over here,</v>

124
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>but something could be happening on there.</v>

125
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.021
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

126
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And he doesn't even see it.</v>

127
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

129
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes,</v>

130
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>sometimes guys don't see taps.</v>

131
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes guys don't see a certain I pokes or groin shots.</v>

132
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that can happen.</v>

133
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>A referee's job is insanely difficult and they only get praise when they fuck</v>

134
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

135
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>They only rather get attention when they fuck up.</v>

136
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't get any praise when they do a great job and just just they need more,</v>

137
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>the they'd need more.</v>

139
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>More people need to understand like how difficult that is.</v>

140
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>So that moment where Tyron finally did connect on Wonderboy and everybody's</v>

141
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:04.871
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

142
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you do that earlier?</v>

143
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Because he could've gotten knocked the fuck out.</v>

144
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that was where the opening was.</v>

145
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Woodley was so aggressive because he was down on the scorecards,</v>

146
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>at least in his corner's eyes and in my eyes he was as well and he had a charge</v>

147
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>forward and he had to connect and he did.</v>

148
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>But to make that happen,</v>

149
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things have to be in place.</v>

150
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand one of the boys timing,</v>

151
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>he had been fighting him for four rounds already.</v>

152
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>He was getting a sense of what Wonderboy could and couldn't do.</v>

153
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>He also knew the consequences.</v>

154
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:36.780
<v Speaker 1>He'd been tagged a couple of times so he knew like I can't just rush Adam cause</v>

155
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy was trying to time them with that right hook.</v>

156
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>He was standing on the South Pole position with his right leg forward.</v>

157
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>He throws that front leg side kick to the body,</v>

158
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>throws it really well because he,</v>

159
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.050
<v Speaker 1>he picks it up from the ground like low and,</v>

160
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

161
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of scoops up so you don't see it coming until it's too late.</v>

162
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It might not be the most powerful application of the front leg side kick,</v>

163
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.933
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

164
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>it's very sneaky because he slides in with that foot low and then it comes up</v>

165
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and stabs you and you don't know if it's going to come up as a sidekick or if</v>

166
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go up and over your shoulders around kick.</v>

167
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what he's doing.</v>

168
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>He's so sneaky.</v>

169
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>So Tyron had to be very cautious and for a lot of people it was very boring</v>

170
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:16.144
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

171
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't think it was boring.</v>

172
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:18.191
<v Speaker 1>Wall's happening.</v>

173
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I was on the edge of my seat.</v>

174
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.403
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

175
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.221
<v Speaker 1>there are moments,</v>

176
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be moments when the shit starts flying.</v>

177
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>And in those moments,</v>

178
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>that's where the fight becomes amazing.</v>

179
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 1>But those guys are smart.</v>

180
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>They're not dumb.</v>

181
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And the belt is so God damn important.</v>

182
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>When you have the belt,</v>

183
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you get to decide,</v>

184
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you fight all the best fighters,</v>

185
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.951
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

186
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:36.281
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

187
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

188
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you make the money.</v>

189
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

190
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>you get the opportunities for the big money fights like the Conor McGregor type</v>

191
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:41.411
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

192
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Those only happen if you have the belt.</v>

193
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have the belt,</v>

194
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>nobody gives a fuck about.</v>

195
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So for a guy like Tyron,</v>

196
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:47.651
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

197
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>that belt is everything.</v>

198
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>For a guy like woody or a guy like a Wonderboy,</v>

199
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.001
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

200
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>that belt is everything.</v>

201
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have that belt,</v>

202
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you make a fraction of what you make.</v>

203
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Like think about that fight that flight's insanely close.</v>

204
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.013
<v Speaker 1>It was so close.</v>

205
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Dominick Cruz afterwards that that's basically the same fight as the first</v>

206
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:03.661
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

207
00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

208
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could call if you've called the first fighter to draw,</v>

209
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you could easily call this fight to draw and I agree with him.</v>

210
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that Wonderboy and Woodley are essentially like so closely</v>

211
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>matched stylistically that it's a wash.</v>

212
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

213
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile Woodley's the one who's the champion Woodley's the one who has the</v>

214
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:21.531
<v Speaker 1>potential to fight.</v>

215
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor Woodley is the one who has a potential to fight Michael Bisping</v>

216
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>or whoever,</v>

217
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>who else he fights at whatever weight he fights at and that is where the money</v>

218
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

219
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>So he's the guy who's going to get the money.</v>

220
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Wonderboy who essentially had a draw with him prove that he was it least</v>

221
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>close enough on one fight and just a hair under the second fight,</v>

222
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>he ma,</v>

223
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make a fraction of what Woodley mix likely so that those</v>

224
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 1>consequences have to be taken into consideration when you're watching these guys</v>

225
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>fight is that they know there's a wind bonus and there's a loss.</v>

226
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

227
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:56.714
<v Speaker 1>if you lose,</v>

228
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 1>you get your show money,</v>

229
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a bonus.</v>

230
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.961
<v Speaker 1>But if you win,</v>

231
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>you get twice the money.</v>

232
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of guys have,</v>

233
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>the way their contract is structured,</v>

234
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:09.341
<v Speaker 1>they'll make x if they win and they'll make x plus x if they'll make x plus x if</v>

236
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:10.251
<v Speaker 1>they win.</v>

237
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:10.821
<v Speaker 1>But if they lose,</v>

238
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>they only make x.</v>

239
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>So they might have,</v>

240
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>they might be getting $200,000 for the fight,</v>

241
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 1>but another $200,000 if they win,</v>

242
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant swing.</v>

243
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.071
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

244
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>So they have to be really fucking careful.</v>

245
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>They don't make mistakes.</v>

246
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't like when bonuses,</v>

247
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:24.824
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

248
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.693
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

249
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I think those guys are trying to win anyway.</v>

250
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.581
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to win.</v>

251
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:28.911
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

252
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I just think like,</v>

253
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>especially in particular in situations like that,</v>

254
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>when fights are like that fucking clothes,</v>

255
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I could judge,</v>

256
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>can decide whether or not you make an extra 200 grand or don't like,</v>

257
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>that seems crazy to me.</v>

258
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
