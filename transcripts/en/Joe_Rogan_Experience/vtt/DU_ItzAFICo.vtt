73
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:44.861

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:45.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

75
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

76
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 2>is there anything you'd like to say about Fairbanks Alaska in 1983 and I was</v>

77
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:52.624
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

78
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.391

00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:53.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

80
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 2>I got busted in Fairbank's,</v>

81
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 2>a for eating a snickers bar and the fucking grocery store and not paying for it.</v>

83
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

84
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.020
<v Speaker 2>but I did two or three days.</v>

85
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 2>It was Memorial Day weekend.</v>

86
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I did three,</v>

87
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 2>four nights in the prison.</v>

88
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.270
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy said 20 hours of community service and this will disappear from</v>

89
00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:12.610
<v Speaker 2>your record and get if you don't get arrested in a year.</v>

90
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So I always say no,</v>

91
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:15.281
<v Speaker 2>cause that's,</v>

92
00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

93
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't convicted of anything.</v>

94
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 2>And they said it would be taken from my record.</v>

95
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:20.741
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's like,</v>

96
00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

97
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you were not Alaskan,</v>

98
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 2>so you're from out of state meant they couldn't strike it from your record.</v>

99
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

100
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 2>and it's on your FBI record,</v>

101
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 2>which is what we get in Canada.</v>

102
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 2>So he was knicker thief.</v>

103
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

104
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sneaker thief.</v>

105
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:34.750
<v Speaker 2>So he's a cool guy.</v>

106
00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I did four days in a fee in a federal medium security prison with no underwear</v>

107
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.750
<v Speaker 2>for a snickers,</v>

108
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 2>for snickers.</v>

109
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean with no underwear?</v>

110
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Were you wearing anything or just naked?</v>

111
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I was a wearing short.</v>

112
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Why did you have pants at the groceries?</v>

113
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Because it makes it</v>

114
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 2>more harrowing.</v>

115
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.623
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

116
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

117
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 years old.</v>

118
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Not yet will you liked very twink ish.</v>

120
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.253
<v Speaker 2>I was very,</v>

121
00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

122
00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 2>So you were worried it was all going to go down.</v>

123
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 2>It would have been worried if I were wearing,</v>

124
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what a anything survival suit.</v>

125
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.703
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

126
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>it's that even isn't that under the amount of money that they could even bust</v>

127
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 2>you for something?</v>

128
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not in the 80s Reagan was president.</v>

129
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to fucking be tough on crime.</v>

130
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.263
<v Speaker 2>Just say no.</v>

131
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 2>And also I had a,</v>

133
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean what happened was we got in from this 10 day hitch with these two guys I</v>

134
00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>had met on the ferry coming up the inside passage and we had this long hitch</v>

135
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>through the Yukon territory,</v>

136
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:29.550
<v Speaker 2>all this crazy shit.</v>

137
00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:30.384
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

138
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>and we get to Fairbank's.</v>

139
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>So the first place we go is the laundromat because we stank,</v>

140
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

141
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have that special soap that your defense defense.</v>

142
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 2>So and a,</v>

143
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>so we went to the laundromat,</v>

144
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>we put everything possible in the washer.</v>

145
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 2>So all three of us were wearing shorts with no underwear,</v>

146
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>boots with no socks and a jacket with no shirt.</v>

147
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 2>And then one of the guys was like,</v>

148
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.161
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

149
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to go to the grocery store because there was a payphone.</v>

150
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 2>And he was going to call his girlfriend to let her know that he'd arrived on</v>

151
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:57.304
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

152
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.821
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll go over with you.</v>

155
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 2>And the other guy's going to stay with the bags or backpacks and all that shit.</v>

156
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

157
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 2>watch the clothes.</v>

158
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 2>So I went with him.</v>

159
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who's on the phone,</v>

160
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>we start pushing a cart around.</v>

161
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:08.471
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

162
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:08.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Soviet immigrants,</v>

164
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:10.121
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

165
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:10.331
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

166
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>so many kinds of,</v>

167
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:11.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:12.544
<v Speaker 2>food here,</v>

169
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>because we'd been living in the woods eating nuts and chocolate in LSD for the</v>

170
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:16.864
<v Speaker 2>last 10 days.</v>

171
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

172
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 2>he opened a thing of Keifer.</v>

173
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>First time I'd ever heard of Keifer,</v>

174
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 2>which is like liquid yogurt and drank that great for your body.</v>

175
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.243
<v Speaker 2>Acidophilus.</v>

176
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

177
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

179
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.281
<v Speaker 2>for some reason,</v>

180
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>eight a snickers bar,</v>

181
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 2>even though I'd been eating chocolate and not much imagination there.</v>

182
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And then we,</v>

183
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>he used the phone,</v>

184
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 2>we ditch the cart and we laughed.</v>

185
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 2>And so there's some security guy had seen us and turned into a thing.</v>

186
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>This cop showed up and I had a knife in my boot and some grass in my pocket,</v>

187
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 2>both of which were legal at the time in Alaska,</v>

188
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but it was enough to make this cop not like me at all.</v>

189
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 2>And he was like this,</v>

190
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:02.851
<v Speaker 2>he'd Napoleonic cop kind of situation and he didn't like smart ass college kids</v>

192
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>from outside coming into Alaska in the summer and know snickers bar walking</v>

193
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

194
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

195
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Fucking around with Kiefer.</v>

196
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 2>So he took us,</v>

197
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 2>he handcuffed us and took us to prison.</v>

198
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Fairbank's correctional center.</v>

199
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Did you not have the money for the snickers bar?</v>

200
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

201
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 2>we have plenty of money.</v>

202
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't want to pay for it,</v>

203
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.221
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

204
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:18.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

205
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 2>you tell it to the magistrate.</v>

206
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

207
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 2>you mean for that now that was just like,</v>

208
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck you're just young and we're just telling Tom and you</v>

209
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:25.751
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

210
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there was a line or something,</v>

211
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>

212
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>but we pretended we were shopping so we put like dog food and Shit in the cart,</v>

213
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 2>and we had our stuff and put the package like we were going to pay for it when</v>

215
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.434
<v Speaker 2>we checked out.</v>

216
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what we were just being dumb,</v>

217
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

218
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.331
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

219
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:48.331
<v Speaker 2>so we ended up being taken to this prison and I had a pipe to,</v>

220
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.581
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

221
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 2>cause I remember when we were,</v>

222
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 2>did the intake,</v>

223
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.300
<v Speaker 2>the guy that like the prison dude who booked us and you know,</v>

224
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 2>did the whole intake thing,</v>

225
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I was joking with him,</v>

226
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.161
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

227
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.341
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get that pipe and grasp back.</v>

229
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.771
<v Speaker 2>Am I?</v>

230
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.311
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

231
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so man.</v>

232
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:02.661
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

233
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

234
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't bother me if it just disappeared and was never even registered</v>

236
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.480
<v Speaker 2>because grass is hard to come by in Alaska was then.</v>

237
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>And so we sort of had a little understanding and like I'm cool,</v>

238
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:13.671
<v Speaker 2>you're cool.</v>

239
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:14.504
<v Speaker 2>Cause he was like,</v>

242
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with that cop?</v>

243
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Did you like hit him or something?</v>

244
00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:20.031
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

245
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:20.331

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

248
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 2>he just had a hair up his ass.</v>

249
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

250
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 2>So this guy was cool.</v>

251
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 2>He saved us because what he did is he said,</v>

252
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

253
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to put you guys in with the general population.</v>

254
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 2>You're going to sleep in the gym at night.</v>

255
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 2>You've got some cots,</v>

256
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 2>you sleep in the gym,</v>

257
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you never let the other one out of your sight the whole time you're here,</v>

258
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 2>you go to the bathroom together,</v>

259
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 2>you go to the showers together,</v>

260
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you watch each other's back and you'll get through it all right.</v>

261
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 2>And we did and he was wild.</v>

262
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 2>And this was like 83,</v>

263
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.564
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

264
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

265
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

266
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of money in Alaska,</v>

267
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.141
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

268
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>From all the oil.</v>

269
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 2>So the prison was plush.</v>

270
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It was like every meal was all you can eat,</v>

271
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>really solid bar,</v>

272
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 2>whole wheat rolls,</v>

273
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 2>white roles.</v>

274
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Wednesday was prime rib day where the cops could pay a buck to eat with the</v>

275
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.294
<v Speaker 2>prisoners.</v>

276
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 2>But the catch was you only had 20 minutes each meal.</v>

277
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 2>So I remember like one day we're sitting there at this table and I wouldn't like</v>

278
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 2>19 maybe 20 maybe 20 something like that.</v>

279
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 2>We're sitting at this table and the guy across the table looked like Charles</v>

280
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.011
<v Speaker 2>Bronson.</v>

281
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:25.620
<v Speaker 2>You remember him,</v>

282
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 2>the stash and the tats and all that,</v>

283
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 2>and we're just like,</v>

284
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 2>this dude was shoveling it in and he looks up at one point he says,</v>

285
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 2>this is the best fucking prison I've ever been in.</v>

286
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Yikes.</v>

287
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

288
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 2>laundry lists of prisons that don't,</v>

289
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 2>don't meet that criteria to standard.</v>

290
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

291
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

292
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

293
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 2>his story was,</v>

294
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.080
<v Speaker 2>he founded dude with his wife and he beat him with a lead pipe and he didn't</v>

295
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:52.190
<v Speaker 2>know if he was dead,</v>

296
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as it happened,</v>

297
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:54.981
<v Speaker 2>he got in his car,</v>

298
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 2>he was from like New Mexico or Arizona.</v>

299
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.550
<v Speaker 2>He got in his car and drove to Alaska because he knew he'd get picked up and he</v>

300
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get picked up in Alaska because he'd heard the prisons were much</v>

301
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:04.590
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

302
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

303
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 2>So he might've beat a guy to death and said,</v>

304
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 2>the way to deal with this is to go to a place that I was awesome.</v>

305
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Prisons and that place just happens to be on the exact opposite.</v>

306
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
