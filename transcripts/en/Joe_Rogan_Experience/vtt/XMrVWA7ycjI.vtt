<v Speaker 1>podcast is brought to you by stamps.com.</v>

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.600
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cost of a stamp just went up to </v>

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.631
<v Speaker 1>forty nine cents and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're complaining about a stamp </v>

5
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>being forty nine cents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Douche bag.</v>

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It's only forty nine cents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if I had to give you money to </v>

7
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>take a fucking letter across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd want more than forty nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>cents.</v>

9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest.</v>

10
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Go into the post office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sucks the fat Dick.</v>

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 2>It's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's slow.</v>

13
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's boring.</v>

14
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom sent me a letter that had the </v>

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 2>wrong postage on it and it went all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to Burbank and then the burbank post</v>

16
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

82
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:52.381
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we released the results of the first </v>

83
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:52.381
<v Speaker 1>clinical trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very positive,</v>

86
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:03.550

<v Speaker 1>larger study.</v>

87
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That study was actually a,</v>

88
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call it,</v>

89
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>pilot study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a study of say like 16 to 20.</v>

90
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:15.181
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess it was 20 people initially </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it got down to 17 or 16 and </v>

91
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>what happens is some people just quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>people are fucking flaky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the pilot study is to make sure that</v>

93
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.270
<v Speaker 1>the protocol is a adequate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 1>we decided to go with a two pills per </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

95
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I take four before I do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a fucking maniac folks.</v>

96
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>That's just what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy like that.</v>

97
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And on a one 80 actually has alpha brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>

98
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of new mood as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some five htp and on a one 80 is </v>

99
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:43.651
<v Speaker 1>fantastic for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For anytime I fly somewhere I just </v>

100
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>immediately take that upon landing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I feel like I have jetlag,</v>

101
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>anytime I'm boozing it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

102
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I really don't do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave out boozing it up with me.</v>

103
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I still get high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

104
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>

105
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>The rec afterwards just sucks so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

106
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to limit it to two drinks.</v>

108
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:09.571
<v Speaker 1>If I go out a lot of times I don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the desire to have more than one </v>

109
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>because why do that?</v>

110
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>When you can do other things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and don't give you a hangover?</v>

111
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other night I had to and it was </v>

112
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.621
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a glass of wine with dinner and </v>

113
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:19.621
<v Speaker 1>then I was out with some friends and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a jack and coke.</v>

114
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:23.341
<v Speaker 1>I was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very mild jack and coke though </v>

115
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:26.300
<v Speaker 1>a point being the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issues that you deal with when you </v>

116
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>are hung over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch,</v>

117
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:33.151
<v Speaker 1>there's dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a depletion depletion </v>

118
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>of all the beautiful things that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind rich and interesting.</v>

119
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Like Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:41.261
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up from alcohol man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get fucked up from the lack of </v>

121
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.001
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get good sleep when you'd go </v>

122
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:45.001
<v Speaker 1>to bed drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're just a mess.</v>

123
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:49.830
<v Speaker 1>All the ingredients in Alpha brain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ingredients in one a or any of </v>

124
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the other supplements that we have are </v>
<v Speaker 1>available at [inaudible] dot com,</v>

125
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.290
<v Speaker 1>along with all of the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>research and references that point to </v>

126
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>individual</v>

127
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 3>studies about individual ingredients and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most recent study on Alpha brain,</v>

128
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:07.451
<v Speaker 3>which is the study on the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>combination of the ingredients to </v>

129
00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 3>achieve a synergistic effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of science behind it,</v>

130
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:15.641
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a lot of controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to alleviate some of the concern at </v>

131
00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Onnit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we offer a 90 day 30 pill,</v>

132
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 3>100 percent money back guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you buy a bottle of Alpha brain 30</v>

133
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:25.841
<v Speaker 3>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have 90 days to tell us it's </v>

134
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:25.841
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't like it,</v>

135
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea how your brain works.</v>

136
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know for me it's not just beneficial,</v>

137
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 3>it's essential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the shit.</v>

138
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 3>I feel nervous if I do a UFC without it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

139
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:40.181
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it helps me form sentences </v>

140
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:43.721
<v Speaker 3>better as I form a shitty sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It helps me when I'm searching for </v>

141
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get them easier and I know that sounds</v>

142
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but go on at.com.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We've got a lot of shit to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitting the bitcoin fan.</v>

148
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.830
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit's crazy.</v>

149
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 4>Fair.</v>

150
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.970
<v Speaker 3>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

151
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan podcasts all day.</v>

152
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Fitting that our friend David Seaman is </v>
<v Speaker 3>here the very day that Mt.</v>

153
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Gox the big storage place or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck it is.</v>

154
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 3>This site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

155
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.270
<v Speaker 2>it's an online exchange for bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The exchange is diggity.</v>

156
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Diggity done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.520
<v Speaker 2>So it hit the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the forrest gump kind of random</v>

158
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:38.521
<v Speaker 2>trends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm always kind of in the </v>

159
00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Speaker 2>background of all this completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrelated shit and yeah,</v>

160
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gox was run by this guy who is a,</v>

161
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly kind of a,</v>

162
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.940
<v Speaker 2>a piece of shit I got to say like </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly is you guys do.</v>

163
00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:53.941
<v Speaker 2>But as a respectable journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard sources say he's a piece of </v>

164
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:54.330
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

165
00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.150
<v Speaker 2>so there is an error in the way that his</v>
<v Speaker 2>site interacts with the overall bitcoin </v>

166
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.430
<v Speaker 2>network and the same way that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.130
<v Speaker 2>are using email and you happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>download a shitty email program,</v>

168
00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:11.131
<v Speaker 2>like a knockoff version of outlook and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucks up the way you send your </v>

169
00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:15.061
<v Speaker 2>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean there's a problem with </v>

170
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:15.061
<v Speaker 2>email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a problem with what you're using</v>

171
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:15.460
<v Speaker 2>and the way you've implemented it.</v>

172
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 2>And email has been used enough by now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we know that it works.</v>

173
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:24.090
<v Speaker 2>And it was kind of a similar issue here </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there was an incompetent </v>

174
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.570
<v Speaker 2>implementation and some hackers were </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to steal over time,</v>

175
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.750
<v Speaker 2>somewhere between $300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million to $400,000,000</v>

176
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.180
<v Speaker 2>worth of bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty brutal.</v>

177
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.180
<v Speaker 2>And bitcoins taking a bashing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>press,</v>

178
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:35.830
<v Speaker 2>which is well deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

179
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I personally bought more or less night </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've just been reading about it </v>

180
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.641
<v Speaker 2>so much that I actually kind of believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I'm drinking the Koolaid and in </v>

181
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:45.130
<v Speaker 2>that case when some shit like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

182
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:50.131
<v Speaker 2>it's not a tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually kind of an opportunity </v>

183
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:52.351
<v Speaker 2>because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now I can actually buy some more </v>

184
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Speaker 2>this instead of only having a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the future currency of the new world </v>

185
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.501
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a real fraction of it and I'm </v>

186
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:58.501
<v Speaker 2>already getting shit from people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

187
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 2>you're promoting a product that is new </v>
<v Speaker 2>world order designed.</v>

188
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have any evidence of that?</v>

189
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Like have you actually read even a 10th </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much of the people who were reporting</v>

190
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:11.541
<v Speaker 2>on this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everything is out there about </v>

191
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:11.541
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and yet they're already moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards.</v>

192
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 2>It was created by two.</v>

193
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that's sort of what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about before the podcast </v>

194
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.510
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a bunch of people that love</v>

195
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.200
<v Speaker 1>for something to be a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they look for it and everything in </v>

196
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.210
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are.</v>

197
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I've been involved in things where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there was no conspiracy.</v>

198
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I know I was there and yet I've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>people tell me that it was like ufc </v>

199
00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:36.650
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the things are fixed,</v>

200
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:39.410
<v Speaker 1>that someone wasn't really injured and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're just.</v>

201
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a big scam and all it is is to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up another fight.</v>

202
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:47.030
<v Speaker 1>They had this all along shuffle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people love to think,</v>

203
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because there are some </v>

204
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.651
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they go looking for him because they </v>

205
00:09:53.651 --> 00:09:53.651
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

206
00:09:53.651 --> 00:09:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to be fooled by them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that is the number one problem with</v>

207
00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Speaker 1>the fact that conspiracies have actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

208
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.120
<v Speaker 1>They've muddied the water so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a disinflation tactic.</v>

209
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always talk about,</v>

210
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:09.431
<v Speaker 1>like if you read anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and you read that not not </v>

211
00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:09.431
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like human intelligence,</v>

212
00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 1>but intelligence reporting for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

213
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they do when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to control information is they </v>

214
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.620
<v Speaker 1>discredited by attaching it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit.</v>

215
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just what they do.</v>

216
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually like a an actual </v>

217
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.991
<v Speaker 2>strategies you mix in the bullshit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the good stuff poisons the well and you </v>

218
00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:26.991
<v Speaker 2>don't believe any of it.</v>

219
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you believe in something </v>

220
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.070
<v Speaker 1>absolutely ridiculous for long with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting shit,</v>

221
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.490
<v Speaker 1>they can automatically point to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous thing and say,</v>

222
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say same guy believes that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are reading your mind from a base on the</v>

223
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:44.920
<v Speaker 1>moon and then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that true.</v>

224
00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Does he really believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

225
00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 1>then you find out what's really going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

226
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:51.010
<v Speaker 1>You find out that all this other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you ever read Bill Cooper,</v>

227
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.790
<v Speaker 1>no course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of that book for some reason,</v>

228
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read it and you go,</v>

229
00:10:56.681 --> 00:10:58.510
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff's really fascinating.</v>

230
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.010
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts talking about alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>bases on the moon and you're like,</v>

231
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

232
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

233
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:02.170
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

234
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started talking like that actress </v>

235
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Shirley Mcclain has a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a book that I was skimming through.</v>

236
00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:13.241
<v Speaker 2>That's all about like how in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties the US government had a secret </v>

237
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:17.681
<v Speaker 2>meeting with like seven different </v>
<v Speaker 2>species of alien and there was this </v>

238
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:18.890
<v Speaker 2>council and even though she's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>actress,</v>

239
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:23.891
<v Speaker 2>you reading this shit and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe anything you're saying </v>

240
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:23.891
<v Speaker 2>now because this is a little out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's awake.</v>

241
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:24.770
<v Speaker 2>He wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broad.</v>

242
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard her talk about look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sidekicks and all kinds of other shit?</v>

243
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just skimming this book and it was </v>

244
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.040
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's alone.</v>

245
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.440
<v Speaker 2>She's a full on loan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what?</v>

246
00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:38.441
<v Speaker 2>But she could totally be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to add that and also I want to </v>

247
00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:38.630
<v Speaker 2>believe she's right about the alien </v>
<v Speaker 2>council.</v>

248
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.320
<v Speaker 2>She's asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silly</v>

249
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.640
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could,</v>

250
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.670
<v Speaker 1>you could Google shirleen mcclain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out all the different spiritual </v>

251
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.290
<v Speaker 1>healing energy things she's into and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

252
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.730
<v Speaker 1>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just an erotic massage probably.</v>

253
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>She's The lady that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a thing that to humans,</v>

254
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 5>and it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happens to men and it happens for </v>

255
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 5>women when they stopped being desirable </v>
<v Speaker 5>physically.</v>

256
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.280
<v Speaker 5>They often look to fantastical and </v>
<v Speaker 5>unimaginable things like Ufo shows or </v>

257
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.480
<v Speaker 5>fucking spiritual awakenings and psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look for something that drags them </v>

258
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:18.061
<v Speaker 5>out of the mundane existence of biology </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if the UFO was real,</v>

259
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 5>if aliens were real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if big foot was real,</v>

260
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:25.711
<v Speaker 5>if you could really read people's minds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't matter if no one wanted to </v>

261
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:26.250
<v Speaker 5>fuck you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

262
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 5>There's something that's bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

263
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 5>So this is a reason why like menopausal </v>
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>

264
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 5>like older women get really into that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of shit.</v>

265
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.910
<v Speaker 5>Like if you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not saying that young women </v>

266
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.910
<v Speaker 5>don't get into it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They certainly do.</v>

267
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.170
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men,</v>

268
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 5>there are a lot of men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of men who are in the weird shit.</v>

269
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is just one theory,</v>

270
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.870
<v Speaker 5>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a spiritual thing that happens </v>

271
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Speaker 5>to a to a lot of older men and older </v>
<v Speaker 5>women where they,</v>

272
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.850
<v Speaker 5>they start looking for like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

273
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.920
<v Speaker 5>paranormal things to start looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

274
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.921
<v Speaker 5>they're starting to feel more spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're getting toward that </v>

275
00:13:01.921 --> 00:13:01.921
<v Speaker 5>point in life where you got to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that shit.</v>

276
00:13:01.921 --> 00:13:06.150
<v Speaker 5>This is a little of that definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in the search for things and search </v>

277
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:11.131
<v Speaker 5>for things unseen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the search for big or search for </v>

278
00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:11.440
<v Speaker 5>aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do believe that a lot of what's</v>

279
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:16.441
<v Speaker 5>going on as if aliens were real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't matter if no one wanted to </v>

280
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 5>fuck them and they're sleeping on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>friend's couch and they're 50.</v>

281
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.100
<v Speaker 5>It really wouldn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

282
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 5>You guys don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you something,</v>

283
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:26.671
<v Speaker 5>but what the aliens they would get if </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just had a weed Brownie or maybe </v>

284
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 5>like a weekend camping or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it already doesn't matter.</v>

285
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.690
<v Speaker 5>They don't need to find that other thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make their life seem like it's not a </v>

286
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 5>big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just look up in the sky.</v>

287
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.150
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes nothing matters with </v>
<v Speaker 5>certainty.</v>

288
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.570
<v Speaker 5>There is some crazy article in </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific American that if you were to </v>

289
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 5>add up all the people who've ever lived </v>
<v Speaker 5>on earth,</v>

290
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 5>it's like a $100 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

291
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 5>so you just don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Period.</v>

292
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.150
<v Speaker 5>Like where were these fucking things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are running around trying to spread</v>

293
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:57.151
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our genetic code and then our hearts </v>

294
00:13:57.151 --> 00:13:59.911
<v Speaker 5>filled with cholesterol and we die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like some weird video game and so </v>

295
00:13:59.911 --> 00:14:04.590
<v Speaker 5>somebody like that feels that they need </v>
<v Speaker 5>to find religion or they need to find </v>

296
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 5>aliens in order to feel like they're a </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of things.</v>

297
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 5>They're already a part of things so they</v>
<v Speaker 5>already don't matter.</v>

298
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 5>So what more do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

299
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 5>that's perfect right there.</v>

300
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think it's a don't matter </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

301
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:16.060
<v Speaker 5>I think they're looking for something </v>
<v Speaker 5>exciting for a lot of people.</v>

302
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously it's just one of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>goofy theories I'm chasing down,</v>

303
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 5>but for a lot of people when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>what matters in life,</v>

304
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 5>one of the big things that matters in </v>
<v Speaker 5>life is being sexually desirable.</v>

305
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 5>And when you stopped being sexually </v>
<v Speaker 5>desirable,</v>

306
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 5>like unequivocably no argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one wants to fuck you.</v>

307
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.260
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it happens sooner to women than it </v>

308
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 5>does men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because for a man you're like 18 or 20.</v>

309
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to fuck you because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have nothing going on.</v>

310
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.640
<v Speaker 5>Start to get into your mid twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're good looking,</v>

311
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 5>you might be able to get something based</v>
<v Speaker 5>on that,</v>

312
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.680
<v Speaker 5>but as you get older you get more status</v>
<v Speaker 5>and more experience.</v>

313
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.700
<v Speaker 5>You know what the fuck you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about more often.</v>

314
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 5>That's where attraction comes from,</v>

315
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 2>but for women it's like twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking prime right there.</v>

316
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 2>You're already at the Max and the 25 is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still good.</v>

317
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Still good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you get older,</v>

318
00:15:00.421 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 2>as society is not just heaping you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaping status upon you,</v>

319
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:09.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still for you very much looks </v>

320
00:15:09.431 --> 00:15:09.431
<v Speaker 2>based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas an older guy,</v>

321
00:15:09.431 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares what Richard Branson looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like or what Felix Dennis looked like.</v>

322
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:17.081
<v Speaker 2>It's more about who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if some actresses in a show and she </v>

323
00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:18.040
<v Speaker 2>looks old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody will say that.</v>

324
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely something in that,</v>

325
00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:24.981
<v Speaker 1>but I think like Richard Branson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's got a really young hot wife and </v>

326
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:25.860
<v Speaker 1>that wife has got a personal trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to let him fuck her.</v>

327
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.870
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

328
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:34.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy would think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that trainer would end up on an </v>

329
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.310
<v Speaker 2>unsuccessful space flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never come back.</v>

330
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to fuck her all</v>

331
00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:39.730
<v Speaker 2>the time unless he's stupid,</v>

332
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta make sure you don't turn into </v>

333
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 1>a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think a lot of gold diggers,</v>

334
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.640
<v Speaker 1>they looked to fuck young guys for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some young studly broke bodybuilder type</v>

335
00:15:51.961 --> 00:15:54.540
<v Speaker 1>dude with a giant hug because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they really want</v>

336
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.910
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want the status,</v>

337
00:15:56.911 --> 00:15:58.500
<v Speaker 2>but they also want something physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

338
00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:00.870
<v Speaker 2>women just want the money into sex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all men want.</v>

339
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

340
00:16:01.741 --> 00:16:03.550
<v Speaker 2>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a</v>

341
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:04.800
<v Speaker 1>again my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

342
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 1>my late teens and early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the most undesirable I've ever </v>

343
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.070
<v Speaker 1>been in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had the hardest time getting laid</v>

344
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.040
<v Speaker 1>the hardest because I was broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was poor and I was,</v>

345
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't even matter if I was </v>

346
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.280
<v Speaker 1>successful in some things like sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I was,</v>

347
00:16:20.281 --> 00:16:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter because what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>important was money was important,</v>

348
00:16:24.811 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 1>was financial success was important with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you not being a loser.</v>

349
00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And I was a loser as far as like bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts and as far as where I lived,</v>

350
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I was a loser and I was a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every young man's,</v>

351
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.970
<v Speaker 1>unless you're born rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting out as a loser,</v>

352
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything to show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And women had no desire to be with me.</v>

353
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are guys who really kind of get </v>

354
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.250
<v Speaker 2>off on being able to bring women back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have nothing going on.</v>

355
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.680
<v Speaker 2>We like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what a loser I am and I'm still </v>

356
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:56.680
<v Speaker 2>getting laid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of thing.</v>

357
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.430
<v Speaker 2>You can use that to your advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

358
00:16:57.431 --> 00:16:58.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was at colleges,</v>

359
00:16:58.661 --> 00:16:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

360
00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if this is what I can pull now think</v>

361
00:17:01.901 --> 00:17:04.120
<v Speaker 2>about 10 years from now when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually not a loser,</v>

362
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.800
<v Speaker 2>how good things might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

363
00:17:05.801 --> 00:17:07.750
<v Speaker 2>So that's a way to motivate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

364
00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:09.780
<v Speaker 2>it also depends on what you're willing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fuck to.</v>

365
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody can get laid if you drop your </v>

366
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.311
<v Speaker 2>standards lower enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women have the advantage in that area </v>

367
00:17:17.311 --> 00:17:18.970
<v Speaker 2>because they can always get high quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

368
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:23.971
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a guy like you really can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're at a certain stage in </v>

369
00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:27.811
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just walk in somewhere and go </v>

370
00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:28.210
<v Speaker 2>home with somebody that night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a woman can do that anywhere.</v>

371
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.330
<v Speaker 2>But the balance is that that's not what </v>
<v Speaker 2>most women want,</v>

372
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want different things,</v>

373
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>

374
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.000
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I think most women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

376
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.970
<v Speaker 1>this is just massive generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

377
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.980
<v Speaker 1>there's some women that just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you and kick you right out the </v>

378
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:43.980
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out,</v>

379
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:43.980
<v Speaker 1>go by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't kiss me by.</v>

380
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

382
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences,</v>

383
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.050
<v Speaker 1>that guy laughs as he's getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

384
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you do that to a girl,</v>

385
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:54.330
<v Speaker 5>like you're the worst piece of shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

386
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 5>If you fucked a girl and then after you </v>
<v Speaker 5>die,</v>

387
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

388
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 5>you got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't kiss me.</v>

389
00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

390
00:17:59.031 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

391
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.160
<v Speaker 5>no hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

392
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 5>it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a sociopath kind of thing to do.</v>

393
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if a girl does it to a guy,</v>

394
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.540
<v Speaker 5>guy will go tell his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

395
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.210
<v Speaker 5>she suck my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucked her.</v>

396
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 5>Debbage kicked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had to go to work.</v>

397
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:12.570
<v Speaker 5>She came out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she told me,</v>

398
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 5>don't kiss her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

399
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 5>this isn't going anywhere and get out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

400
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:17.480
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll call you if you want to fuck again.</v>

401
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.270
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please do.</v>

402
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

403
00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody's had that experience </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're like,</v>

404
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.880
<v Speaker 5>I was just used and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a second.</v>

405
00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 5>So that's a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was awesome.</v>

406
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 5>Totally different.</v>

407
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.680
<v Speaker 5>But I think it's totally different </v>
<v Speaker 5>because women have a different instinct </v>

408
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 5>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a massive generalization,</v>

409
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 5>by the way women have the instinct to </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to find a guy that they can trust,</v>

410
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.580
<v Speaker 5>try to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

411
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.750
<v Speaker 5>spend unless you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you've been through a few and </v>

412
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.750
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

413
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 5>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's what the Cougar thing is.</v>

414
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 5>So people like about cougars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking given up.</v>

415
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 5>I just like women who have their shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>together and cougars tend to be more </v>

416
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 5>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like executive types.</v>

417
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.930
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>I no longer go for the starving artist </v>

418
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.211
<v Speaker 5>because I always like to be the less </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy person in the relationship and if </v>

419
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:05.151
<v Speaker 5>I'm the one that they're relying on for </v>
<v Speaker 5>some kind of stability and unlike </v>

420
00:19:05.151 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 5>already completely fucking crazy with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the stuff I'm working on,</v>

421
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.630
<v Speaker 5>that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

422
00:19:07.631 --> 00:19:11.250
<v Speaker 5>like when somebody is asking me for </v>
<v Speaker 5>quarters to use the laundry machine,</v>

423
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 5>it's not a good relationship.</v>

424
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.180
<v Speaker 5>So I'm more into the stability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

425
00:19:15.181 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 5>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

426
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 5>It's hard when when you're dating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

427
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 5>in water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other is really financially </v>

428
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 5>unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

429
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.320
<v Speaker 5>it's always hard because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 5>stressful,</v>

430
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it,</v>

431
00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:31.141
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it puts a giant wedge in the </v>

432
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:31.141
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend,</v>

433
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 5>she's successful and her boyfriend now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ex boyfriend is.</v>

434
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm not very successful and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that they fight about is that </v>

435
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.151
<v Speaker 5>like he's just frustrated all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can't get anything going with his </v>

436
00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:44.151
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You actually,</v>

437
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 5>it's funny that something just happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>for them.</v>

438
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:46.810
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As you know,</v>

439
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 5>they broke up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That always seems to happen.</v>

440
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:54.441
<v Speaker 5>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes a Murphy's law going on there </v>

441
00:19:54.441 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>

442
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about it and she was </v>

443
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.851
<v Speaker 5>talking about how difficult it is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>date someone who's really struggling </v>

444
00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 5>because it becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a mantra.</v>

445
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.520
<v Speaker 5>It's like going off in the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>head at all times.</v>

446
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Like you're broke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you owe money,</v>

447
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 5>your bills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

448
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 5>When you have money problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all you think about.</v>

449
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:12.390
<v Speaker 5>Collectors are calling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna,</v>

450
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.660
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get your car repossessed,</v>

451
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.420
<v Speaker 5>you need another job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need this,</v>

452
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:17.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that it's just,</v>

453
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:20.250
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard to date someone like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that because you don't get them.</v>

454
00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:23.130
<v Speaker 5>You get them under massive duress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

455
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.570
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

456
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:29.571
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely better if you can walk </v>
<v Speaker 5>into something where you have a bit of </v>

457
00:20:29.571 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 5>money because when you have money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the opposite feeling in your head,</v>

458
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.900
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this could go away if I wanted it to.</v>

459
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this could probably be reduced if I</v>

460
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 5>need it to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

461
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:39.820
<v Speaker 5>there's that for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is the.</v>

462
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:44.830
<v Speaker 5>The big thing that I noticed when I got </v>
<v Speaker 5>my first development deal wasn't a lot </v>

463
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 5>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was enough money to where I could</v>

464
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 3>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I wasn't getting rich,</v>

465
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 3>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

466
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I've got some money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can really.</v>

467
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about paying my </v>
<v Speaker 3>bills.</v>

468
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:59.611
<v Speaker 3>I can pay my rent this month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was this crazy weight lifted off </v>

469
00:20:59.611 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 3>my shoulder and I think I was 25 at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and you know,</v>

470
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 3>most of my life up until that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the time I was working,</v>

471
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.280
<v Speaker 3>it was all struggles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

472
00:21:07.281 --> 00:21:09.970
<v Speaker 3>There's no money in the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The money was in the bank.</v>

473
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:12.520
<v Speaker 3>It was enough to pay whatever check I </v>
<v Speaker 3>sent out maybe,</v>

474
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.660
<v Speaker 3>and then I was going to have to stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>some more money in there as quick as </v>

475
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.251
<v Speaker 3>possible to pay for the next bill's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the sudden I had some money in </v>

476
00:21:20.251 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 3>the bank and there was this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of relaxation.</v>

477
00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

478
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 3>this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Rich.</v>

479
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Just not having to worry.</v>

480
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 3>So whenever I give people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

481
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.450
<v Speaker 3>if I talked to someone who's struggling </v>
<v Speaker 3>or talk,</v>

482
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 3>someone's trying to plan the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>

483
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:36.970
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to believe,</v>

484
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 3>but it is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being rich doesn't matter.</v>

485
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 3>You get used to everything you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get used to being in a big house.</v>

486
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.470
<v Speaker 3>I've been in a small apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt exactly the same as being in a </v>

487
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.570
<v Speaker 3>big house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being in the big house is kind of cool,</v>

488
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth what it costs to be in a </v>

489
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 3>big house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think like if you buy a house for</v>

490
00:21:55.481 --> 00:22:00.481
<v Speaker 3>a million bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of money you have to spend </v>

491
00:22:00.481 --> 00:22:03.031
<v Speaker 3>every fucking month on a million dollar </v>
<v Speaker 3>house and mortgage and fixing it up and </v>

492
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 3>amount of hours that you have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>

493
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you work a reasonable job,</v>

494
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.820
<v Speaker 3>you make 100 grand a year or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

495
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Normal good wage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of fucking money,</v>

496
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:13.150
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

497
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:18.210
<v Speaker 3>your house cost 10 times what you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a year and you're never going to pay </v>

498
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.321
<v Speaker 3>it off in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to pay it off in 30 years </v>

499
00:22:22.321 --> 00:22:24.480
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to have to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay insurance on the fucking property </v>

500
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.600
<v Speaker 3>tax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean property tax?</v>

501
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I got to pay tax on some shit I already </v>
<v Speaker 3>bought every year,</v>

502
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even I already own it.</v>

503
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I own the fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I own the property and I have to pay </v>

504
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.710
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I paying you for?</v>

505
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving you money for what I own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is going on here?</v>

506
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.060
<v Speaker 3>And it'll drive you crazy and plumbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and electricity and this and that.</v>

507
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:48.210
<v Speaker 3>When you really stop and think about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>much you're actually working for what </v>

508
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.941
<v Speaker 3>you're getting out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not worth it for most </v>

509
00:22:50.941 --> 00:22:54.001
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is worth it is to not worry </v>

510
00:22:54.001 --> 00:22:54.001
<v Speaker 3>about going to dinner.</v>

511
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:59.220
<v Speaker 3>If you can have enough money where I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and get a meal at a restaurant and </v>

512
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.470
<v Speaker 3>not think too much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say I would like the salmon and not</v>

513
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:05.410
<v Speaker 3>look at the price and say the chickens </v>
<v Speaker 3>this much,</v>

514
00:23:05.411 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 3>but the salmon's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dollar less.</v>

515
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I'll get the salmon instead of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

516
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:14.611
<v Speaker 3>You can just order what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could go to a movie and not worry </v>

517
00:23:14.611 --> 00:23:17.971
<v Speaker 3>about the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the other shit like the difference </v>

518
00:23:17.971 --> 00:23:19.030
<v Speaker 3>between having a lexis and having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mercedes.</v>

519
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.630
<v Speaker 3>The difference between having a a Toyota</v>
<v Speaker 3>and having a Ford,</v>

520
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.330
<v Speaker 3>you get used to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything you're doing,</v>

521
00:23:25.331 --> 00:23:27.730
<v Speaker 3>you get used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as your car gets you to work,</v>

522
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.790
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have enough money to buy a </v>

523
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

524
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:32.790
<v Speaker 3>you love mustangs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go get a fucking Mustang,</v>

525
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.670
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy yourself.</v>

526
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't sweat it.</v>

527
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a car that gets you there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the real difference between your </v>

528
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 3>car being repossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no money for food,</v>

529
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 3>you have no money for rent and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to pay your bills.</v>

530
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

531
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 5>the big jump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The big jumps not for robberies and you </v>

532
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 5>get used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still look at Steve Jobs.</v>

533
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.040
<v Speaker 5>He never went crazy and he was worth </v>
<v Speaker 5>billions.</v>

534
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 5>There's always the fucking turtleneck </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyday,</v>

535
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 5>but he did go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He went crazy to like to push success.</v>

536
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:00.580
<v Speaker 5>He went.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He never.</v>

537
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.230
<v Speaker 5>He didn't have a balanced perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

538
00:24:02.231 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 5>but I mean in terms of he wasn't buying </v>
<v Speaker 5>a mansions and cars and stuff nonstop.</v>

539
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.680
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was so obsessed with the pursuit </v>

540
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:11.680
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

541
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.770
<v Speaker 5>apple being this dominant market player </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the money that they made and </v>

542
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:19.120
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went a little crazy just in his own </v>

543
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:19.120
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

544
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a minimalist crazy to where he </v>
<v Speaker 5>still lived in like the fucking silicon </v>

545
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 5>valley where I have a friend who lives </v>
<v Speaker 5>up there.</v>

546
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:26.550
<v Speaker 5>They have a house that they're renting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the house was worth $50,</v>

547
00:24:26.551 --> 00:24:27.290
<v Speaker 5>million dollars.</v>

548
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 5>I want to tell you if that house was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a fucking van eyes,</v>

549
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be worth 400 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was looking,</v>

550
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:40.151
<v Speaker 5>I was looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a real estate website is San </v>

551
00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:40.151
<v Speaker 5>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a place for sale.</v>

552
00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:44.600
<v Speaker 5>Those 200,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looked like one of the shacks in </v>

553
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 5>Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just objective like a $10,000</v>

554
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 5>property.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going for $200,000.</v>

555
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no doubt.</v>

556
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:50.350
<v Speaker 5>If you could put another house in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat.</v>

557
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.160
<v Speaker 5>If you could jam it in there with no </v>
<v Speaker 5>backyard.</v>

558
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 5>Just fucking stuffing on the actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>footprint.</v>

559
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.890
<v Speaker 5>That areas where so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I say that it wouldn't be worth 400</v>

560
00:24:57.891 --> 00:24:59.630
<v Speaker 5>grand event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably exaggerating.</v>

561
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.650
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's probably worth a </v>
<v Speaker 5>million and van eyes.</v>

562
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 5>It's a very nice house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my point is it's not a fucking 14,</v>

563
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:10.631
<v Speaker 5>$15,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>house or whatever the fuck they would </v>

564
00:25:10.631 --> 00:25:10.631
<v Speaker 5>actually wind up getting for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not,</v>

565
00:25:10.631 --> 00:25:15.010
<v Speaker 5>but it's in this crazy area where all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people have tech money and that </v>

566
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:15.470
<v Speaker 5>tech money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>squirrely money,</v>

567
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:15.890
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

568
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 5>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

569
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the numbers are crazy.</v>

570
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:21.260
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense to find out </v>
<v Speaker 5>how much money.</v>

571
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.140
<v Speaker 5>Some of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like the Google guys,</v>

572
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.490
<v Speaker 5>the facebook guys and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

573
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 5>Like that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's many yachts,</v>

574
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.920
<v Speaker 5>private jet Manchin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>buy an island money.</v>

575
00:25:31.921 --> 00:25:36.921
<v Speaker 5>It's that insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going to get even crazier in the </v>

576
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:38.270
<v Speaker 5>years ahead with bitcoin because some of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the earliest adopters,</v>

577
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:40.280
<v Speaker 5>the amount of coins they have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think about it,</v>

578
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

579
00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:45.551
<v Speaker 5>these people are for sure going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>billionaires and they're going to be at </v>

580
00:25:45.551 --> 00:25:48.881
<v Speaker 5>the upper end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not even going to be like low </v>

581
00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:48.881
<v Speaker 5>level billionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

582
00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:51.230
<v Speaker 5>But what would happen if they collected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they sold all their bitcoins?</v>

583
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Oh you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't sell them all because then you</v>

584
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 5>crash your own market,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

585
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.680
<v Speaker 5>But then what the fuck is the point in </v>
<v Speaker 5>having it?</v>

586
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.280
<v Speaker 5>I think for them eventually it's about </v>
<v Speaker 5>living in a world where you walk into a </v>

587
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Speaker 5>store and the prices there and bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

588
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.350
<v Speaker 5>So I think if they hold out for long </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough and if it doesn't get fucked over</v>

589
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:14.351
<v Speaker 5>by too much bad stuff like the Mt Gox </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation that we could live in a place </v>

590
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:19.631
<v Speaker 5>like that because then you have one </v>
<v Speaker 5>price regardless of what country you're </v>

591
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:19.631
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

592
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 5>kind of like a universal language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could really happen like it's kind of</v>

593
00:26:23.121 --> 00:26:24.830
<v Speaker 5>a long shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it could actually happen.</v>

594
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.430
<v Speaker 5>And in that case that person becomes </v>
<v Speaker 5>like science fiction rich,</v>

595
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're talking about somebody can be</v>

596
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 5>worth hundreds of billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of just worth,</v>

597
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10,000</v>

598
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:36.990
<v Speaker 5>bitcoins or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So science fiction rich.</v>

599
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.400
<v Speaker 5>So we kind of got off track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did this bitcoin collapse?</v>

600
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 5>How this gox thing</v>

601
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 6>take place?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened there already?</v>

602
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:51.951
<v Speaker 6>Conspiracy theories that Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gox was like some kind of CIA up to </v>

603
00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 6>discredit bitcoin really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's what somebody tweeted me,</v>

604
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 6>but I don't see any evidence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it sounds like something they would</v>

605
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Speaker 6>want to do if they thought of it in </v>
<v Speaker 6>advance,</v>

606
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:03.740
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was purely incompetence.</v>

607
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 6>This was a website that started like Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gox is short for magic.</v>

608
00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:13.251
<v Speaker 6>The gathering online exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really it started as a place where </v>

609
00:27:13.251 --> 00:27:13.720
<v Speaker 6>people sold magic cards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

610
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.350
<v Speaker 6>what not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This every.</v>

611
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.830
<v Speaker 6>They deserve everything that got this </v>
<v Speaker 6>company,</v>

612
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 6>this company didn't know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were doing and didn't,</v>

613
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 6>didn't know their ass from their elbow </v>
<v Speaker 6>in terms of programming languages.</v>

614
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:30.210
<v Speaker 6>Like somebody told me they programmed </v>
<v Speaker 6>their trading platform and PHP,</v>

615
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:35.450
<v Speaker 6>which I don't know that much about </v>
<v Speaker 6>programming that apparently is like </v>

616
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.450
<v Speaker 6>totally not the right language for </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything financial.</v>

617
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.420
<v Speaker 6>And their whole thing is based on this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

618
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 6>so they're just super incompetent and </v>
<v Speaker 6>for whatever reason,</v>

619
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:45.951
<v Speaker 6>they're the ones who stumbled into this </v>
<v Speaker 6>massive market of like you're now </v>

620
00:27:45.951 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 6>trading billions of dollars a bit coins </v>
<v Speaker 6>and supporting the whole planets,</v>

621
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:48.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bitcoin,</v>

622
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.690
<v Speaker 6>a market and they weren't ready for </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

623
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 6>And just series of fuck ups at every </v>
<v Speaker 6>stage of bad pr,</v>

624
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.730
<v Speaker 6>bad at communicating what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 6>when something doesn't work,</v>

625
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:04.731
<v Speaker 6>they just take it offline,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not realizing the implications of what </v>

626
00:28:04.731 --> 00:28:07.291
<v Speaker 6>you're going to scare the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole market if you just take shit </v>

627
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:07.291
<v Speaker 6>off line and don't tell people in </v>
<v Speaker 6>advance.</v>

628
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:12.200
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looks like they got hacked by </v>

629
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 6>somebody that somebody found an exploit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>took the money,</v>

630
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.300
<v Speaker 6>even though the money that was in cold </v>
<v Speaker 6>storage somehow,</v>

631
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:20.990
<v Speaker 6>which was supposed to be impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm sure they weren't competent </v>

632
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:20.990
<v Speaker 6>enough to have fucked up somewhere along</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way.</v>

633
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 6>And now we're in the situation we're in </v>
<v Speaker 6>now where people are panicked.</v>

634
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:24.700
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

635
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:29.750
<v Speaker 6>the good news is that there are other </v>
<v Speaker 6>exchanges out there that are much more </v>

636
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.400
<v Speaker 6>credible backed by real companies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're coming online.</v>

637
00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 6>There are a couple in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're coming online,</v>

638
00:28:34.891 --> 00:28:37.410
<v Speaker 6>which was pretty cool because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see us be in on the action.</v>

639
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:42.411
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to see this be something </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just happening in Japan and so </v>

640
00:28:42.411 --> 00:28:42.411
<v Speaker 6>many places.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>

641
00:28:42.411 --> 00:28:45.270
<v Speaker 6>how did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how did someone break in like how do you</v>

642
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.950
<v Speaker 6>get that money?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what do you,</v>

643
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.200
<v Speaker 6>what are you actually doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How are you getting that money?</v>

644
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

645
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 6>Bitcoin itself has not been hacked and </v>
<v Speaker 6>as far as I know,</v>

646
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:57.960
<v Speaker 6>it's never been hacked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the actual protocol is 100 percent.</v>

647
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to say perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if I send you money,</v>

648
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:01.860
<v Speaker 6>there's certainty that I've sent it to </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

649
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.370
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in this case they were using something </v>

650
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.190
<v Speaker 6>called transaction malleability,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I,</v>

651
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 6>full disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't fully understand this shit,</v>

652
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.350
<v Speaker 6>but pretty much what I think it is is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

653
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.670
<v Speaker 6>if I write you a check,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to wait until that check clears</v>

654
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 6>before you actually assume you have the </v>
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

655
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:25.460
<v Speaker 6>And in this case Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gox was assuming based on unconfirmed </v>

656
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 6>transactions that they had money or that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were sending money.</v>

657
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.930
<v Speaker 6>And you apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you know anything about Bitcoin,</v>

658
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.940
<v Speaker 6>you can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the other exchanges weren't doing </v>

659
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it'd be like if you got a million</v>

660
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 6>dollar check,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could totally be a rubber check.</v>

661
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:39.150
<v Speaker 6>You don't know until it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>cleared.</v>

662
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 6>You can't trade on that million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If bitcoin</v>

663
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.720
<v Speaker 5>really does become an emerging currency </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the whole world adopts.</v>

664
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 5>What a great movie this is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

665
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:53.521
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Gathering Dorks stumble upon this </v>

666
00:29:53.521 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 5>billion dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just see them sitting around.</v>

667
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:54.770
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

668
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.050
<v Speaker 5>we're worth a billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't it be cool if we had,</v>

669
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.430
<v Speaker 5>if we had girls and money and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>switched over to bitcoin and seeing this</v>

670
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 5>fat guy named Mark Karpeles is the CEO </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Mt.</v>

671
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 5>Gox.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this him?</v>

672
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.170
<v Speaker 5>That is him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a fucking Dork.</v>

673
00:30:07.171 --> 00:30:09.520
<v Speaker 5>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today's sorry buddy.</v>

674
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.510
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that bitcoin is going.</v>

675
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.080
<v Speaker 5>He's hiding now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know his whereabouts.</v>

676
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:16.390
<v Speaker 5>So he's either hiding or probably being </v>
<v Speaker 5>tortured somewhere.</v>

677
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

678
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 5>Three hundred $50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Million dollars because of this guys.</v>

679
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 5>Fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big fuck up.</v>

680
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big fuck up.</v>

681
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine how many people want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill him?</v>

682
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 5>That's real money to the $350,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>for folks that understand this.</v>

683
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.020
<v Speaker 5>This is not like people trading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

684
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 5>like fucking magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The gathering corns.</v>

685
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a liquid market.</v>

686
00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:42.061
<v Speaker 5>You could buy $350,</v>
<v Speaker 5>million dollars worth of laptops if you </v>

687
00:30:42.061 --> 00:30:42.061
<v Speaker 5>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could actually.</v>

688
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 5>Tigerdirect is right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

689
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:49.681
<v Speaker 5>and then also vegas casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's two casinos that are allowing </v>

690
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:49.681
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's many.</v>

691
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:54.230
<v Speaker 5>There's many emerging companies or we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>up into this pretty much every day on it</v>

692
00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:55.930
<v Speaker 5>was even thinking about getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved.</v>

693
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 5>They should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should.</v>

694
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>

695
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:06.620
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just going to be a blip on the </v>

696
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:06.620
<v Speaker 5>radar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

697
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many blips this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nonstop Bitcoin,</v>

698
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.830
<v Speaker 5>negative news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

699
00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.320
<v Speaker 5>I think justice news alone is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make people not like invest or do </v>

700
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.871
<v Speaker 5>anything like maybe in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I had the CEO of coin market on my </v>

701
00:31:18.871 --> 00:31:22.010
<v Speaker 5>podcast the other day and he runs one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the US exchanges.</v>

702
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.000
<v Speaker 5>They're actually based in Santa Monica </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he didn't sound phased at all.</v>

703
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:27.310
<v Speaker 5>He told me this is a couple of hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>before Mt.</v>

704
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 5>Gox actually came out as being </v>
<v Speaker 5>insolvent.</v>

705
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:33.870
<v Speaker 5>He told me on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're insolvent and I think </v>

706
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.870
<v Speaker 5>they need to disappear as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>

707
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.000
<v Speaker 5>Not Disappears and run away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just like disappear from the bitcoin</v>

708
00:31:37.001 --> 00:31:42.001
<v Speaker 5>ecosystem so that more credible </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies like us can step in and do </v>

709
00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:46.291
<v Speaker 5>this shit in a way that's legal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>regulated and actually backed by real </v>

710
00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:46.291
<v Speaker 5>investors.</v>

711
00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:47.430
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't sound concerned about.</v>

712
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 5>He's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

713
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:50.350
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this are shitty competition is going out</v>

714
00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:53.340
<v Speaker 5>of business and now we can take over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

715
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 5>I wish I knew enough to know whether or </v>
<v Speaker 5>not he's correct.</v>

716
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.280
<v Speaker 5>That sounds very comforting if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think as long as people continue to </v>

717
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 5>watch porn and like pay web cam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>girls with bitcoins,</v>

718
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.880
<v Speaker 5>as long as people continue to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>online gambling,</v>

719
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:12.090
<v Speaker 5>as long as you have libertarians who </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to stash away some of their money </v>

720
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 5>in case there's some kind of financial </v>
<v Speaker 5>apocalypse,</v>

721
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:17.790
<v Speaker 5>as long as you have those three things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always going to be bitcoin </v>

722
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 5>demand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a question.</v>

723
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.400
<v Speaker 5>You're not allowed to online gamble in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the US with money.</v>

724
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 5>Can you online gamble with bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

725
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's a highly gray area that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be a way to get bitcoin </v>

726
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.460
<v Speaker 5>rockin just tell people that they could </v>
<v Speaker 5>gamble in bitcoin.</v>

727
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are casinos in Vegas now that have</v>

728
00:32:34.091 --> 00:32:39.091
<v Speaker 5>started accepting too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that online it'd be online.</v>

729
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 5>It's prohibitive</v>

730
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.220
<v Speaker 3>because the online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lack of online gambling is what </v>

731
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:45.220
<v Speaker 3>crushed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

732
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.690
<v Speaker 3>international pool league.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a,</v>

733
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Kevin Trudeau,</v>

734
00:32:48.331 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that scam artists,</v>

735
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:54.491
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the secrets that they don't </v>

736
00:32:54.491 --> 00:32:56.771
<v Speaker 3>want you to know about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I'm putting it in a book </v>

737
00:32:56.771 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 3>for everybody to fucking read weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>loss secrets.</v>

738
00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:02.110
<v Speaker 3>They don't want you to know about I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are hiding information or </v>

739
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.360
<v Speaker 3>that guy put together this huge multiple</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollar professional pool league </v>

740
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:13.031
<v Speaker 3>and he was going to market it based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you could gamble on the </v>

741
00:33:13.031 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 3>matches online and right when it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out,</v>

742
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:21.130
<v Speaker 3>right when the invested all the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they changed the laws and it was just a </v>

743
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.210
<v Speaker 3>force out all the online gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the online casinos and online and </v>

00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:31.031
<v Speaker 3>all those different places to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys all got fucked dudes had to </v>

<v Speaker 3>leave the country.</v>

747
00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Like that bodog guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a boy dog fight.</v>

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.870
<v Speaker 3>There's an organization of fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>

749
00:33:35.871 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 3>He had to leave the company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>

750
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.530
<v Speaker 3>You can't come to America if it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

751
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 3>they'll arrest them and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of online gambling,</v>

752
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:42.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

753
00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:45.320
<v Speaker 3>it's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me so sick.</v>

754
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:49.550
<v Speaker 3>The idea that they can somehow another </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent people from gambling,</v>

755
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 3>but you don't prevent them from gambling</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vegas,</v>

756
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent them in Atlantic city.</v>

757
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.920
<v Speaker 3>You don't prevent them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An Indian casinos,</v>

758
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:59.750
<v Speaker 3>you don't prefer them in car casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like they've decided arbitrarily to</v>

759
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:03.360
<v Speaker 3>keep people from doing it online because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hurts those casinos or hurts,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they've decided to allow them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibit business.</v>

762
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.380
<v Speaker 3>They've allowed them to halt competition</v>
<v Speaker 3>and innovation because you're by </v>

<v Speaker 3>if they could,</v>

786
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.370
<v Speaker 3>if that's a legal loophole and you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>use bitcoin to gamble on things.</v>

787
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>God Damn like sports.</v>

788
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:19.340
<v Speaker 3>bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a major league baseball,</v>

789
00:35:19.341 --> 00:35:21.470
<v Speaker 3>NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>

790
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>golf.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

793
00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:31.601
<v Speaker 3>It would be worth billions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only would it be worth billions if </v>

794
00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:32.210
<v Speaker 3>people found out that you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy shit with this bitcoin.</v>

795
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.600
<v Speaker 3>They would start investing chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their portfolio in bitcoins and people </v>

796
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:37.600
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

799
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:46.881
<v Speaker 5>be huge where a lot of guys want to know</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I want to tip the girls that they </v>

800
00:35:46.881 --> 00:35:51.561
<v Speaker 5>watch on the live cam sites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't because they don't want </v>

801
00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:54.651
<v Speaker 5>their credit card linked to the site </v>
<v Speaker 5>because then their wife will see it and </v>

802
00:35:54.651 --> 00:35:54.810
<v Speaker 5>it'd be a whole shitstorm meddling </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch,</v>

803
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 5>but if they can just load up at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>local seven,</v>

804
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:01.390
<v Speaker 5>11 on $50 worth of Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have it transferred to their account and</v>

805
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 5>then they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you buy Bitcoin at 7:11?</v>

806
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 5>Basically you can use a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like various money services are you used</v>

807
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:08.980
<v Speaker 5>to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

808
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 5>that's where things are headed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that we're getting.</v>

809
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.650
<v Speaker 5>Are Their ATM machines now coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>online?</v>

810
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:16.020
<v Speaker 5>There was one in Boston that I saw a </v>
<v Speaker 5>video of.</v>

811
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that as well.</v>

812
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.820
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they,</v>

813
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.460
<v Speaker 5>that would definitely open the door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And for folks who don't know technology,</v>

814
00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:27.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm porn opens up the door to technology</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

815
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean when online video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>online statistics,</v>

816
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff came from adult stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

817
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:36.651
<v Speaker 5>when apple cut flash out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when apple stopped flash on the IPADS </v>

818
00:36:36.651 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 5>and on their laptops and they um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

819
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.420
<v Speaker 5>when they're on their phones rather when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did that.</v>

820
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.170
<v Speaker 5>The what is the other five htp?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

821
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 5>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a supplement.</v>

822
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:51.850
<v Speaker 5>Html five html,</v>
<v Speaker 5>http get new boots.</v>

823
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:56.890
<v Speaker 5>They put new mood and their computers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when they started using html five,</v>

824
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the porn sites started adopting it.</v>

825
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:05.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was like almost instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to not be able to watch porn on </v>

826
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.150
<v Speaker 5>your iphone and then pop pow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>

827
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 5>There's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are human forces.</v>

828
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 5>People need to watch porn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People need to translate it.</v>

829
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 5>David Seaman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do they need it?</v>

830
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 5>People need to transact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

831
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 5>they do need it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

832
00:37:16.411 --> 00:37:17.580
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the Middle East.</v>

833
00:37:17.581 --> 00:37:22.581
<v Speaker 5>I think half the issue with the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>East is that guys are just not getting </v>

834
00:37:22.581 --> 00:37:25.401
<v Speaker 5>off enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should put like a thousand rubbing </v>

835
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:25.401
<v Speaker 5>tugs in the Middle East and just see </v>
<v Speaker 5>what happens.</v>

836
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's,</v>

837
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 5>don't quote me on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I wouldn't.</v>

838
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 5>A postal address like Jabba the hut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

839
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.460
<v Speaker 5>that's an issue to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're covering them up.</v>

840
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.310
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just so repressive and I understand</v>

841
00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:36.720
<v Speaker 5>like you got to respect someone's </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture,</v>

842
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:41.721
<v Speaker 5>but you also have to respect the fact </v>
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of these people living in </v>

843
00:37:41.721 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 5>these societies probably don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live that way.</v>

844
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.750
<v Speaker 5>That culture is a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a problem with any suppressive.</v>

845
00:37:45.751 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 5>Culture is a trap and you can't get out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that trap.</v>

846
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 5>Especially if that trap is tied to </v>
<v Speaker 5>religion.</v>

847
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.370
<v Speaker 5>If you're eliminating inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're eliminating progress,</v>

848
00:37:56.371 --> 00:37:59.190
<v Speaker 5>you're eliminating people growing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing another name of religion.</v>

849
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>

850
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.480
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I don't know what God wrote or what </v>

851
00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.701
<v Speaker 5>he didn't rope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I highly doubt if he's the way </v>

852
00:38:07.701 --> 00:38:07.701
<v Speaker 5>you're describing them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this awesome,</v>

853
00:38:07.701 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 5>amazing guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I highly doubt he gives a fuck what kind</v>

854
00:38:10.651 --> 00:38:13.350
<v Speaker 5>of clothes you wear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just me though.</v>

855
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not thinking for God or anything,</v>

856
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:18.450
<v Speaker 5>but I just highly doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you're dealing with,</v>

857
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.850
<v Speaker 5>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying definitely,</v>

858
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 5>but most likely it's some bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>written by people and it's poisoned.</v>

859
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:29.541
<v Speaker 5>Your culture absolutely poisoned the </v>
<v Speaker 5>very foundations of your culture and </v>

860
00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 5>won't allow any progress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will not allow new information.</v>

861
00:38:32.281 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 5>It will not allow consideration of old </v>
<v Speaker 5>ways.</v>

862
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 5>The way</v>

863
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 1>you live is perfect and it will not </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

864
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:44.190
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be cotton camels heads </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the fucking dull knives to the end </v>

865
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just what it is.</v>

866
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.350
<v Speaker 1>What what you're doing is how you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always gonna do it.</v>

867
00:38:47.351 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll walk by.</v>

868
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to fucking dressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

869
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:56.040
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to bow to the east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that same shit that you've been </v>

870
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:56.230
<v Speaker 1>doing since the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennia.</v>

871
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:58.630
<v Speaker 1>You're going to continue to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>

872
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're labeling somebody you disagree</v>

873
00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:05.481
<v Speaker 2>with is an infidel or as not an infidel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of room for reasonable </v>

874
00:39:05.671 --> 00:39:06.780
<v Speaker 2>discussion there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

875
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:11.810
<v Speaker 2>here's my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the other person's point is </v>

876
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.810
<v Speaker 2>you're an infidel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we had a softball team,</v>

877
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.590
<v Speaker 2>we would call ourselves the infidels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be dope.</v>

878
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.970
<v Speaker 2>A good name for a strip club.</v>

879
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a gre podcast,</v>

880
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:20.150
<v Speaker 1>softball team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs of the Jerry infidel.</v>

881
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be a good neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strip club.</v>

882
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Make all the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll veils belly dance</v>

883
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't feel bad about seeing </v>

884
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 1>their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't see him and be like,</v>

885
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.300
<v Speaker 1>they're robbing a bank when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing you their pussy.</v>

886
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

887
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually called the infidels and all </v>

888
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.251
<v Speaker 1>girls wear veils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad move because a lot of </v>

889
00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:42.251
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

890
00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking it would want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymity.</v>

891
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:45.980
<v Speaker 2>We think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

892
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I saw a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a as soon as actress at a coffee shop </v>

893
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.350
<v Speaker 2>near my place the other day and she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting at a table by herself and had on</v>

894
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.010
<v Speaker 2>like the big bug eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sunglasses,</v>

895
00:39:55.011 --> 00:39:56.780
<v Speaker 2>like she's like a praying mantis pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

896
00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.020
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think people can't want that,</v>

897
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe you want it five percent of </v>

898
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.851
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think in that particular moment </v>

899
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:06.851
<v Speaker 2>somebody would not want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

900
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:07.710
<v Speaker 2>you mean that amount of attention?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

901
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're a woman in some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these Arab societies,</v>

902
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.460
<v Speaker 2>you can't just walk around like American</v>
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>

903
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on one of your podcasts </v>

904
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.531
<v Speaker 2>actually some guy was jerking off on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooftop because he saw like a woman's </v>

905
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Vale come down or something like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>very sexually repressed.</v>

906
00:40:21.801 --> 00:40:26.801
<v Speaker 2>So you can't even just dress normally in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coffee shop without getting the same </v>

907
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:28.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of attention that over here and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>list actress would get.</v>

908
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

909
00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

910
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.700
<v Speaker 1>just the idea that you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover your head,</v>

911
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:34.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

912
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Always wear a veil like,</v>

913
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.820
<v Speaker 2>and it's unsanitary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think over time.</v>

914
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

915
00:40:41.001 --> 00:40:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know more than wearing a baseball</v>

916
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:43.190
<v Speaker 1>hat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

948
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:48.290

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I assumed it was because my iphone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty batteries,</v>

951
00:41:53.001 --> 00:41:58.001
<v Speaker 1>but allowing the world to text you </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially you're allowing the whole </v>

952
00:41:58.001 --> 00:41:58.001
<v Speaker 1>world filled with assholes to text you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

954
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 1>This is going to help me more than going</v>
<v Speaker 1>a infrared saunas and all the bullshit I</v>

955
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:08.021
<v Speaker 1>do to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to take twitter off my </v>

956
00:42:08.021 --> 00:42:08.021
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

957
00:42:08.021 --> 00:42:08.021
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

958
00:42:08.021 --> 00:42:09.330
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you.</v>

959
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.860
<v Speaker 1>When you deal with that many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have them at their discretion.</v>

960
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Get in touch with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

961
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.970
<v Speaker 1>You have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to try to connect with </v>

962
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 1>people online because it's what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's what I do as well,</v>

963
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 1>but you can't allow them to just do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at their discretionary time because it's</v>

964
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:25.360
<v Speaker 1>intrusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

965
00:42:25.361 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 1>your regular life is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be able to have time to</v>

966
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 1>reflect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

967
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you'll never form your own opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just be constantly inundated with</v>

968
00:42:33.501 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 1>information and other people's activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

969
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.110
<v Speaker 1>You can't allow that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

970
00:42:38.111 --> 00:42:43.111
<v Speaker 1>It's a symptom of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a symptom of the new world and you </v>

971
00:42:43.111 --> 00:42:47.111
<v Speaker 1>know you are experiencing it in extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>form because you're sort of a public </v>

972
00:42:47.111 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 1>figure and you're a journalist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're controversial.</v>

973
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cover a lot of very fascinating </v>

974
00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:56.411
<v Speaker 1>subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to get a lot more than </v>

975
00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:56.411
<v Speaker 1>the average person who has this set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

976
00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

977
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very true.</v>

978
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starting today,</v>

979
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 1>my phone would explode if I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would literally shake.</v>

980
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It would just shake and just boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sparks would fly out of it on your </v>

981
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.631
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like froze up because of something </v>

982

983
00:43:13.631 --> 00:43:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking that I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the twitter app probably can't </v>

984
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:20.861
<v Speaker 1>handle that many things at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just frees up a one time I accidentally </v>

985
00:43:20.861 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 1>gave him my cell phone number out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

986
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to send it to somebody in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pm and I sent it.</v>

987
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I sent it to the whole world and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking phone literally just shut off </v>

988
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 1>and rebooted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

989
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:33.140
<v Speaker 1>this has got to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to reboot myself.</v>

990
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I've rebooted itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just was like,</v>

991
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and committed suicide.</v>

992
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 1>So awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just my.</v>

993
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 1>My inbox filled up in five seconds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the texts that were coming,</v>

994
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:47.540
<v Speaker 1>there's just.</v>

1042
00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:38.090
<v Speaker 1>So the stuff that we can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all like real blurry.</v>

1043
00:45:38.091 --> 00:45:38.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the other stuff.</v>

1044
00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:43.890
<v Speaker 6>Do you think this is what the NSA sees?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They see like every new human being </v>

1045
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:43.890
<v Speaker 6>coming online?</v>

1046
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The NSA is,</v>

1047
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:47.060
<v Speaker 1>they're paying attention 24 hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>to every one of these babies.</v>

1048
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Make sure they're not fucking doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything illegal.</v>

1049
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 1>So get all these babies is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking.</v>

1050
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:56.330
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like we're going to run out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of oxygen or something.</v>

1051
00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see a lot of American flags </v>

1052
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.390
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1053
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of those other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the red Chinese flag that </v>

1054
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.430
<v Speaker 1>bothers me as an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to do our job and do </v>

1055
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:10.730
<v Speaker 1>some more fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the deaths.</v>

1056
00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.490
<v Speaker 1>China is number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most birth India.</v>

1057
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just stopped.</v>

1058
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.420
<v Speaker 1>What if freaked out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1059
00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:19.530
<v Speaker 1>But your computer crash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1060
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Well what if they just stopped having </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies?</v>

1061
00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:29.070
<v Speaker 1>What is one day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went on that thing and it was a day </v>

1062
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:29.390
<v Speaker 1>where there was no babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That movie with,</v>

1063
00:46:29.391 --> 00:46:30.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Clive Owen.</v>

1064
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Children of men?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:46:32.121 --> 00:46:34.520
<v Speaker 1>When people stopped being fertile or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something stupid,</v>

1066
00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that is the,</v>

1067
00:46:36.291 --> 00:46:39.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are not dooming gloomers</v>

1068
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:43.700
<v Speaker 1>about overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their idea is that as time goes on,</v>

1069
00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:48.701
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is the cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like third world cultures that are like </v>

1070
00:46:48.701 --> 00:46:51.980
<v Speaker 1>really into having a massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>child children,</v>

1071
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.130
<v Speaker 1>childbirths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are going to become more developed</v>

1072
00:46:55.131 --> 00:47:00.131
<v Speaker 1>and as they become more developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually gonna have a decrease in </v>

1073
00:47:00.131 --> 00:47:00.440
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the non doom and gloomers.</v>

1074
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.140
<v Speaker 1>They obviously don't have this website </v>
<v Speaker 1>on bookmark.</v>

1075
00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:08.260
<v Speaker 1>If they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would see the fucking invasion in </v>

1076
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:08.420
<v Speaker 1>real time see it happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1077
00:47:08.421 --> 00:47:10.220
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we're going to have enough oil.</v>

1078
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:15.350
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a theory that the more people </v>

1079
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:16.911
<v Speaker 6>you have in an area,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more kind of like intelligent </v>

1080
00:47:16.911 --> 00:47:19.140
<v Speaker 6>productivity you have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So higher population doesn't lead to the</v>

1081
00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.160
<v Speaker 6>Malthusian meltdown where people starve </v>
<v Speaker 6>and kill each other to get back into a </v>

1082
00:47:24.781 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 6>lower population realm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Instead.</v>

1083
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 6>It's the high population itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what is leading</v>

1084
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 5>to innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And somewhere along that innovation can </v>

1085
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.340
<v Speaker 5>keep up with the higher population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>

1086
00:47:36.341 --> 00:47:41.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's basically you look at humans </v>

1087
00:47:41.341 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 5>like kind of like a network capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense.</v>

1088
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.930
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what concerns me most?</v>

1089
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.700
<v Speaker 5>Those are just the actual natural </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical resources.</v>

1090
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched him.</v>

1091
00:47:46.831 --> 00:47:49.600
<v Speaker 5>Pollution and pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched that movie.</v>

1092
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 5>Jiro dreams of Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a great.</v>

1093
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.240
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about that movie like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>

1094
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really interesting.</v>

1095
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

1096
00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:59.470
<v Speaker 5>First of all I learned two things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

1097
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.710
<v Speaker 5>I would never want to be a fucking Sushi</v>
<v Speaker 5>chef because they work too hard.</v>

1098
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.510
<v Speaker 5>Those fucking people work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1099
00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 5>The apprentices who are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they stay apprentice.</v>

1100
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:08.080
<v Speaker 5>So they're like 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1101
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:13.170
<v Speaker 5>How about the fact that the guy worked </v>
<v Speaker 5>on making eggs for like 10 years before </v>

1102
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 5>he got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when the guy told him he did it</v>

1103
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:15.400
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start crying.</v>

1104
00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You cooked an egg,</v>

1105
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:21.040
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why that movie is so beautiful,</v>

1106
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:26.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we will be sick of that shit </v>

1107
00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:26.041
<v Speaker 5>after 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy has a 10 seat room.</v>

1108
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.020
<v Speaker 5>It's a 10 seat room in the Tokyo subway </v>
<v Speaker 5>station that's booked out for months are</v>

1109
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 5>booked out from us and it's the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sushi in the world apparently.</v>

1110
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.470
<v Speaker 5>And the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean his,</v>

1111
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:40.650
<v Speaker 5>his son's 50 years old and his son goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the fish market every day and buys </v>

1112
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:45.751
<v Speaker 5>from the same guy who's like literally </v>
<v Speaker 5>got a flashlight on the tuna and </v>

1113
00:48:45.751 --> 00:48:47.300
<v Speaker 5>touching it with his fingers and he has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to make sure it's,</v>

1114
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:52.380
<v Speaker 5>he has a feel for the texture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the texture will directly contribute or </v>

1115
00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.820
<v Speaker 5>directly correlate with great flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he knows what textures the right </v>

1116
00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.081
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they know like how to age the tuna </v>

1117
00:49:01.081 --> 00:49:03.490
<v Speaker 5>and you know how long for an old tuna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long for a young tuna.</v>

1118
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.760
<v Speaker 5>Fucking crazy shit man is a true art </v>
<v Speaker 5>artisans.</v>

1119
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 5>When you imagine if we had that in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>US,</v>

1120
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 5>like at every level of our society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody putting out a new APP,</v>

1121
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.460
<v Speaker 5>like the new facebook APP is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if this is perfected yet </v>

1122
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.160
<v Speaker 5>and they just study it for the next six </v>
<v Speaker 5>months before they release it.</v>

1123
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:19.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No shit man.</v>

1124
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.690
<v Speaker 5>And I mean there's no money to be made </v>
<v Speaker 5>and what this guy is doing either,</v>

1125
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's enough money to keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>afloat,</v>

1126
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's got a 10 seat fucking place and</v>

1127
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:34.510
<v Speaker 5>these people talk about his Sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

1128
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:39.511
<v Speaker 5>restaurant tours and restaurant critics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they say they get nervous when they </v>

1129
00:49:39.511 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 5>go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get nervous when they meet him.</v>

1130
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.260
<v Speaker 5>The guy takes the same fucking subway </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyday,</v>

1131
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 5>sits in the same seat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exxon at the same stop.</v>

1132
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.480
<v Speaker 5>He's 85 fucking years old and he's been </v>
<v Speaker 5>working every day since he was like </v>

1133
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:51.480
<v Speaker 5>fucking 20.</v>

1134
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Look at what an old boss as though if he</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes back up there.</v>

1135
00:49:53.941 --> 00:49:54.590
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.150
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's his son.</v>

1137
00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 5>His son's 50 like everything about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way they cook.</v>

1138
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 5>The place is fucking amazing and made me</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to fly to Japan.</v>

1139
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:06.790
<v Speaker 5>Maybe want a book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet you can't even book online,</v>

1140
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:10.420
<v Speaker 5>but you've got to go there in person and</v>
<v Speaker 5>get your reservations.</v>

1141
00:50:10.421 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 5>But it made me want to try this Sushi </v>
<v Speaker 5>and finding what the fuck is all about.</v>

1142
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:18.330
<v Speaker 5>He probably gives you like a riddle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Zen Koan that you have to solve </v>

1143
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:18.330
<v Speaker 5>and if you solve it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1144
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:19.320
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three months from now launch,</v>

1145
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:24.510
<v Speaker 5>we're on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if I was going to do what I would </v>

1146
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.020
<v Speaker 5>want to do it quick before that whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>place is nuclear war Godzilla shows up.</v>

1147
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this shit</v>

1148
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.000
<v Speaker 6>is pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1149
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 6>unsettling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very unsettling.</v>

1150
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:32.560
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a sign</v>

1151
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:37.580
<v Speaker 3>just that went there and was catching </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish from right off the shore and they </v>

1152
00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.491
<v Speaker 3>tested 50 tests a flounder I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the other word for a flounder?</v>

1153
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Good grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old men have been the sole ground fish </v>

1154
00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:48.170
<v Speaker 3>flatfish one of those flat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is those,</v>

1155
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:49.050
<v Speaker 3>those fisher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1156
00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.300
<v Speaker 3>they stay in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not migratory.</v>

1157
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.830
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could eat.</v>

1158
00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1159
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:57.540
<v Speaker 3>it was fine to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what he's saying is that the ocean is</v>

1160
00:50:57.541 --> 00:51:02.100
<v Speaker 3>so fucking enormous that it's not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>having the same effect that people think</v>

1161
00:51:02.101 --> 00:51:03.090
<v Speaker 3>it has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:51:03.091 --> 00:51:05.760
<v Speaker 3>it is scary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water leak is very scary.</v>

1163
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:09.380
<v Speaker 3>It's still dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dissipates out enough that the ocean.</v>

1164
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean is so goddamn big that right </v>

1165
00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:17.691
<v Speaker 3>now it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real issue is not just </v>

1166
00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's these nuclear plants in general.</v>

1167
00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I try to make it relative.</v>

1168
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Someone like I had a conversation with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend who is a very pro business and </v>

1169
00:51:25.711 --> 00:51:26.960
<v Speaker 3>very pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1170
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:32.010
<v Speaker 3>nuclear power and the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear power and he's talking about </v>

1171
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.510
<v Speaker 3>these few places where the issues have </v>
<v Speaker 3>arisen and I said,</v>

1172
00:51:33.511 --> 00:51:34.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1173
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of time that nuclear power's been</v>

1174
00:51:37.771 --> 00:51:38.730
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1175
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Now think about the amount of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>power plants that exist now.</v>

1176
00:51:42.811 --> 00:51:47.811
<v Speaker 3>Think about how many of the men have had</v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic failures only to write only</v>

1177
00:51:48.451 --> 00:51:49.170
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>

1178
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 3>but those two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those places are fa hucked forever.</v>

1179
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.410
<v Speaker 3>There's two and it's less than 100 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nuclear power.</v>

1180
00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:03.030
<v Speaker 3>How long do you think people bit around </v>
<v Speaker 3>what if people around another 20,000</v>

1181
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:08.031
<v Speaker 3>years stop and think about how many of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those nuclear power plants are gonna </v>

1182
00:52:08.031 --> 00:52:09.780
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck everything around them.</v>

1183
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.020
<v Speaker 3>There's two places right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chernobyl and this place,</v>

1184
00:52:13.021 --> 00:52:16.170
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a three mile island or </v>
<v Speaker 3>four mile island or whatever the fuck it</v>

1185
00:52:16.171 --> 00:52:18.030
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That place is kind of fucked,</v>

1186
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.410
<v Speaker 3>but not quite as fucked.</v>

1187
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we know enough about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that we're too.</v>

1188
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.580
<v Speaker 6>It's too new for us and we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>the the timetable that you would need to</v>

1189
00:52:27.581 --> 00:52:28.470
<v Speaker 6>do it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1190
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.610
<v Speaker 6>You're absolutely like our lifespans are</v>
<v Speaker 6>just too short.</v>

1191
00:52:30.611 --> 00:52:35.611
<v Speaker 6>We're like fucking fruit flies working </v>
<v Speaker 6>with this technology that has </v>

1192
00:52:35.611 --> 00:52:39.121
<v Speaker 6>ramifications.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That will be around for thousands of </v>

1193
00:52:39.121 --> 00:52:41.760
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why don't our lifespan is nothing </v>

1194
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:41.760
<v Speaker 6>compared to the lifespan of any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>leak will.</v>

1195
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:46.141
<v Speaker 6>Also we.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We grew up in a time where these things </v>

1196
00:52:46.141 --> 00:52:49.321
<v Speaker 6>that already existed and we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>any say in their construction and so </v>

1197
00:52:49.321 --> 00:52:52.771
<v Speaker 6>they were manufactured by people kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>assumed there may have been around all </v>

1198
00:52:52.771 --> 00:52:57.420
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Technology's probably oldest fuck by </v>

1199
00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:57.420
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is old as fuck.</v>

1200
00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.160
<v Speaker 3>The one in Fukushima is old as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's outdated technology,</v>

1201
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.790
<v Speaker 3>but they kind of assumed upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction that with innovation,</v>

1202
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:06.791
<v Speaker 3>with progress in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be able to be a way to </v>

1203
00:53:06.791 --> 00:53:07.130
<v Speaker 3>correct all these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1204
00:53:07.131 --> 00:53:08.810
<v Speaker 3>there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still isn't.</v>

1205
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:12.000
<v Speaker 6>At least with coal power plants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even though those are messy too,</v>

1206
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:17.690
<v Speaker 6>it's only fucking up the present.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like you're leaving this thing </v>

1207
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:18.340
<v Speaker 6>that for thousands of years is going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be a,</v>

1208
00:53:18.341 --> 00:53:23.341
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>making children have birth defects and </v>

1209
00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:23.341
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1210
00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:26.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's messy when it's drawn out of the </v>

1211
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.270
<v Speaker 6>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's probably not good for the at all,</v>

1212
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that's destroying </v>

1213
00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:31.340
<v Speaker 2>areas for long time.</v>

1214
00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

1215
00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at what people are willing to </v>

1216
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.590
<v Speaker 1>accept and not willing to accept just in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of,</v>

1217
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having fuel just to the name of progress</v>

1218
00:53:41.291 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 1>just in the name of financial reward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1219
00:53:45.571 --> 00:53:49.660
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of scary how flippant people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are about polluting the ocean,</v>

1220
00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:54.930
<v Speaker 1>about polluting the BP oil spill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had Peter Schiff on and we were </v>

1221
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.280
<v Speaker 1>talking about the BP thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about.</v>

1222
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to that one.</v>

1223
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.800
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kind of gets under my skin because a </v>

1224
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.370
<v Speaker 2>lot of the limited government stuff I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can latch onto and agree with,</v>

1225
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.250
<v Speaker 2>but then there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to describe it.</v>

1226
00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:11.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's not a certain humanism</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that you need to have.</v>

1227
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everything doesn't have to be in </v>

1228
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:16.280
<v Speaker 2>your framework of the free market </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle.</v>

1229
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.330
<v Speaker 2>That's great for a lot of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to get the best water or the</v>

1230
00:54:18.331 --> 00:54:23.331
<v Speaker 2>best soda or the best weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a good idea to get free </v>

1231
00:54:23.331 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 2>markets working there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have competition.</v>

1232
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be for every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>facet of life.</v>

1233
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Well the real issue with him is </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental.</v>

1234
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His willingness to,</v>

1235
00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fracking thing like his,</v>

1236
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.880
<v Speaker 1>his concerned about fracking was so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1237
00:54:37.881 --> 00:54:40.080
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really funny.</v>

1238
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Like talking to them about people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had their land is destroyed forever</v>

1239
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.930
<v Speaker 1>and he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they got millions of dollars.</v>

1240
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got money that would've never been </v>

1241
00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:51.140
<v Speaker 1>able to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got hush money,</v>

1242
00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their land is fucked like that.</v>

1243
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.710
<v Speaker 1>The money is all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all relative.</v>

1244
00:54:55.711 --> 00:54:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Like what's a million dollars to Peter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schiff?</v>

1245
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not nearly as much as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to those people.</v>

1246
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Peter Schiff,</v>

1247
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 1>a million dollars or whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

1248
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:08.990
<v Speaker 1>that's worth it to destroy a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>property essentially for as long as</v>

1249
00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.480
<v Speaker 2>people wasn't around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was weird about that too is I think</v>

1250
00:55:11.481 --> 00:55:14.990
<v Speaker 2>you asked him about the environmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact and he said there's nothing wrong</v>

1251
00:55:14.991 --> 00:55:16.370
<v Speaker 2>with fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no environment.</v>

1252
00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:18.980
<v Speaker 2>The environmental impact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know that's not true.</v>

1253
00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Like just google it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all over the place.</v>

1254
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's over a thousand documented wells</v>

1255
00:55:24.171 --> 00:55:25.980
<v Speaker 1>that have been polluted from fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:31.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that if fracturing works </v>

1257
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:33.641
<v Speaker 1>exactly according to plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so deep in the ground that you're </v>

1258

1322
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:33.660
<v Speaker 5>You can't just pump water and chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the ground because we know that </v>

1323
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.170

00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hydraulic fracturing.</v>

1333
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.470
<v Speaker 5>That's literally what he sounds like </v>
<v Speaker 5>when he talks about it,</v>

1334
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.270
<v Speaker 5>explaining how simple it is.</v>

1335
00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:09.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's only poisoned to thousand wells so </v>

1336
00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.000
<v Speaker 5>far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's only been around for a few decades.</v>

1337
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:15.120
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No worry.</v>

1339
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.570
<v Speaker 5>I think we're predisposed to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who sound reasonable.</v>

<v Speaker 5>David,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seaman,</v>

1342
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:28.361
<v Speaker 5>let's be reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hydraulic fracturing is very safe and </v>

1343
00:59:28.361 --> 00:59:29.660
<v Speaker 5>should ask for it in your community </v>
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>

1344
00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:35.100
<v Speaker 5>forward in your own home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hydraulically fracture your own gas from</v>

1345
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:40.301
<v Speaker 5>the ground below you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like the reverse mortgage guy </v>

1346
00:59:40.301 --> 00:59:42.290
<v Speaker 5>that's on at nights and convincing old </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who a cash in their home equity,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like it's a good way to.</v>

1348
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 5>It shows him in front of a sports car </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

1349
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:51.071
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get a sports car but you also lose </v>

1350
00:59:51.071 --> 00:59:51.071
<v Speaker 5>the fucking equity to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1351
00:59:51.071 --> 00:59:51.680
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no longer own the house you live in,</v>

1352
00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:56.980
<v Speaker 5>but at least that is just financial </v>
<v Speaker 5>money comes and goes and is there.</v>

1353
00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.310
<v Speaker 5>You're not poisoning the fucking very </v>
<v Speaker 5>water that people can drink.</v>

1354
01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:06.610
<v Speaker 5>You're not changing the water like </v>
<v Speaker 5>people used to be able to use that to </v>

1355
01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 5>fertilize crops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to feed their animals,</v>

1356
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.160
<v Speaker 5>to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they drink it.</v>

1357
01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.680
<v Speaker 5>They get like neuro toxins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get like anybody's in nerves.</v>

1358
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 5>Stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody who thinks that's totally okay.</v>

1359
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.480
<v Speaker 5>I would recommend the prescription of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Yoga,</v>

1360
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.450
<v Speaker 5>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weed,</v>

1361
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 5>Brownies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as permissible by law.</v>

1362
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:29.650
<v Speaker 5>All those things would all three of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those things would be the Trifecta of </v>

1363
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:32.890
<v Speaker 5>not being a dick anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The weed brownies or the most </v>

1364
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.931
<v Speaker 5>introspective in like if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>think about a drug that makes you </v>

1365
01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 5>consider everything that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>

1366
01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.780
<v Speaker 5>God damn those things get to the heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>of it helps me see like the other </v>

1367
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.400
<v Speaker 5>person's perspective and then even if I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to go ahead with what I'm doing,</v>

1368
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 5>at least I've seen it from their point </v>
<v Speaker 5>of view,</v>

1369
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:47.840
<v Speaker 5>so it's not coming from a place of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ignorance coming from,</v>

1370
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:48.860
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1371
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:49.790
<v Speaker 5>now I can do what I want.</v>

1372
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:55.180
<v Speaker 5>Whereas before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just the person who doesn't see </v>

1373
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 5>how the world is perceiving it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of scary.</v>

1374
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:57.650
<v Speaker 5>It's scary to me that I went that long </v>
<v Speaker 5>without,</v>

1375
01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>using that stuff.</v>

1376
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>

1377
01:01:00.501 --> 01:01:05.501
<v Speaker 5>the reason for a lot of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>have these negative opinions on </v>

1378
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:10.811
<v Speaker 5>marijuana brownies or cookies is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the times that they're used </v>

1379
01:01:10.811 --> 01:01:14.231
<v Speaker 5>recreationally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the Times people are using them </v>

1380
01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:14.231
<v Speaker 5>just sort of have fun with or they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up.</v>

1381
01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:18.850
<v Speaker 5>They're already drunk and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>associate being hung over and like </v>

1382
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:20.150
<v Speaker 5>making bad decisions with the marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 5>has nothing to do with that.</v>

1383
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.980
<v Speaker 5>What people think of it as more of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>party thing,</v>

1384
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 5>which you kind of can be mean and it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>fun to get high and watch star wars with</v>

1385
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.590
<v Speaker 5>your buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

1386
01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:28.720
<v Speaker 5>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1387
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 5>if you have a bunch of people over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house and he'd go,</v>

1388
01:01:30.831 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 5>let's eat pot brownies and watch star </v>
<v Speaker 5>wars.</v>

1389
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1390
01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:39.011
<v Speaker 5>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also fun to watch star trek by </v>

1391
01:01:39.011 --> 01:01:40.520
<v Speaker 5>yourself like every day on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it also.</v>

1392
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:45.570
<v Speaker 5>But besides being fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it most certainly can be a tool for </v>

1393
01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:47.090
<v Speaker 5>psychological expert exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really can,</v>

1394
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.470
<v Speaker 5>you can explore some areas of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness that maybe you didn't know</v>

1395
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:56.471
<v Speaker 5>were really troubling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then all of a sudden they get </v>

1396
01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:58.540
<v Speaker 5>dragged into the forefront and some </v>
<v Speaker 5>spotlights get turned on them and you </v>

1397
01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.991
<v Speaker 5>didn't even know that you had some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a subliminal or subconscious hiding </v>

1398
01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:03.760
<v Speaker 5>of these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1399
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:09.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a scientist at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I really believe that stuff like </v>

1400
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.531
<v Speaker 5>that has evolved alongside us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's part of the reason why it's </v>

1401
01:02:11.531 --> 01:02:12.980
<v Speaker 5>not harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why nobody ever ods on marijuana is that</v>

1402
01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:16.580
<v Speaker 5>we've had time to adapt to it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>adapted to us and we have this symbiotic</v>

1403
01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 5>relationship where it's making us a more</v>
<v Speaker 5>introspective</v>

1404
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.880
<v Speaker 2>and we're able to innovate as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

1405
01:02:23.881 --> 01:02:28.881
<v Speaker 2>we tend to grow more marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which keeps it alive and keeps it </v>

1406
01:02:28.881 --> 01:02:28.881
<v Speaker 2>thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this,</v>

1407
01:02:28.881 --> 01:02:30.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing like a coral reef almost.</v>

1408
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 2>And then we come along with modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

1409
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>We make all this shit illegal just for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sake of it.</v>

1410
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:41.690
<v Speaker 2>And we do away with things that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had is basic tools for most of </v>

1411
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:45.171
<v Speaker 2>human history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about it like this shit is </v>

1412
01:02:45.171 --> 01:02:45.171
<v Speaker 2>only been illegal for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like 70 years?</v>

1413
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main thing you're dead on.</v>

1414
01:02:47.251 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's changing.</v>

1415
01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can stop the change </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's currently underway.</v>

1416
01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:58.701
<v Speaker 3>I think what Colorado did and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Seattle or Washington state did that </v>

1417
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.050
<v Speaker 3>those decisions were made by people </v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

1418
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 3>And then you see that not only is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky's not falling,</v>

1419
01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 3>but those people are making a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and then then it just opens up and</v>

1420
01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:12.711
<v Speaker 3>now that the banks are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to take the money from the </v>

1421
01:03:12.711 --> 01:03:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Colorado dispensary's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they call them?</v>

1422
01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.960
<v Speaker 3>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a dispenser.</v>

1423
01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 3>If it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a pot store</v>

1424
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>dispensary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If caregiver shit,</v>

1425
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>maybe not your share giver because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not medical,</v>

1426
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 2>it's just the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Rato was just selling weed.</v>

1427
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.670
<v Speaker 2>They just gave up on the whole medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and they're like,</v>

1428
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just selling weed.</v>

1429
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Come on in Seattle still hanging back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1430
01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what are you guys doing?</v>

1431
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I think they'll see that people are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go crazy and it's going to help</v>

1432
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:44.361
<v Speaker 2>the local economy a lot and then other </v>
<v Speaker 2>states who want to adopt some form of </v>

1433
01:03:44.361 --> 01:03:44.361
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:03:44.361 --> 01:03:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is like the crazy friend that </v>
<v Speaker 2>eats the mushrooms first car.</v>

1435
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys share that.</v>

1436
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 2>That's not a much of a kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking eat it,</v>

1437
01:03:50.671 --> 01:03:55.671
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado's like your crazy friend who's </v>

1438
01:03:55.671 --> 01:03:56.670
<v Speaker 2>like real skinny but never gets sick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a cowboy hat on and he's like,</v>

1439
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat that fucking Brownie Brown.</v>

1440
01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:01.530
<v Speaker 2>So Colorado just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1441
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>we'll just fucking start selling it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see what's up.</v>

1442
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:09.380
<v Speaker 2>And so all these people have started </v>
<v Speaker 2>these huge businesses and within the </v>

1443
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 2>first day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the first seven hours they'd made</v>

1444
01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:14.090
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1445
01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:17.340
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that's being there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tourism,</v>

1446
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 2>like people are driving from Wyoming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Colorado.</v>

1447
01:04:20.311 --> 01:04:22.560
<v Speaker 2>So they combined the cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cuts down on crime.</v>

1448
01:04:22.561 --> 01:04:27.561
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who actually is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager at one of the dispensary is out </v>

1449
01:04:27.561 --> 01:04:31.131
<v Speaker 2>there in Denver and she was telling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>when one of their dispensary's moves </v>

1450
01:04:31.131 --> 01:04:35.421
<v Speaker 2>into a neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people stopped going to their </v>

1451
01:04:35.421 --> 01:04:37.560
<v Speaker 2>dealer and they just come into the store</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's their new place obviously,</v>

1452
01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:39.240
<v Speaker 2>because they want to do something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>less risky.</v>

1453
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just fucked all those dealers out</v>

1454
01:04:41.641 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 2>of their money like that's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's being taxed now.</v>

1455
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:49.071
<v Speaker 2>It's being regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's helping people because people are </v>

1456
01:04:49.071 --> 01:04:51.891
<v Speaker 2>being paid jobs that actually pay well </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just one drug dealer taking </v>

1457
01:04:51.891 --> 01:04:52.570
<v Speaker 2>all the money and it's interesting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own.</v>

1458
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>They can grow their own as well.</v>

1459
01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1460
01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.320
<v Speaker 3>that's another beautiful thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about the cops </v>

1461
01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.991
<v Speaker 3>coming to your house and breaking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your front door because you got a plant </v>

1462
01:05:02.991 --> 01:05:06.051
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in your closet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about that </v>

1463
01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:06.051
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

1464
01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:09.910
<v Speaker 2>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the balance that La is </v>

1465
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.430
<v Speaker 2>struck where there are dispensaries you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can buy from and you see the green,</v>

1466
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.100
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.480
<v Speaker 2>The plus sign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not in your face,</v>

1468
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:20.510
<v Speaker 2>so if you're somebody who doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>or it makes you paranoid when you do it </v>

1469
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.510
<v Speaker 2>or you just have a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>upbringing,</v>

1470
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not something where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly confronted by it.</v>

1471
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you want it,</v>

1472
01:05:24.941 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't.</v>

1473
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:28.090
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be a part of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1474
01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.150
<v Speaker 2>That's the way it should</v>

1475
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>like it in their neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1476
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was really kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

1477
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:37.561
<v Speaker 1>I was driving down the street with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine and it was in his </v>

1478
01:05:37.561 --> 01:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and there's like the green </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus signs and he's like,</v>

1479
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:43.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking things are all over my </v>

1480
01:05:43.801 --> 01:05:43.801
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and I'm like soon as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquor store.</v>

1481
01:05:43.801 --> 01:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Stupid is the liquor store right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1482
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

1483
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.450
<v Speaker 2>And no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody.</v>

1484
01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Nobody leaves the dispensary looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>unhappy.</v>

1485
01:05:49.911 --> 01:05:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Like people always leave liquor stores </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking all bummed out.</v>

1486
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:57.360
<v Speaker 1>People leave dispensary's looking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way they leave when they nutting </v>

1487
01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 1>their pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they go and get a lap dance like,</v>

1488
01:05:58.181 --> 01:05:59.760
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I got away with that.</v>

1489
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 1>They get in their car and they drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>away like some kind of a criminal.</v>

1490
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1491
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just have this attitude that,</v>

1492
01:06:10.451 --> 01:06:15.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a dispensary somehow or another </v>

1493
01:06:15.451 --> 01:06:15.451
<v Speaker 1>different than having a liquor store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got a liquor store,</v>

1494
01:06:15.451 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Drive out of his house,</v>

1495
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.850
<v Speaker 1>take a left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go down the hill,</v>

1496
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's liquor store is a fucking </v>

1497
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:24.480
<v Speaker 1>dispensary a mile away from that is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my neighborhood.</v>

1498
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 1>So what's all this green plus sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

1499
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Or when you're out with somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they smell it on a sidewalk and they're </v>

1500
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of offended by it.</v>

1501
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you offended?</v>

1502
01:06:33.971 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's peaceful.</v>

1503
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 2>It's if people are having a good time </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you,</v>

1504
01:06:38.051 --> 01:06:39.790
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that there's crime or </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>

1505
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Not only that smells good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1506
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.320
<v Speaker 2>You got caught a plus sign instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>green cross.</v>

1507
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.240
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no religion on across.</v>

1508
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be like Red Cross </v>

1509
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.300
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross.</v>

1510
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1511
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.300
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Green Cross.</v>

1512
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean even the cross is not a cross</v>

1513
01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:55.000
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a plus sign.</v>

1514
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

1515
01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:58.960
<v Speaker 2>It's good to have crosses an extended </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>

1516
01:06:58.961 --> 01:07:00.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference in the shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

1517
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Red Cross's cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicinal use.</v>

1518
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's a cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's a green cross.</v>

1519
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't really call it a cross.</v>

1520
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.920
<v Speaker 2>I like plus better anyways because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any kind of religious </v>

1521
01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:13.920
<v Speaker 2>connotation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1522
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that really what Red Cross is </v>

1523
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:19.050
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that why?</v>

1524
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Why is it okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1525
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's Google it.</v>

1526
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:24.810
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the great things about </v>

1527
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:24.810
<v Speaker 2>being a journalist is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to the point,</v>

1528
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:29.370
<v Speaker 2>you just realize you can say no to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and that's the best way to do it </v>

1529
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>because you have google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to like draw on what </v>

1530
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1531
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1533
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:40.470
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the green plus sign on pot </v>

1534
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.470
<v Speaker 1>dispensaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1535
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Um Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say,</v>

1536
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.750
<v Speaker 2>how has this not been asked a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>times over in like reading reddit trees.</v>

1537
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:51.730
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting thing because like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of these stores,</v>

1538
01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.390
<v Speaker 1>that green plus sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become so universal that's,</v>

1539
01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>that's all it has on the sign to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>green plus sign and then I'll say like,</v>

1540
01:07:58.601 --> 01:08:00.040
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1541
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.150
<v Speaker 1>the whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1542
01:08:01.151 --> 01:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>West Valley caregivers was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was Wv,</v>

1543
01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:06.970
<v Speaker 1>CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all it said.</v>

1544
01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you get near the West valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>caregivers like,</v>

1545
01:08:09.011 --> 01:08:12.900
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you actually selling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they get in there and just tanks.</v>

1546
01:08:12.901 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>

1547
01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're doing.</v>

1548
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately that place that I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to,</v>

1549
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:23.500
<v Speaker 1>my favorite spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government told them that they had </v>

1550
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>to close down because they had opened up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a too late,</v>

1551
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:28.640
<v Speaker 1>like after a certain amount of time they</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't approved or something like that.</v>

1552
01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:33.940
<v Speaker 1>And the dude was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very nervous about it because </v>

1553
01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.131
<v Speaker 1>they had shut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten shut down once for something </v>

1554
01:08:36.131 --> 01:08:36.131
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1555
01:08:36.131 --> 01:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who owned it previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up going to jail.</v>

1556
01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:43.620
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the few people that got </v>

1557
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:43.620
<v Speaker 1>popped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually he didn't know him that when he</v>

1558
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.591
<v Speaker 1>owned another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know one of the guys who got </v>

1559
01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>popped and wind up doing time and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys in San Francisco,</v>

1560
01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:51.020
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pot university guys,</v>

1561
01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:52.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis University,</v>

1562
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>those guys are still duking it out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

1563
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot,</v>

1564
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:57.230
<v Speaker 1>pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>McCormick,</v>

1565
01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.600
<v Speaker 1>todd McCormick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>todd mccormick.</v>

1566
01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Our friend is involved in some legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

1567
01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

1568
01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I only do delivery nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even go to this store is a smart</v>

1569
01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:09.830
<v Speaker 1>move man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1570
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1571
01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:16.210
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of weed and it's way </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to get and it's way more relaxed </v>

1572
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's still sketchy federally and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone comes in after Obama,</v>

1573
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:26.470
<v Speaker 1>which is very likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a more repressive because this,</v>

1574
01:09:26.471 --> 01:09:28.610
<v Speaker 1>this Obama thing has been a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>

1575
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's done and what we thought he </v>

1576
01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 1>was going to do are so polar opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1577
01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:38.720
<v Speaker 1>they didn't stop the Dea from rating </v>
<v Speaker 1>these medical marijuana facilities.</v>

1578
01:09:38.721 --> 01:09:43.721
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of raids during his time </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go and look at how many </v>

1579
01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:45.740
<v Speaker 1>raids took place during Obama's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been quite substantial.</v>

1580
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:50.741
<v Speaker 1>The blowback from that has also been </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial and it's very damaging to </v>

1581
01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 1>his party because he's essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican in wolf clothing.</v>

1582
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 1>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the shit that I've done outside</v>

1583
01:09:55.671 --> 01:10:00.671
<v Speaker 1>of social things have been like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really similar to what the Bush </v>

1584
01:10:00.671 --> 01:10:04.781
<v Speaker 1>administration did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of really negative </v>

1585
01:10:04.781 --> 01:10:06.170
<v Speaker 1>shit that's happened with the dea </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking into these pots doors,</v>

1586
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.200
<v Speaker 1>putting fucking boots on kids' necks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken like there was one that they did </v>

1587
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:15.551
<v Speaker 1>where they got caught doing all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the film was sent remotely </v>

1588
01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:16.400
<v Speaker 1>to another location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like constantly.</v>

1589
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.740
<v Speaker 1>It was currently sent so no one can </v>
<v Speaker 1>steal the hard drives.</v>

1590
01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.660
<v Speaker 1>The security cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still recording,</v>

1591
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:24.890
<v Speaker 1>so the so seed got to see them put their</v>
<v Speaker 1>boots on this kids neck,</v>

1592
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:26.360
<v Speaker 1>throw him to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a kid.</v>

1593
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Just a young 20 year old kid working in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a place that's just pull all the money.</v>

1594
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Just people being thugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They steal the money.</v>

1595
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they know that these people aren't </v>

1596
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:38.900
<v Speaker 1>threats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you your break,</v>

1597
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:42.191
<v Speaker 1>you see 20 year old college kid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>working there and national security </v>

1598
01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:44.750
<v Speaker 1>threat investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who these people are,</v>

1599
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you know who you're arresting and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got your boot on his neck.</v>

1600
01:10:47.271 --> 01:10:48.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the people who are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>

1601
01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to find like more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1602
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:53.690
<v Speaker 1>healthy outlets for their anxiety or </v>
<v Speaker 1>their uncertainty.</v>

1603
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:59.050
<v Speaker 1>So the point is there's probably going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be someone could easily bribe a </v>

1604
01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:04.310
<v Speaker 1>politician to go hard on these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the new administration office.</v>

1605
01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:07.340
<v Speaker 1>If there was a big push by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical industry,</v>

1606
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:09.080
<v Speaker 1>it was a big push by the alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

1607
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.990
<v Speaker 1>big push by whatever prison guards </v>
<v Speaker 1>union,</v>

1608
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>whoever it needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The can grease the wheels</v>

1609
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:19.130
<v Speaker 5>to get them to be harder on marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could conceivably happen that the </v>

1610
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 5>genie's not totally out of the bottle </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet,</v>

1611
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:25.580
<v Speaker 5>but I think that the chances of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening are thankfully not that high </v>

1612
01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:28.740
<v Speaker 5>because the cat's out of the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The public knows that marijuana is not a</v>

1613
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 5>bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's a good thing.</v>

1614
01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 5>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a very hard thing to.</v>

1615
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:37.730
<v Speaker 5>How can you outdo that at this point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't matter how many reefer madness </v>

1616
01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:41.181
<v Speaker 5>as you put out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have come to the conclusion that </v>

1617
01:11:41.181 --> 01:11:41.181
<v Speaker 5>it's actually not bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see?</v>

1618
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:46.190
<v Speaker 5>And what about her?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was on Piers Morgan talking about </v>

1619
01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:49.971
<v Speaker 5>pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure she's against it and put it on </v>

1620
01:11:49.971 --> 01:11:49.971
<v Speaker 5>and coulter on Piers Morgan talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about pot,</v>

1621
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.430
<v Speaker 5>not just against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's so ridiculous.</v>

1622
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.160
<v Speaker 5>It's so hilarious because first of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's working,</v>

1623
01:11:56.161 --> 01:11:57.180
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about her.</v>

1624
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:02.420
<v Speaker 5>So obviously her trolling people like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that just want to stay in the media and </v>

1625
01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:03.270
<v Speaker 5>they don't realize the real harm they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing to the,</v>

1626
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.960
<v Speaker 5>the national discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with she,</v>

1627
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.910
<v Speaker 5>she got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she got you to mention her name just now</v>

1628
01:12:08.911 --> 01:12:11.240
<v Speaker 5>and now she's going to get booked on </v>
<v Speaker 5>another show because of this.</v>

1629
01:12:11.241 --> 01:12:14.040
<v Speaker 5>So will be on the today show and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

1630
01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:19.041
<v Speaker 5>So she can sell more books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's fucking over people who </v>

1631
01:12:19.041 --> 01:12:22.401
<v Speaker 5>actually rely on what they see on tv and</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's just fucking up the whole </v>

1632
01:12:22.401 --> 01:12:22.401
<v Speaker 5>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got it,</v>

1633
01:12:22.401 --> 01:12:23.820
<v Speaker 5>Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five seconds.</v>

1634
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

1635
01:12:25.081 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a terrible person.</v>

1636
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:32.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what she's doing is for her own benefit </v>

1637
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 5>and that the trolling when you have,</v>

1638
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:37.130
<v Speaker 8>why is it illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cannabis,</v>

1639
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.200
<v Speaker 8>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>alcohol,</v>

1640
01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.710
<v Speaker 8>I answer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're going to interrupt me and say,</v>

1641
01:12:40.711 --> 01:12:42.070
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not true.</v>

1642
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:43.140
<v Speaker 8>That.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Explain why.</v>

1643
01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.310
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I kept trying to.</v>

1644
01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 8>When you had been dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now I'm going to explain now.</v>

1645
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.400
<v Speaker 8>So don't interrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1646
01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.800
<v Speaker 8>look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the sole purpose for smoking pot or </v>

1647
01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.380
<v Speaker 8>eating a pot Brownie is to get high.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is not true with alcohol.</v>

1648
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.480
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pause it right there.</v>

1649
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 5>She's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1650
01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.500
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is crazy?</v>

1651
01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:04.730
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who gets he gets he drinks not to get </v>

1652
01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:04.730
<v Speaker 5>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:08.241
<v Speaker 5>I drink whiskey for the taste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagined he fucking sitting around </v>

1654
01:13:08.241 --> 01:13:12.801
<v Speaker 5>drinking whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like imagine if they came up with </v>

1655
01:13:12.801 --> 01:13:15.171
<v Speaker 5>alcohol free whiskey and they sold it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>those big arnold palmer lemonade cans </v>

1656
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 5>with alcohol free whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to do that with weed.</v>

1657
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to give you the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the benefits without the high,</v>

1658
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:25.710
<v Speaker 5>like extract that and put it in a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that would fuck people over.</v>

1659
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:26.320
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1660
01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:28.890
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're actually the scientific research</v>

1661
01:13:28.891 --> 01:13:33.891
<v Speaker 5>behind that is for extract cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's for pain is for micro under chronic</v>

1662
01:13:34.231 --> 01:13:36.230
<v Speaker 5>pain that they don't want to get high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but okay,</v>

1663
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.240
<v Speaker 5>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My thinking was that they're kind of </v>

1664
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:41.240
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1665
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:41.250
<v Speaker 5>you can use the medical benefits as long</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you don't get high from it.</v>

1666
01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 5>And I think that this is totally just my</v>
<v Speaker 5>own perspective.</v>

1667
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:50.031
<v Speaker 5>I really think that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>medicinal properties of marijuana is </v>

1668
01:13:50.031 --> 01:13:53.601
<v Speaker 5>that it allows you to see things </v>
<v Speaker 5>differently and I think there's much </v>

1669
01:13:53.601 --> 01:13:56.061
<v Speaker 5>more of a connection between the mental </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the physical than we're willing to </v>

1670
01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:59.091
<v Speaker 5>accept in our Western society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like most humans up until </v>

1671
01:13:59.091 --> 01:14:00.540
<v Speaker 5>about 100 years ago took most of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying for granted.</v>

1672
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:05.541
<v Speaker 5>Like you remember reading books like </v>
<v Speaker 5>novels of the 18 hundreds where </v>

1673
01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:07.020
<v Speaker 5>somebody's sick and their doctor says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go live somewhere,</v>

1674
01:14:07.021 --> 01:14:08.940
<v Speaker 5>like go live in the countryside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll feel better.</v>

1675
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.120
<v Speaker 5>And they would prescribe this shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually works because if you're less </v>

1676
01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:14.120
<v Speaker 5>stressed</v>

1677
01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:14.120
<v Speaker 6>out and you're in a better environment </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you get better,</v>

1678
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 6>your body knows what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1679
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:17.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've totally,</v>

1680
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we try to be so clinical with everything</v>

1681
01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 6>that we can't let somebody just get high</v>
<v Speaker 6>and fucked up for a few hours and figure</v>

1682
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 6>out their own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has to be very clinical,</v>

1683
01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:27.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't actually feel something that's</v>

1684
01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.840
<v Speaker 6>altered state of consciousness,</v>

1685
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 3>although I agree with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the scientific principle or the </v>

1686
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:36.390
<v Speaker 3>scientific reasoning behind extracting </v>
<v Speaker 3>CBDS,</v>

1687
01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:41.580
<v Speaker 3>it just so that people who have injuries</v>
<v Speaker 3>can have pain medication that's natural </v>

1688
01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:41.660
<v Speaker 3>and have it while they're at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1689
01:14:41.661 --> 01:14:43.130
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get hooked up or.</v>

1690
01:14:43.131 --> 01:14:48.131
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of something else then I </v>

1691
01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:48.131
<v Speaker 3>gotta use the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1692
01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:51.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1693
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.220
<v Speaker 3>with what you're saying because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right in a lot of ways as well.</v>

1694
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.320
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1695
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:56.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of reasons why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>extract cbd from cannabis and they're </v>

1696
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.900
<v Speaker 3>not all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not all,</v>

1697
01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1698
01:14:57.761 --> 01:15:02.761
<v Speaker 3>the man wants to keep you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So play this fucking wacky bitch player </v>

1699
01:15:02.761 --> 01:15:02.761
<v Speaker 3>some more</v>

1700
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.180
<v Speaker 8>or a 14 year old going to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everybody drinks alcohol to get slightly</v>

1701
01:15:08.181 --> 01:15:10.850
<v Speaker 8>higher than when they start drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Julie Pierce Morgan.</v>

1702
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:14.630
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I am done TV after drinks.</v>

1703
01:15:14.631 --> 01:15:19.160
<v Speaker 8>I bet you you have to you right now that</v>
<v Speaker 8>will explain a lot of things.</v>

1704
01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.600
<v Speaker 8>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Would you please let me finish one?</v>

1705
01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:26.570
<v Speaker 8>Tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Piers Morgan will take your rainbow.</v>

1706
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:28.880
<v Speaker 8>Enjoy wine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They drink wine for a purpose.</v>

1707
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:31.100
<v Speaker 8>Over $800.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bottles of wine.</v>

1708
01:15:31.101 --> 01:15:33.080
<v Speaker 8>Perhaps you have a warm feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It does not.</v>

1709
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.350
<v Speaker 8>You can tell if somebody's been smoking </v>
<v Speaker 8>pot.</v>

1710
01:15:36.351 --> 01:15:41.351
<v Speaker 8>They're eyes are red.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They giggle at everything and by the </v>

1711
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:43.330
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're incapable of carrying on the </v>

1712
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:43.330
<v Speaker 8>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever smoked pot?</v>

1713
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:43.330
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I haven't.</v>

1714
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:43.330
<v Speaker 8>Never know.</v>

1715
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pause.</v>

1716
01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:49.490
<v Speaker 3>How ridiculous that they're incapable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>carrying on the normal functions of </v>

1717
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:50.250
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do Jujitsu.</v>

1718
01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do comedy while I'm high.</v>

1719
01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:54.180
<v Speaker 3>I do in this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

1720
01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I do almost every radio show ever do </v>
<v Speaker 3>high that the normal functions of life,</v>

1721
01:15:59.131 --> 01:16:01.590
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go to the movies high all the time.</v>

1722
01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Go to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hot all the time.</v>

1723
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Like what is she?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is she basing it off as?</v>

1724
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Does she have one ex boyfriend that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pothead that she's basing opiodes about?</v>

1725
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Stop and think about that because she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dating.</v>

1726
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:17.820
<v Speaker 3>If that is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's dating a guy who's willing to </v>

1727
01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:21.051
<v Speaker 3>tolerate her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just imagine what kind of a fucking </v>

1728
01:16:21.051 --> 01:16:21.450
<v Speaker 3>idiot he's going to be an o.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't.</v>

1729
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.090
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't function well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

1730
01:16:24.091 --> 01:16:26.550
<v Speaker 3>he pro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was probably paralytic.</v>

1731
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Just being around your fucking shitbag </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

1732
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm imagine that.</v>

1733
01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your girlfriend.</v>

1734
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't.</v>

1735
01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't function in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that.</v>

1736
01:16:34.561 --> 01:16:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Or if it's her friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she says,</v>

1737
01:16:36.001 --> 01:16:38.550
<v Speaker 3>she knows a lot of potheads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has potheads have friends,</v>

1738
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:43.500
<v Speaker 3>you know what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that by just trolling like that?</v>

1739
01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.210
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might've been okay.</v>

1740
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.240
<v Speaker 3>That controlling that she did when she </v>
<v Speaker 3>started doing it because when she </v>

1741
01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.400
<v Speaker 3>started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was trying to get an alert coming up</v>

1742
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.840
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some lawyers on that thing.</v>

1743
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.970
<v Speaker 3>When she started trolling like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was probably pre-internet,</v>

1744
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:05.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she was probably doing that shit </v>

1745
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.030
<v Speaker 3>way before.</v>

1746
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.350
<v Speaker 6>The only way for her to get attention </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the platform,</v>

1747
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:10.500
<v Speaker 6>but now that she has a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she should use it for good instead of </v>

1748
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:10.500
<v Speaker 6>glee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll stop this information.</v>

1749
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:14.480
<v Speaker 5>Sub being a silly bitch like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a nuanced point of view.</v>

1750
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.650
<v Speaker 5>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1751
01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.800
<v Speaker 5>what can it not just be a right wing </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking chatterbox.</v>

1752
01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:23.820
<v Speaker 5>So like people like that who claimed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be limited government and conservative </v>

1753
01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:23.850
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1754
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.900
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me like they pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 5>just want lower taxes because if you </v>

1755
01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.680
<v Speaker 5>really believed in limited government,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck can the government tell you</v>

1756
01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:35.860
<v Speaker 5>that you can't put something that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all safe in your own body and </v>

1757
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.090
<v Speaker 5>the comfort and safety of your own </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking home when you're an American </v>

1758
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:39.090
<v Speaker 5>citizen and supposedly live in a free </v>
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>

1759
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 5>you should be able to do that in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1760
01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.590
<v Speaker 5>Do I think it should be taxed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>regulated?</v>

1761
01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep it safe.</v>

1762
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:48.790
<v Speaker 5>Keep it on the books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why shouldn't you be allowed to do </v>

1763
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:51.521
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure she doesn't have a real </v>

1764
01:17:51.521 --> 01:17:51.521
<v Speaker 5>argument against that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's only ad Hominem.</v>

1765
01:17:51.521 --> 01:17:52.580
<v Speaker 5>It's well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're lazy and you're like,</v>

1766
01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:53.420
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about the Beatles?</v>

1767
01:17:53.421 --> 01:17:55.040
<v Speaker 5>Were they lazy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about Steve Jobs?</v>

1768
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 5>Is he lazy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1769
01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:58.490
<v Speaker 5>like you're just isolating one anecdotal</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking thing.</v>

1770
01:17:58.580 --> 01:17:59.450
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's not.</v>

1771
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 5>I can make an argument against alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 5>based on some guy outside.</v>

1772
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:08.201
<v Speaker 5>He was drunk in front of a liquor store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean you shouldn't go out </v>

1773
01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:08.201
<v Speaker 5>drinking with your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

1774
01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:12.911
<v Speaker 5>look what she's using as an example </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's talking about while you were in </v>

1775
01:18:12.911 --> 01:18:12.911
<v Speaker 5>the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was talking about,</v>

1776
01:18:12.911 --> 01:18:13.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1777
01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.860
<v Speaker 5>you could drink it and have a warm </v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling like,</v>

1778
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.370
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're.</v>

1779
01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.680
<v Speaker 5>So what you're saying is you can't smoke</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a little bit of pot and just relax </v>

1780
01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 5>a little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can have a very mild pot candy.</v>

1781
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.380
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pot candy that speed weed has.</v>

1782
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:30.440
<v Speaker 5>It's God damn perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His God damn perfect.</v>

1783
01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 5>You can have one and it's just a mild </v>
<v Speaker 5>edge.</v>

1784
01:18:33.861 --> 01:18:35.820
<v Speaker 5>Really reduce search.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smile.</v>

1785
01:18:35.821 --> 01:18:37.940
<v Speaker 5>So mild,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really like to play pool.</v>

1786
01:18:37.941 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 5>I like to take to heart candy one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:44.510
<v Speaker 5>But one one is great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you don't feel perplexed.</v>

1788
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 5>You don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what were we talking about?</v>

1789
01:18:46.281 --> 01:18:48.980
<v Speaker 5>You don't get any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a dosage issue.</v>

1790
01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that alcohol is more,</v>

1791
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:58.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could easily under dosed with </v>

1792
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.590
<v Speaker 5>alcohol and just have a warm feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't do that with marijuana.</v>

1793
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:05.770
<v Speaker 5>That's so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so dumb and it's so ignorant to </v>

1794
01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:09.941
<v Speaker 5>human physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so ignorant to all the different </v>

1795
01:19:09.941 --> 01:19:12.470
<v Speaker 5>things that we use on a daily basis </v>
<v Speaker 5>where if you overuse them,</v>

1796
01:19:12.471 --> 01:19:14.390
<v Speaker 5>they would fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1797
01:19:14.391 --> 01:19:19.391
<v Speaker 5>there's a huge amount of medications </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people take on a daily basis where </v>

1798
01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:22.370
<v Speaker 5>if they took 20 times more than they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were supposed to take their dead,</v>

1799
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>salt,</v>

1800
01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.240
<v Speaker 5>10 ounces of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a dead person.</v>

1801
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:29.000
<v Speaker 5>She's in sleeping pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

1802
01:19:29.001 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 5>Tylenol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pms,</v>

1803
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:32.390
<v Speaker 5>and tylenol is apparently really bad for</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1804
01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 5>If you drank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should not take tylenol.</v>

1805
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.080
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know this until a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

1806
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:41.410
<v Speaker 5>If you drink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should not take tylenol as your </v>

1807
01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:41.410
<v Speaker 5>hangover cure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should take some advil.</v>

1808
01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:43.070
<v Speaker 5>Acetaminophen is really tough on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>liver.</v>

1809
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.020
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That stuff's not good for you.</v>

1810
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:47.870
<v Speaker 5>I know a guy who takes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he takes,</v>

1811
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.590
<v Speaker 5>this is a crazy cocktail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he takes adderall.</v>

1812
01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:56.860
<v Speaker 5>He takes Xanax and he takes ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does have been prescribed?</v>

1813
01:19:56.901 --> 01:19:59.690
<v Speaker 5>What is that about exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that about?</v>

1814
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.720
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to speed myself up so I can </v>

1815
01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:04.720
<v Speaker 5>slow myself down so I can relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Speeds himself up.</v>

1816
01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.470
<v Speaker 5>Then apparently you get a little freaked</v>
<v Speaker 5>out from that.</v>

1817
01:20:06.471 --> 01:20:09.120
<v Speaker 5>So he needs something to relax and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where the xanax comes in.</v>

1818
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 5>But then he can't go to bed at night.</v>

1819
01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:12.690
<v Speaker 5>So he needs the ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I totally POW,</v>

1820
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:17.691
<v Speaker 5>POW.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I totally do that with coffee and </v>

1821
01:20:17.691 --> 01:20:19.551
<v Speaker 5>alcohol though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because what happens is you have like a </v>

1822
01:20:19.551 --> 01:20:21.561
<v Speaker 5>meeting at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>PM so you get all caffeinated and then </v>

1823
01:20:21.561 --> 01:20:21.561
<v Speaker 5>it's 6:45</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're in your apartment.</v>

<v Speaker 5>amped from the caffeine.</v>

1827
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:30.740
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to have a buddy that had a crack </v>

1828
01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:30.900
<v Speaker 5>habit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to go with them,</v>

1829
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:32.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1830
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:35.430
<v Speaker 5>go to the liquor store when he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and he wanted to calm down,</v>

1831
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:40.610
<v Speaker 5>he would go to the liquor store and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>would buy a 40 ounce just to like bring </v>

1832
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.610
<v Speaker 5>his heart rate down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1833
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.860
<v Speaker 5>And he would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1834
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.820
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a healthy living right there.</v>

1835
01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's dead.</v>

1836
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry about that.</v>

1837
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he died.</v>

1838
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:51.500
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is why I'm not a comedian by the </v>

1839
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:51.500
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1840
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:51.500
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>

1841
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.630
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't get upset at you for seeing </v>
<v Speaker 5>the healthy living.</v>

1842
01:20:52.631 --> 01:20:55.010
<v Speaker 5>It's obviously not healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a lot of,</v>

1843
01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.500
<v Speaker 5>a lot of drug problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he wound up dying because of it.</v>

1844
01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:03.890
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just seeing him trying to calm down </v>

1845
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:05.220
<v Speaker 5>by drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pounding this 40 ounce of beer,</v>

1846
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.670
<v Speaker 5>just try to get the alcohol into his </v>
<v Speaker 5>bloodstream to just alleviate the,</v>

1847
01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:12.210
<v Speaker 5>the crazy heartbeat that he had going </v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1848
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:14.880
<v Speaker 5>That's where the dea and stuff like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>is fucking up also,</v>

1849
01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:20.210
<v Speaker 5>is if they've betrayed the trust of </v>
<v Speaker 5>young people by lying to them about </v>

1850
01:21:20.210 --> 01:21:20.220
<v Speaker 5>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So as a result,</v>

1851
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.750
<v Speaker 5>there are probably people out there who </v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

1852
01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe not that bad.</v>

1853
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:28.250
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe crack cocaine is not that bad </v>

1854
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.591
<v Speaker 5>because they completely lied to a some </v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana and I remember as a kid in </v>

1855
01:21:30.591 --> 01:21:34.461
<v Speaker 5>middle school they had a cop come to our</v>
<v Speaker 5>classroom and give us the whole day or </v>

1856
01:21:34.461 --> 01:21:38.230
<v Speaker 5>breakdown and he had a suitcase filled </v>
<v Speaker 5>with like fake versions of drugs and </v>

1857
01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:38.230
<v Speaker 5>what they look like.</v>

1858
01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:40.470
<v Speaker 5>And I was thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even as a kid I was like,</v>

1859
01:21:40.471 --> 01:21:43.380
<v Speaker 5>how ridiculous is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm an expert on all these drugs.</v>

1860
01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:46.170
<v Speaker 5>Look like before I didn't know shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>about half these things down,</v>

1861
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:50.190
<v Speaker 5>like practically a drug dealer based on </v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucking infomercial.</v>

1862
01:21:50.191 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 5>Like here's all the stuff that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>should never look for,</v>

1863
01:21:52.201 --> 01:21:54.540
<v Speaker 5>don't look for this one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It comes in this kind of bag,</v>

1864
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:55.500
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

1865
01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:57.630
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some kind of weird propaganda.</v>

1866
01:21:57.690 --> 01:22:02.690
<v Speaker 5>There's education and knowing what not </v>
<v Speaker 5>to take as long as you're honest about </v>

1867
01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:02.690
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Now this one is actually just the dried </v>
<v Speaker 5>plant.</v>

1869
01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:06.330
<v Speaker 5>It grows all over the contiguous United </v>
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>

1870
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.670
<v Speaker 5>It's been used for thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>

1871
01:22:08.671 --> 01:22:10.800
<v Speaker 5>You just said contiguous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never used that word ever.</v>

1872
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:12.580
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever used contiguous?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1873
01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.290
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a good word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1875
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.190
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1876
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:20.100
<v Speaker 5>I read a lot of Shit on my kindle and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then certain words just get into my mind</v>

1877
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.990
<v Speaker 5>is a good one and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to use this next time.</v>

1878
01:22:21.991 --> 01:22:26.730
<v Speaker 5>I feel like using it rocket contiguous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hope you use it correctly anyway.</v>

1879
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.980
<v Speaker 5>So it's already being fact checked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

1880
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:29.970
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're absolutely right.</v>

1881
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 5>It's that if they said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they're honest about the look,</v>

1882
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.220
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't do this one because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to lower your motivation.</v>

1883
01:22:35.221 --> 01:22:40.221
<v Speaker 5>At least stay away from it until you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>into college or until you get a job or </v>

1884
01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:43.431
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is that you need to get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should avoid if you want to be as </v>

1885
01:22:43.431 --> 01:22:43.980
<v Speaker 5>motivated as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they said that,</v>

1886
01:22:43.981 --> 01:22:44.610
<v Speaker 5>then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1887
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:47.370
<v Speaker 5>then I'll listen to you when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>stay away from the crack cocaine because</v>

1888
01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:49.260
<v Speaker 5>it will fuck up your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which it will,</v>

1889
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.590
<v Speaker 5>but you don't trust that person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no trust what they say.</v>

1890
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:57.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it also fucks up the relationship that </v>

1891
01:22:57.650 --> 01:22:58.050
<v Speaker 5>people have to law enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It fucks up the relationship that people</v>

1892
01:22:58.051 --> 01:23:03.051
<v Speaker 5>have to people in positions of authority</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you legitimately need to protect </v>

1893
01:23:03.051 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 5>you in a civilized society and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the cops should</v>

1894
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:11.130
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being a cop should be an honorable </v>

1895
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:11.130
<v Speaker 3>position that's very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>acquire.</v>

1896
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:15.390
<v Speaker 3>It should be something that we really </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect and we love and appreciate the </v>

1897
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:16.840
<v Speaker 3>people that are around us that are there</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help us.</v>

1898
01:23:16.841 --> 01:23:19.510
<v Speaker 3>If some shit goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if some bad people around,</v>

1899
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:21.610
<v Speaker 3>if some people are victimizing other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1900
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:25.030
<v Speaker 3>some people are breaking the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That should be a part of our society,</v>

1901
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:30.180
<v Speaker 3>but when they become a dea person and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're shooting someone's fucking dog,</v>

1902
01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 3>cause they got a plant growing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1903
01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:37.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many of those God damn videos</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to see for you realize there's </v>

1904
01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:40.201
<v Speaker 3>a problem with the fact these cops think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could just break into someone's </v>

1905
01:23:40.201 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 3>house and shoot the fucking dog for </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1906
01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:43.000
<v Speaker 3>They shoot shoot dogs that are behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog gates barking,</v>

1907
01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:44.800
<v Speaker 3>little tiny dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just shoot them.</v>

1908
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:47.380
<v Speaker 3>They shoot them because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>intimidate the fuck out of the people.</v>

1909
01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:48.550
<v Speaker 3>They want to let them know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1910
01:23:48.551 --> 01:23:53.551
<v Speaker 3>I just shut your fucking dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to start crying and I'm </v>

1911
01:23:53.551 --> 01:23:53.551
<v Speaker 3>going to get what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's part of the power trip.</v>

1912
01:23:53.551 --> 01:23:58.471
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the thing and it's part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes people distrust cops and </v>

1913
01:23:58.471 --> 01:24:03.091
<v Speaker 3>that's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If cops didn't have to deal with these </v>

1914
01:24:03.091 --> 01:24:03.160
<v Speaker 3>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there wasn't laws that were unjust on</v>

1915
01:24:03.161 --> 01:24:08.161
<v Speaker 3>the books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then this sort of behavior would never </v>

1916
01:24:08.161 --> 01:24:08.230
<v Speaker 3>take place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you couldn't do that to someone,</v>

1917
01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.710
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't break down someone's door </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and fucking shoot their dog.</v>

1918
01:24:11.711 --> 01:24:15.460
<v Speaker 3>If you could only go and arrest people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are committing crimes,</v>

1919
01:24:15.461 --> 01:24:18.100
<v Speaker 3>our whole attitude crimes have </v>
<v Speaker 3>victimized people.</v>

1920
01:24:18.190 --> 01:24:21.430
<v Speaker 3>Our whole attitude about law enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 3>would change.</v>

1921
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:23.650
<v Speaker 3>It would make it better for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1922
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 3>It would make it better for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will become like firefighters.</v>

1923
01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:31.441
<v Speaker 3>It would become an integral part of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>society that's absolutely necessary </v>

1924
01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:32.290
<v Speaker 3>except for the people that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>committing the crime,</v>

1925
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:35.650
<v Speaker 3>which we don't want in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has to be real crime.</v>

1926
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:40.830
<v Speaker 3>It has to be crime and creates victims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>victimless crimes or horse shit crimes </v>

1927
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:42.310
<v Speaker 3>against yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their bullshit.</v>

1928
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.100
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop a person from cutting off</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own fucking finger.</v>

1929
01:24:45.101 --> 01:24:50.101
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you decided to go get a bolt cutter </v>

1930
01:24:50.101 --> 01:24:52.711
<v Speaker 3>from fucking Home Depot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it home and hack off one of your </v>

1931
01:24:52.711 --> 01:24:53.020
<v Speaker 3>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one can fucking stop you.</v>

1932
01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:54.790
<v Speaker 3>You go to the hospital and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

1933
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 3>I cut my finger off of the bolt cutter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to arrest you.</v>

1934
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:58.300
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why'd you do that?</v>

1935
01:24:58.301 --> 01:24:59.830
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hate that finger there.</v>

1936
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1937
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:01.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do that again.</v>

1938
01:25:01.991 --> 01:25:03.340
<v Speaker 3>You idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to die.</v>

1939
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:08.370
<v Speaker 3>You know you've got an infection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take these antibiotics and get out of </v>

1940
01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:11.131
<v Speaker 3>the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how come you can cut off your </v>

1941
01:25:11.131 --> 01:25:13.351
<v Speaker 3>fucking finger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you see a guy who likes to smoke </v>

1942
01:25:13.351 --> 01:25:13.351
<v Speaker 3>pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can arrest him.</v>

1943
01:25:13.351 --> 01:25:14.800
<v Speaker 3>You could arrest him for what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's he doing?</v>

1944
01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:17.110
<v Speaker 3>He's doing something to his body that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't agree.</v>

1945
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's no victims.</v>

1946
01:25:19.211 --> 01:25:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Here we're is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a victim.</v>

1947
01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.280
<v Speaker 3>Is the smoke going into the air and </v>
<v Speaker 3>polluting our modern discourse?</v>

1948
01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it fucking taking paint off cars down</v>

1949
01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:28.000
<v Speaker 3>the block?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1950
01:25:28.001 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 3>it's not doing a goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no staff.</v>

1951
01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:33.280
<v Speaker 3>There's no crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no crime and dance where we have</v>

1952
01:25:33.281 --> 01:25:35.770
<v Speaker 3>to make a distinction and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1953
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:40.771
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why that distinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>is very difficult to make is because </v>

1954
01:25:40.771 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 3>there's people that have made these laws</v>
<v Speaker 3>and enforcing these laws.</v>

1955
01:25:41.921 --> 01:25:46.921
<v Speaker 3>A business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a business not just in keeping </v>

1956
01:25:46.921 --> 01:25:50.911
<v Speaker 3>prison guards in in work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but keeping prisons filled and keeping,</v>

1957
01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:56.220
<v Speaker 3>making sure that prisons generate income</v>
<v Speaker 3>from bringing prisoners so they make </v>

1958
01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:00.781
<v Speaker 3>sure that laws are in place that </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely ensure that they're going to </v>

1959
01:26:00.781 --> 01:26:05.161
<v Speaker 3>have new people in there every year </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people are going to keep </v>

1960
01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:05.960
<v Speaker 3>breaking these laws because the laws </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are ridiculous,</v>

1961
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:11.050
<v Speaker 3>the laws that have been in place since </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of the time and those </v>

1962
01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:11.050
<v Speaker 3>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they they,</v>

1963
01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:14.710
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're about 30 percent of the people </v>

1964
01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:14.710
<v Speaker 3>that are in prison.</v>

1965
01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:14.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so fucked up about it.</v>

1966
01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:20.090
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that these laws,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these anti psychedelic and anti </v>

1967
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:23.481
<v Speaker 6>marijuana laws are actually like a form </v>
<v Speaker 6>of societies immune system?</v>

1968
01:26:23.701 --> 01:26:28.701
<v Speaker 6>Kind of going overboard?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I think about how some of the most </v>

1969
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:32.931
<v Speaker 6>brilliant people seem to have some kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of interaction with drugs at some point </v>

1970
01:26:32.931 --> 01:26:35.871
<v Speaker 6>in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it be steve jobs with the acid </v>

1971
01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:38.841
<v Speaker 6>trips or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty much any musician with weed or </v>

1972
01:26:38.841 --> 01:26:39.670
<v Speaker 6>any writer with weed at median,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

1973
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.070
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any comedian,</v>

1974
01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 6>it unlocks a lot of potential that </v>
<v Speaker 6>otherwise wouldn't be there for people </v>

1975
01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:47.490
<v Speaker 6>and it shows you the world in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>different way.</v>

1976
01:26:47.491 --> 01:26:50.520
<v Speaker 6>Especially if you do something that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>even stronger like a psychedelic.</v>

1977
01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:56.330
<v Speaker 6>It's showing you something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like root access to a </v>

1978
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.330
<v Speaker 6>computer where it gives you a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>

1979
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:57.630
<v Speaker 6>But for most people you don't want root </v>
<v Speaker 6>access.</v>

1980
01:26:57.631 --> 01:26:59.110
<v Speaker 6>You just want them to have their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1981
01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.680
<v Speaker 6>their web browser and that's it and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't want them fucking stuff up.</v>

1982
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if society as a whole is to </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of unconscious thing that goes on </v>

1983
01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:07.590
<v Speaker 6>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is really powerful stuff,</v>

1984
01:27:07.591 --> 01:27:09.480
<v Speaker 6>so we'll allow some people to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>access to it,</v>

1985
01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.640
<v Speaker 6>but we can't just let the whole society </v>
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>

1986
01:27:11.641 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 6>Timothy Leary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1987
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.380
<v Speaker 6>tune in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tune out,</v>

1988
01:27:13.381 --> 01:27:18.381
<v Speaker 6>whatever his thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because what will have as a result is </v>

1989
01:27:18.381 --> 01:27:22.400
<v Speaker 6>completely uncharted waters that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>haven't been to before and there are </v>

1990
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:22.710
<v Speaker 6>people really afraid of that happening.</v>

1991
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:27.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you have to look where these </v>

1992
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:29.400
<v Speaker 3>laws coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the laws coming from really educated</v>

1993
01:27:29.401 --> 01:27:33.050
<v Speaker 3>philosophers and scholars?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not so much the exempt.</v>

1994
01:27:33.090 --> 01:27:33.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1995
01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:36.930
<v Speaker 3>These laws are coming from people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing a lot of fearmongering.</v>

1996
01:27:36.931 --> 01:27:40.140
<v Speaker 3>You remember all the shit that Ronald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan was saying back in the day.</v>

1997
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that marijuana may be one </v>

1998
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:48.171
<v Speaker 3>of the most damaging drugs known to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most dangerous job.</v>

1999
01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2000
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:50.970
<v Speaker 3>it's that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people,</v>

2001
01:27:50.971 --> 01:27:55.971
<v Speaker 3>these people like this and coulter Twat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's finish listening to this because </v>

2002
01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:56.250
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Play it more.</v>

2003
01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.790
<v Speaker 8>How do you know what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 8>My best friend,</v>

2004
01:28:01.791 --> 01:28:02.350
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she's not.</v>

2005
01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.010
<v Speaker 8>I doubt that a lot of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2006
01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:09.040
<v Speaker 8>maybe bill Maher is going to still get </v>
<v Speaker 8>their pod.</v>

2007
01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:14.041
<v Speaker 8>They're probably self medicating,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the more people will take it and if </v>

2008
01:28:14.041 --> 01:28:14.060
<v Speaker 8>it is made legal vastly more people will</v>
<v Speaker 8>take it.</v>

2009
01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:17.470
<v Speaker 8>Disaster for commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Commerce.</v>

2010
01:28:17.530 --> 01:28:22.530
<v Speaker 8>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Contents are incapable of following </v>

2011
01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:22.530
<v Speaker 8>simple instructions and getting the job </v>
<v Speaker 8>done.</v>

2012
01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:27.480
<v Speaker 6>Piers Morgan's body language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like this fucking person that I </v>

2013
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.610
<v Speaker 6>have to interview a drag on the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's awful too.</v>

2014
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:30.310
<v Speaker 8>I was just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Great.</v>

2015
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.230
<v Speaker 8>What do you mean by pop?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Was um,</v>

2016
01:28:33.231 --> 01:28:38.231
<v Speaker 8>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm moved to a new place in California </v>

2017
01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:38.231
<v Speaker 8>and there was a cool pool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't,</v>

2018
01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:42.810
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd come back and it's four feet down </v>

2019
01:28:42.810 --> 01:28:43.070
<v Speaker 8>and it's called covered with green mold </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I called him up.</v>

2020
01:28:43.071 --> 01:28:44.230
<v Speaker 8>He was a pothead.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2021
01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:44.570
<v Speaker 8>I was there.</v>

2022
01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:48.330
<v Speaker 3>You know how silly that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about anecdotal evidence.</v>

2023
01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:52.530
<v Speaker 3>She met a pool guy who was a pothead who</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't clean our pool.</v>

2024
01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:55.880
<v Speaker 3>So therefore what a selfish con People </v>
<v Speaker 3>Centered Company,</v>

2025
01:28:56.220 --> 01:29:01.220
<v Speaker 3>$800 bottle of wine just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>$800 bottles of wine and then she talks </v>

2026
01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 3>about how her pool couldn't do</v>

2027
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.570
<v Speaker 1>his job because he was high on pot.</v>

2028
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:09.750
<v Speaker 8>Let me try.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let me try and stop the stream of </v>

2029
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.750
<v Speaker 8>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2030
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.910
<v Speaker 8>Anything done with a pothead.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What we need to do.</v>

2031
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:15.050
<v Speaker 8>Everyone knows what a pod had.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't mean it's not smoking pot one</v>

2032
01:29:15.051 --> 01:29:20.051
<v Speaker 8>time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How much are you assuming a pothead </v>

2033
01:29:20.051 --> 01:29:22.871
<v Speaker 8>takes enough so that it can be made fun </v>
<v Speaker 8>of on TV promoting a narrative.</v>

2034
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:26.360
<v Speaker 8>It's heavy drinker,</v>
<v Speaker 8>heavy smoker,</v>

2035
01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.480
<v Speaker 8>no heavy smokers work all night and then</v>
<v Speaker 8>die young,</v>

2036
01:29:29.481 --> 01:29:34.481
<v Speaker 8>saving the social security system money </v>
<v Speaker 8>and we for a commerce commercial </v>

2037
01:29:34.481 --> 01:29:39.371
<v Speaker 8>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for the purposes of the good of the </v>

2038
01:29:39.371 --> 01:29:39.371
<v Speaker 8>country,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we ought to encourage Americans to smoke</v>

2039
01:29:39.371 --> 01:29:40.040
<v Speaker 8>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They'd be incredibly productive.</v>

2040
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing laser John.</v>

2041
01:29:41.410 --> 01:29:44.480
<v Speaker 1>He's encouraging lung cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing right now is a human who's</v>

2042
01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:47.250
<v Speaker 1>screaming for a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention.</v>

2043
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:52.790
<v Speaker 1>If we could get ann coulter into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle retreat in Peru and force feed </v>

2044
01:29:54.061 --> 01:29:59.061
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca with one of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they use for fog wall when they stuffed </v>

2045
01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 1>goose filled with grain to make their </v>
<v Speaker 1>liver fat and delicious.</v>

2046
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:04.410
<v Speaker 1>If we could do that with her with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca,</v>

2047
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.470
<v Speaker 1>just pinched her nose and our mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinot.</v>

2048
01:30:07.471 --> 01:30:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Just pin it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold onto it,</v>

2049
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.100
<v Speaker 1>force it down.</v>

2050
01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:11.960
<v Speaker 8>Walmart.</v>

2051
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Hold it in there and make sure your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbs it.</v>

2052
01:30:14.161 --> 01:30:16.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw up and then let this bitch go on a</v>

2053
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:19.650
<v Speaker 1>wild ride on the feathered snake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>

2054
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:21.900
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't eat dick too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She needs Dick too,</v>

2055
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2056
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what she needs.</v>

2057
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 1>She needs Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually wants to fuck her.</v>

2058
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:27.300
<v Speaker 1>She probably can get some Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably a mess.</v>

2059
01:30:27.301 --> 01:30:30.570
<v Speaker 1>They're both drunk and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was breast mouse,</v>

2060
01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:34.620
<v Speaker 1>some weird Fox News producer just on top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her wedding.</v>

2061
01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Stinky feet was fucking slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socks on.</v>

2062
01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.390
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2063
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's gross.</v>

2064
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:44.370
<v Speaker 1>She's a gross human being and not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>gross like with,</v>

2065
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

2066
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:47.970
<v Speaker 1>she's not an ugly woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not my favorite,</v>

2067
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:50.610
<v Speaker 1>but her personality is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2068
01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:55.611
<v Speaker 1>It's just so insensitive and aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ego maniacal like what what she's </v>

2069
01:30:55.611 --> 01:30:59.090
<v Speaker 1>saying is so preposterous and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously so.</v>

2070
01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Obviously trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what she's doing.</v>

2071
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucking done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the master troll the day.</v>

2072
01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.570
<v Speaker 1>See the new Godzilla trailer out today a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more.</v>

2073
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:13.590
<v Speaker 1>This case was more things to yell and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll play that because that's so </v>

2074
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.590
<v Speaker 1>much more awesome.</v>

2075
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:16.370
<v Speaker 8>It's not heavy drinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When the cat is out of the bed,</v>

2076
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:17.910
<v Speaker 8>you can put it back in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was the problem,</v>

2077
01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:20.070
<v Speaker 8>but here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the issue is again,</v>

2078
01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:21.850
<v Speaker 8>to pick up where I was in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 8>my sentence,</v>

2079
01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:24.440
<v Speaker 8>but during prohibition,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that isn't a big deal.</v>

2080
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:27.820
<v Speaker 8>Why do we treat it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Alcohol related disease,</v>

2081
01:31:27.821 --> 01:31:31.210
<v Speaker 8>cirrhosis of the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 8>accidents as a result of alcohol.</v>

2082
01:31:31.211 --> 01:31:33.910
<v Speaker 8>One down precipitously.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It will go up.</v>

2083
01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.310
<v Speaker 8>We will have luck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is how many fans we have.</v>

2084
01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:41.570
<v Speaker 8>One that's just about enough that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 8>has ever overdosed on cannabis.</v>

2085
01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.640
<v Speaker 8>Did you know that they can perform daily</v>
<v Speaker 8>functions.</v>

2086
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:48.440
<v Speaker 8>They're going to be on my tax bill.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You the people.</v>

2087
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.820
<v Speaker 8>Can you accept that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>People can overdose on too much.</v>

2088
01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:53.590
<v Speaker 8>Everybody dies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Eventually</v>

2089
01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you just contradicted yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat dummy and do you encourage cigarette</v>

2090
01:31:58.451 --> 01:32:00.270
<v Speaker 1>smoking on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

2091
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:03.360
<v Speaker 3>she's doing right there is just being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>silly person,</v>

2092
01:32:03.570 --> 01:32:06.330
<v Speaker 3>which she's doing right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a purposely trolling,</v>

2093
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:09.720
<v Speaker 3>which he's doing right there is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get attention and holding onto</v>

2094
01:32:09.721 --> 01:32:12.600
<v Speaker 3>an argument that doesn't have any basis </v>
<v Speaker 3>in logical thinking.</v>

2095
01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Her argument is just about her trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get her point over.</v>

2096
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:19.110
<v Speaker 3>She's just a shitty example of a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's allowed to talk.</v>

2097
01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.930
<v Speaker 3>So that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you shouldn't be.</v>

2098
01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:27.440
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be given that sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform if that's the kind of thing </v>

2099
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:27.810
<v Speaker 3>that you do because it's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not a thinker.</v>

2100
01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:33.140
<v Speaker 3>What she's doing is she has an ideology </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she pushes that ideology at the </v>

2101
01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:34.590
<v Speaker 3>expense of all the contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>

2102
01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what she's.</v>

2103
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:41.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's talking about fucking alcohol </v>

2104
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.110
<v Speaker 3>being okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes being okay,</v>

2105
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:44.841
<v Speaker 3>marijuana being back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be on my tax bill is </v>

2106
01:32:44.841 --> 01:32:44.841
<v Speaker 3>her concern.</v>

2107
01:32:44.841 --> 01:32:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Well guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hooker,</v>

2108
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not on your tax bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

2109
01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I smoked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dumb thing to say,</v>

2110
01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:53.160
<v Speaker 3>it's just the fucking Nancy grace thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all lazy.</v>

2111
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Particular look at you fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are you.</v>

2112
01:32:57.301 --> 01:33:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Are you a fucking maniac?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mountain climber is that you running 100</v>

2113
01:33:01.831 --> 01:33:04.050
<v Speaker 3>miles every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking lazy.</v>

2114
01:33:04.051 --> 01:33:05.280
<v Speaker 3>You're lazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're lazy.</v>

2115
01:33:05.281 --> 01:33:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Fat Face Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2116
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Patil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lazy dummies out there talking shit </v>

2117
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:15.801
<v Speaker 3>about pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not pot and you know Ken pot make </v>

2118
01:33:15.801 --> 01:33:15.960
<v Speaker 3>you lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2119
01:33:15.961 --> 01:33:20.490
<v Speaker 3>it can relax you and if there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a tendency to want to not do</v>

2120
01:33:20.491 --> 01:33:22.140
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pot will definitely accept you.</v>

2121
01:33:22.290 --> 01:33:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Accentuate that tendency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but being lazy is a state of mind.</v>

2122
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:32.510
<v Speaker 3>It's what you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the direction you decide to pursue your </v>

2123
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.510
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2124
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:36.531
<v Speaker 3>I am not lazy because of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am more introspective and oftentimes I</v>

2125
01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:40.440
<v Speaker 3>get more done because of marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have more interests.</v>

2126
01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:45.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just we have these perceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have these stereotypes that have been</v>

2127
01:33:45.211 --> 01:33:50.211
<v Speaker 3>reinforced and movies and we have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and we have these ideas that are </v>

2128
01:33:50.401 --> 01:33:53.370
<v Speaker 3>coming from a person who clearly doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke pot.</v>

2129
01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Clearly she's not eating pot cookies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>exploring your conscience.</v>

2130
01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe in any kind of media </v>
<v Speaker 6>laws,</v>

2131
01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:03.961
<v Speaker 6>but I almost feel like there should be a</v>
<v Speaker 6>law where if you're going to talk about </v>

2132
01:34:03.961 --> 01:34:06.571
<v Speaker 6>a subject this big,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you actually have to have firsthand </v>

2133
01:34:06.571 --> 01:34:09.571
<v Speaker 6>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so if you're talking about marijuana is </v>

2134
01:34:09.571 --> 01:34:11.641
<v Speaker 6>harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you must have actually used it yourself </v>

2135
01:34:11.641 --> 01:34:12.250
<v Speaker 6>more than once before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can talk about it in that manner.</v>

2136
01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 6>If you're talking about Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you actually have to have used it at </v>

2137
01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:17.770
<v Speaker 6>least once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're talking about anything.</v>

2138
01:34:17.771 --> 01:34:19.030
<v Speaker 6>If you're talking about being </v>
<v Speaker 6>unemployed,</v>

2139
01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:24.210
<v Speaker 6>you have to have been unemployed at some</v>
<v Speaker 6>point or at least interview somebody </v>

2140
01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:24.670
<v Speaker 6>who's unemployed now and not just </v>
<v Speaker 6>pontificate,</v>

2141
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:25.900
<v Speaker 6>which is what so many people do.</v>

2142
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I agree to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the marijuana thing is it's also</v>

2143
01:34:31.311 --> 01:34:35.870
<v Speaker 3>troubling the format in which they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating in these goddamn formats,</v>

2144
01:34:35.871 --> 01:34:40.190
<v Speaker 3>these television formats or so and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize it when I was younger,</v>

2145
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:45.310
<v Speaker 3>but now after four years of podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so aware of what the difference is </v>

2146
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:47.870
<v Speaker 3>and communicating like that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating like this.</v>

2147
01:34:48.110 --> 01:34:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Like when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do Jujitsu,</v>

2148
01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:55.460
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're a really good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and you roll with someone who's </v>

2149
01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:59.741
<v Speaker 3>just really strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote with a guy who was like a good </v>

2150
01:34:59.741 --> 01:34:59.741
<v Speaker 3>athlete.</v>

2151
01:34:59.741 --> 01:35:03.610
<v Speaker 1>It takes you a while to get them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get them so it's </v>

2152
01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:03.680
<v Speaker 1>going to take a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone doesn't know Jujitsu but</v>

2153
01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>they're really strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not be able to hold onto them.</v>

2154
01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:10.451
<v Speaker 1>They might throw you off them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually they're going to get </v>

2155
01:35:10.451 --> 01:35:12.881
<v Speaker 1>tired of doing that because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it the wrong way and you're going </v>

2156
01:35:12.881 --> 01:35:15.511
<v Speaker 1>to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Ann cultures on a Pierce Morgan </v>

2157
01:35:15.511 --> 01:35:18.551
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could say a bunch of crazy shit </v>

2158
01:35:18.551 --> 01:35:18.551
<v Speaker 1>because she knows the commercials come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in at seven minutes.</v>

2159
01:35:18.551 --> 01:35:20.750
<v Speaker 1>She can start this ridiculous argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's completely securitas.</v>

2160
01:35:20.751 --> 01:35:22.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have an ending to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he.</v>

2161
01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.470
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be an interruption,</v>

2162
01:35:24.471 --> 01:35:29.471
<v Speaker 1>will be right back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're going to cut to </v>

2163
01:35:29.471 --> 01:35:29.471
<v Speaker 1>commercial and they're going to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and she's going to babble some more</v>

2164
01:35:29.471 --> 01:35:31.430
<v Speaker 1>so she can sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a fight.</v>

2165
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:33.800
<v Speaker 1>We sprint in between rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprint,</v>

2166
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:38.890
<v Speaker 1>and then in between rounds you relaxed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you come back with some other </v>

2167
01:35:38.890 --> 01:35:40.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking inane argument and the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>round and that's what she's doing,</v>

2168
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:42.650
<v Speaker 1>but if you got her on a podcast for </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours,</v>

2169
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I would brian downing her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do exactly what I did with that </v>

2170
01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.711
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just talked to them and allow them </v>

2171
01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:50.711
<v Speaker 1>to express themselves until you reveal </v>
<v Speaker 1>how ridiculous they are.</v>

2172
01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she.</v>

2173
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.370
<v Speaker 1>If she were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she were here,</v>

2174
01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:55.250
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't be able to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual hit and run where you throw</v>

2175
01:35:55.251 --> 01:35:58.370
<v Speaker 1>out like this huge character attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>against weed smokers and then it's over.</v>

2176
01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would let her talk,</v>

2177
01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 1>let her talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have hours to kill.</v>

2178
01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

2179
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:08.470
<v Speaker 1>get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after awhile you're going to get </v>

2180
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.470
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get tired.</v>

2181
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.470
<v Speaker 1>You get tired of saying nuts.</v>

2182
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:12.320
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get tired of sprinting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nonsense and then slowly but surely</v>

2183
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:17.410
<v Speaker 1>we will compile facts and slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 1>surely we will present you with examples</v>

2184
01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:22.720
<v Speaker 1>of people who use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are healthy and who have benefited </v>

2185
01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:22.850
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you my own personal story,</v>

2186
01:36:22.851 --> 01:36:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I benefit from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we can compare and you can tell</v>

2197
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a lazy way of being a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

2198

2215
01:37:48.330 --> 01:37:51.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of beautiful people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke marijuana,</v>

2216
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:55.410
<v Speaker 1>beautiful spiritually beautiful.</v>

<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

2218
01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of lazy people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke marijuana.</v>

01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:02.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of lazy people who drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

2220
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:08.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a tool like any other tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be used or it can be abused.</v>

2221
01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:13.760
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my old joke from one of my </v>

2222
01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:13.760
<v Speaker 1>bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can build a house with marijuana.</v>

2223
01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

2224
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:16.890
<v Speaker 1>you could smoke pot and use it to design</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2225
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

2226
01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could build a deck with a,</v>

2227
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.710
<v Speaker 1>with a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hit nails with a hammer or you</v>

2228
01:38:22.711 --> 01:38:24.600
<v Speaker 1>can hit yourself with a dick if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>

2229
01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that hammer should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>

2230
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:29.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could design furniture on marijuana.</v>

2231
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:32.580
<v Speaker 1>You could build a fucking airplane on </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

2232
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:34.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're on marijuana.</v>

2233
01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:37.050
<v Speaker 1>He can write a novel on marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been done many times.</v>

2234
01:38:37.051 --> 01:38:42.051
<v Speaker 1>Even king wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all his shit was just a lot of </v>

2235
01:38:42.051 --> 01:38:42.051
<v Speaker 1>coke to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a bad example,</v>

2236
01:38:42.051 --> 01:38:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King on writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a mixed example.</v>

2237
01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people should be able to do whatever </v>

2239
01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:50.250
<v Speaker 1>they want to do as long as you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting others.</v>

2240
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:53.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking marijuana and you wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>up becoming a fucking rapist.</v>

2241
01:38:53.851 --> 01:38:54.780
<v Speaker 1>If Marilyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was,</v>

2242
01:38:54.781 --> 01:38:55.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not say marijuana with.</v>

2243
01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:00.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a cactus flower that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>found in New Mexico and for some reason </v>

2244
01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 1>that makes you a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody takes,</v>

2245
01:39:01.081 --> 01:39:02.850
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like a rape Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:39:02.851 --> 01:39:04.710
<v Speaker 1>They should probably make that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing illegal.</v>

2247
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2248
01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.560
<v Speaker 1>you started eating people's faces in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miami.</v>

2249
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 1>That shy legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2250
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what's funny about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what they started saying was </v>

2251
01:39:14.210 --> 01:39:17.361
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was the Zombie that they said </v>

2252
01:39:17.361 --> 01:39:17.361
<v Speaker 1>they tested him and he tested positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>for marijuana.</v>

2253
01:39:17.361 --> 01:39:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That was the only drug he didn't test </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for.</v>

2254
01:39:18.901 --> 01:39:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Bath salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's with all the stories,</v>

2255
01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but this is how piss poor the media is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're giving out these five to</v>

2256
01:39:25.531 --> 01:39:30.531
<v Speaker 1>seven minute blurbs on information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why didn't test positive for bath </v>

2257
01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:31.890
<v Speaker 1>salts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no test for bath salts.</v>

2258
01:39:31.891 --> 01:39:34.830
<v Speaker 1>You fuckhead they don't have a test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2259
01:39:34.831 --> 01:39:36.810
<v Speaker 1>So they're just making this shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what does bath salts,</v>

2260
01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:42.260
<v Speaker 1>what about salts with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be a variety of different </v>

2261
01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:42.260
<v Speaker 1>compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Storage,</v>

2262
01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:45.920
<v Speaker 1>just a media term for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what man drug will with these </v>

2263
01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:46.320
<v Speaker 1>man drugs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you take an illegal drug,</v>

2264
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:48.180
<v Speaker 1>you alter it so that it's no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>

2265
01:39:48.181 --> 01:39:53.181
<v Speaker 1>but it's still as ridiculous effects on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human body and then you sell it as </v>

2266
01:39:53.181 --> 01:39:53.181
<v Speaker 1>not for human consumption.</v>

2267
01:39:53.181 --> 01:39:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one simple formula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't just take math and add </v>

2268
01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:01.581
<v Speaker 1>phosphorus to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a bunch of different </v>

2269
01:40:01.581 --> 01:40:02.130
<v Speaker 1>versions of these bath salts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're saying that you didn't test</v>

2270
01:40:02.131 --> 01:40:04.950
<v Speaker 1>positive for back salts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right and you're wrong.</v>

2271
01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.750
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't test positive,</v>

2272
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 1>but the reason is they don't have a test</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

2273
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.100
<v Speaker 1>So of course he didn't test positive for</v>
<v Speaker 1>bath salts.</v>

2274
01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.280
<v Speaker 1>You said a test to a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to test for a bunch of </v>

2275
01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:16.280
<v Speaker 1>different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to look for,</v>

2276
01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>

2277
01:40:16.331 --> 01:40:17.420
<v Speaker 1>They're going to look for alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>

2278
01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.590
<v Speaker 1>They have a spectrum that they look for </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in.</v>

2279
01:40:19.591 --> 01:40:24.591
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you specifically tell them what </v>

2280
01:40:24.591 --> 01:40:24.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of bath salts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to look for that.</v>

2281
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:30.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to come up with a check </v>

2282
01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:30.370
<v Speaker 1>mark next to bath salts.</v>

2283
01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:33.890
<v Speaker 1>So they tried to blame it on marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say this guy smoked pot and eight guys </v>

2284
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:33.930
<v Speaker 1>face like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doesn't happen sometimes.</v>

2285

<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want in and out,</v>

2286
01:40:35.131 --> 01:40:40.131

<v Speaker 1>What they don't realize is how </v>

2287
01:40:40.131 --> 01:40:40.590
<v Speaker 1>attractive they made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd after that because people go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Zombie Kush.</v>

2290
01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.150

<v Speaker 1>handle it because he's crazy homeless.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I honestly do because I feel bad for the</v>

2299
01:41:04.811 --> 01:41:09.811
<v Speaker 3>viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's going out to people's </v>

2300
01:41:09.811 --> 01:41:11.731
<v Speaker 3>homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These toxins are being pumped into your </v>

2301
01:41:11.731 --> 01:41:11.731
<v Speaker 3>living room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a middle aged woman.</v>

2302
01:41:11.731 --> 01:41:12.130
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not going to get any better.</v>

2303
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get any smarter,</v>

2304
01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:14.920
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what she is.</v>

2305
01:41:14.921 --> 01:41:16.570
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2306
01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.930
<v Speaker 3>you've lived your life and accumulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and had life experiences and</v>

2307
01:41:19.931 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 3>this is the result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is who you are.</v>

2308
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:26.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a attention seeking missile to a </v>

2309
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:30.471
<v Speaker 3>disaster that's destroying lives along </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way with it's fucking shitty </v>

2310
01:41:30.471 --> 01:41:32.740
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so unfortunate.</v>

2311
01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:34.450
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate for her.</v>

2312
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:39.480
<v Speaker 3>It's unfortunate for the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen and don't realize how ridiculous </v>

2313
01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:44.311
<v Speaker 3>or opinions really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the actual facts </v>

2314
01:41:44.311 --> 01:41:45.310
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the anti anti marijuana rhetoric.</v>

2315
01:41:45.311 --> 01:41:46.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>

2316
01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:47.800
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2317
01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:52.801
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely problems with people </v>

2318
01:41:52.801 --> 01:41:54.601
<v Speaker 3>using marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's problems with people use </v>

2319
01:41:54.601 --> 01:41:54.601
<v Speaker 3>toothpaste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's problems with people using glue.</v>

2320
01:41:54.601 --> 01:41:55.840
<v Speaker 3>They take glue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sniff it and they go,</v>

2321
01:41:55.841 --> 01:41:57.790
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are nuts,</v>

2322
01:41:57.791 --> 01:42:02.791
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 7 billion of us on this planet </v>

2323
01:42:02.791 --> 01:42:02.791
<v Speaker 3>and there's a certain percentage of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can't handle anything.</v>

2324
01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they were raised poor because </v>

2325
01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.410
<v Speaker 3>the race in a poor manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty I should say,</v>

2326
01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.500
<v Speaker 3>because their genetics are poor because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

2327
01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:16.520
<v Speaker 3>They have birth defects because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental hazards because they have </v>

2328
01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 3>disease is because fill in the life </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

2329
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:22.090
<v Speaker 3>fill in a traumatic childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incidences fill it in,</v>

2330
01:42:22.091 --> 01:42:27.091
<v Speaker 3>fill it in for why they're fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a human being is a very complex </v>

2331
01:42:27.091 --> 01:42:29.560
<v Speaker 3>puzzle that doesn't always come together</v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

2332
01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:34.710
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of factors that have to </v>

2333
01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:34.710
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2334
01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:36.820
<v Speaker 3>that have to fall into place to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>David Seaman to make a guy can come on a</v>

2335
01:42:36.821 --> 01:42:41.821
<v Speaker 3>podcast and be articulate and express </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and have all this stuff in </v>

2336
01:42:41.821 --> 01:42:45.571
<v Speaker 3>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a lot of factors in </v>

2337
01:42:45.571 --> 01:42:45.571
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not it doesn't always work out that way.</v>

2338
01:42:45.571 --> 01:42:47.710
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the beautiful things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>running across a guy like you or a cross</v>

2339
01:42:47.850 --> 01:42:52.850
<v Speaker 3>and anyone who's got their shit together</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not easy or you and your </v>

2340
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 3>podcast just attracting a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>listeners and building up something.</v>

2341
01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.310
<v Speaker 3>You didn't do this with a network </v>
<v Speaker 3>backing.</v>

2342
01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.830
<v Speaker 3>It was just your own thing and it grew </v>
<v Speaker 3>over time.</v>

2343
01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.200
<v Speaker 3>We also did cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't do it,</v>

2344
01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:04.390
<v Speaker 3>trying to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the,</v>

2345
01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2346
01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:10.250
<v Speaker 3>when we had these discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was nobody listening so we just </v>

2347
01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:13.060
<v Speaker 3>expressed are our thoughts and it allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>you a platform to explore,</v>

2348
01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:18.810
<v Speaker 3>but these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these like five minute blurbs where </v>

2349
01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:22.051
<v Speaker 3>people run on and start arguments on </v>
<v Speaker 3>television just to try to get people to </v>

2350
01:43:22.051 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 3>buy their book.</v>

2351
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:24.850
<v Speaker 3>It's the silent movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2352
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.980
<v Speaker 3>That's some old shit that doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2353
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:32.160
<v Speaker 3>The world is complicated and a five </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute conversation on a very complex </v>

2354
01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.160
<v Speaker 3>issue that has a massive social impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Massive,</v>

2355
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:38.890
<v Speaker 3>both positive and negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything,</v>

2356
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:41.110
<v Speaker 3>like every fucking good thing in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2357
01:43:41.111 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Driving has a positive and negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

2358
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I am not going to stop driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like being able to get somewhere </v>

2359
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:49.300
<v Speaker 3>quicker than walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but driving kills people.</v>

2360
01:43:49.301 --> 01:43:51.560
<v Speaker 3>There's car accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're breathing in brake dust.</v>

2361
01:43:51.561 --> 01:43:56.561
<v Speaker 3>If you live in a fucking city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget about the pollution from the </v>

2362
01:43:56.561 --> 01:43:56.780
<v Speaker 3>engines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no free lunch.</v>

2363
01:43:57.110 --> 01:44:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Everything has a plus and a minus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's our job as human beings to to </v>

2364
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.140
<v Speaker 3>have a balanced approach and here's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's not good.</v>

2365
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Suppressing and making something illegal</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's beneficial to millions of people </v>

2366
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.270
<v Speaker 3>and if there's any lesson to be learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>from prohibition,</v>

2367
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:19.540
<v Speaker 3>it's the rise of organized crime because</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you turn regular people into </v>

2368
01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:20.870
<v Speaker 3>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the criminals are going to provide those</v>

2369
01:44:20.871 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 3>regular people with drugs and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be on taxed.</v>

2370
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Unregulated</v>

2371
01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:28.260
<v Speaker 6>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they just corrupt the officials</v>

2372
01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:33.261
<v Speaker 6>and the whole thing becomes its own </v>
<v Speaker 6>little environment and it gets </v>

2373
01:44:33.261 --> 01:44:37.221
<v Speaker 6>entrenched and that's what you have is </v>
<v Speaker 6>now you have powerful cartels that want </v>

2374
01:44:37.221 --> 01:44:41.091
<v Speaker 6>to keep it illegal so they continue to </v>
<v Speaker 6>so they can continue to make money off </v>

2375
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:41.091
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>

2376
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't really hate and culture.</v>

2377
01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:43.320
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing against that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad for her.</v>

2378
01:44:43.321 --> 01:44:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad that she's that person now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

2379
01:44:46.150 --> 01:44:51.050
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad for anybody that's in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>position because that's such an easy for</v>

2380
01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:56.051
<v Speaker 3>a person who has experienced life </v>
<v Speaker 3>through as much of an objective lens as </v>

2381
01:44:57.111 --> 01:44:59.320
<v Speaker 3>you can and you see a person like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a.</v>

2382
01:44:59.450 --> 01:45:04.450
<v Speaker 3>that's not a person who's at their best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a person who has done a lot </v>

2383
01:45:04.450 --> 01:45:09.131
<v Speaker 3>of soul searching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of thinking and it's come to this </v>

2384
01:45:09.131 --> 01:45:09.131
<v Speaker 3>really peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loving conclusion.</v>

2385
01:45:09.131 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 3>That's a silly person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>

2386
01:45:10.761 --> 01:45:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Person has to be themselves and live </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their own</v>

2387
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 6>Mary's every night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not fun.</v>

2388
01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:15.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's not that.</v>

2389
01:45:15.730 --> 01:45:20.730
<v Speaker 6>She's not having a fun life when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about how he lived in a fucked </v>

2390
01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:20.730
<v Speaker 6>up world and people do crazy stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2391
01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:22.410
<v Speaker 6>things are mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2392
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.720
<v Speaker 6>I wrote this article the other day that </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of my readers didn't like,</v>

2393
01:45:26.721 --> 01:45:31.721
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's one of the better </v>
<v Speaker 6>things I've ever written and it's where </v>

2394
01:45:31.721 --> 01:45:34.361
<v Speaker 6>I take this angle where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if President Obama is right about </v>

2395
01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:34.361
<v Speaker 6>most of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2396
01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:36.650
<v Speaker 6>like he's doing a lot of stuff that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>arguably not constitutional.</v>

2397
01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:42.190
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are 7 billion people on the </v>

2398
01:45:42.190 --> 01:45:44.741
<v Speaker 6>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them are driven by hateful </v>

2399
01:45:44.741 --> 01:45:45.890
<v Speaker 6>ideology and certain parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in a nuclear age,</v>

2400
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:49.070
<v Speaker 6>it only takes one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't even take a nuke.</v>

2401
01:45:49.071 --> 01:45:50.310
<v Speaker 6>It takes another nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2402
01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:55.600
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess going from Ann Coulter did nine </v>

2403
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:55.600
<v Speaker 6>slash 11 is natural.</v>

2404
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:55.880
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2405
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:59.030
<v Speaker 6>I can start to see the other side of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>whole argument.</v>

2406
01:45:59.031 --> 01:46:04.031
<v Speaker 6>And I think you have to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>that if you're doing the kind of work </v>

2407
01:46:04.031 --> 01:46:06.251
<v Speaker 6>that I do is I have to see where people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like General Keith Alexander are coming </v>

2408
01:46:06.251 --> 01:46:07.580
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the argument that we can't,</v>

2409
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.330
<v Speaker 6>sorry that we're looking for your text </v>
<v Speaker 6>messages that sucks Boohoo,</v>

2410
01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.940
<v Speaker 6>but we're not going to allow another </v>
<v Speaker 6>nine slash 11 to happen because we don't</v>

2411
01:46:13.941 --> 01:46:18.941
<v Speaker 6>want to have 3000 innocent people die </v>
<v Speaker 6>and have the economy crashed and have </v>

2412
01:46:18.941 --> 01:46:21.830
<v Speaker 6>total chaos for the next five years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I can see things in that light.</v>

2413
01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:24.380
<v Speaker 6>And I wrote this article coming from </v>
<v Speaker 6>that place of,</v>

2414
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:29.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's kept us safe and I realized that's </v>

2415
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:30.530
<v Speaker 6>a total Bush era argument and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of thing that I normally despise.</v>

2416
01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:35.860
<v Speaker 6>But you have to be willing to explore </v>
<v Speaker 6>that and explore the fact that it's the </v>

2417
01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:36.440
<v Speaker 6>year 2014 now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2418
01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:41.620
<v Speaker 6>he's been in office since January 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you have these fear mongers and the </v>

2419
01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:46.331
<v Speaker 6>alternative media who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people who I don't want to disc because </v>

2420
01:46:46.331 --> 01:46:47.210
<v Speaker 6>I do their shows and they do mine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

2421
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people like Alex Jones,</v>

2422
01:46:48.741 --> 01:46:52.530
<v Speaker 6>basically it's fucking 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if what you're saying is true,</v>

2423
01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:57.531
<v Speaker 6>why are you not in a gulag somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why aren't you in a fucking dungeon </v>

2424
01:46:57.531 --> 01:46:58.230
<v Speaker 6>tower being tortured by homeland </v>
<v Speaker 6>security</v>

2425
01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:03.650
<v Speaker 1>for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's easily dismissed because he's so </v>

2426
01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:03.650
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2427
01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 1>you could pull up a million videos of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him screaming and ranting and raving and</v>

2428
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you just dismiss him right away.</v>

2429
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:09.030
<v Speaker 6>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my point though is like Obama is not the</v>

2430
01:47:09.031 --> 01:47:11.940
<v Speaker 6>boogeyman that he's been made out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that what he is,</v>

2431
01:47:11.941 --> 01:47:16.941
<v Speaker 6>is somebody who's trying to do the best </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can within an extremely fucked up </v>

2432
01:47:16.941 --> 01:47:21.501
<v Speaker 6>and flawed and piece together system </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is dealing with like 15 different </v>

2433
01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.020
<v Speaker 6>entities at once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2434
01:47:22.021 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 6>like whenever the dea breaks in </v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody's door,</v>

2435
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:30.140
<v Speaker 6>that's not because Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Obama's like sitting in the White House </v>

2436
01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:30.140
<v Speaker 6>on his ipad and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2437
01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:30.390
<v Speaker 6>let's go to this guy's house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2438
01:47:30.391 --> 01:47:34.230
<v Speaker 6>Like he's got other things on his mind </v>
<v Speaker 6>and yet we link all this to Obama and we</v>

2439
01:47:34.231 --> 01:47:39.231
<v Speaker 6>should instead be trying to modernize </v>
<v Speaker 6>the whole fucking system so that Obama </v>

2440
01:47:39.231 --> 01:47:39.231
<v Speaker 6>has less to do.</v>

2441
01:47:39.231 --> 01:47:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a very good point in </v>

2442
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.430
<v Speaker 1>that and I agree with you on looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other perspective.</v>

2443
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very important and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very reluctant to do that.</v>

2444
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.550
<v Speaker 1>People are very.</v>

2445
01:47:47.890 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the hardest things to do was</v>
<v Speaker 6>hard for me to write this article </v>

2446
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 6>because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

2447
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm like defending everything that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't believe,</v>

2448
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:57.700
<v Speaker 1>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're exploring that idea and I think </v>

2449
01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you should be allowed to explore an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

2450
01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:01.811
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore an idea and people on the left </v>

2451
01:48:01.811 --> 01:48:01.811
<v Speaker 1>are people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2452
01:48:01.811 --> 01:48:06.670
<v Speaker 1>anti war or in rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would like reject that </v>

2453
01:48:06.670 --> 01:48:09.800
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that to get to know what you</v>

2454
01:48:09.801 --> 01:48:11.440
<v Speaker 1>really have to explore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to,</v>

2455
01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:12.760
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the,</v>

2456
01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:18.060
<v Speaker 1>the holes in the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to look at it from a defensive </v>

2457
01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:21.161
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to explore it and look at it </v>

2458
01:48:21.161 --> 01:48:21.161
<v Speaker 1>from their point of view to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2459
01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that I would agree with you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways that Obama,</v>

2460
01:48:24.981 --> 01:48:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

2461
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.000
<v Speaker 1>that Obama has one of the most thankless</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs ever and it's unbelievably fucked </v>

2462
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.981
<v Speaker 1>up situation to try to deal with however</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's lied about things and I have issue </v>

2463
01:48:35.981 --> 01:48:40.821
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have issue with the lying about the </v>

2464
01:48:40.821 --> 01:48:40.821
<v Speaker 1>NSA collecting metadata like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2465
01:48:40.821 --> 01:48:43.040
<v Speaker 1>how long did you think that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stay a lie?</v>

2466
01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was gonna sit out there before </v>

2467
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:48.320
<v Speaker 1>people found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2468
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.150
<v Speaker 1>people exposed to that was not true </v>
<v Speaker 1>within days.</v>

2469
01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:51.050
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2470
01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 6>there's a new one that's out today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wrote down,</v>

2471
01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:54.900
<v Speaker 6>don't go negative,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

2472
01:48:54.901 --> 01:48:59.901
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a new NSA snowden document that </v>

2473
01:48:59.901 --> 01:49:02.160
<v Speaker 6>the NSA and the GCHQ,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the British version of it.</v>

2474
01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.410
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess the British government's NSA,</v>

2475
01:49:04.411 --> 01:49:05.490
<v Speaker 6>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2476
01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:10.520
<v Speaker 6>they have this whole a procedural thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>for how to go after activists that they </v>

2477
01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.930
<v Speaker 6>don't like and harass them using troll </v>
<v Speaker 6>identities,</v>

2478
01:49:12.931 --> 01:49:17.160
<v Speaker 6>like literally their slideshows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>showing how NSA agents troll people they</v>

2479
01:49:17.161 --> 01:49:22.161
<v Speaker 6>don't like online and destroy their </v>
<v Speaker 6>credibility and reputation and this is </v>

2480
01:49:22.161 --> 01:49:26.361
<v Speaker 6>shit that even a week ago to say this </v>
<v Speaker 6>would be like kind of out there because </v>

2481
01:49:26.361 --> 01:49:26.361
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure,</v>

2482
01:49:26.361 --> 01:49:28.260
<v Speaker 6>like maybe governments troll people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can't say with authority,</v>

2483
01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:31.500
<v Speaker 6>like the US government and the British </v>
<v Speaker 6>government or trolling people they don't</v>

2484
01:49:31.501 --> 01:49:35.010
<v Speaker 6>like now we know that this is a fact and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's something that needs to be reined</v>

2485
01:49:35.011 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 6>in because that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not paying for that because we're</v>

2486
01:49:37.891 --> 01:49:42.891
<v Speaker 6>paying for this crazy district.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're paying for some antisocial </v>

2487
01:49:42.891 --> 01:49:46.161
<v Speaker 6>sociopath's to get a paycheck every two </v>
<v Speaker 6>weeks from the federal government to </v>

2488
01:49:46.161 --> 01:49:47.590
<v Speaker 6>fucking do crazy stuff on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so funny,</v>

2489
01:49:47.591 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2490
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:50.710
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just hilarious that they've.</v>

2491
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about what is the,</v>

2492
01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 5>that job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want that job by the way.</v>

2493
01:49:53.850 --> 01:49:57.040
<v Speaker 5>I want the lowest form of life on online</v>
<v Speaker 5>troll.</v>

2494
01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:58.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what,</v>

2495
01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 5>that's what the government does role.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2496
01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:05.300
<v Speaker 5>it's hilarious and it only works if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>pay a attention,</v>

2497
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.530
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's enough people working for the</v>

2498
01:50:08.531 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to discredit you,</v>

2499
01:50:09.701 --> 01:50:12.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they could put a good dent in </v>
<v Speaker 5>public perception of you,</v>

2500
01:50:12.611 --> 01:50:17.611
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that's not what you're </v>

2501
01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:17.611
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be doing if you're a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>

2502
01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:19.330
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to be in a government is</v>

2503
01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:23.650
<v Speaker 5>one of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of a lot of ways like what you</v>

2504
01:50:23.710 --> 01:50:26.140
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't do when you argue with trolls </v>
<v Speaker 5>online,</v>

2505
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:28.270
<v Speaker 5>like you shouldn't do that because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2506
01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:31.240
<v Speaker 5>you just got to accept the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in an unusual position.</v>

2507
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:36.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the government's in an unusual position </v>

2508
01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:38.581
<v Speaker 5>to Obama with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was basically getting trolled by </v>

2509
01:50:38.581 --> 01:50:40.210
<v Speaker 5>Snowden for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was watching this and I was like,</v>

2510
01:50:40.211 --> 01:50:45.211
<v Speaker 5>it's absolutely ridiculous for a US </v>
<v Speaker 5>president to be lowering himself to the </v>

2511
01:50:45.211 --> 01:50:48.670
<v Speaker 5>level of a 29 year old freelance </v>
<v Speaker 5>contractor for some defense company.</v>

2512
01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:50.850
<v Speaker 5>How is he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In what way was he going to.</v>

2513
01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:53.350
<v Speaker 5>By addressing the issue and making it </v>
<v Speaker 5>seem like,</v>

2514
01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:58.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>snowden's the problem with it should've </v>

2515
01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:58.520
<v Speaker 5>been is immediately the second this shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>came out.</v>

2516
01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:02.620
<v Speaker 5>If I were one of Obama's advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would suggest just be honest with you,</v>

2517
01:51:02.621 --> 01:51:05.110
<v Speaker 5>will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like some stuff went overboard.</v>

2518
01:51:05.290 --> 01:51:07.420
<v Speaker 5>There were some things that should not </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been occurring.</v>

2519
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.960
<v Speaker 5>I'll put an end to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will appoint a panel to look into it.</v>

2520
01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:14.320
<v Speaker 5>It's not what America is about and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>went overboard because we didn't want to</v>

2521
01:51:14.321 --> 01:51:19.321
<v Speaker 5>see another nine slash 11 happened and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so of course some programs crop up over </v>

2522
01:51:19.321 --> 01:51:20.620
<v Speaker 5>time to keep you safe and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit is unconstitutional.</v>

2523
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.270
<v Speaker 5>We'll fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And most people,</v>

2524
01:51:22.271 --> 01:51:25.270
<v Speaker 5>I'd say like 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine percent of people including myself,</v>

2525
01:51:25.630 --> 01:51:26.400
<v Speaker 5>would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

2526
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.790
<v Speaker 5>Job Well done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2527
01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:29.590
<v Speaker 5>we don't need to fixate on this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

2528
01:51:30.110 --> 01:51:32.520
<v Speaker 5>but Jones instead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like a manhunt.</v>

2529
01:51:32.521 --> 01:51:37.521
<v Speaker 5>It's like the plane was forced to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground somewhere and to search for </v>

2530
01:51:37.521 --> 01:51:38.290
<v Speaker 5>snowden and it's been in the news for </v>
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

2531
01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.160
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

2532
01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:40.630
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2533
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:41.740
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also,</v>

2534
01:51:41.741 --> 01:51:46.480
<v Speaker 5>what did he do that's so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He released information about crimes.</v>

2535
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:48.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you look at what is law,</v>

2536
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:50.500
<v Speaker 5>what is law in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2537
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:55.620
<v Speaker 5>there are laws and there are precedents </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have been set way back to when the </v>

2538
01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.910
<v Speaker 5>founding fathers had no idea were ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have a fucking internet.</v>

2539
01:51:58.150 --> 01:52:03.150
<v Speaker 5>They had certain laws that were in place</v>
<v Speaker 5>in order to make sure that people's </v>

2540
01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:04.630
<v Speaker 5>rights are protected and that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>government doesn't get out.</v>

2541
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:09.630
<v Speaker 5>I got a hand that law enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't get out of hand because people </v>

2542
01:52:09.630 --> 01:52:11.020
<v Speaker 5>who have ultimate power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it corrupts them.</v>

2543
01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:12.230
<v Speaker 5>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It always has.</v>

2544
01:52:12.231 --> 01:52:15.670
<v Speaker 5>It's had since the beginning of time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a fucking security guard at</v>

2545
01:52:15.671 --> 01:52:20.671
<v Speaker 5>a mall or whether it's the president of </v>
<v Speaker 5>United States power is a corrupting </v>

2546
01:52:20.671 --> 01:52:24.091
<v Speaker 5>thing and these laws in place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they circumvented those laws.</v>

2547
01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:27.460
<v Speaker 5>They changed those laws.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They pass things like the NDA.</v>

2548
01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:32.610
<v Speaker 5>They pass things like the Patriot Act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They pass all these things to make laws </v>

2549
01:52:32.610 --> 01:52:32.920
<v Speaker 5>that are in place to protect people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights.</v>

2550
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:36.460
<v Speaker 5>Invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make the fourth amendment invalid and so</v>

2551
01:52:36.461 --> 01:52:40.450
<v Speaker 5>then they feel justified by doing what </v>
<v Speaker 5>is essentially a crime.</v>

2552
01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Well guy comes out and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2553
01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 5>a crime is being committed on 300 </v>
<v Speaker 5>million people</v>

2554
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.160
<v Speaker 2>in this country and multiple millions </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide by a group of Americans who </v>

2555
01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>didn't get a license to do this by any </v>
<v Speaker 2>voting,</v>

2556
01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:59.210
<v Speaker 2>by any court of public opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are unelected officials.</v>

2557
01:52:59.211 --> 01:53:01.340
<v Speaker 2>This is scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Bob Smith,</v>

2558
01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:06.341
<v Speaker 2>and suburban Virginia is looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking through your emails potentially </v>

2559
01:53:06.341 --> 01:53:07.760
<v Speaker 2>if they just have the power to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because they have the power to do so.</v>

2560
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:10.430
<v Speaker 2>The acted on it and that's crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a crime.</v>

2561
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:15.550
<v Speaker 2>We have laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what snowden did was calling him a </v>

2562
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:18.080
<v Speaker 2>trader is one of the most disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 2>labels you could ever label.</v>

2563
01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:23.230
<v Speaker 2>A guy who took his own life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificed to safety and security in </v>

2564
01:53:24.201 --> 01:53:27.830
<v Speaker 2>order to enlighten the millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are crime is going on.</v>

2565
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a modern Paul revere times a </v>

2566
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.310
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2567
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had a nice life in Hawaii.</v>

2568
01:53:35.121 --> 01:53:39.350
<v Speaker 2>He had the dancer girlfriend and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>making good money for a 29 year old.</v>

2569
01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Now he's under the fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crosshairs.</v>

2570
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:45.410
<v Speaker 2>He's in the cross hairs now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have to do that.</v>

2571
01:53:45.411 --> 01:53:48.350
<v Speaker 2>He made a choice and he's definitely not</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attention seeker.</v>

2572
01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Don't think Putin's not hooking them up </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2573
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 2>You think you're talking about with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian slowly Mowgli,</v>

2574
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Russian chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians.</v>

2575
01:53:55.411 --> 01:53:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Chicks are probably way harder than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2576
01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was banging in Hawaii.</v>

2577
01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:01.690
<v Speaker 2>He's probably got some evil Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>liver steel and chicks,</v>

2578
01:54:01.691 --> 01:54:06.691
<v Speaker 2>the kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck them and you'd get all groggy </v>

2579
01:54:06.691 --> 01:54:06.691
<v Speaker 2>and you wake up in a hostel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2580
01:54:06.691 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 2>we're in a tub filled with ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2581
01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2582
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's really going on with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2583
01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.370
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to guess,</v>

2584
01:54:13.371 --> 01:54:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I think they take care of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's probably.</v>

2585
01:54:16.821 --> 01:54:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well think about it.</v>

2586
01:54:18.241 --> 01:54:19.880
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there were like a,</v>

2587
01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.430
<v Speaker 2>if it were a Russian snowden and he came</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the US,</v>

2588
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:24.560
<v Speaker 2>we would totally hook him up.</v>

2589
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:29.590
<v Speaker 2>We'd make them go into NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The US government would be singing his </v>

2590
01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:32.741
<v Speaker 2>praises every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of creepy when you realize </v>

2591
01:54:32.741 --> 01:54:35.051
<v Speaker 2>that that does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do steal like scientists and they </v>

2592
01:54:35.051 --> 01:54:35.051
<v Speaker 2>steal like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2593
01:54:35.051 --> 01:54:38.801
<v Speaker 2>we're all competing with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the US is one of the major super </v>

2594
01:54:38.801 --> 01:54:41.981
<v Speaker 2>powers and we're in this dystopian novel</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now where everybody is spying on </v>

2595
01:54:41.981 --> 01:54:43.380
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have satellites and uh,</v>

2596
01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I think the US is the least evil of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>superpowers by far and the most </v>

2597
01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:52.121
<v Speaker 2>promising one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should still hold ourselves to </v>

2598
01:54:52.121 --> 01:54:54.311
<v Speaker 2>the highest standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shouldn't it be like vicious about </v>

2599
01:54:54.311 --> 01:54:57.101
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just a lot of </v>

2600
01:54:57.101 --> 01:54:58.250
<v Speaker 2>incompetence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a lot of what leads to </v>

2601
01:54:58.250 --> 01:55:00.731
<v Speaker 2>these evil decisions and behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so things to think about how this stuff </v>

2602
01:55:00.731 --> 01:55:03.971
<v Speaker 2>is doing their job and all this stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting out these lame powerpoint </v>

2603
01:55:03.971 --> 01:55:03.971
<v Speaker 2>slides.</v>

2604
01:55:03.971 --> 01:55:04.730
<v Speaker 2>It feels like something from the office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2605
01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 2>like the bullet points are like go after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the activists damage their credibility,</v>

2606
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:12.170
<v Speaker 2>bring it up a search for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on dirt,</v>

2607
01:55:12.210 --> 01:55:13.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dirt.</v>

2608
01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Some tech blog and one of their top </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles right now is about the NSA </v>

2609
01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.640
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the actual slides.</v>

2610
01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to see some of these because </v>

2611
01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:27.311
<v Speaker 2>it's so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the combination of evil and </v>

2612
01:55:27.311 --> 01:55:27.311
<v Speaker 2>mundane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

2613
01:55:27.311 --> 01:55:28.190
<v Speaker 2>that is just weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2614
01:55:28.191 --> 01:55:33.191
<v Speaker 2>because it's people making these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people making these policies and </v>

2615
01:55:33.191 --> 01:55:35.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just incredibly vicious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so hilarious.</v>

2616
01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:37.330
<v Speaker 2>It really is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2617
01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:42.670
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious how incompetent they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a lot of ways it's almost like </v>

2618
01:55:42.670 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 2>it's on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the whole thing is being</v>

2619
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.910
<v Speaker 5>done on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're not incompetent.</v>

2620
01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:50.940
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about this too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the government puts across this </v>

2621
01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:50.940
<v Speaker 5>image like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2622
01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:55.011
<v Speaker 5>we're just a bunch of bumbling morons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We shut down the government because we </v>

2623
01:55:55.011 --> 01:55:56.040
<v Speaker 5>couldn't agree to something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what's going on.</v>

2624
01:55:56.041 --> 01:56:00.690
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile you have the NSA has these</v>
<v Speaker 5>protocols for harassing people were very</v>

2625
01:56:00.691 --> 01:56:02.880
<v Speaker 5>smart at some level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we know there.</v>

2626
01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Those are the slides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny.</v>

2627
01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:10.740
<v Speaker 5>Leak confidential information to </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies,</v>

2628
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:13.170
<v Speaker 5>the press via blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>

2629
01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Post negative information on appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 5>forums,</v>

2630
01:56:16.890 --> 01:56:19.950
<v Speaker 5>appropriate forums,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped deals,</v>

2631
01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:24.900
<v Speaker 5>ruin business relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that set uP a honey trap?</v>

2632
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:27.780
<v Speaker 5>We'll get that set up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A honey trap.</v>

2633
01:56:27.781 --> 01:56:32.781
<v Speaker 5>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like the stuff they did to </v>

2634
01:56:32.781 --> 01:56:34.200
<v Speaker 5>assign a damaged credibility hook him up</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a girl.</v>

2635
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:35.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2636
01:56:35.161 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 5>what exactly did happen with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sausage?</v>

2637
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:42.201
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what for folks who don't realize he's </v>

2638
01:56:42.201 --> 01:56:42.840
<v Speaker 5>not in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't know juliana songs is,</v>

2639
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:44.850
<v Speaker 5>he's in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which embassy?</v>

2640
01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:48.360
<v Speaker 5>Some south american and some south </v>
<v Speaker 5>american embassy I should know,</v>

2641
01:56:48.361 --> 01:56:49.530
<v Speaker 5>but I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should know too.</v>

2642
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's not there because of what he </v>

2643
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:55.110
<v Speaker 5>did by leaking all that information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2644
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.020
<v Speaker 5>that's not really a crime that you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>get a guy on.</v>

2645
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:59.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2646
01:56:59.190 --> 01:57:00.900
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not the same kind of crime.</v>

2647
01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:06.260
<v Speaker 5>The reason why they've got him held </v>
<v Speaker 5>hostage is because they say that he had </v>

2648
01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:10.671
<v Speaker 5>secret or surprise sex with a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means he had sex with her while </v>

2649
01:57:10.671 --> 01:57:11.400
<v Speaker 5>they were wearing a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Condoms.</v>

2650
01:57:11.410 --> 01:57:16.410
<v Speaker 5>She agreed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then while they're in bed </v>

2651
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:18.411
<v Speaker 5>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they were both naked and he </v>

2652
01:57:18.411 --> 01:57:20.871
<v Speaker 5>stuck it in without a condom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He pulled the creeper switcheroo and </v>

2653
01:57:20.871 --> 01:57:21.970
<v Speaker 5>that's surprised sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess that's.</v>

2654
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:24.690
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't even sound like a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how is that?</v>

2655
01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:26.160
<v Speaker 5>What does that sound like?</v>

2656
01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:31.160
<v Speaker 5>A real gentle attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like how does that require being </v>

2657
01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.250
<v Speaker 5>on the books?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Surprise.</v>

2658
01:57:32.251 --> 01:57:34.770
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2659
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:40.100
<v Speaker 5>it's confusing as fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That could actually be something that </v>

2660
01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:43.911
<v Speaker 5>they could hold a guy in an embassy for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many years now have been there for </v>

2661
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:45.410
<v Speaker 5>longer than a year?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Long time.</v>

2662
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:47.820
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be kind of like trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the same place.</v>

2663
01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got to be brutal.</v>

2664
01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:51.600
<v Speaker 5>It's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it probably drive you fucking crazy.</v>

2665
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:54.240
<v Speaker 5>It probably will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably really will drive you fucking</v>

2666
01:57:54.241 --> 01:57:56.400
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That poor bastard.</v>

2667
01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:57.720
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stuck.</v>

2668
01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:00.240
<v Speaker 5>He's stuck there and he probably will </v>
<v Speaker 5>die there.</v>

2669
01:58:00.241 --> 01:58:01.570
<v Speaker 5>They'll probably make sure he dies </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2670
01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:05.670
<v Speaker 5>A vitamin that can be crazy if he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>there like 20 years from now,</v>

2671
01:58:05.671 --> 01:58:10.671
<v Speaker 5>30 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think some president will probably </v>

2672
01:58:10.671 --> 01:58:12.330
<v Speaker 5>like part time or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think so it would hopefully way,</v>

2673
01:58:12.331 --> 01:58:17.331
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way in the future for that to president </v>

2674
01:58:17.331 --> 01:58:17.331
<v Speaker 5>snowden and like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>45 months.</v>

2675
01:58:18.230 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 5>Miley president miley cyrus president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>mildly in two years or no,</v>

2676
01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:24.630
<v Speaker 5>she's got to be what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like 45 years old or something?</v>

2677
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got to be in your thirties,</v>

2678
01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:27.450
<v Speaker 5>36,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

2679
01:58:27.630 --> 01:58:28.620
<v Speaker 5>To be president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

2680
01:58:28.810 --> 01:58:32.490
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere I'm just hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just hurts.</v>

2681
01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.290
<v Speaker 5>It just hurts that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that transparent.</v>

2682
01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:39.570
<v Speaker 5>It hurts that were that bad that after </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these years of human civilization,</v>

2683
01:58:39.571 --> 01:58:41.290
<v Speaker 5>all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>since the printing press,</v>

2684
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 5>all these years,</v>

2685
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 1>since newspapers all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's television now.</v>

2686
01:58:44.921 --> 01:58:47.530
<v Speaker 1>All these years of the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still that transparent.</v>

2687
01:58:47.531 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 1>It's still that</v>

2688
01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:53.730
<v Speaker 6>I gotta tell you though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I've been thinking lately about </v>

2689
01:58:53.730 --> 01:58:54.760
<v Speaker 6>seeing those images from Ukraine of all </v>
<v Speaker 6>of these people.</v>

2690
01:58:54.761 --> 01:58:57.330
<v Speaker 6>Bloody and they went total,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2691
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 6>like completely off the civilization </v>
<v Speaker 6>map.</v>

2692
01:58:59.891 --> 01:59:03.340
<v Speaker 6>Just chaos burning stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>brother against brother,</v>

2693
01:59:03.341 --> 01:59:06.100
<v Speaker 6>like really dark shit over there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2694
01:59:06.130 --> 01:59:08.800
<v Speaker 6>they threw out their president,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe,</v>

2695
01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:13.090
<v Speaker 6>and he's on the run or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it makes me wonder,</v>

2696
01:59:13.091 --> 01:59:18.091
<v Speaker 6>like maybe some of this stuff that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>sense as being really oppressive is </v>

2697
01:59:18.091 --> 01:59:20.260
<v Speaker 6>necessary for society to just hold </v>
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

2698
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:25.440
<v Speaker 6>Like if we didn't have the occasional </v>
<v Speaker 6>situation where the government comes </v>

2699
01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:27.940
<v Speaker 6>down hard on somebody that things would </v>
<v Speaker 6>just slowly disintegrate and we will get</v>

2700
01:59:27.941 --> 01:59:30.220
<v Speaker 6>to a place where you walk into fedex and</v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody wants to.</v>

2701
01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:35.760
<v Speaker 6>Nobody wants to check you out because </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's not enough of thIs kind of </v>

2702
01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.060
<v Speaker 6>cohesive societal thing.</v>

2703
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the thinking that there </v>

2704
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:43.090
<v Speaker 1>has to be a yin and a yang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a good and an evil.</v>

2705
01:59:43.091 --> 01:59:47.170
<v Speaker 1>There has to be suppression and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to escape suppression in order to</v>

2706
01:59:47.171 --> 01:59:52.171
<v Speaker 1>create momentum and energy and in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to to enthusiastically encouraged </v>

2707
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:57.841
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be fighting against </v>

2708
01:59:57.841 --> 01:59:57.841
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be battling against them.</v>

2709
01:59:57.841 --> 01:59:57.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like to discover freedom,</v>

2710
01:59:57.961 --> 01:59:59.970
<v Speaker 6>you have to face a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 6>oppression.</v>

2711
02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of thinking behind that,</v>

2712
02:00:02.381 --> 02:00:07.381
<v Speaker 1>that that's sort of the way the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>works and that there's hunters and then </v>

2713
02:00:07.381 --> 02:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>there's prey there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2714
02:00:07.431 --> 02:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>there's lions and then there's gazelles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

2715
02:00:09.711 --> 02:00:14.711
<v Speaker 1>This is just sort of the way the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>works in order for the gazelles to stay </v>

2716
02:00:14.711 --> 02:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>alive and keep reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to realize a lion coming after</v>

2717
02:00:15.831 --> 02:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>them because if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2718
02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:20.000
<v Speaker 1>because gazelles could just hang out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in one spot.</v>

2719
02:00:20.001 --> 02:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably eat themselves silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd fucked so much.</v>

2720
02:00:22.651 --> 02:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>There'd be too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they'd all die of starvation.</v>

2721
02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>There would be no food left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost like you need both.</v>

2722
02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:31.060
<v Speaker 1>You need a good and a bad and he did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and a day.</v>

2723
02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>You need a winter and a summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a whole fucking lot of </v>

2724
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>different things to come into play.</v>

2725
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:40.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's what I'm starting to think </v>

2726
02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:42.701
<v Speaker 6>is kind of evolving my views on this </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff because I think that government </v>

2727
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:46.990
<v Speaker 6>serves as a kind of immune system </v>
<v Speaker 6>against shit like what happened in </v>

2728
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:49.991
<v Speaker 6>Ukraine and what's happening in parts of</v>
<v Speaker 6>south America now where people are just </v>

2729
02:00:49.991 --> 02:00:53.060
<v Speaker 6>losing it and you can't let that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just can't,</v>

2730
02:00:53.090 --> 02:00:54.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because the results,</v>

2731
02:00:54.021 --> 02:00:59.021
<v Speaker 6>you don't know where it ends and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>seems like at least the example with </v>

2732
02:00:59.021 --> 02:00:59.021
<v Speaker 6>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it ends in a bad place.</v>

2733
02:00:59.021 --> 02:01:03.701
<v Speaker 6>You go from something that really sucks </v>
<v Speaker 6>to something that's unimaginably worse </v>

2734
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:05.330
<v Speaker 6>and even more oppressive because you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>only go from oppression,</v>

2735
02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:10.380
<v Speaker 6>the chaos to more oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very rare what the United States </v>

2736
02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:12.140
<v Speaker 6>did with our founding and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>constitution and the bill of rights.</v>

2737
02:01:12.141 --> 02:01:14.690
<v Speaker 6>These are very rare things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>happen all that often.</v>

2738
02:01:15.150 --> 02:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Interesting that we don't realize we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

2739
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:20.960
<v Speaker 1>We didn't observe and learn from what </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2740
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>what did we try to escape and what did </v>
<v Speaker 1>we pull off in trying to escape,</v>

2741
02:01:24.650 --> 02:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>but what we pulled off is the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>startup civilization the world has ever </v>

2742
02:01:29.650 --> 02:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>known from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2743
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a time in human </v>

2744
02:01:35.290 --> 02:01:38.141
<v Speaker 1>history where within 300 years less of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country being formed is become dominant </v>

2745
02:01:39.561 --> 02:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>superpower on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not just in a roman sort of a way,</v>

2746
02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>not in a gang is con sort of a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a truly global way.</v>

2747
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And now we find out is spying on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody as well.</v>

2748
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Has missiles all over the world sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>drones into places where they're not </v>

2749
02:01:56.290 --> 02:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>supposed to invade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we send flying robots to do our dirty</v>

2750
02:01:58.941 --> 02:02:03.941
<v Speaker 1>work for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What mean it's the most insane </v>

2751
02:02:03.941 --> 02:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship or the most insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>government rather shouldn't say </v>

2752
02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of is,</v>

2753
02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most insane.</v>

2754
02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would think of us as,</v>

2755
02:02:09.610 --> 02:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictators dominating them.</v>

2756
02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:13.700
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we occupy a unique space.</v>

2757
02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:15.110
<v Speaker 6>It's really the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2758
02:02:15.111 --> 02:02:20.111
<v Speaker 6>you read about this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pox americana and all that stuff </v>

2759
02:02:20.111 --> 02:02:22.810
<v Speaker 6>like we've imposed a worldwide piece.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I realize I'm using the word peace even </v>

2760
02:02:22.810 --> 02:02:23.750
<v Speaker 6>though there are people dying in certain</v>
<v Speaker 6>areas,</v>

2761
02:02:23.751 --> 02:02:28.751
<v Speaker 6>but it's essentially piece through force</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we've established that and I don't </v>

2762
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:32.510
<v Speaker 6>want to say that that's all bad because </v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's provided a lot of stability</v>

2763
02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:34.910
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of innovation for millions of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2764
02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is all bad,</v>

2765
02:02:36.961 --> 02:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2766
02:02:38.341 --> 02:02:43.341
<v Speaker 1>But What I was going to say is that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have become in this most insane </v>

2767
02:02:43.341 --> 02:02:48.080
<v Speaker 1>empire ever was it was all born out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to escape suppression and we </v>

2768
02:02:48.811 --> 02:02:53.811
<v Speaker 1>tried to establish these parameters that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would avoid suppression in this place </v>

2769
02:02:53.811 --> 02:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>and those parameters allowed people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be free to do a lot of things that </v>

2770
02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:59.900
<v Speaker 1>weren't able to do in other countries to</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

2771
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:03.720
<v Speaker 1>set up homesteads and build houses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking farm and,</v>

2772
02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2773
02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make cities that just don't exist </v>

2774
02:03:09.210 --> 02:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in the fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did New York city arise in,</v>

2775
02:03:10.991 --> 02:03:15.991
<v Speaker 1>in America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rub because it wasn't an another </v>

2776
02:03:15.991 --> 02:03:15.991
<v Speaker 1>fucking country like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When New York city was first formed,</v>

2777
02:03:15.991 --> 02:03:20.721
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing like us and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>flocked here from all over the fucking </v>

2778
02:03:20.721 --> 02:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>planet knowing that this is the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

2779
02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:24.540
<v Speaker 1>This is where my pArents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents family came from.</v>

2780
02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.720
<v Speaker 1>They all came from Italy and they came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Ireland where it sucked and they </v>

2781
02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:33.411
<v Speaker 1>got on boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know what the fuck was </v>

2782
02:03:33.411 --> 02:03:33.480
<v Speaker 1>on the other end because there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet back then and they just fucking</v>

2783
02:03:33.481 --> 02:03:38.481
<v Speaker 1>took a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those gangster mother fuckers </v>

2784
02:03:38.481 --> 02:03:40.080
<v Speaker 1>created this incredible place where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to escape a shit life.</v>

2785
02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:42.840
<v Speaker 1>So What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shut up this life too.</v>

2786
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.530
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2787
02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:48.540
<v Speaker 1>we impose the same bullshit that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared of or they were scared of when </v>

2788
02:03:49.771 --> 02:03:52.650
<v Speaker 1>they formed America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just fucking ignore it.</v>

2789
02:03:52.770 --> 02:03:57.770
<v Speaker 1>We ignore what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our founding fathers warned us </v>

2790
02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:57.770
<v Speaker 1>about and we think we're smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2791
02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2792
02:03:58.171 --> 02:04:00.360
<v Speaker 1>it benefits me if I take away the fourth</v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment.</v>

2793
02:04:00.361 --> 02:04:05.361
<v Speaker 1>So fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just some fat guy who eats meat and </v>

2794
02:04:05.361 --> 02:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>takes prozac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've decided I'm going to change the</v>

2795
02:04:06.451 --> 02:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

2796
02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:11.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is kind of funny that we've in some </v>

2797
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 6>ways become what we run from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like that greek myth where the king</v>

2798
02:04:14.630 --> 02:04:19.630
<v Speaker 6>is given the prophecy that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his son one day will grow up to kill </v>

2799
02:04:19.630 --> 02:04:22.340
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so he exiles his son to some distant</v>

2800
02:04:22.341 --> 02:04:24.410
<v Speaker 6>land.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in so doing,</v>

2801
02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:28.100
<v Speaker 6>he eventually assures his own death </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're in a battle or something</v>

2802
02:04:28.101 --> 02:04:30.950
<v Speaker 6>and the sun kills his father not </v>
<v Speaker 6>realizing that it's his father.</v>

2803
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:33.740
<v Speaker 6>And if he had actually just lived in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>kingdom for his whole life,</v>

2804
02:04:33.741 --> 02:04:38.741
<v Speaker 6>he of course would not kill his own dad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was that very action of to </v>

2805
02:04:38.741 --> 02:04:38.741
<v Speaker 6>prevent his</v>

2806
02:04:38.741 --> 02:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>fate that made it occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2807
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:42.840
<v Speaker 1>creating enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating enemies out of fear,</v>

2808
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:48.470
<v Speaker 1>being afraid of people so you create an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy and then you create someone that </v>

2809
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>you should be afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now and now we're drawing people and</v>

2810
02:04:49.621 --> 02:04:53.670
<v Speaker 1>creating new enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just droning people,</v>

2811
02:04:53.671 --> 02:04:58.671
<v Speaker 1>but the latest revelation that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just droning people what we're using </v>

2812
02:04:58.671 --> 02:05:02.481
<v Speaker 1>metadata to find out where their phones </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and sending missiles to where their </v>

2813
02:05:02.481 --> 02:05:06.471
<v Speaker 1>phones are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it's been absolutely </v>

2814
02:05:06.471 --> 02:05:09.621
<v Speaker 1>shown that al qaeda and the taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they switched sim cards back and forth </v>

2815
02:05:10.441 --> 02:05:15.441
<v Speaker 1>and move them around all the time so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people can't clock where the phone </v>

2816
02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:16.560
<v Speaker 1>is connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it connected to this?</v>

2817
02:05:16.561 --> 02:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>AlgerIa guy is connected to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>halloween because who knows?</v>

2818
02:05:20.710 --> 02:05:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking sim cards floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2819
02:05:22.201 --> 02:05:27.201
<v Speaker 1>Who knows who's got what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they decide that it's okay to shoot </v>

2820
02:05:27.201 --> 02:05:28.260
<v Speaker 1>missiles to where the phone is.</v>

2821
02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2822
02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:33.330
<v Speaker 1>That's some incredibly evil shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely evil.</v>

2823
02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:38.610
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's more important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill this guy than it is to not kill all</v>

2824
02:05:38.611 --> 02:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>the innocent people around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2825
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:44.130
<v Speaker 1>They probably turned on his camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>though in there listening first,</v>

2826
02:05:44.131 --> 02:05:44.670
<v Speaker 1>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2827
02:05:44.671 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

2828
02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:47.220
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could hear his voice.</v>

2829
02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Not according to the nsa documents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any of the cooperating </v>

2830
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>evidence outside of the metadata.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2831
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:55.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just knew where the phone was.</v>

2832
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Sent a rocket there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll pull them.</v>

2833
02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:01.500
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of these guys also use </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones that you can take the.</v>

2834
02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't have cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't use phones that have </v>

2835
02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>batteries in them that you can't take </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2836
02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Like they never use iphone or like htc </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

2837
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:13.740
<v Speaker 1>They use phones where you could always </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the battery out because the nsa and</v>

2838
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:14.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2839
02:06:14.490 --> 02:06:15.870
<v Speaker 1>covering organizations fill in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blank,</v>

2840
02:06:15.871 --> 02:06:20.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mossad plucking the [inaudible] or </v>

2841
02:06:20.871 --> 02:06:20.871
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2842
02:06:20.871 --> 02:06:23.550
<v Speaker 1>They all at this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a bad guy,</v>

2843
02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:25.770
<v Speaker 1>they have the capability of listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your phone calls.</v>

2844
02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>They also have the capability of turning</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your cameras so they use specific </v>

2845
02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:34.581
<v Speaker 1>phones that don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also you could remove batteries so they </v>

2846
02:06:34.581 --> 02:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>don't have a power source and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2847
02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:37.890
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll cover their phone cameras,</v>

2848
02:06:37.891 --> 02:06:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the front facing camera and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other shit too.</v>

2849
02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2850
02:06:40.621 --> 02:06:43.290
<v Speaker 1>they work around all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

2851
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:48.270
<v Speaker 1>they're not stupid to what technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows the enemy or their enemy to do,</v>

2852
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metadata thing is just so crazy.</v>

2853
02:06:51.631 --> 02:06:56.631
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you found out where the </v>

2854
02:06:56.631 --> 02:06:58.251
<v Speaker 1>phone is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you send a missile to where that </v>

2855
02:06:58.251 --> 02:06:58.251
<v Speaker 1>phone is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2856
02:06:58.251 --> 02:06:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I could sort of kind of see if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2857
02:06:59.501 --> 02:07:00.420
<v Speaker 1>this was your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2858
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's godzilla and godzilla's phone is.</v>

2859
02:07:04.010 --> 02:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2860
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd say just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be sure to send a missile that </v>

2861
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:12.471
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have trouble believing that </v>

2862
02:07:12.471 --> 02:07:13.020
<v Speaker 1>they're just killing people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metadata because uh,</v>

2863
02:07:13.110 --> 02:07:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I would like to think that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody within these agencies who's </v>

2864
02:07:18.110 --> 02:07:18.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

2865
02:07:18.110 --> 02:07:21.591
<v Speaker 1>we got to actually have some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>probable cause here before we end </v>

2866
02:07:21.591 --> 02:07:22.740
<v Speaker 1>somebody's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2867
02:07:22.741 --> 02:07:27.741
<v Speaker 1>It wOuld be nice to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the issue is that you're dealing </v>

2868
02:07:27.741 --> 02:07:30.621
<v Speaker 1>with people who are so accustomed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>making decisions that cost people </v>

2869
02:07:30.621 --> 02:07:30.621
<v Speaker 1>millions of lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2870
02:07:30.621 --> 02:07:32.970
<v Speaker 1>or you knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over course of time,</v>

2871
02:07:32.971 --> 02:07:34.620
<v Speaker 1>millions of lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of lives,</v>

2872
02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:35.950
<v Speaker 1>dozens of lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2873
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.980
<v Speaker 1>the loss of life there are so accustomed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to making those decisions.</v>

2874
02:07:39.550 --> 02:07:41.020
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that came out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2875
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>the wikileaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so disturbing was the collateral </v>

2876
02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:49.681
<v Speaker 1>murder video where they were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about shooting those missiles into the </v>

2877
02:07:50.711 --> 02:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>van and that there were children there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the guy was like,</v>

2878
02:07:54.341 --> 02:07:54.930
<v Speaker 1>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2879
02:07:54.931 --> 02:07:57.490
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't have brought their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

2880
02:07:57.550 --> 02:07:58.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

2881
02:07:58.140 --> 02:08:03.140
<v Speaker 6>I that wiki leaks is another example </v>
<v Speaker 6>where if they had just come out on day </v>

2882
02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:03.140
<v Speaker 6>one and said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2883
02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:07.330
<v Speaker 6>this organization has a surface,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some shit that is really unacceptable,</v>

2884
02:08:07.690 --> 02:08:12.690
<v Speaker 6>we're going to investigate it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to make sure it doesn't </v>

2885
02:08:12.690 --> 02:08:12.690
<v Speaker 6>happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you very much.</v>

2886
02:08:12.690 --> 02:08:14.470
<v Speaker 6>That would have been the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This whole thing with julian assange and</v>

2887
02:08:14.471 --> 02:08:17.470
<v Speaker 6>the embassy and wiki leaks becoming this</v>
<v Speaker 6>globally prominent,</v>

2888
02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:20.920
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this alternative media organization</v>

2889
02:08:21.130 --> 02:08:24.040
<v Speaker 6>would not have happened at all if the us</v>
<v Speaker 6>government on day one and just said,</v>

2890
02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:29.160
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thanks for bringing this stuff to our </v>

2891
02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:29.160
<v Speaker 6>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It will not happen again.</v>

2892
02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:29.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2893
02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:29.370
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want it to not happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2894
02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to continue happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to make sure that </v>

2895
02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

2896
02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.210
<v Speaker 6>in the age of the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't just crack down on something </v>

2897
02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:37.310
<v Speaker 6>like wiki leaks so that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>noticing,</v>

2898
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.880
<v Speaker 1>well now they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now they know.</v>

2899
02:08:40.150 --> 02:08:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Now they know because of that and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know because of snowden.</v>

2900
02:08:42.401 --> 02:08:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean now they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was uncharted territory,</v>

2901
02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>but the point I was making is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2902
02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:52.260
<v Speaker 1>saying that they wouldn't shoot missiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where the metadata is because they're</v>

2903
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:54.670
<v Speaker 1>worried about innocent civilians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>

2904
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Will you clearly look at that video and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

2905
02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>at least in this certain circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a very flippant attitude about </v>

2906
02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>the loss of collateralized collateral </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage and it's children.</v>

2907
02:09:05.621 --> 02:09:07.280
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about I shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought their kids like,</v>

2908
02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:08.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2909
02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that where we're at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the good guys and they shouldn't </v>

2910
02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:13.960
<v Speaker 1>have brought their kids and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the attitude.</v>

2911
02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Not all my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we kill kids.</v>

2912
02:09:15.730 --> 02:09:17.980
<v Speaker 1>There's not that attitude that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty indigenized.</v>

2913
02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably dehumanized and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk about innocent.</v>

2914
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one more innocent than </v>

2915
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't choose to be there.</v>

2916
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:28.900
<v Speaker 1>They didn't choose to be born there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't choose to have those parents</v>

2917
02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:34.020
<v Speaker 1>that didn't choose to be led by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tiny hands into the fucking car </v>

2918
02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:37.111
<v Speaker 1>seat in the van.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going to shoot with </v>

2919
02:09:37.111 --> 02:09:37.570
<v Speaker 1>hellfire missiles because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought a reporter was an assassin.</v>

2920
02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:38.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2921
02:09:38.591 --> 02:09:41.020
<v Speaker 1>it's all a mistake and their attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2922
02:09:41.230 --> 02:09:42.550
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have brought their kids.</v>

2923
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:48.270
<v Speaker 1>That leads me to believe that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there in the world who are </v>

2924
02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:48.490
<v Speaker 1>willing to shoot missiles to where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone is.</v>

2925
02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so weird that with Vietnam they </v>

2926
02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:57.751
<v Speaker 6>went through all this stuff like the </v>
<v Speaker 6>slow realization that we're maybe not </v>

2927
02:09:57.751 --> 02:10:01.651
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be there and that innocent </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are being killed and there's no </v>

2928
02:10:01.651 --> 02:10:05.461
<v Speaker 6>purpose for this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we came to that realization with </v>

2929
02:10:05.461 --> 02:10:08.371
<v Speaker 6>Vietnam and it seems like a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same stuff is happening now and we're </v>

2930
02:10:08.371 --> 02:10:11.761
<v Speaker 6>going through the same bullshit where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to listen to people on tv tell </v>

2931
02:10:11.761 --> 02:10:11.761
<v Speaker 6>you that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2932
02:10:11.761 --> 02:10:13.090
<v Speaker 6>we got to support the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't question anything.</v>

2933
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:18.390
<v Speaker 6>We've already been there like that all </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened in the Vietnam war and then </v>

2934
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:21.061
<v Speaker 6>eventually people just fell out of that </v>
<v Speaker 6>narrative and they realized it was </v>

2935
02:10:21.061 --> 02:10:24.181
<v Speaker 6>bullshit and now today it's still </v>
<v Speaker 6>considered something where you can't </v>

2936
02:10:24.181 --> 02:10:24.181
<v Speaker 6>just say that the wars are complete </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit.</v>

2937
02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best story about all this or the </v>

2938
02:10:29.250 --> 02:10:31.620
<v Speaker 1>most ridiculous but yet true is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>both the Vietnam war and the Afghanistan</v>

2939
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big part of what's going on,</v>

2940
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:37.550
<v Speaker 1>is it profiting familial drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the heroin,</v>

2941
02:10:37.570 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2942
02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin.</v>

2943
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:42.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a big part of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in Vietnam.</v>

2944
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:45.200
<v Speaker 1>It was a big part of the whole golden </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle.</v>

2945
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a big.</v>

2946
02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:51.420
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money that was moved in </v>

2947
02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:53.810
<v Speaker 1>heroin during the Vietnam era is </v>
<v Speaker 1>documented.</v>

2948
02:10:53.811 --> 02:10:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's documented that there were soldiers</v>

2949
02:10:55.761 --> 02:10:56.990
<v Speaker 1>that were involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were profiting.</v>

2950
02:10:57.190 --> 02:11:00.200
<v Speaker 1>What was that movie with denzel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington where he,</v>

2951
02:11:00.201 --> 02:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he played a famous drug dealer that went</v>

2952
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:04.640
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2953
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:09.750
<v Speaker 1>to China and was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a friend or one of his buddies </v>

2954
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:12.370
<v Speaker 1>was a Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a soldier and they were,</v>

2955
02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:15.780
<v Speaker 1>they were based on a true story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how uh,</v>

2956
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:18.140
<v Speaker 1>he became a big time drug dealer.</v>

2957
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:20.570
<v Speaker 1>American gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:11:20.571 --> 02:11:22.730
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great fucking movie.</v>

2959
02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I saw that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was much like,</v>

2960
02:11:24.531 --> 02:11:26.810
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in Afghanistan now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2961
02:11:26.811 --> 02:11:28.850
<v Speaker 1>if you brought it up back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2962
02:11:28.851 --> 02:11:33.851
<v Speaker 1>a big reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big motivation for the Vietnam war is </v>

2963
02:11:33.851 --> 02:11:33.851
<v Speaker 1>a secret drug running organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

2964
02:11:33.851 --> 02:11:35.110
<v Speaker 1>get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking crack pot.</v>

2965
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:38.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing they say today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today it's even more blatant in your</v>

2966
02:11:38.661 --> 02:11:43.661
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When geraldo rivera is interviewing </v>

2967
02:11:43.661 --> 02:11:43.820
<v Speaker 1>troops that are guarding poppy fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2968
02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2969
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.810
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2970
02:11:44.811 --> 02:11:45.140
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2971
02:11:45.141 --> 02:11:45.440
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

2972
02:11:45.450 --> 02:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2973
02:11:45.751 --> 02:11:46.030
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2974
02:11:46.031 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2975
02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need the information from these </v>

2976
02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:54.131
<v Speaker 1>people and where the taliban is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to guard their poppy </v>

2977
02:11:54.131 --> 02:11:54.131
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2978
02:11:54.131 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2979
02:11:54.290 --> 02:11:55.640
<v Speaker 1>No one's making any money off this </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2980
02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:57.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2981
02:11:57.420 --> 02:12:02.420
<v Speaker 1>The fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever it is that's profiting on </v>

2982
02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:04.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever by whatever method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever avenue they're profiting,</v>

2983
02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:06.770
<v Speaker 1>they find some sort of a Justification </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

2984
02:12:06.771 --> 02:12:07.820
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake about it.</v>

2985
02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Part of the motivation and why we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is that money that has a factor.</v>

2986
02:12:11.541 --> 02:12:16.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what factor it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it more or less valuable than the </v>

2987
02:12:16.541 --> 02:12:17.330
<v Speaker 1>trillions of dollars in minerals they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have discovered?</v>

2988
02:12:17.570 --> 02:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Is it more or less valuable than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas at that Russia and the </v>

2989
02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>United States were duking it out over </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the time of the mujahideen is,</v>

2990
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:27.080
<v Speaker 1>is it more or less?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2991
02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:29.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unquestionably a factor.</v>

2992
02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:33.710
<v Speaker 1>The amount of heroin production in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan since he knew us occupation,</v>

2993
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:37.610
<v Speaker 1>is that like 90 percent or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy through the roof.</v>

2994
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:40.430
<v Speaker 1>So this is just the unreported,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sister story.</v>

2995
02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It's facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2996
02:12:41.721 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 1>these are facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone cold.</v>

2997
02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:44.960
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I say unreported,</v>

2998
02:12:45.010 --> 02:12:47.050
<v Speaker 6>not saying that this shit's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I'm saying is like,</v>

2999
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:52.090
<v Speaker 6>this is the stuff that people don't see </v>
<v Speaker 6>on fox and friends exactly is the poppy </v>

3000
02:12:52.090 --> 02:12:52.090
<v Speaker 6>fields.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3001
02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:58.480
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of interesting that we watch </v>
<v Speaker 6>fox or msnbc and some kind of academic.</v>

3002
02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.120
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll talk about obama's performance is </v>

3003
02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:07.390
<v Speaker 6>if obama is just this country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a politician who we can just sit there </v>

3004
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:09.650
<v Speaker 6>and review him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's really this incredibly powerful</v>

3005
02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:12.530
<v Speaker 6>near emperor of what you just talked </v>
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

3006
02:13:12.531 --> 02:13:17.531
<v Speaker 6>this technological and military empire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's kind of absurd I think for </v>

3007
02:13:17.531 --> 02:13:20.600
<v Speaker 6>us to still think that he's this </v>
<v Speaker 6>constitutionally bound president.</v>

3008
02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:22.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's spying on all these people.</v>

3009
02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:24.860
<v Speaker 6>We've got military actions all over the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

3010
02:13:24.861 --> 02:13:29.240
<v Speaker 6>Like we need to consider the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we are not living in a pre nine slash 11</v>

3011
02:13:29.241 --> 02:13:29.900
<v Speaker 6>world anymore.</v>

3012
02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3013
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:32.670
<v Speaker 1>opium production,</v>

3014
02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:37.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ramped up 49 percent from 2012.</v>

3015
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:42.090
<v Speaker 2>It goes up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just going up and up.</v>

3016
02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like the business to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3017
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:46.870
<v Speaker 2>It's way better than bitcoin right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To bitcoin into poppy seeds,</v>

3018
02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:47.260
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3019
02:13:47.290 --> 02:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

3020
02:13:48.571 --> 02:13:50.750
<v Speaker 2>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if just google the,</v>

3021
02:13:50.751 --> 02:13:52.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount that heroin has,</v>

3022
02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:56.310
<v Speaker 2>has jumped up 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

3023
02:13:56.311 --> 02:14:01.311
<v Speaker 2>it's up by 50 percent in the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the most recent january of 2014.</v>

3024
02:14:02.770 --> 02:14:04.180
<v Speaker 2>That's from newsweek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

3025
02:14:04.190 --> 02:14:09.190
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that from news week their </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug output is up 50 percent in the last</v>

3026
02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:13.530
<v Speaker 2>year and since the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since the american takeover,</v>

3027
02:14:13.531 --> 02:14:17.820
<v Speaker 2>since american occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me google that american occupation,</v>

3028
02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:21.780
<v Speaker 2>it's full or that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some nutty number.</v>

3029
02:14:23.250 --> 02:14:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so sad because it's so </v>

3030
02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:28.250
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so in our face,</v>

3031
02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the world getS better?</v>

3032
02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I think I asked you this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from here I feel like thingS have to</v>

3033
02:14:35.821 --> 02:14:37.230
<v Speaker 2>get better and they're already getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

3034
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:42.270
<v Speaker 2>There are definitely better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think whAt we're getting at </v>

3035
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:45.561
<v Speaker 2>earlier is really important that the yin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the yang is almost necessary in </v>

3036
02:14:45.561 --> 02:14:50.510
<v Speaker 2>order for things to get done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be almost a natural part</v>

3037
02:14:50.641 --> 02:14:55.641
<v Speaker 2>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the greatest time ever </v>

3038
02:14:55.641 --> 02:14:58.221
<v Speaker 2>to be alive or really do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think every time was the greatest </v>

3039
02:14:58.221 --> 02:14:59.250
<v Speaker 2>time ever to be alive at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3040
02:14:59.251 --> 02:15:02.400
<v Speaker 2>just not everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you live in africa right now,</v>

3041
02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:07.610
<v Speaker 2>if you're in Liberia right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucking socks is a sucky time to be </v>

3042
02:15:07.610 --> 02:15:07.670
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3043
02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:12.680
<v Speaker 2>if you live in Somalia and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a pirate because all the europeans </v>

<v Speaker 2>shores and killed all the fish.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Can god's greatest weed sitting here </v>

3059
02:15:57.380 --> 02:16:01.090
<v Speaker 2>using laptops and super powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet connection connected to a </v>

3060
02:16:01.090 --> 02:16:01.620
<v Speaker 2>million people in the world.</v>

3061
02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.330
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an awesome time to be alive.</v>

3062
02:16:03.331 --> 02:16:04.560
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love,</v>

3063
02:16:04.650 --> 02:16:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I love America and I love the internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of the reason why I'm so</v>

3064
02:16:07.561 --> 02:16:11.460
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with all the shit I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that these are really cool tools that</v>

3065
02:16:11.461 --> 02:16:15.480
<v Speaker 2>we've put out into the world and it kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pains me to see us fucking it up.</v>

3066
02:16:15.481 --> 02:16:20.481
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we created the internet and it's </v>

3067
02:16:20.481 --> 02:16:20.481
<v Speaker 2>truly amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a game changer and no,</v>

3068
02:16:20.481 --> 02:16:22.080
<v Speaker 2>now we've weaponized it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the phrase they use,</v>

3069
02:16:22.590 --> 02:16:23.520
<v Speaker 2>you just showed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3070
02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:26.580
<v Speaker 2>where you're using it to harass innocent</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and credit them.</v>

3071
02:16:26.581 --> 02:16:31.581
<v Speaker 2>Ruined their business people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am going to get thIs a million times </v>

3072
02:16:31.581 --> 02:16:35.251
<v Speaker 2>now that I've talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is will aren't companies doing </v>

3073
02:16:35.251 --> 02:16:35.251
<v Speaker 2>that aren't individuals trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3074
02:16:35.251 --> 02:16:39.900
<v Speaker 2>it's really different when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government is using your tax dollars </v>

3075
02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:43.291
<v Speaker 2>that you send them every year and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're using that to psychologically </v>

3076
02:16:43.291 --> 02:16:44.170
<v Speaker 2>harass you or to harass the journalists </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you listened to.</v>

3077
02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:49.440
<v Speaker 2>That's really dIfferent from some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking weirdo doing it are some greedy </v>

3078
02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:51.010
<v Speaker 2>company doing because they want to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect their little domain.</v>

3079
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:53.440
<v Speaker 2>But those companies that do do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're full of shit.</v>

3080
02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:56.460
<v Speaker 2>You should avoid them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're shitty if you,</v>

3081
02:16:56.510 --> 02:16:57.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're saying negative</v>

3082
02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.920
<v Speaker 1>things about the competition and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>making them up and you're trolling and </v>

3083
02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:03.590
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to kill their business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a shithead.</v>

3084
02:17:03.810 --> 02:17:05.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's reality.</v>

3085
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:06.640
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3086
02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing that's been going on with us </v>

3087
02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3088
02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:12.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys that we've had on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast several times,</v>

3089
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:14.450
<v Speaker 1>guy named dave asprey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I don't hate.</v>

3090
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I like the gUy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a good guy.</v>

3091
02:17:16.581 --> 02:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I think he's flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of human beings.</v>

3092
02:17:18.591 --> 02:17:23.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm flawed as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's exaggerated and said some </v>

3093
02:17:23.591 --> 02:17:25.700
<v Speaker 1>things on the show that have turned out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bite us in the ass.</v>

3094
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And I sorta started investigating it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he started making claims about </v>

3095
02:17:31.161 --> 02:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>my friend tate's business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tate started taping him.</v>

3096
02:17:34.431 --> 02:17:35.510
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go into business </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3097
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason they had a falling </v>

3098
02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:41.160
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tate decided to start selling his own</v>

3099
02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:41.160
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

3100
02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Dave asprey sells a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sells a good products,</v>

3101
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:50.830
<v Speaker 1>good coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other different health and </v>

3102
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:50.830
<v Speaker 1>nutrition products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with what he's selling,</v>

3103
02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but he started shooting on tate stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called it inferior quality without </v>

3104
02:17:55.930 --> 02:17:57.380
<v Speaker 1>any testing whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also called it a knock off.</v>

3105
02:17:57.381 --> 02:17:59.420
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about is mct oil that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>sells.</v>

3106
02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem with that.</v>

3107
02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Several problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One problem being that dave asprey </v>

3108
02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:08.711
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He buys it because a company that buy </v>

3109
02:18:08.711 --> 02:18:12.581
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they buy and they sell it to a bunch of </v>

3110
02:18:12.581 --> 02:18:14.441
<v Speaker 1>different companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend larry used to be in the </v>

3111
02:18:14.441 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 1>nutrition business and he was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he owned a company called nature's pure,</v>

3112
02:18:16.061 --> 02:18:21.061
<v Speaker 1>a very good company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he told me exactly how it all works </v>

3113
02:18:21.061 --> 02:18:25.000
<v Speaker 1>and he told me how he buys from the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppliers that all these other people </v>

3114
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:25.100
<v Speaker 1>buy from.</v>

3115
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:30.110
<v Speaker 1>LIke there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only a limited amount of </v>

3116
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:31.811
<v Speaker 1>suppliers that make vitamin d that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>mct or they'll make all these different </v>

3117
02:18:31.811 --> 02:18:32.210
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You buy it from them,</v>

3118
02:18:32.211 --> 02:18:37.211
<v Speaker 1>you try to buy from the most reputable </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplier and then you package it </v>

3119
02:18:37.211 --> 02:18:39.671
<v Speaker 1>yourself and label it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what dave does and that's what </v>

3120
02:18:39.671 --> 02:18:42.480
<v Speaker 1>tate did too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so dave was called tate stuff </v>

3121
02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.030
<v Speaker 1>inferior without any testing whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a propensity for bullshitting and</v>

3122
02:18:44.031 --> 02:18:46.220
<v Speaker 1>so I saw that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that man?</v>

3123
02:18:46.221 --> 02:18:51.221
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say that because I know </v>

3124
02:18:51.221 --> 02:18:51.221
<v Speaker 1>where you get your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the company that makes your stuff</v>

3125
02:18:51.221 --> 02:18:53.540
<v Speaker 1>so you can't just say that his stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferior.</v>

3126
02:18:53.541 --> 02:18:56.840
<v Speaker 1>We don't know where he buys it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what testing is done.</v>

3127
02:18:56.841 --> 02:18:58.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3128
02:18:58.290 --> 02:19:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I even went out of the way to make his </v>
<v Speaker 1>is mct oil to try to improve what he </v>

3129
02:19:03.290 --> 02:19:07.271
<v Speaker 1>thought dave was doing by selling it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>glass bottles because he felt like </v>

3130
02:19:07.271 --> 02:19:07.271
<v Speaker 1>plastic can leach.</v>

3131
02:19:07.271 --> 02:19:07.960
<v Speaker 1>It can leach chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3132
02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:09.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the heat,</v>

3133
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:10.670
<v Speaker 1>like it's very conscientious the way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

3134
02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>What was not so conscientious with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of copied dave's business model.</v>

3135
02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:18.890
<v Speaker 1>He copied dave's claims about mycotoxins</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these different things,</v>

3136
02:19:19.130 --> 02:19:24.020
<v Speaker 1>so then he goes and tests dave's coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then test his coffee as well.</v>

3137
02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dave's coffee turns out to test positive</v>

3138
02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:31.691
<v Speaker 1>for under threshold below threshold of </v>
<v Speaker 1>two different mycotoxins means you're </v>

3139
02:19:31.691 --> 02:19:33.530
<v Speaker 1>not going to affect you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to physically affect you,</v>

3140
02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:37.160
<v Speaker 1>but his whole claim to fame was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real issue with mycotoxins and</v>

3141
02:19:37.161 --> 02:19:39.590
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's developed a process that elIminates</v>

3142
02:19:39.591 --> 02:19:41.420
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every other coffee could be tainted.</v>

3143
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:44.180
<v Speaker 1>That was his number one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like classic government shit,</v>

3144
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:46.460
<v Speaker 1>create a problem and then offer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

3145
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So I know parrot his words not doing any</v>
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

3146
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:52.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having them on the podcast.</v>

3147
02:19:52.970 --> 02:19:55.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very knowledgeable.</v>

3148
02:19:55.161 --> 02:20:00.161
<v Speaker 1>It seems so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We repeat is his words about mycotoxins </v>

3149
02:20:00.161 --> 02:20:00.161
<v Speaker 1>and coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tate,</v>

3150
02:20:00.161 --> 02:20:04.900
<v Speaker 1>when he does this test and finds out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dave stuff actually has mycotoxins and </v>

3151
02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:08.861
<v Speaker 1>tate's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has gone through none of this </v>

3152
02:20:08.861 --> 02:20:10.751
<v Speaker 1>super secret process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just done the standard wet </v>

3153
02:20:10.751 --> 02:20:13.661
<v Speaker 1>processing that all high level single </v>
<v Speaker 1>source coffee companies do take,</v>

3154
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:15.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3155
02:20:15.141 --> 02:20:16.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man,</v>

3156
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:19.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's shit has some mycotoxins mind</v>

3157
02:20:19.431 --> 02:20:21.800
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like w w what exactly is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on here?</v>

3158
02:20:21.890 --> 02:20:26.890
<v Speaker 1>So we sell his coffee at on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sell the bulletproof coffee or </v>

3159
02:20:26.890 --> 02:20:27.410
<v Speaker 1>upgraded coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asprey's coughing.</v>

3160
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:32.650
<v Speaker 1>So we decided to test that and tate's </v>
<v Speaker 1>and starbucks and some random coffee </v>

3161
02:20:34.251 --> 02:20:39.251
<v Speaker 1>from whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them test positive for </v>

3162
02:20:39.251 --> 02:20:43.301
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an instant issue that's not </v>

3163
02:20:43.301 --> 02:20:44.570
<v Speaker 1>really presents an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've been parenting it and,</v>

3164
02:20:44.571 --> 02:20:49.571
<v Speaker 1>and saying that it becomes this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing saying that it's an issue saying </v>

3165
02:20:50.811 --> 02:20:55.811
<v Speaker 1>that it's a huge health issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every coffee expert you read online </v>

3166
02:20:55.811 --> 02:20:56.300
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's bullshit.</v>

3167
02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:57.800
<v Speaker 1>They all think it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3168
02:20:57.801 --> 02:21:00.620
<v Speaker 1>there's like scores that they have for </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

3169
02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:03.170
<v Speaker 1>They have scores like a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

3170
02:21:03.171 --> 02:21:05.750
<v Speaker 1>like rusty's hawaiian that we started </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>

3171
02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:08.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good stuff and it's scored</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a 95.</v>

3172
02:21:08.721 --> 02:21:10.520
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3173
02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:14.120
<v Speaker 1>And in order to score high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they test your stuff from mold.</v>

3174
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Like they test it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3175
02:21:15.970 --> 02:21:16.410
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3176
02:21:16.460 --> 02:21:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't have moldy coffee and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>test high.</v>

3177
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:21.710
<v Speaker 1>So iT's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not an issue.</v>

3178
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:24.230
<v Speaker 1>This isn't an issue that was existing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties.</v>

3179
02:21:24.231 --> 02:21:27.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a pub med or article from 1980 </v>
<v Speaker 1>about mycotoxins.</v>

3180
02:21:27.891 --> 02:21:32.891
<v Speaker 1>So people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't dying or chopping other </v>

3181
02:21:32.891 --> 02:21:33.170
<v Speaker 1>people's faces off a bunch of other shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3182
02:21:33.171 --> 02:21:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Like it causes coffee to be bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case.</v>

3183
02:21:35.661 --> 02:21:37.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of.</v>

3184
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So my point is this all started his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his whole downfall started because he </v>

3185
02:21:43.491 --> 02:21:46.430
<v Speaker 1>was making false claims to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate competition.</v>

3186
02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.280
<v Speaker 1>he was doing exactly what we're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies shouldn't do,</v>

3187
02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:51.560
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't shit on someone to eliminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

3188
02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Now if aspe came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3189
02:21:53.181 --> 02:21:58.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of fucked up to tate </v>

3190
02:21:58.181 --> 02:21:59.150
<v Speaker 1>is basically copying my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my claims about mycotoxins,</v>

3191
02:21:59.151 --> 02:22:01.310
<v Speaker 1>which by the way aren't true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he would have a point,</v>

3192
02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:02.290
<v Speaker 1>but it would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3193
02:22:02.291 --> 02:22:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you take the copy of my lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3194
02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's basically what he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to say because other than that,</v>

3195
02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>there's not really case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

3196
02:22:10.041 --> 02:22:15.041
<v Speaker 1>it's just the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coffee equivalent of a root beer </v>

3197
02:22:15.041 --> 02:22:16.310
<v Speaker 1>float,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is coffee with butter and mct oil,</v>

3198
02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:19.460
<v Speaker 1>which then it turns out that wasn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked his idea.</v>

3199
02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy named rob wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another guy we've had on the podcast,</v>

3200
02:22:22.551 --> 02:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the paleo gurus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote about it in 2004,</v>

3201
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.220
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't asked for idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea had been out there.</v>

3202
02:22:29.221 --> 02:22:32.250
<v Speaker 3>He collects these ideas and that's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that rhonda patrick,</v>

3203
02:22:32.251 --> 02:22:37.251
<v Speaker 3>who was on last week because a phd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said that after he put some shit on </v>

3204
02:22:37.251 --> 02:22:40.620
<v Speaker 3>his website from her scientific research</v>
<v Speaker 3>with vitamin d and didn't accreditor,</v>

3205
02:22:41.220 --> 02:22:43.620
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of that going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3206
02:22:43.650 --> 02:22:47.690
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people discrediting people sang</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty things about being a know.</v>

3207
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:53.000
<v Speaker 3>It all comes back to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all comes back because if you're </v>

3208
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
<v Speaker 3>saying false claims about someone like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3209
02:22:54.001 --> 02:22:59.001
<v Speaker 3>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're just randomly deciding that </v>

3210
02:22:59.001 --> 02:23:01.431
<v Speaker 3>someone's stuff is shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then they get to test your stuff </v>

3211
02:23:01.431 --> 02:23:01.431
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3212
02:23:01.431 --> 02:23:02.520
<v Speaker 3>and if it turns out that your whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>process is bullshit,</v>

3213
02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:06.810
<v Speaker 3>that all this unnecessary nonsense or </v>
<v Speaker 3>voodoo you're doing to your,</v>

3214
02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:11.811
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your process to make sure that your </v>

3215
02:23:11.811 --> 02:23:14.031
<v Speaker 3>stuff is better than everybody else's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't actually work is actually </v>

3216
02:23:14.031 --> 02:23:14.400
<v Speaker 3>real and the problem doesn't actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>

3217
02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:19.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you shouldn't throw stones if </v>

3218
02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:19.440
<v Speaker 6>you're in the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The glass house.</v>

3219
02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:20.880
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would have never tested his coffee.</v>

3220
02:23:21.150 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 3>We would have thought that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably still an issue.</v>

3221
02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:26.430
<v Speaker 3>You can find things online about </v>
<v Speaker 3>mycotoxins in coffee,</v>

3222
02:23:26.431 --> 02:23:31.431
<v Speaker 3>been an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently they figured it out in </v>

3223
02:23:31.431 --> 02:23:34.761
<v Speaker 3>like the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wet processing they figured out so </v>

3224
02:23:34.761 --> 02:23:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it puts us in a real bad position </v>

3225
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.990
<v Speaker 3>because we've said what this guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we repeated it on this podcast.</v>

3226
02:23:39.991 --> 02:23:42.420
<v Speaker 3>I've repeated it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a bad product.</v>

3227
02:23:42.421 --> 02:23:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sells his good stuff.</v>

3228
02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Don't make any mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

3229
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:49.390
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not by dave as that's not his style.</v>

3230
02:23:49.430 --> 02:23:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Know that is a hawaiian roasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a different one,</v>

3231
02:23:52.621 --> 02:23:54.960
<v Speaker 3>or it's caveman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that cayman or hawaiian roasters,</v>

3232
02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:57.750
<v Speaker 3>hawaiian roasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we have no affiliation with.</v>

3233
02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Cave man is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend hates coffee.</v>

3234
02:24:00.061 --> 02:24:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I have no business interest in that.</v>

3235
02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:03.230
<v Speaker 3>He's just my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3236
02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:08.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually have a business interest in </v>

3237
02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:10.341
<v Speaker 3>selling asprey's coffee because I own a </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of art and I sell it through on </v>

3238
02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:10.341
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

3239
02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:15.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to be honest always about </v>

3240
02:24:15.141 --> 02:24:15.160
<v Speaker 3>everything and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have like,</v>

3241
02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:20.420
<v Speaker 3>it would be profitable for me to not </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about this because we sell his </v>

3242
02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:21.510
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not ethical.</v>

3243
02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

3244
02:24:22.651 --> 02:24:24.970
<v Speaker 3>it's good coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with it.</v>

3245
02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:28.020
<v Speaker 3>People caffeinated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is necessary.</v>

3246
02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.310
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3247
02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:31.200
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he buys very good coffee.</v>

3248
02:24:31.201 --> 02:24:36.201
<v Speaker 3>He sells very good coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's absolutely nothing wrong with </v>

3249
02:24:36.201 --> 02:24:36.201
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other,</v>

3250
02:24:36.201 --> 02:24:39.411
<v Speaker 3>the claims were unnecessary and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>claims created a business and they </v>

3251
02:24:39.411 --> 02:24:39.760
<v Speaker 3>created a model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They created this,</v>

3252
02:24:39.761 --> 02:24:42.510
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this issue that doesn't seem to exist,</v>

3253
02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:45.420
<v Speaker 3>but why did it all come out to light?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What all came to light?</v>

3254
02:24:45.421 --> 02:24:50.421
<v Speaker 3>Because there was unfair claims about </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that he thought was a </v>

3255
02:24:50.421 --> 02:24:50.421
<v Speaker 3>competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3256
02:24:50.421 --> 02:24:55.161
<v Speaker 3>and that's that country shit that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government is encouraging their </v>

3257
02:24:55.161 --> 02:24:59.991
<v Speaker 3>employees to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to discredit people is what discredits </v>

3258
02:24:59.991 --> 02:24:59.991
<v Speaker 3>the government when something like that.</v>

3259
02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:04.510
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like the perfect way of </v>

3260
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:04.510
<v Speaker 6>expressing what I was trying to get at </v>
<v Speaker 6>earlier.</v>

3261
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:07.460
<v Speaker 6>This idea of you're the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>government and you're the us president.</v>

3262
02:25:07.690 --> 02:25:08.300
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't,</v>

3263
02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:13.390
<v Speaker 6>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't lower yourself to this level </v>

3264
02:25:13.390 --> 02:25:13.950
<v Speaker 6>where you're competing with snowden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a back and forth.</v>

3265
02:25:13.951 --> 02:25:16.310
<v Speaker 6>That should be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We fucked up where the government,</v>

3266
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:18.090
<v Speaker 6>we're going to correct it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3267
02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:20.040
<v Speaker 6>Everybody would honor that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The same with wikileaks.</v>

3268
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 6>The same with guantanamo bay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we went overboard with some </v>

3269
02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:28.111
<v Speaker 6>interrogation stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We detained some people against their </v>

3270
02:25:28.111 --> 02:25:28.111
<v Speaker 6>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their basiC rights.</v>

3271
02:25:28.111 --> 02:25:30.820
<v Speaker 6>We did this because we were panicked and</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't want another nine slash 11 and</v>

3272
02:25:30.821 --> 02:25:35.821
<v Speaker 6>now we'll take steps to correct it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's not what they're saying and </v>

3273
02:25:35.821 --> 02:25:35.821
<v Speaker 6>that's not what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's really,</v>

3274
02:25:35.821 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 6>I think all anybody wants to hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of rhetoric from here on out,</v>

3275
02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 6>which is we recognize there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've never fucking Said that,</v>

3276
02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:47.300
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>obama as many positive things is that I </v>

3277
02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:50.311
<v Speaker 6>can say about obama as I grow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to just learn more about the world and </v>

3278
02:25:50.311 --> 02:25:54.061
<v Speaker 6>realize that he's not this evil dictator</v>
<v Speaker 6>that info wars makes them out to be it's</v>

3279
02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:55.600
<v Speaker 6>more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Picture.</v>

3280
02:25:56.050 --> 02:25:58.930
<v Speaker 6>With thAt said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he still has not come out and said,</v>

3281
02:25:59.590 --> 02:26:04.590
<v Speaker 6>it's clear at this point the nsa has </v>
<v Speaker 6>done some stuff that is not within the </v>

3282
02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:07.591
<v Speaker 6>bounds of our laws and we'll fix that </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's all he'd have to do and it'd </v>

3283
02:26:07.591 --> 02:26:07.591
<v Speaker 6>be</v>

3284
02:26:07.591 --> 02:26:10.510
<v Speaker 1>close to the most people would demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does fix that mean?</v>

3285
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:15.630
<v Speaker 1>The most have locked about clamping down</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it now and those people will be okay </v>

3286
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:20.191
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're always gonna have this </v>

3287
02:26:20.191 --> 02:26:20.191
<v Speaker 1>symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3288
02:26:20.191 --> 02:26:20.191
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean you would be okay</v>

3289
02:26:20.191 --> 02:26:22.520
<v Speaker 6>if I honestly believed that obama was </v>
<v Speaker 6>fixing the problem in a meaningful way?</v>

3290
02:26:22.521 --> 02:26:26.120
<v Speaker 6>I'd be okay with it because I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 6>busy and I don't want to nitpick.</v>

3291
02:26:26.121 --> 02:26:31.121
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd rather see us move forward as a </v>

3292
02:26:31.121 --> 02:26:33.491
<v Speaker 6>country and not continue to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can go after anything until the end </v>

3293
02:26:33.491 --> 02:26:38.350
<v Speaker 6>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are some really big innovations </v>

3294
02:26:38.350 --> 02:26:40.091
<v Speaker 6>ahead of us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think where we might go into a big </v>

3295
02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:40.100
<v Speaker 6>economic boom in the next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The bitcoin thing,</v>

3296
02:26:40.101 --> 02:26:42.920
<v Speaker 6>even if bitcoin goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something very similar to it is going to</v>

3297
02:26:42.921 --> 02:26:47.921
<v Speaker 6>take off and these are exciting things </v>
<v Speaker 6>like we're on the verge of another big </v>

3298
02:26:47.921 --> 02:26:48.680
<v Speaker 6>tech boom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we were in the nineties.</v>

3299
02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:53.920
<v Speaker 6>We shouldn't get bogged down with all </v>
<v Speaker 6>this petty bickering and all this </v>

3300
02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:54.110
<v Speaker 6>hateful stuff and red vs blue and</v>

3301
02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:56.210
<v Speaker 1>petty at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's critical.</v>

3302
02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a sign of the times and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's indicative of this new </v>

3303
02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:03.560
<v Speaker 1>environment that we find ourselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new environment.</v>

3304
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:05.380
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean the issues are petty.</v>

3305
02:27:05.381 --> 02:27:07.810
<v Speaker 6>I mean the government back and forth is </v>
<v Speaker 6>petty.</v>

3306
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:12.990
<v Speaker 6>It's very petty to like force an </v>
<v Speaker 6>airplane to the ground to search for </v>

3307
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:12.990
<v Speaker 6>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not,</v>

3308
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:14.800
<v Speaker 6>this is the most powerful government,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the world you shouldn't behave like.</v>

3309
02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely agree with that.</v>

3310
02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what's going on,</v>

3311
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we're talking about that,</v>

3312
02:27:20.821 --> 02:27:21.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3313
02:27:21.490 --> 02:27:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the coffee thing or whether we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the government thing or </v>

3314
02:27:26.490 --> 02:27:29.611
<v Speaker 1>the talk about virtually anything is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't expect to get away with business </v>

3315
02:27:31.471 --> 02:27:36.471
<v Speaker 1>as usual because there's too much that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets exposed now because of the </v>

3316
02:27:36.471 --> 02:27:41.421
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you do evil shit and </v>

3317
02:27:41.421 --> 02:27:45.500
<v Speaker 1>other people are aware of that evil shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they could find out about that evil </v>

3318
02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:45.540
<v Speaker 1>shit and put it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3319
02:27:45.580 --> 02:27:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you got to expect that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep these nsa workers silent </v>

3320
02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:51.840
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of them are actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriots.</v>

3321
02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:52.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have,</v>

3322
02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:56.940
<v Speaker 1>they might have gotten a job a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago out of college working for the nsa,</v>

3323
02:27:56.941 --> 02:27:59.250
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't do it because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be a bad guy.</v>

3324
02:27:59.430 --> 02:28:04.430
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do it because they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>spy on their neighbor because their </v>

3325
02:28:04.430 --> 02:28:06.621
<v Speaker 1>neighbor mike just think that the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States should get the fuck out of </v>

3326
02:28:06.621 --> 02:28:06.621
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3327
02:28:06.621 --> 02:28:11.121
<v Speaker 1>tHat's not why they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it because they wanted to keep </v>

3328
02:28:11.121 --> 02:28:13.881
<v Speaker 1>people safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people like that out </v>

3329
02:28:13.881 --> 02:28:15.591
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they find themselves a part of this </v>

3330
02:28:15.591 --> 02:28:17.960
<v Speaker 1>genuinely dangerous organization that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely violating constitutional </v>

3331
02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:20.310
<v Speaker 1>rights and what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take chances.</v>

3332
02:28:20.610 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 1>They take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about that</v>

3333
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.180
<v Speaker 3>william binney guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy?</v>

3334
02:28:23.181 --> 02:28:25.790
<v Speaker 3>That was the first a whistleblower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way,</v>

3335
02:28:25.791 --> 02:28:26.900
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way back in the day.</v>

3336
02:28:26.930 --> 02:28:31.930
<v Speaker 3>That guy had some balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy had some balls and he got away </v>

3337
02:28:31.930 --> 02:28:32.930
<v Speaker 3>with it too because he was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicting a future crime.</v>

3338
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:38.170
<v Speaker 3>He quit and then he predicted a future </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime and then when the future crime </v>

3339
02:28:38.170 --> 02:28:38.840
<v Speaker 3>actually came into manifestation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't.</v>

3340
02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:41.840
<v Speaker 3>it manifested itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like 10 years later.</v>

3341
02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.210
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you stop and think about it.</v>

3342
02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:48.830
<v Speaker 3>This guy called it and he quit the nsa </v>
<v Speaker 3>after 2001 that has amazing.</v>

3343
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

3344
02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.540
<v Speaker 3>He was the original was a whistleblower </v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody talks about that cat,</v>

3345
02:28:53.930 --> 02:28:55.100
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he.</v>

3346
02:28:55.110 --> 02:29:00.110
<v Speaker 3>He's another fucking hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is what you're not </v>

3347
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:00.410
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to do it like that.</v>

3348
02:29:00.620 --> 02:29:02.570
<v Speaker 3>You have an obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the top of the heap,</v>

3349
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:08.230
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's also an impossible job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think trying to govern 300 million </v>

3350
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:09.800
<v Speaker 3>people is impossible and I think you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>get frustrated.</v>

3351
02:29:09.801 --> 02:29:14.801
<v Speaker 3>It's where most come up with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to keep these motherfuckers in </v>

3352
02:29:14.801 --> 02:29:14.801
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>

3353
02:29:14.801 --> 02:29:16.070
<v Speaker 6>That's where my president obama may be </v>
<v Speaker 6>right article comes from,</v>

3354
02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:21.160
<v Speaker 6>is this realization that there are a lot</v>
<v Speaker 6>of people and actually the best </v>

3355
02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:23.780
<v Speaker 6>description of obama that I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this pickup artists who put some</v>

3356
02:29:23.781 --> 02:29:26.660
<v Speaker 6>of his videos on youtube and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 6>all about pickup.</v>

3357
02:29:26.661 --> 02:29:28.880
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them are just about like views </v>
<v Speaker 6>on life.</v>

3358
02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:29.780
<v Speaker 6>Who's this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3359
02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:30.720
<v Speaker 6>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3360
02:29:30.721 --> 02:29:32.360
<v Speaker 6>and cook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He actually lives in la,</v>

3361
02:29:32.361 --> 02:29:34.100
<v Speaker 6>but I've never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3362
02:29:34.101 --> 02:29:35.480
<v Speaker 6>I was watching this video where he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3363
02:29:35.481 --> 02:29:38.300
<v Speaker 6>people aren't really prepared to hear </v>
<v Speaker 6>the truth about obama,</v>

3364
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:42.800
<v Speaker 6>which is that he's kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a principal for this school known as the</v>

3365
02:29:42.801 --> 02:29:47.801
<v Speaker 6>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's just trying to hold shit </v>

3366
02:29:47.801 --> 02:29:47.801
<v Speaker 6>together and people don't want him to go</v>
<v Speaker 6>up on the podium and say,</v>

3367
02:29:47.801 --> 02:29:48.650
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want more jobs?</v>

3368
02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:51.260
<v Speaker 6>You've got to create some innovation </v>
<v Speaker 6>because things are stagnant,</v>

3369
02:29:51.261 --> 02:29:52.700
<v Speaker 6>like you've got to go out there and do </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

3370
02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:57.940
<v Speaker 6>I can't just create things out of thin </v>
<v Speaker 6>air and it's the same with national </v>

3371
02:29:57.940 --> 02:29:58.730
<v Speaker 6>security stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He can't fix everything that people need</v>

3372
02:29:58.731 --> 02:30:00.130
<v Speaker 6>to demand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3373
02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:02.840
<v Speaker 6>protections of their privacy's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not all on him.</v>

3374
02:30:02.841 --> 02:30:04.310
<v Speaker 6>It has to be on the people and I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we,</v>

3375
02:30:04.311 --> 02:30:05.860
<v Speaker 6>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not uni,</v>

3376
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:07.880
<v Speaker 6>not red band,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not most of the listeners,</v>

3377
02:30:07.881 --> 02:30:11.720
<v Speaker 6>but in fucking lazy as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>been focused on other stuff and now it's</v>

3378
02:30:11.721 --> 02:30:13.970
<v Speaker 6>kind of coming back to bite us in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ass.</v>

3379
02:30:13.971 --> 02:30:15.680
<v Speaker 6>So we have to decide like what's </v>
<v Speaker 6>important to us,</v>

3380
02:30:15.681 --> 02:30:20.681
<v Speaker 6>how far are we willing to trade off our </v>
<v Speaker 6>basic rights in exchange for the </v>

3381
02:30:20.721 --> 02:30:22.190
<v Speaker 6>guarantee of no more nine slash 11.</v>

3382
02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3383
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:28.510
<v Speaker 3>or does that even work at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what should we concentrate on when </v>

3384
02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:28.880
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to prevent another nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 11?</v>

3385
02:30:28.881 --> 02:30:33.881
<v Speaker 3>What should we concentrate on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we concentrate on spying on </v>

3386
02:30:33.881 --> 02:30:36.551
<v Speaker 3>americans or should we concentrate on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>non intervention is an interventional </v>

3387
02:30:36.551 --> 02:30:40.871
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy that doesn't cause people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get so fucking pissed off at us that </v>

3388
02:30:40.871 --> 02:30:45.221
<v Speaker 3>they want to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we concentrate on not shooting </v>

3389
02:30:45.221 --> 02:30:47.921
<v Speaker 3>dji drones into apartment buildings </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have a fucking cell phone </v>

3390
02:30:47.921 --> 02:30:48.470
<v Speaker 3>that we want to find the user</v>

3391
02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:50.940
<v Speaker 6>maybe focused on not giving easy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>easy,</v>

3392
02:30:50.941 --> 02:30:55.941
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>immigration rights to fucking Saudi </v>

3393
02:30:55.941 --> 02:30:55.941
<v Speaker 6>Arabia when like all the nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 6>hijackers,</v>

3394
02:30:55.941 --> 02:30:57.450
<v Speaker 6>I believe are from Saudi Arabia or many </v>
<v Speaker 6>of them were.</v>

3395
02:30:57.540 --> 02:31:00.080
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that could be done.</v>

3396
02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:03.860
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is so gigantic.</v>

3397
02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:06.860
<v Speaker 3>The world is so enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are so many people.</v>

3398
02:31:06.861 --> 02:31:09.110
<v Speaker 3>There's so many competing financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>

3399
02:31:09.111 --> 02:31:14.111
<v Speaker 3>There's so much shit going on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for any one group to try to fix it and </v>

3400
02:31:15.531 --> 02:31:18.410
<v Speaker 3>they don't even work together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so fucked up.</v>

3401
02:31:18.411 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 3>The cia and the fbi don't work</v>

3402
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.240
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pete with each other,</v>

3403
02:31:21.241 --> 02:31:22.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's competition.</v>

3404
02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:24.120
<v Speaker 1>WeLl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it portrays got busted.</v>

3405
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:28.140
<v Speaker 1>They got busted because the fucking cia </v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting investigated by the fbi.</v>

3406
02:31:28.450 --> 02:31:30.990
<v Speaker 1>They investigated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portray as the fbi investigated,</v>

3407
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:34.530
<v Speaker 1>portrays the fucking head spook got </v>
<v Speaker 1>spooked on.</v>

3408
02:31:34.770 --> 02:31:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how we got busted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they found out about his </v>

3409
02:31:39.770 --> 02:31:42.261
<v Speaker 1>affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think women is really how he got </v>

3410
02:31:42.261 --> 02:31:44.331
<v Speaker 1>busted though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He allowed his personal life to take </v>

3411
02:31:44.331 --> 02:31:44.331
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3412
02:31:44.331 --> 02:31:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know absolutely nothing about this </v>

3413
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.590
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just from what little I know,</v>

3414
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:52.160
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's not something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have happened if he had remained </v>

3415
02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:54.891
<v Speaker 1>100 percent above board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole investigation that was set </v>

3416
02:31:54.891 --> 02:31:57.000
<v Speaker 1>off by the fbi would have never happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was that woman in tampa,</v>

3417
02:31:57.270 --> 02:32:02.270
<v Speaker 1>the socialite or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who triggered the whole fucking </v>

3418
02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:03.600
<v Speaker 1>unraveling thing and once you unleash </v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of forces,</v>

3419
02:32:03.601 --> 02:32:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I think they just keep digging until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

3420
02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Until they find something to crankin </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3421
02:32:07.171 --> 02:32:09.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a cracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You unleash that beast and you know,</v>

3422
02:32:09.480 --> 02:32:12.030
<v Speaker 1>knowing where it'll end up and it ended </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with him losing his job.</v>

3423
02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it hilarious too that he lost his </v>

3424
02:32:17.060 --> 02:32:18.831
<v Speaker 1>job because of pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the number one murderer in the </v>

3425
02:32:18.831 --> 02:32:18.980
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's basically,</v>

3426
02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:21.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He murders bad guys for the country.</v>

3427
02:32:22.140 --> 02:32:23.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what a general is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3428
02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:26.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to say no murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say killer.</v>

3429
02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's say eliminator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

3430
02:32:27.531 --> 02:32:29.420
<v Speaker 1>let's sanitize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3431
02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:32.130
<v Speaker 1>he's a warrior warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say warrior.</v>

3432
02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:37.190
<v Speaker 1>He's the head warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go back to like the conan the </v>

3433
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:38.370
<v Speaker 1>barbarian books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or watch a movie.</v>

3434
02:32:38.371 --> 02:32:40.650
<v Speaker 1>What it kona and do he slayed and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

3435
02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:43.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what warriors do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They slay and they fuck.</v>

3436
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:47.190
<v Speaker 1>So we want these neutered warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want these warriors that don't.</v>

3437
02:32:47.191 --> 02:32:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want these,</v>

3438
02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:53.760
<v Speaker 1>these people that are over there just </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting the heads off of people from a </v>

3439
02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:53.760
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

3440
02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Watch their heads explode and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get any pussy.</v>

3441
02:32:55.460 --> 02:33:00.460
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stopping life on a regular </v>

3442
02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:00.460
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what?</v>

3443
02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.100
<v Speaker 1>There's laWs against what the bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you you can't do,</v>

3444
02:33:02.101 --> 02:33:07.101
<v Speaker 1>but the bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about the bible </v>

3445
02:33:07.101 --> 02:33:07.101
<v Speaker 1>because you got a free pass from uncle </v>
<v Speaker 1>sam.</v>

3446
02:33:07.101 --> 02:33:11.601
<v Speaker 1>We've talked to god and god says it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay to kill these folks as long as </v>

3447
02:33:11.601 --> 02:33:11.601
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

3448
02:33:11.601 --> 02:33:12.480
<v Speaker 1>what if we went into Iraq on a false </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise?</v>

3449
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:17.630
<v Speaker 1>God will forgive you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you kill those people for no </v>

3450
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.630
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

3451
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know any better,</v>

3452
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:19.470
<v Speaker 1>so it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then who's to blame?</v>

3453
02:33:19.530 --> 02:33:24.530
<v Speaker 1>No one's to blame because the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially like a gigantic </v>

3454
02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:27.501
<v Speaker 1>corporation that doesn't have real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like one person that you could </v>

3455
02:33:27.501 --> 02:33:29.400
<v Speaker 1>pin it to is like a lot of people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3456
02:33:29.401 --> 02:33:30.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it dude.</v>

3457
02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's essentially what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3458
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:36.060
<v Speaker 1>So that one guy who's the best general </v>
<v Speaker 1>patraeus,</v>

3459
02:33:36.090 --> 02:33:41.090
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the guy that whenever they went </v>

3460
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:41.090
<v Speaker 1>to the news and if there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan thing,</v>

3461
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:43.170
<v Speaker 1>they went to general patraeus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't get some pussy.</v>

3462
02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

3463
02:33:44.610 --> 02:33:48.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hAte him because I look </v>
<v Speaker 1>for his marriage vows aside.</v>

3464
02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Of course his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be upset if she didn't know.</v>

3465
02:33:50.730 --> 02:33:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3466
02:33:51.931 --> 02:33:56.931
<v Speaker 1>if he lied about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of something to take into </v>

3467
02:33:56.931 --> 02:33:56.931
<v Speaker 1>consideration when you factor in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

3468
02:33:57.030 --> 02:34:00.060
<v Speaker 1>taken into consideration lightly when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you really stop and think about how many</v>

3469
02:34:00.061 --> 02:34:05.061
<v Speaker 1>warriors in the past have had harems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gingiss con fucked like every living </v>

3470
02:34:05.061 --> 02:34:08.450
<v Speaker 1>human being in the year 12 slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean w w,</v>

3471
02:34:08.470 --> 02:34:13.470
<v Speaker 1>what are we pretending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending these warriors are we </v>

3472
02:34:13.470 --> 02:34:13.470
<v Speaker 1>pretending that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3473
02:34:13.470 --> 02:34:18.100
<v Speaker 1>some strange barbie doll can gi joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3474
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Oregon list thing that just fights for </v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

3475
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:23.710
<v Speaker 3>glory and country and doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical desires.</v>

3476
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:26.010
<v Speaker 6>I was a awhile ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had this guy,</v>

3477
02:34:26.011 --> 02:34:31.011
<v Speaker 6>David Brennan on my podcast and he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about how police and militaries </v>

3478
02:34:31.011 --> 02:34:34.770
<v Speaker 6>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've only been professional flight the </v>

3479
02:34:34.770 --> 02:34:34.770
<v Speaker 6>last hundred and 20 years or something </v>
<v Speaker 6>before that,</v>

3480
02:34:34.770 --> 02:34:37.710
<v Speaker 6>they were just pretty much the enforcers</v>
<v Speaker 6>for whoever owned the land.</v>

3481
02:34:37.711 --> 02:34:41.130
<v Speaker 6>So if you were the feudal lord,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would have your own police force who</v>

3482
02:34:41.131 --> 02:34:43.980
<v Speaker 6>had basically collect taxes and beat </v>
<v Speaker 6>peasants and stuff.</v>

3483
02:34:44.310 --> 02:34:49.310
<v Speaker 6>We've only expected police and soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be pr professional for the past </v>

3484
02:34:49.310 --> 02:34:54.140
<v Speaker 6>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's still kind of catching up </v>

3485
02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:54.870
<v Speaker 6>because these are very old structures </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're using violence,</v>

3486
02:34:54.871 --> 02:34:56.190
<v Speaker 6>so it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you mix?</v>

3487
02:34:56.300 --> 02:35:00.120
<v Speaker 6>It's always kind of boggled my mind that</v>
<v Speaker 6>cops will go from a fatal,</v>

3488
02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:03.570
<v Speaker 6>like some kind of fatal confrontation </v>
<v Speaker 6>where they have to take somebody down to</v>

3489
02:35:03.571 --> 02:35:07.140
<v Speaker 6>15 minutes later they're at starbucks </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting another coffee.</v>

3490
02:35:07.141 --> 02:35:09.920
<v Speaker 6>Like that's gotta be a weird fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind melt.</v>

3491
02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:15.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a massive disconnect and I </v>

3492
02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:16.790
<v Speaker 3>think it may very well be that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them were taking antidepressants.</v>

3493
02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:19.520
<v Speaker 3>I know antidepressants in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly common.</v>

3494
02:35:19.580 --> 02:35:23.120
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 3>medications for people that come back.</v>

3495
02:35:23.121 --> 02:35:26.290
<v Speaker 3>They have ptsd and people have issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>and depressant.</v>

3496
02:35:26.310 --> 02:35:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's google that because,</v>

3497
02:35:27.921 --> 02:35:32.921
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read an article recently about </v>

3498
02:35:32.921 --> 02:35:34.940
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants in the military and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't remember the exact statistics,</v>

3499
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:38.750
<v Speaker 3>but it was in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty disturbing,</v>

3500
02:35:38.751 --> 02:35:43.751
<v Speaker 3>but makes sense because they allow you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to rationalize things in a way that </v>

3501
02:35:43.751 --> 02:35:45.980
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to if you're not on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

3502
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3503
02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:50.570
<v Speaker 3>Antidepressants in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3504
02:35:50.571 --> 02:35:52.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot.</v>

3505
02:35:52.701 --> 02:35:57.701
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Military prescribes antidepressants to </v>

3506
02:35:57.701 --> 02:36:00.610
<v Speaker 3>growing army of soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3507
02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Military says at 12 percent of its </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat personnel in Iraq and 17 percent </v>

3508
02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:09.260
<v Speaker 3>serving in Afghanistan are taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>prescription antidepressants.</v>

3509
02:36:09.290 --> 02:36:14.290
<v Speaker 3>This is for 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only assume the numbers have gone </v>

3510
02:36:14.290 --> 02:36:14.290
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3511
02:36:14.290 --> 02:36:15.500
<v Speaker 3>It's increased since then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it has.</v>

3512
02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:17.600
<v Speaker 3>If they found out there's money in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look.</v>

3513
02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:19.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the beautiful thing about being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation.</v>

3514
02:36:19.881 --> 02:36:22.220
<v Speaker 3>You have to maximize your profits every </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

3515
02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Corporations just can't stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3516
02:36:24.291 --> 02:36:27.860
<v Speaker 3>we made x amount of money last year and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we made the same this year,</v>

3517
02:36:27.861 --> 02:36:29.970
<v Speaker 3>so we're doing really good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3518
02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:32.000
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to continue to grow.</v>

3519
02:36:32.001 --> 02:36:37.001
<v Speaker 3>They want that infinite growth paradigm </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm Peter Joseph always goes on and</v>

3520
02:36:37.761 --> 02:36:40.220
<v Speaker 3>on about and his documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3521
02:36:40.221 --> 02:36:42.860
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of corporations.</v>

3522
02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:47.600
<v Speaker 3>One of the most ridiculous aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy is the infinite growth idea.</v>

3523
02:36:47.630 --> 02:36:52.630
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you can just continue to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get bigger and bigger every year until </v>

3524
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:54.200
<v Speaker 3>what you have all the money on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet because that's where it goes.</v>

3525
02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:57.800
<v Speaker 3>If every fucking corporation actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>continued to grow and,</v>

3526
02:36:57.810 --> 02:37:00.770
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stayed alive for 100,</v>

3527
02:37:00.771 --> 02:37:02.540
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>350,</v>

3528
02:37:02.541 --> 02:37:04.100
<v Speaker 3>a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it takes,</v>

3529
02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:05.960
<v Speaker 3>they should all have all the money in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

3530
02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3531
02:37:07.850 --> 02:37:10.370
<v Speaker 3>what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have infinite growth.</v>

3532
02:37:10.371 --> 02:37:11.480
<v Speaker 3>It doeSn't make sense.</v>

3533
02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:16.640
<v Speaker 6>It's a monopoly game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody ends up with all the pieces of </v>

3534
02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:16.640
<v Speaker 6>paper by end,</v>

3535
02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:16.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you know,</v>

3536
02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:22.280
<v Speaker 1>you got to think that if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies were making </v>

3537
02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:25.820
<v Speaker 1>untold millions of dollars in having 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the soldiers in Iraq and 17 </v>

3538
02:37:26.911 --> 02:37:30.210
<v Speaker 1>percent in Afghanistan in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3539
02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:34.410
<v Speaker 1>that was six years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what Is it now?</v>

3540
02:37:34.530 --> 02:37:37.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably pretty fucking crazy.</v>

3541
02:37:38.010 --> 02:37:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any precedence in the military in 2014.</v>

3542
02:37:40.891 --> 02:37:45.891
<v Speaker 1>Let's try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 14 and let's see what it </v>

3543
02:37:45.891 --> 02:37:48.360
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

3544
02:37:48.390 --> 02:37:53.390
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just reading random blogs with a </v>

3545
02:37:53.390 --> 02:37:54.720
<v Speaker 1>very quick and cursory google search </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no vetting out whatsoever.</v>

3546
02:37:54.721 --> 02:37:57.170
<v Speaker 1>So they might be all full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

3547
02:37:57.240 --> 02:37:59.430
<v Speaker 1>we don't even have to look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the numbers are,</v>

3548
02:37:59.450 --> 02:38:01.990
<v Speaker 1>those are all abstract anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that It's a,</v>

3549
02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:07.040
<v Speaker 1>it's people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are definitely on it and that's </v>

3550
02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:07.040
<v Speaker 1>kind of crazy that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3551
02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take people and you put them in this</v>

3552
02:38:08.610 --> 02:38:13.610
<v Speaker 1>terrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He yanked them out of their lives and </v>

3553
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3554
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you send them over to these,</v>

3555
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:15.570
<v Speaker 6>now they've got to kill people and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>they come home and yeah,</v>

3556
02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:20.840
<v Speaker 6>their wife is sleeping with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>else or their girlfriend has left them </v>

3557
02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:22.380
<v Speaker 6>and then they have the ptsd crack,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crack down,</v>

3558
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:24.000
<v Speaker 6>can't deal with life anymore.</v>

3559
02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3560
02:38:25.570 --> 02:38:30.310
<v Speaker 1>they just recently shot a guy and I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was having some ptsd issues.</v>

3561
02:38:30.311 --> 02:38:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances were.</v>

3562
02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:37.860
<v Speaker 1>There was a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone rear ended him and he wound up </v>

3563
02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:37.860
<v Speaker 1>shooting some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3564
02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>

3565
02:38:38.770 --> 02:38:39.510
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3566
02:38:39.580 --> 02:38:44.580
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't gone to court yet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they're trying to put </v>

3567
02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:47.881
<v Speaker 1>together the case and try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the exact circumstances where the </v>

3568
02:38:47.881 --> 02:38:47.881
<v Speaker 1>guy rear ended him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows.</v>

3569
02:38:47.881 --> 02:38:48.850
<v Speaker 1>The guy might've been crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

3570
02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And he might've really been defending </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

3571
02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3572
02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but that's an issue when people are used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to killing people and people have been </v>

3573
02:38:57.420 --> 02:38:58.120
<v Speaker 1>over there for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

3574
02:38:58.510 --> 02:39:03.510
<v Speaker 1>he did a tour more than one and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>also went back and did black water </v>

3575
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:06.040
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without a doubt he's seen some shit.</v>

3576
02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:08.120
<v Speaker 6>You've seen dirty wars by now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3577
02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3578
02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:10.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty disturbing the.</v>

3579
02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

3580
02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3581
02:39:12.161 --> 02:39:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get that guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

3582
02:39:13.701 --> 02:39:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I was actually watching summit last </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

3583
02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy scahill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3584
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3585
02:39:18.411 --> 02:39:19.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3586
02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:24.550
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a strange time where a </v>

3587
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.550
<v Speaker 1>guy can make a documentary like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3588
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:29.021
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a strange time where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could talk about documentary like that </v>

3589
02:39:29.021 --> 02:39:29.540
<v Speaker 1>for hours and hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your podcast or this product</v>

3590
02:39:29.620 --> 02:39:34.620
<v Speaker 6>as part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's part of the reason I love America </v>

3591
02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:34.620
<v Speaker 6>as we can always self correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3592
02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:36.280
<v Speaker 6>We're not doing this podcast in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>basement somewhere.</v>

3593
02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:41.290
<v Speaker 6>Worried about the fucking syrian army </v>
<v Speaker 6>storming in here and torturing us like </v>

3594
02:39:41.290 --> 02:39:44.981
<v Speaker 6>they are just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're in a different part of the </v>

3595
02:39:44.981 --> 02:39:46.871
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only difference is you're in a </v>

3596
02:39:46.871 --> 02:39:46.871
<v Speaker 6>different area.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3597
02:39:46.871 --> 02:39:46.871
<v Speaker 6>You no longer have these rights and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>gotta be careful.</v>

3598
02:39:46.970 --> 02:39:48.860
<v Speaker 6>We thankfully don't have that and I want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

3599
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:50.660
<v Speaker 6>I want to see that remain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Obviously</v>

3600
02:39:50.770 --> 02:39:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that it's not just America,</v>

3601
02:39:54.221 --> 02:39:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a world and I think the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country like America,</v>

3602
02:39:57.910 --> 02:40:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately the goal would be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the whole world up to the same </v>

3603
02:40:02.910 --> 02:40:06.031
<v Speaker 1>standard that we hold ourselves to and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a global community of people that </v>

3604
02:40:06.031 --> 02:40:10.471
<v Speaker 1>are essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have the same rights </v>

3605
02:40:10.471 --> 02:40:10.471
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you go and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive north korean regime is.</v>

3606
02:40:10.471 --> 02:40:12.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no places like Syria that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still hold.</v>

3607
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:14.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no places that</v>

3608
02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really shameful that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't gone in North Korea yet because </v>

3609
02:40:19.540 --> 02:40:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I understand people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we do?</v>

3610
02:40:19.850 --> 02:40:24.850
<v Speaker 2>We've got to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a humanitarian disaster like </v>

3611
02:40:24.850 --> 02:40:24.850
<v Speaker 2>humanity basically watching another </v>
<v Speaker 2>holocaust.</v>

3612
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to take the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to take the loss on it </v>

3613
02:40:30.190 --> 02:40:34.371
<v Speaker 2>because it's going to be messy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take time and money and </v>

3614
02:40:34.371 --> 02:40:34.371
<v Speaker 2>probably going to lose some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be,</v>

3615
02:40:34.371 --> 02:40:35.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Korea is going to lose.</v>

3616
02:40:35.530 --> 02:40:38.630
<v Speaker 2>That's our ally and that's a real issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's right there.</v>

3617
02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:43.690
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think as a modern society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see all this shit on the </v>

3618
02:40:43.690 --> 02:40:46.121
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't just let them continue to kill </v>

3619
02:40:46.121 --> 02:40:46.121
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other,</v>

3620
02:40:46.121 --> 02:40:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I think the other month he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his girlfriend,</v>

3621
02:40:46.881 --> 02:40:51.881
<v Speaker 2>he just wiped out like all of her family</v>
<v Speaker 2>or friends or some shit over some </v>

3622
02:40:51.881 --> 02:40:52.310
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sligHt.</v>

3623
02:40:52.410 --> 02:40:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he executed his ex wife.</v>

3624
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He executed his ex girlfriend and uh,</v>

3625
02:40:57.030 --> 02:41:01.200
<v Speaker 1>he executed his uncle who is thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about establishing a coo.</v>

3626
02:41:01.470 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And then he executed all of his uncle's </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

3627
02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:06.660
<v Speaker 1>He executed his uncle's sons who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent and they were 20 years old,</v>

3628
02:41:06.661 --> 02:41:08.460
<v Speaker 1>but he knew that they would come back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get him one day.</v>

3629
02:41:08.461 --> 02:41:10.770
<v Speaker 1>So he executed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He executed everyone.</v>

3630
02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the us government is fixated on guys </v>

3631
02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:16.020
<v Speaker 2>like kim.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't they go after this fucking guy</v>

3632
02:41:16.021 --> 02:41:17.870
<v Speaker 2>in North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good point.</v>

3633
02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Use the same kind of resources against </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like that rather than someone </v>

3634
02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:22.900
<v Speaker 2>who's a,</v>

3635
02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be concerned with military </v>

3636
02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:27.730
<v Speaker 1>operations because it's so close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea and I think they've publicly</v>

3637
02:41:27.731 --> 02:41:30.580
<v Speaker 1>stated that they would launch nukes at </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea if there were ever invaded.</v>

3638
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:32.170
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so clever.</v>

3639
02:41:32.171 --> 02:41:34.480
<v Speaker 1>If there was some kind of resource we </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted in North Korea,</v>

3640
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:39.870
<v Speaker 1>we would find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would find a diplomatic way to </v>

3641
02:41:39.870 --> 02:41:39.870
<v Speaker 1>resolve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3642
02:41:39.870 --> 02:41:41.350
<v Speaker 1>But are we or are we not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have to decide are we retarded</v>

3643
02:41:41.450 --> 02:41:44.530
<v Speaker 1>or we goofy fucks that do stupid shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could point out easily.</v>

3644
02:41:44.531 --> 02:41:49.531
<v Speaker 1>Or are we these super clever geniuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that know how to circumvent any security</v>

3645
02:41:49.611 --> 02:41:50.560
<v Speaker 1>systems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3646
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I think halt the nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we are a,</v>

3647
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:55.270
<v Speaker 1>we're convenient if the core</v>

3648
02:41:55.400 --> 02:42:00.400
<v Speaker 2>really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have all these layers of </v>

3649
02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:00.400
<v Speaker 2>stupidity and not all of the layers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected.</v>

3650
02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Some of it is just stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not there for any reason,</v>

3651
02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:03.120
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3652
02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3653
02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what our reaL capabilities </v>

3654
02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:09.800
<v Speaker 1>are and I probably shouldn't know since </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the military,</v>

3655
02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just,</v>

3656
02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I would love to be able to trust them </v>
<v Speaker 1>wholeheartedly.</v>

3657
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I would love to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would love to be able to step back and </v>

3658
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:18.070
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3659
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:20.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're invading a country because </v>

3660
02:42:20.751 --> 02:42:20.751
<v Speaker 1>that country is filled with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes and those assholes are going to</v>

3661
02:42:20.751 --> 02:42:22.490
<v Speaker 1>kill innocent people worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love that.</v>

3662
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I really would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not an anti military guy.</v>

3663
02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm a realist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a realist when it comes to human </v>

3664
02:42:31.330 --> 02:42:31.330
<v Speaker 1>nature and I'm a realist when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to human history.</v>

3665
02:42:31.330 --> 02:42:36.090
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a time of peace ever </v>

3666
02:42:36.090 --> 02:42:37.490
<v Speaker 1>in the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever from the time that we were shut out</v>

3667
02:42:37.491 --> 02:42:40.100
<v Speaker 1>of the first monkey mama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you know,</v>

3668
02:42:40.290 --> 02:42:45.290
<v Speaker 1>fighting over a fucking deer leg or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell we were fighting over </v>

3669
02:42:45.290 --> 02:42:49.181
<v Speaker 1>back then to today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been one day on earth </v>

3670
02:42:49.181 --> 02:42:52.841
<v Speaker 1>where no one died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been one day on earth </v>

3671
02:42:52.841 --> 02:42:53.540
<v Speaker 1>where no one dropped a rock on someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>head from the top of a cliff.</v>

3672
02:42:53.541 --> 02:42:57.260
<v Speaker 1>There's never been one day on earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people didn't fight to the death.</v>

3673
02:42:57.380 --> 02:43:02.380
<v Speaker 1>It's always happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been a part of what we are </v>

3674
02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:05.470
<v Speaker 1>and like the yin and the yang that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were discussing earlier that sort of </v>

3675
02:43:05.470 --> 02:43:09.461
<v Speaker 1>exist in as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a natural part of just life in the </v>

3676
02:43:09.461 --> 02:43:11.500
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this push and there's,</v>

3677
02:43:11.501 --> 02:43:11.680
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

3678
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:13.210
<v Speaker 3>does tie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes in.</v>

3679
02:43:13.211 --> 02:43:17.160
<v Speaker 3>The tide goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill o'reilly can't explain that.</v>

3680
02:43:17.220 --> 02:43:19.600
<v Speaker 3>You can't explain that I'm in jesus his </v>
<v Speaker 3>corner.</v>

3681
02:43:19.930 --> 02:43:23.020
<v Speaker 3>But I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something to that.</v>

3682
02:43:23.021 --> 02:43:26.500
<v Speaker 3>And there's something also to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I harp on quite often,</v>

3683
02:43:26.501 --> 02:43:31.501
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's an important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to look at all the different </v>

3684
02:43:31.501 --> 02:43:35.020
<v Speaker 3>sort of areas of the world where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3685
02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:40.290
<v Speaker 3>what we call natural phenomenon or </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural examples of strange behavior or </v>

3686
02:43:40.290 --> 02:43:42.530
<v Speaker 3>observed behavior or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3687
02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:46.720
<v Speaker 3>natural cycles of whether it's a weather</v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns or whether it's,</v>

3688
02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:48.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

3689
02:43:48.491 --> 02:43:51.880
<v Speaker 3>We lOok at all these things as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>very natural except for ourselves.</v>

3690
02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:54.460
<v Speaker 3>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to human beings,</v>

3691
02:43:54.461 --> 02:43:57.490
<v Speaker 3>we decided that because we're sentient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're,</v>

3692
02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:00.760
<v Speaker 3>we have the ability to rationalize and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think and communicate.</v>

3693
02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:03.220
<v Speaker 3>We don't think what we do is natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we think,</v>

3694
02:44:03.221 --> 02:44:05.050
<v Speaker 3>well we do is just some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3695
02:44:05.051 --> 02:44:07.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a society we have to be civilized and</v>

3696
02:44:07.211 --> 02:44:09.460
<v Speaker 3>think things through and that might all </v>
<v Speaker 3>be natural.</v>

3697
02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:14.460
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might be seeing with humanity is a </v>

3698
02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:16.741
<v Speaker 3>really complicated version of what goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in an anthill will we might be </v>

3699
02:44:16.741 --> 02:44:21.151
<v Speaker 3>seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just some really natural behavior </v>

3700
02:44:21.151 --> 02:44:22.390
<v Speaker 3>that's just on some next level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fractal shit.</v>

3701
02:44:22.540 --> 02:44:27.280
<v Speaker 3>It's just so uber complicated because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many of us and you're dealing</v>

3702
02:44:27.281 --> 02:44:32.281
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're factoring in information as well </v>

3703
02:44:32.281 --> 02:44:35.041
<v Speaker 3>as the instincts to breed the instincts </v>
<v Speaker 3>to dominate and have food and resources </v>

3704
02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:39.790
<v Speaker 3>on top of all those other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also dealing with communication.</v>

3705
02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:42.310
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange information.</v>

3706
02:44:42.311 --> 02:44:47.311
<v Speaker 3>Also the ability to enhance yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that exchanged information and </v>

3707
02:44:47.311 --> 02:44:49.330
<v Speaker 3>alter perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A wolf stays a wolf.</v>

3708
02:44:49.331 --> 02:44:51.290
<v Speaker 3>It's whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give a douchebag.</v>

3709
02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Some mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he becomes a really introspective </v>

3710
02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:56.320
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least for a few hours.</v>

3711
02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:58.240
<v Speaker 3>He'd become a yoga instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was enough times.</v>

3712
02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of people that </v>

3713
02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:04.300
<v Speaker 3>changed because of experiences and </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and,</v>

3714
02:45:04.301 --> 02:45:04.790
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3715
02:45:04.791 --> 02:45:09.791
<v Speaker 3>and just life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving them something that forces them </v>

3716
02:45:09.791 --> 02:45:13.111
<v Speaker 3>to examine the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the box that they put the world in life </v>

3717
02:45:13.111 --> 02:45:17.341
<v Speaker 3>gives them something that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've sort of been forced to sort of </v>

3718
02:45:17.341 --> 02:45:20.880
<v Speaker 3>get a new perspective that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in the animal world and that's </v>

3719
02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:23.860
<v Speaker 3>why you have to add in and factor in all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these variables and look at human beings</v>

3720
02:45:23.861 --> 02:45:25.480
<v Speaker 3>and say it seems natural.</v>

3721
02:45:25.630 --> 02:45:29.230
<v Speaker 3>What we're doing seems natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that along with,</v>

3722
02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:30.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3723
02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:35.410
<v Speaker 3>bears male bears eating the young cubs </v>
<v Speaker 3>to force the female to keep breeding.</v>

3724
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean all that stuff is natural too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

3725
02:45:39.330 --> 02:45:41.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's disgusting and horrible to watch,</v>

3726
02:45:41.681 --> 02:45:44.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's all natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're working it out,</v>

3727
02:45:44.170 --> 02:45:46.060
<v Speaker 3>we're working it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are working it out.</v>

3728
02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I really think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3729
02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:49.840
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm confident about it.</v>

3730
02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm confident about it because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects in my own life of,</v>

3731
02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:56.820
<v Speaker 3>of education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I say education,</v>

3732
02:45:56.821 --> 02:45:57.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean formal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3733

<v Speaker 3>just reading things and being exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>information and be exposed to wife </v>

3734

<v Speaker 3>just having conversations with people </v>

3736
02:46:09.271 --> 02:46:12.571
<v Speaker 3>and hashing things out and then seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reactions to these conversations </v>

3737
02:46:12.571 --> 02:46:13.970
<v Speaker 3>that people have online where they join </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

3738
02:46:13.971 --> 02:46:15.620
<v Speaker 3>They started discussing things on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

3739
02:46:15.621 --> 02:46:18.320
<v Speaker 3>discussing things on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people you know,</v>

3740
02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:23.530
<v Speaker 3>have conversations in person about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that have happened on the </v>

3741
02:46:23.530 --> 02:46:23.530
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

02:46:23.530 --> 02:46:23.530
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3743
02:46:23.530 --> 02:46:27.701
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out about this and then I </v>

3744
02:46:27.701 --> 02:46:27.701
<v Speaker 3>started researching into this and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed my diet because of that and then</v>

3745
02:46:27.701 --> 02:46:32.621
<v Speaker 3>this and that and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why </v>

3746
02:46:32.621 --> 02:46:35.530
<v Speaker 3>misinformation like the aspe thing so </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrating and it really pisses me off </v>

3747
02:46:35.530 --> 02:46:38.090
<v Speaker 3>because it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the wrong spirit of this thing.</v>

3748
02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.830
<v Speaker 3>It's in the wrong spirit of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to.</v>

3749
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:40.280
<v Speaker 5>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3750

<v Speaker 5>Everybody.</v>

3751
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:44.690

3752
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:49.750
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>famine thinking doesn't have any logic </v>

3753
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.750
<v Speaker 5>attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fam and thinking is just.</v>

3754
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:50.990
<v Speaker 5>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to piss again.</v>

3762
02:47:08.681 --> 02:47:11.200
<v Speaker 5>this looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to talk to somebody in charge.</v>

3763
02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:17.750
<v Speaker 5>You're not fooling anybody when you say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3764
02:47:17.751 --> 02:47:22.751
<v Speaker 5>What happened was a natural disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're lying.</v>

3765
02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:29.760
<v Speaker 5>It was not an earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a typhoon because what's </v>

3766
02:47:31.411 --> 02:47:34.270
<v Speaker 5>really happening is that you're hiding </v>
<v Speaker 5>something out,</v>

3767
02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.840
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the greatest promoted back to the </v>

3768
02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:49.390
<v Speaker 5>stove ever had been so good at releasing</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

3769
02:47:49.391 --> 02:47:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Slowly</v>

3770
02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:57.050
<v Speaker 9>pop It right up on the ocean.</v>

3771
02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:05.800
<v Speaker 5>If you're listening and watching,</v>

3772
02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.040
<v Speaker 9>you're seeing a bunch of cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Your tests in the pacific.</v>

3773
02:48:28.810 --> 02:48:30.110
<v Speaker 5>No idea what's coming.</v>

3774
02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:35.830
<v Speaker 9>They're so good about not showing you </v>
<v Speaker 9>much to kill it.</v>

3775
02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:50.090
<v Speaker 9>Control</v>

3776
02:48:58.290 --> 02:49:03.290
<v Speaker 5>and not the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the arrogance of man,</v>

3777
02:49:05.710 --> 02:49:08.730
<v Speaker 5>so godzilla is coming next as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would unite us.</v>

3778

<v Speaker 5>This motherfucker popped out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ocean for sure.</v>

3808
02:50:22.391 --> 02:50:24.500
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable about at middle school </v>

<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

3813

<v Speaker 5>your mouth,</v>

3821
02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:54.900

<v Speaker 5>I thought it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>

3832
02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:20.420
<v Speaker 5>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's egocentric.</v>

3833
02:51:21.350 --> 02:51:26.350
<v Speaker 5>It's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll regret it when it's kid fucking </v>

3834
02:51:26.350 --> 02:51:27.920
<v Speaker 5>susan gets older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that that's going to happen.</v>

3835
02:51:28.310 --> 02:51:29.810
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the david seaman,</v>

3836
02:51:29.811 --> 02:51:31.190
<v Speaker 5>our david seaman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

3837
02:51:31.191 --> 02:51:36.191
<v Speaker 5>the last guest was the ceo of a bitcoin </v>
<v Speaker 5>exchange and I grilled him on whether </v>

3838
02:51:36.201 --> 02:51:41.201
<v Speaker 5>it's good time to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm totally hypocritical because I </v>

3839
02:51:41.201 --> 02:51:41.201
<v Speaker 5>had never had a problem with moon unit </v>
<v Speaker 5>zappa.</v>

3840
02:51:41.201 --> 02:51:42.980
<v Speaker 5>If I didn't have a problem with moon </v>
<v Speaker 5>unit zappa.</v>

3841
02:51:42.981 --> 02:51:44.760
<v Speaker 5>Why do I care about northwest?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had apologized.</v>

3842
02:51:44.810 --> 02:51:45.710
<v Speaker 5>Kanye.</v>

3843
02:51:45.711 --> 02:51:47.000
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3844
02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:48.520
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you will.</v>

3845
02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:50.690
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't apologize right there,</v>

3846
