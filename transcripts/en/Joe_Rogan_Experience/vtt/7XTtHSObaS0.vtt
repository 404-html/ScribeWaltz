00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.630
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.920
what's cracking this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.921
you by stamps.com stamps.com is a very convenient way to eliminate going to the

4
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.200
post office and doing everything from your office with stamps.com you can print

5
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:24.030
up official us postage on your home computer with a regular printer.

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
It's a beautiful thing.
You print it,
you weigh it,
they give you a digital scale,

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.740
you weigh your packages,
the mailman comes,

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.310
you give them the packages with the stuff printed on it and you're done.

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.380
You don't have to do that waiting in line shit.

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.440
You don't have to talk to someone who doesn't really want to talk to you.

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.080
You don't have to get them to waive all your packages.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.930
If you have a home business,
if you send things regularly online,

13
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.340
this is a huge lifesaver.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.290
We're also brought to you by one 800 flowers.com and I apologize to one 800

28
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.200
flowers.com because I'm half a moron and uh,

29
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:53.700
I guess I said everything right in the first half of the commercial and then the

30
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.210
second half I said stamps.com listen farmers,

31
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.390
a lot of times I have a lot of shit on my mind.

32
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.600
There's a lot of different things going on and we're doing a podcast podcasts

33
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:07.110
with Justin Martin Dale and I was just trying to fight off all the gay thoughts

34
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.760
bouncing off the inside of my skull.
So my apologies.

35
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.440
But one 800 flowers.com is another awesome podcast sponsor that we enjoy very

36
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:18.420
much because,
uh,
it's,

37
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.270
it makes it so that you don't have to go to the flower arrangement store.

38
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.380
What did they call them?
Florists.

39
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.290
You don't want to be caught dead in the florist because if you get caught in the

40
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.770
florists,
that means you lost.
It means you're there with a bunch of other apps.

41
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.610
Don't do it.
Do it online.
And you could be in Cognito,

42
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.590
you can keep all your manly street cred,

43
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.670
but yet get all the love from your woman and make her feel happy.

44
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.830
One 800 and maybe your man,
I mean,

45
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:43.920
maybe you're one of those dudes just like sending flowers to your buddies.

46
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.940
There's nothing wrong with that.
Look,
you know,
it's not the fucked up thing,

47
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:51.510
right?
You could send your buddy a six pack of beer and no one says anything.

48
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.120
You could send them some cigars.
No one has a problem with it.

49
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.940
You could send your buddy some beef jerky.
No one will say a thing,

50
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.190
but send your friend one of your best guy friends.

51
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.960
You're heterosexual guy friends,

52
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.700
some beautiful creations of Mother Nature and you will be looked at as some sort

53
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.330
of a Weirdo.
I don't get it.
There's weird rules in this world.

54
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.710
Why is pink a a silly color for men to wear?
Why is it,

55
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.160
why is it a questionable color?
That makes no sense.
It's a goddamn color.

56
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.040
All right,
we're crazy.
Something's wrong with people,

57
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.080
but there's nothing wrong with flowers.

58

N n I t.

85
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.150
Now manly men like Cameron Hanes do a lot of lifting weights and they need some

86
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:15.340
supplements.
They need some protein in their diet.

87
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.630
They need to eat healthy foods and they need strength and fitness equipment,

88
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.530
strength and conditioning equipment like the stuff that we sell at [inaudible]

89
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.080
dot com we're going to have to hook up Cameron Hanes with a Zombie kettle bell

90
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.990
when he's out there shooting elk with his bow.

91
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.830
You've got to prepare for the apocalypse cause shit could go down if you've

92
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:35.320
never seen a the Zombie kettle bells it,
audit.com.

93
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.050
They're essentially just like normal kettle bells.

94
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.500
But we had an artist named Steven Shubin Junior.
If you look at the big screen,

95
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:45.190
you can see those,
um,
designed these cool faces.

96
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:47.530
They're also three d mapped and balanced.

97
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.340
So they work just like a regular kettle bells.
They're not just beautiful.

98
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.690
Their actual functional actually functional.
We have the Zombie kettle bells,

99
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:59.990
we have chimpanzee,
the primal kettle bells,
which are all the great apes.

100
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:03.710
We have chimpanzees,
orangutans,
chimps,

101
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:06.680
and we even have a gorilla and a howler monkey.

102
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.520
The is my favorite though because like my friend Cameron Hanes,

103
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:15.230
I'm an extremist and uh,
I feel like if 70 pounds is the biggest one we sell,

104
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:18.710
that's the one I'm working out with.
Bitch.
Okay.
Because I'm a manly man.

105
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.660
That's what I do.
All right.

106
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.610
We said we have all kinds of shit that benefits you at [inaudible] dot com what

107
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.940
we call on it.com is a human optimization website.

108
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.680
So whatever we find that works great and it's good for your health.
We sell it,

109
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.620
even soap.
We have defense soap that we sell,

110
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.140
which is a lot of people.
Um,

111
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.770
there's a lot of confusion when it comes to antibacterial soap.

112
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.680
Antibacterial soap is,
is kind of sketchy.

113
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.160
Like if you use it and you're in a hospital and you're about to perform surgery,

114
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.190
that's one thing.
But if you use that stuff on your body,

115
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.400
the problem is that your body has natural flora,

116
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.910
there's natural bacteria on your body that you actually want to preserve.

117
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.070
That's why it's good to eat probiotics.

118
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.780
Like acidophilus actually promote healthy bacteria both in your gut and in your

119
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.890
skin.
And defense soap is a,
another way to do that.

120
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:12.000
Defense soap is uh,
uh,

121
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.880
my friend guy who owns the company created this because he is a grappler and he

122
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.860
has been involved in wrestling his whole life.

123
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.250
And when you have a lot of Jujitsu guys are wrestling guys or MMA guys that

124
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.510
they,
they,
they get a lot of skin rashes,
whether it's um,
skin conditions,

125
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:33.410
whether it's staph infection or whether it's,
uh,
sometimes we get,

126
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.940
I've gotten ringworm from Jujitsu.
You can get a lot of this,
um,

127
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.710
Matt herpes really you and a lot of that is,
um,

128
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.940
can be prevented from hygiene and that harsh antibacterial soap actually can

129
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:50.690
make it,
you more susceptible to these things because it,

130
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.230
it actually kills the good bacteria as well as the bad bacteria,

131
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.730
but with defense.
So,

132
00:07:55.731 --> 00:08:00.050
but he's figured out is to use tea tree oil and eucalyptus and all natural

133
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:03.200
ingredients that promote healthy bacteria and,

134
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.900
and kill the bad bacteria.

135
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.020
It's really good stuff and it smells good and it's,
it's,

136
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:12.050
it's a healthy natural soap for your body.

137
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.550
Just one more thing that we sell it on a.com just like the hemp protein powder,

138
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.020
which by the way will not have to answer this,
I don't know how many times,

139
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:24.170
but will not make you test positive at work.
Okay?

140
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:27.050
If you worked for ups and you're worried about pissing hot,

141
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.650
you don't have to worry about it.
Hemp is actually not psychoactive.

142
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.920
And the recent farm bill that just got passed,

143
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.070
it looks like we're gonna be able to grow hemp in America.
Finally,

144
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.040
we've been selling hemp at Onnit com for the longest time,

145
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:43.340
but we've had to buy it from Canada,
which is so crazy.

146
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.050
That means that American farmers have not been able to make,
uh,
the grow a crop.

147
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:52.100
That's a natural plant.
It's not psychoactive,
it's not a drug,

148
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.550
but because it's related to a drug,
it's been illegal.
Finally,

149
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:01.290
people are realizing how absolutely ridiculous that is because we've been able

150
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.480
to sell it,
but we have to buy it from Canada,

151
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.630
so it's great for my friends up in Canada that are farmers.

152
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:07.980
It's great for the Canadian farmers,

153
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:11.750
but it is absolutely ridiculous and American farmers and not able to grow.
Hap.

154
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.870
Finally,
we're going to start being able to do that there.

155
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.770
I guess it's going to start at universities in places where it's legal statewide

156
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.971
and then uh,

157
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:25.971
I'm sure that this wave seems to be spreading and it's going to eventually go

158
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:29.850
through the entire country because there's no reason to stop it.
It's not a drug.

159
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:31.470
We're not talking even about marijuana,

160
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.530
which of course I think she'd be legal anyway,
but what this is,

161
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.640
is just the hemp and it makes a fine protein powder.

162
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.090
One of the very best protein powders,
very easily digestible,

163
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:44.270
has amino Alvie amino acids in it.
It's,

164
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.260
it's got healthy fats in it and we sell it it on a.com as well as well as hemp

165
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:52.860
force bars,
which are a hemp protein in bar form,

166
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:55.320
which is great when you're out there hiking in the mountains,

167
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:57.270
Cameron Hanes and you need some snacks.

168
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.840
We'll give you some hemp force bars keeping your backpack so he stay healthy.

Aubrey Marcus will be here tomorrow.
Actually,

171
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.710
we're going to do a podcast with Aubrey and we're going to talk about all the

172
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:17.490
latest developments at on it,
but until then,

173
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.500
today we have Cameron Hayes,
master bow hunter,
all around Badass.

174
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.430
Cue The music.
Whenever you're ready,
Jamie.
Hey,

175
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.930
it's you forgot the volume.
You fuck

176
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.100
you fucked it up.
At least it's not low.
The computer did.
At least it's not live.

177
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:42.780
Yeah.
Do you know how to do it or are we done?

178
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.820
No,
that's coming shows over.
Yeah,
it's all rocky podcast by night.
All Day.

179
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.660
It wouldn't be the same if everything came out smooth.
Well Cameron,
first of all,

180
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:00.580
thanks for doing this podcast.
For people who don't know,

181
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:04.210
Cameron Cameron Hanes is a,
um,
a famous bow hunter,

182
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.020
which is a rare thing.
It's very rare that someone becomes famous as,

183
00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:12.340
as a bow hunter and in the most manly form of bow hunting ever,

184
00:11:12.341 --> 00:11:14.710
you're famous for shooting the biggest,

185
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:18.970
most majestic North American animals with sticks.
That's right.
I mean,

186
00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:19.870
that's what you're famous for,

187
00:11:19.871 --> 00:11:24.460
your families for taking out giant bugling elk with a flying stick.

188
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.390
That's pretty bad ass,
dude.
I wouldn't say famous.
You're famous to me.

189
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.840
You're famous.
Uh,
I told him a friend of mine who's a,
a hunting fan,

190
00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:35.410
he's a personal trainer and I said,
I'm doing this podcast with Cameron names.

191
00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:39.700
He goes,
oh,
that's the key pampering guy.
That's it.
So dude,
like,
okay,

192
00:11:39.701 --> 00:11:44.620
one other got you.
And one other guy,
you are famous.
[inaudible] so there's three.

193
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.020
I brought you up to my friend Ryan Callahan,
who,
uh,

194
00:11:47.021 --> 00:11:49.750
works at first light and he said,
oh yeah,
I know who that guy is.
Yeah.

195
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.890
So people know who you are,
man.
Okay.
You have become at least,

196
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.090
<v 2>uh,
can I say you have notoriety?
Okay.
Yeah,
I'd say that.
Okay.</v>

197
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.000
Some notoriety from killing elk with a,
with flying sticks.
That's it.
Yeah.

198
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.070
How does one go about becoming famous or at least develop Internet notoriety

199
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.520
from killing elk with flying sticks?
Um,
you know,

200
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.260
I think for me it's just,
I dunno,
I just came up just like everybody else.

201
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:18.070
So it's like,

202
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.540
so what I've done kind of gives other people that didn't have any breaks or just

203
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:25.810
regular guys hope to chase our dreams.
I really think that's it.

204
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:29.860
I think that's why people like me.
Well,
I'll tell you how I found out about you.

205
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.450
Um,
I watched a lot of videos on youtube on online,

206
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.080
whether it's a,
whether videos about anything that I find interesting.

207
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.130
And I saw this video of this guy carrying rocks in his backpack,

208
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.240
going up hills training for elk hunting.
And I was like,
what?

209
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.610
What is that?
And I thought about it,
I was like,

210
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.010
that actually is a pretty smart move.
Like,

211
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:53.500
I've never heard of anybody training for hunting.

212
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.110
I went hunting when I shot that mule deer with Steve Rinella.
Um,
that was the,
uh,

213
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:03.510
the first time everyone hunting.
And I was amazed at how tired I was.
Yeah.

214
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.730
I was like,
this is ridiculous.
Like I thought I was in really good shape,

215
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.530
but when you're climbing up those muddy hills and the Missouri breaks and

216
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:15.060
everything's like sloshing and it's,
you know,
these steep hills and you know,

217
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.320
you're doing it for six hours in a row,
like then you get exhausted.
Yeah,

218
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.930
your legs get rubber,
your lungs are burning.
I was like,
I can't believe this.

219
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:25.600
I was thinking I need to work out for hunting.

220
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.720
But I'd never heard of anybody doing that before until I saw you.
Right.
Well,
it,

221
00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:30.970
you know,

222
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.780
like Elk County and you can get up at sometimes five in the morning to get to

223
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:38.330
where maybe you put some elk to bed the night before and walks.

224
00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:39.670
So an hour before daylight,

225
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.640
then you're hunting all day and then you get back to camp after dark,

226
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:45.010
maybe at eight or nine o'clock.
That's a long day.

227
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.130
And as long day people aren't used to doing that.

228
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.770
I mean how often do you work out for 15 hours a day?
Not only that,
but like you,

229
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.810
if you shoot an elk then you have to take that elk back and you have to figure

230
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:00.310
out how to carry it through the mountains.

231
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.940
Like that's where it gets really crazy because like what's the biggest elk

232
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:07.110
you've ever shot?
Um,
is probably a,

233
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.920
a Roosevelt bullet killed in Oregon in 2010 and we're figuring it weighed about

234
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:16.590
1200 pounds is 12 or 13 years old.
Big Animal.

235
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.380
I was huge.
Ooh.
How long did it take you to carry?

236
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.810
1200 I mean that's on the bone.

237
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.580
So once you quarter it and skin it and take the head off of it and the antlers,

238
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.840
how much is it,
how much you carry it out?
About 500 pounds.
You know,

239
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:34.710
we had a quartered up and then with the Hyde cause don't want her to get it

240
00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:38.410
mounted in the head and all that.
So we had to carry about 500 pounds.

241
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:42.400
But I had a few guys with me.
So,
you know,
made it a little easier.

242
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.970
Yeah.
Guess you have to bring like a pack crew.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,

243
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.940
they're big animals and that's just,
that's part of it.
But that's,
you know,

244
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.150
when you can go into the mountains or an elk lives every day and,

245
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.810
and like you said was sharp stick,
take it out,
harvest it,

246
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.370
and then so you're,

247
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.180
you're on its home court and then bring it back to your truck and back to your

248
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:09.770
freezer.
That's,
that's a powerful experience,
you know?
That's the whole,

249
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.270
the whole thing is hard.
Everything about it is hard,
but to be able to do that,

250
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.260
I mean,

251
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.260
it's given me confidence to know that in whatever everyday life I can achieve

252
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:24.110
things,
you know?
Because that's about as tough as it gets for me.
Yeah.

253
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:27.620
I've always said that adversity is a very important thing for human beings

254
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:30.710
because if you don't go through adversity,
you'd never know that you can.

255
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:34.100
There's always going to be questions.
And every time you do go through adversity,

256
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:39.050
it sort of adds on to your ability and your confidence in all walks of life.

257
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:42.530
It's like this tattoo that I have is Miyamoto Musashi,

258
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.300
the guy who wrote the book of five rings.

259
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:49.040
And when I was a kid and I was a competing in martial arts tournaments,

260
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.950
I read the book of five rings and I remember this one quote,

261
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.380
once you understand the way broadly,

262
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:59.210
you can see it in all things and once you've gone through the kind of adversity

263
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:03.170
that you must go through to,
you know,
hike nine miles until mountain,

264
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:07.220
shoot an elk and then bring that giant beast back and then cook it like,

265
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.250
Oh God is that is you,

266
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:14.480
you will develop confidence and you'll develop a sense of accomplishment that's

267
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.680
very difficult to recreate.
Yeah.
And that's to do that.

268
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:21.320
I know how difficult that is.
And so in training,

269
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.820
I try to simulate that as much as possible.
Yeah.

270
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.950
I mean that's where the caring the 130 pound rock up the hill or you know,

271
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:30.740
for training,
I've run a hundred mile ultra marathons,
you know,

272
00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:32.330
that type of thing.
And basically I just want to,

273
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:37.280
I want to simulate that misery because I want to know what being miserable feels

274
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:40.730
like.
If you don't never know,
you never know how you're going to react.

275
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.180
Some people might fold up quit.
But uh,

276
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.480
so I've tried to get there as often as possible.
How did you,

277
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.580
why did you decide a rock?
Why not like weights?
Well,

278
00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:53.600
you can measure way to just try to just go with the rock because it's even more

279
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:58.400
primal.
Uh,
I dunno,
I just,
I had been seeing this rock,
you know,

280
00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:01.000
I run this mountain all the time,
so I've been seeing this rock and,
uh,

281
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.130
I was like,
man,
I need to get that rock to the top of the hill.

282
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.270
And so I did this seminar at Cabela's and,
uh,
I said,
hey,

283
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:09.500
anybody who wants to come up,

284
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.080
I'm going to go run the mountain cause everybody knows I run this mountain.

285
00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:14.990
So they came in for the Kybella seminar and I told him,
I said,

286
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:17.150
if you run them out and I'll give you a free DVD,
just come,
hey,

287
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.100
I'd just like to work out with people.
Just,
you know,

288
00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:23.210
I like to see people sacrificing.
So I said,

289
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:26.060
I'm going to carry this rock up and we can all go do it.
And I figured,

290
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.400
I mean the Ra,
I figured it's about 70 pounds.
I had no idea.
So I get up there,

291
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:34.340
I had this empty pack and have everybody there and I'm like,
all right,

292
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.510
just hang on,
hang on for a second.
I'm just going to throw this rock on my pack.

293
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.480
And I like Lyft.
At first time I'd ever touched it.
And I was like,
wow,

294
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.370
this is more than 70 pounds.

295
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.840
And so I ended up getting it up to the top and then we tried to take pictures

296
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:48.230
trying to,

297
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.440
I couldn't even lift that thing over my head because a rock is just weird,
uh,

298
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.700
to lift.
And,
um,
so I ended up taking it down off the mountain.
I'm like,

299
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.220
obviously there's more than 70.
I want to figure out how much it is.

300
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:02.640
So it was 130 pounds,
but,
but it was just kind of on a whim,

301
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:06.090
I guess is how that came about.
And now I just,
now it's just my rock.

302
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.550
No,
it's your workout,
right?
It is.

303
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.030
You allowed to just pull rocks out of the forest.

304
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:15.540
Is there any regulations about that?
I may have poached that rock.

305
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.770
No,
it's still there.
It's,
I just carried up and down.
I never take it.

306
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.680
I took it to the gym to weigh it,
but it's back.

307
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:24.180
It's up on the mountain right now.
Okay.

308
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.210
So what would you do if you came there and you saw someone else throw that rock

309
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:29.970
in their backpack?
He like,
hey man,
there and it,
was he going to do it?

310
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.890
Somebody did.
I think they had seen the rock talked about.
So I said,
hey,

311
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.910
you know,
people are people kind of,
you know,

312
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.800
people question everything for whatever reason.
Sure.
And so they like,
oh,

313
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.290
that's not a hard 30 pounds.
I'm like,
okay,
well here it is.

314
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.310
Go pack it to wherever you want.
And Way.

315
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.770
So somebody did move at like 20 yards and I did notice that.

316
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.530
But other than that,
it just kind of sits wherever I leave it that well.

317
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.370
If it's heavy enough,

318
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:57.130
it's good that nobody will steal it or most people won't steal it,
I should say.

319
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.710
Obviously I don't think they're gonna steal it.
Now,

320
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:01.500
when you take that rock up to the top of the mountain,
how often you do this?

321
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.510
I do it about once a week.
Once a week?
Yeah.
That's kind of wow.

322
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.320
I mix it up and that's my once a week type,
something different.
Other than that,

323
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:14.790
I usually just run the mountain.
So once a week.
Once every seven days.

324
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:19.610
You carry that?
How far are you carrying it?
It's a mile and a half g's.
Yes.

325
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.710
Oh yeah.
That hurts my lower back.
Just thinking about it.
Yeah,
me too.
Oh,

326
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.120
that is there any danger of like doing,

327
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:33.090
that's like some serious weight that you're carrying on your back like that it's

328
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:36.950
an awkward way to carry weight.
Yeah.
Do it like once a week.
Yeah.

329
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.840
I tried to think on bulletproof,
but I've found out that I'm not and so,

330
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.220
yeah.
And that's it.
Yeah,
that's the trail right there.
So wow.
With the rock.

331
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.380
That's some serious work,

332
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:54.330
like the amount of actual physical kinetic work that you have to do to go up a

333
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:58.380
hill with 130 pound rock on your back like that.
Like,

334
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.690
man,
that's got to get you in some insane shape.
Know it helps,
you know,

335
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:06.750
I mean,
it's just every,
everything helps mixing it up.

336
00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:09.630
I do a lot of different things,
but that's just one of them.
Now,

337
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:12.900
was this something that you would always done and then when you got into hunting

338
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:15.150
you just sort of ramped it up or did you,

339
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.630
did you like really get into fitness once you became a hunter?

340
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.800
That's another shirt I have,
you know,
ramp it up.
Oh really?
Is it really?
Yeah,

341
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:27.740
it is.
Oh,
no kidding.
But,
uh,
no,
let's see.
So I started bow hunting.
I was,
um,

342
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.290
just a teenager and uh,
it was,

343
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:35.610
I ended up killing a spike bull elk my very first year.
I think it was 18 or 19.

344
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.810
And uh,
that was,
you know,
to kill a bowl with the bow where I came from.

345
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:44.060
A real small town.
I mean 20 some kids in my graduating class and so,
um,

346
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.640
a lot of people hunted but to kill a bowl with a bow like special.

347
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.310
<v 3>And so I got attention for that.</v>

348
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.090
I was like this some positive reinforcement and I'm like,
you know,

349
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.390
this after high school,
after the high school sports and all that,

350
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.440
and trying to find my way,
trying to figure out what the heck I was going to do.

351
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.190
And so I liked hunting.
I liked the challenge of it.

352
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.910
I got some positive reinforcement from it.
So I'm like,
Hey,
this is pretty cool.

353
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:13.030
Cause I didn't hardly know anybody who'd killed a bolt with a bow back then.

354
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.180
And so,
uh,
I was successful.

355
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:20.320
But from there I just wanted more one or more of a challenge.
And then,
you know,

356
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.070
I started going into the wilderness into the Oregon's biggest wilderness eagle

357
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:28.360
cap wilderness.
It's 375,000 acres and uh,

358
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.430
so he can get back in there,
away from people.
And I thought,

359
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:33.520
well now I want to go to the middle of this wilderness,

360
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:38.500
cause that would be even more bad ass.
And if I,
he killed a bull back there,
man,

361
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:39.430
that would be the ultimate.

362
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.730
And so it was just kinda from there I realized how the physical part of bow

363
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:49.210
hunting where,
where it,
you know,
it was more important.
And so I just,

364
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.680
it's kind of a progression,
you know,

365
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:54.130
I've always always ran 10 k's and different things like that,

366
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:56.740
but I figured,
man,

367
00:21:56.741 --> 00:22:01.300
you can't be in too good a shape to,
to challenge that country.

368
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.690
And,
uh,
so I've just,
you know,
I've never,

369
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:07.930
I haven't reached my limit and I'm trying to,
to try to become,

370
00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:09.790
what I always say is the ultimate predator.

371
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.990
<v 0>So it becomes,
uh,</v>

372
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.860
a part of like your,
your whole psyche.

373
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.340
It becomes a part of like what you're doing with your life and it comes,

374
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.710
the challenge of it becomes almost as important as what you're doing itself.

375
00:22:25.861 --> 00:22:29.400
Like you're not just going out and getting it out for me,
you know,

376
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.550
which I'm sure you enjoy elk meat,
but it's also,
it's,
it's,

377
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.880
it's almost sort of like a spiritual quest.

378
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.770
<v 3>Oh yeah.
I mean the,
you know,</v>

379
00:22:37.771 --> 00:22:40.260
the most powerful moments I've had have been in the mountains,

380
00:22:40.261 --> 00:22:45.261
in the wilderness after killing a bull because everything that goes into it,

381
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.140
you know,
it's not just the fact that I killed an animal,
it's,
uh,

382
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.600
it's how much I respect animal,

383
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.540
how tough the country is back all the training.

384
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.720
It's just a cumulation of all that work and all that investment of emotion and

385
00:23:00.691 --> 00:23:05.000
everything else.
And so that's,
yeah,
it is,
it's spiritual.
I mean,
um,

386
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.250
by herself back there is a,
as raw as it gets.
It's tough.
And

387
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.080
<v 0>eating the animal that you,
you've killed.
Uh,</v>

388
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.300
for I just started hunting.
I've been only been hunting little over a year,

389
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.480
year and a half.
And for me,
uh,

390
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.590
the most delicious meals and most satisfying meals I've ever had is venison that

391
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:28.340
I,
that I've killed myself.
If there's something,
something intimate about it,

392
00:23:28.341 --> 00:23:32.360
I guess it's something,
Ma,
you're much more attached to what you're,

393
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.960
what you're eating.
And you know,
I've never killed anything with a ball,

394
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:40.640
much less a 1200 pound bull elk with a bow in the middle of the woods.
I mean,

395
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.100
that's got to ramp it up another notch.

396
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.390
It's amazing because he was shooting with a rifle,
you know,

397
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.420
I shot that mule deer from 200 yards away.
That's a pretty far,
yeah.
You know,

398
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:53.750
you're shooting these animals 30,
40 yards away from you and your,

399
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.600
and they're huge.
Yeah.

400
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.400
<v 3>No,
they're,
I mean,
they don't commit suicide.
They are,
you know,</v>

401
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.920
they're used to lions.
They're used to being hunted.

402
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.850
So to get into bow range in their red zone,
so to speak,
you know,

403
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:12.620
that 30 to 40 yards,
um,
that's difficult.
They're dialed in.

404
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.280
They're used to being hunted every single day.
I mean,
they're,

405
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.160
they're never turned off.
And so,
uh,
yeah,
it's tough.

406
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:22.370
And then you have just basically a sharp stick,
you know,
one Arrow,

407
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.710
you've got the arrows lane over there and it's just,

408
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.750
it's amazing how lethal with the razor sharp broadhead an Arrow can be.
And,

409
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:33.230
uh,
I've seen,
you know,
there's videos of,

410
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.850
of bull huge bowls I've killed dropping in seconds just from that,
you know,

411
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:42.100
quicker.
Even then maybe a rifle would kill him.
And that's,
uh,
you know,

412
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:43.130
that's pretty amazing.

413
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.650
<v 0>That is pretty amazing.
Well,</v>

414
00:24:44.651 --> 00:24:47.440
one of the things about you is because of all your training,

415
00:24:47.441 --> 00:24:50.260
because of all this lifting and exercise that you do,

416
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.880
you shoot a really heavy bow,
you shoot a 90 pound compound bow,

417
00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.810
which for folks who don't know,
like a lot of people,
they'll,

418
00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.610
it'll tell you like you don't need to shoot anything more than 60 but 90 I've

419
00:25:03.611 --> 00:25:06.460
never even heard of anybody shooting at 90 I never even pulled one until I

420
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:11.230
pulled yours.
I mean that's a ridiculously,
I mean that's pretty stout.
Yeah.

421
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.093
So you're,

422
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.280
you're sort of like adding to like this whole reason why he or you're exercising

423
00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:22.510
and all this fitness and getting,
you know,
really strong in really great shape.

424
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.471
You know,
you're,
you're,

425
00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:26.950
you kind of have to be in great shape just to use the very weapon that used to

426
00:25:26.951 --> 00:25:27.880
take these animals out.

427
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.650
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
and that's true.
You don't,</v>

428
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.830
you don't necessarily have to shoot 90 pounds.
I mean,
people do kill,

429
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.370
there's women out there bow hunting who are very successful with 50 pound bow.

430
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.730
It's true.
You can do it,
but you know,

431
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.830
I want to shoot 90 um,
I what I want on an animal's,
I want two holes.

432
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:48.500
I want that Arielle blowing through.
So I have two blood,

433
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.520
two wholes spilling blood and that's how I'm going to recover the animal.

434
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.540
You know,
an Arrow kills from hemorrhage,
so not from shock like a,

435
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.440
like a rifle would.

436
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.470
So to get that hemorrhage whereas a 50 pound Belmont going halfway and it might

437
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.130
get into the lungs and it might kill it.
You know,

438
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:08.510
you might get 12 inches of penetration.
If I go clear through that bowl and it's,

439
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:10.790
you know,
maybe 24 inches across,

440
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:15.791
well there's a 24 inch wound as opposed to 12 inch row wound in killing by

441
00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:19.250
hemorrhage.
And so it's just going to be that much more lethal in my mind.

442
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.030
And then if I'm blowing through ribs or through a shoulder or it's cordone way

443
00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:27.050
hard,
so I have to go through maybe 30 inches of of mass,

444
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.140
I'm going to be able to do that.
Yeah,
it's not,
you know,

445
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.430
it's not necessary so to speak,
but it's what I'm comfortable with.

446
00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:37.250
And I think it makes me that more lethal of a bow hunter.

447
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.780
How many other dudes are shooting 90 pounds?
I'm not sure.
Is there anybody?

448
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.130
I Dunno.
Pr.
Yeah,
I'm sure it probably one or two.

449
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.190
<v 0>Yeah.
I'm sure there's,
there's some,
well,</v>

450
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.830
I just pulled it back and I was thinking when I was pulling it back,
I was like,

451
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:53.160
imagine pulling this thing back.
If you just climbed up the top of a mountain,

452
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.820
you're absolutely exhausted and then you have this one opportunity to see if you

453
00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:58.710
ever had that happen where you know,
you,

454
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:02.730
you're really exhausted to work to get to where the elk is and then you're,

455
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.800
you're so tired,
you have a hard time pulling the ball.

456
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:09.670
<v 3>No,
no,
I don't.
That's because the train hard.
Right?
Yeah.
No,
that's,</v>

457
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.450
that's never been an issue.
Um,
you know,

458
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.420
<v 0>but it's because you prepare for the average person.
I mean,
90 pounds is,</v>

459
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:20.610
it's really difficult to lift.
I mean,
you're essentially,

460
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.620
you're using two hands sort of,

461
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.770
but a bulk of the work has got to be in your right arm,
right?

462
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.510
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's difficult,
you know,</v>

463
00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.430
where I think would be more difficult as if you're sitting in a tree stand four

464
00:27:30.431 --> 00:27:34.660
hours freezing and then a buck walks by and you have a 90 pound bow.

465
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.790
That would be hard.
That would be,
cause you're not warmed up,
you're not active.

466
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.880
So that could be difficult.
But I did use,

467
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.950
I had that bow for a late season back home and it was cold.

468
00:27:47.951 --> 00:27:50.740
It was like seven degrees and I had been up there for hours and I'm just like,

469
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.160
okay,
this is going to be a test now if I can,

470
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.030
if I can pull this back and I was able to,

471
00:27:55.031 --> 00:27:59.500
and so well it's just because you trained so hard.
Yeah.
No,
I mean,
yeah,
if you,

472
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.410
if you,
if I didn't do what I do every day,
there's no way.
That's great.

473
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.810
<v 0>Many other guys are doing that.</v>

474
00:28:04.811 --> 00:28:08.920
How many other guys are like in shape and treating this almost like a sport?

475
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.850
<v 3>Uh,
there's more,
you know,
there's,
there's more doing it now.
Um,</v>

476
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.900
especially guys out west.
But you know,
I get,
I get emails from Georgia,

477
00:28:17.901 --> 00:28:21.920
from people.
It just,
you know,
and what I found is it,

478
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.060
like you talked about earlier,
it kind of gives your life purpose.
You know,

479
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.980
everybody has a job,
people have families,
everything else.
And they just Kinda,

480
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.630
they need to find something that can define them or motivate them.

481
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:40.070
And now all of a sudden training for hunting is something,
you know,

482
00:28:40.071 --> 00:28:42.320
before that was,
you know,
nobody ever did it.

483
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.940
So now maybe that is what's making a difference in their life.
And so,

484
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:51.300
um,
you know,
and I still get people who they don't like it.
They,

485
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.590
they don't like feeling like they have to train to hunt.

486
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.300
And so I get criticized a lot for my approach also.

487
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.470
And what do they say?
Oh,
do you doing getting shape,

488
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:08.810
really doing good and strong and healthy and so what kind of criticisms and they

489
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:14.210
come up with here though.
Yeah.
It's uh,
it's pretty,

490
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.800
I don't know if it's funny,
it's been irritating,
but I just kind of blow it off.

491
00:29:18.801 --> 00:29:20.870
But how does it actually irritated?
Yeah.
Yeah,
a little bit.

492
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:25.120
We're going to get tougher.
You got to work on that aspect of your training.
Okay.

493
00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.180
I do definitely.
But they'll say stuff like,
oh,

494
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.070
Cameron says you have to be able to run a marathon to kill an elk,
which is,

495
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.370
I've never said that I do that,
but you don't have to.
And uh,

496
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.720
or you know,
I've just,
I saw something the other day that says,
oh,

497
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.130
<v 0>uh,
you know,
my approach is what's wrong with hunting today?</v>

498
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:50.230
It's like I will be in healthy and strong.
Yes.
I Dunno.

499
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.610
Not eating sugar and not drinking alcohol,
eating healthy foods and working out.

500
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.350
Yeah.
You're,
what's wrong with the world man?

501
00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.850
Basically all these healthy fuckers out there ruining it for everybody else.

502
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.000
I know he's fat guys like to sit and tree stands,
blow farts there.

503
00:30:05.001 --> 00:30:08.800
They're upset guys.
Like you are out there doing something exciting,
I guess.

504
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:13.270
I don't know.
So anyway,
yeah,
I do get,
I get criticized just because,
you know,

505
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:16.360
hunting and hunting for some people is kind of a,

506
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.550
just to get away and there's nothing wrong with that.
You know,
you want to,

507
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.280
it's a vacation.
Sure.

508
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.730
It's not something you want to gear your life around and that's okay.
I get that.

509
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:25.330
You don't,

510
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.990
you don't have to train everyday if all you're looking for is just to get away

511
00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:32.560
and relax.
There's nothing wrong with that in any endeavor,

512
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.340
whether it's a game or a sport or even martial arts.
I mean,

513
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:39.730
there's nothing wrong with taking a martial art class once a week just for

514
00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:44.050
exercise.
You like my friend Joey Diaz,
he's,
he's,
he's big,
he's overweight,

515
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.600
he takes Jujitsu all the time.
It's not trying to get his black belt.

516
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.320
He just wants to get,
get his blood pumping and get a,
get a little,

517
00:30:49.321 --> 00:30:51.460
a little workout in there.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Right.

518
00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:54.550
And then I have another friend who's a,
he's beating world champions,

519
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:58.450
my friend Ed.
He's a,
you know,
a black belt and like one of the best in the world.

520
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.560
So it's like those both approaches are okay.
Yeah.

521
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.620
It's okay to be obsessed with something and it,

522
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.520
and pursue excellence and it's okay to just enjoy it as a pastime.
Yeah.

523
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.500
The problem is that the people that enjoy it as a pastime,
they're always to re,

524
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.670
there's kids,
this little nagging thing in the back of their head.

525
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:17.680
For some of them,
like especially the weak ones,

526
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.280
that they realize that you do it better than them or they realized that if they

527
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:22.870
went hunting with you,
they couldn't keep up.

528
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.210
Or they realize if they ran with you,
they can't keep up.

529
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:27.520
Or if they realize they tried to live with you,
they couldn't lift as much.

530
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.590
So they're like crabs in a bucket.
You know what crabs in a bucket I like.
No.

531
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.410
If you have a bunch of crabs in a bucket and one crab tries to get out of the

532
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:38.950
bucket and the other crabs grab him and pull him down.
Gotcha.

533
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.150
And that's what always happens.

534
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.060
I guess just that's the number one problem with the world.

535
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.290
It's crabs in a bucket.
Yeah.
The number one problem with this world is people,

536
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:50.560
instead of being inspired,
they look to criticize people.

537
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:54.190
Instead of looking at someone who works hard and does something amazing and and

538
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:58.450
looking at their own life,
they find fault or they find weakness or they,
they,

539
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:00.610
they,
they find themselves not to add up,

540
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:05.230
not to measure up and so they get upset and instead of finding that

541
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:07.840
inspirational and say,
you know what?
I do have a belly.

542
00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:10.300
I do need to get to the gym.
You know what?
I do drink too much.

543
00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:11.980
I got to stop doing that.
Instead of that,

544
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:16.240
they just start shitting on this one thing that causes them to feel insecure,

545
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.040
not even realizing that that one thing has the potential to empower them.

546
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.970
Right now.
I don't know if,
I mean it could be what's going on,

547
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:29.710
but 100% that was fat fucks to 100% what's going on?

548
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.630
It's 100% man.
I know it because I've felt those feelings.
I felt I've,

549
00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.000
I've felt insecurity.
I felt jealousy.
I felt all that,

550
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:39.850
especially as a young man before I figured out how,

551
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:45.070
how to train my mind and how to embrace someone who's better than me and embrace

552
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:49.970
someone who inspires me and look for it amongst my peers.
Look for it.

553
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:53.840
Even amongst my enemies,
I try to be inspired by people.
I don't even like,

554
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:58.300
you know,
I tried it.
Like if I find someone that I think is like someone who's a,

555
00:32:58.301 --> 00:33:03.050
a bad comedian who's a joke fif who's,
uh,
but they work hard.

556
00:33:03.051 --> 00:33:07.580
I try to take that aspect of them that works hard and only concentrate on that

557
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:11.990
and find inspiration in it because then they become valuable to me right now.

558
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:15.530
Then I can see the negative aspect of their behavior and that becomes valuable

559
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:18.440
to me because I realized it reinforces what's bad.

560
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.350
But then the good aspects of it,
whatever it is,

561
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:24.860
you could find just something in someone that you don't even like,

562
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.960
you could find like something that they do that,
that can inspire you.
Right.

563
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.990
<v 3>And you know,
I don't want to,
I get mostly all positive and um,</v>

564
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.000
people inspire me.
They say that I've helped her motivate them and this and that,

565
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.710
that inspires me also to,
to,
it holds me accountable.
You know what I mean?

566
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:46.100
Cause now I've created this thing and it's what I love,

567
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:49.340
but it also holds me accountable.
Like,
Hey,
I got to keep,

568
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.930
I got to keep it up for the people.
You know what I mean?
And,
um,
so that's,
I mean,

569
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.700
99% of what I get is positive,
but it seems like you remember the 1%

570
00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.500
<v 0>got to train yourself to not do that.
Yeah,
that's,
that's mental training,</v>

571
00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.010
mental training as well as physical training.
Believe me,
man,

572
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.720
I've gone through it and,
uh,
I,
what I say is,
it's like snake bite venom.

573
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:14.440
Like when a snake bites you,
if a snake bites you for the first time,
I mean,

574
00:34:14.441 --> 00:34:17.020
you're fucked.
You're,
you're sick.
You've got to go to the hospital,

575
00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:19.570
you gotta get an Antivenom,
you're in a lot of trouble.

576
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.620
But if you just get a little bit of venom,
a little bit of venom every day,

577
00:34:23.621 --> 00:34:27.580
over time,
after a while the snake bites and you're like,
bitch,
get outta here.

578
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.810
This shit ain't gonna work out.

579
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.880
You got to develop the ability to understand what it is.
Yeah.

580
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.360
And I feel sorry for people and when I just see ridiculous criticism,

581
00:34:37.361 --> 00:34:40.480
I laugh.
Like someone will come into my office sometimes,
like my wife's like,

582
00:34:40.481 --> 00:34:42.310
what are you laughing?
I'm like,
AH,
some guys make it fun of me.

583
00:34:42.311 --> 00:34:46.700
It's just hilarious.
I just reading what they say about me makes me laugh.
If,

584
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.240
if I really thought they were right,
it would bother me.
But if I,
you know,

585
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.930
if I have done what I need to do and I've done all the work and I have assessed

586
00:34:55.931 --> 00:35:00.550
myself and I'm objective,
then I can find folly in their weakness.
Right?

587
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:05.020
Yeah.
But you're an inspirational dude for sure.
Because you inspired me.
Uh,

588
00:35:05.021 --> 00:35:09.910
I saw some of your videos.
I said I like a guy who's going for things.

589
00:35:09.911 --> 00:35:13.240
I like a guy who's,
it's not easy to run a ultra marathon.

590
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:15.220
It's not easy to take 130 pound rock,

591
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.770
put it in a pack and walk up to the top of the hill.

592
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.770
When I see people doing stuff like that,
I get like,

593
00:35:20.771 --> 00:35:24.220
this is like ramps up inside me and I want to go work out.

594
00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.230
I want to go do something,
I want to get shit done.

595
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.880
I think people like you are really important though.
The,
the,

596
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.010
the type of people that do things like that,
they,

597
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.370
they provide energy for countless other people,

598
00:35:36.371 --> 00:35:39.450
whether you're aware of it or not,
you know,
I know that you did to me.

599
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.310
So I know that I'm not unique in that.

600
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.830
I know that other people who watch your videos feel the same way.

601
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.610
They get excited about it and you cause motion.

602
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.840
You cause you cause effort because of what you've done.

603
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.560
You get people excited and that inspiration actually causes things to him to

604
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:56.520
take place.
Yeah.

605
00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.070
<v 3>Well thanks.
Thanks.
This is,
you know,
it's what I love to do.
It's um,</v>

606
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.590
and it's just preparing for crunch time.

607
00:36:03.591 --> 00:36:08.330
Basically getting out there and preparing to,
to be the ultimate Predator or not,

608
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:13.010
not fail when all the press,
you know,
like when we're filming for a TV show,
um,

609
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.380
there's a lot of pressure.
These hunts can be expensive.

610
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:19.790
You're traveling along way away from your family.
There's a lot at stake.

611
00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.720
There's a guy with you who's being paid.
There's a big investment.

612
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:27.410
So I don't wanna I don't want to fail when it comes down to that moment,

613
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.010
not only for me but for other people who sacrifice.
So that's,

614
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.450
that's basically what the work's about.

615
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:37.660
<v 0>And I think it's cool too that you feel that people are inspired by these things</v>

616
00:36:37.661 --> 00:36:39.880
and it actually like motivates you to,

617
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.790
to ramp it up another notch to keep it going even further.

618
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:47.890
<v 3>Oh yeah.
No I don't,
I haven't hit my ceiling,
you know,
I'm trying to get better.</v>

619
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.510
<v 0>Just such a bad ass,
manly approach to life.
You know,</v>

620
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:56.490
elk hunting with a bow and being an expert at that.
Do you have a regular job?

621
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.610
Yup.
What's your regular job?
I'm supposed to be at work right now actually.

622
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.320
Oh really?
You got off,
you got a good boss know that I think I'm sick.
Oh really?

623
00:37:04.321 --> 00:37:08.600
Not.
They're going to find out this is,
this is a bad move then.

624
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.090
<v 3>No,
no,
no.
Um,
let's see.</v>

625
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.930
I'm a buyer for the local water and power company back home.

626
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.840
So I've done that for 18 years.

627
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.820
<v 0>So you do that 40 hours a week.
Yep.</v>

628
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:23.140
And so how do you find the time to do all this other stuff?
Just make it happen.

629
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.230
Wow.

630
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.370
<v 3>Yeah.
It's just what I do.
So,
uh,
yeah,
I mean I,
you know how it goes.</v>

631
00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:29.870
I'm sure you've been there before where if,

632
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.830
if I don't get my workout in or if I don't do it,
I'm just in a bad mood,

633
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:38.210
you know what I mean?
Cause it,
and uh,
so we just make time to make it happen.

634
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.103
And uh,

635
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.390
<v 0>just what I do.
Well,</v>

636
00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:44.530
this is the other part about working out about the bad mood part is that your

637
00:37:44.531 --> 00:37:49.050
body sort of develops this,
uh,
this habit of,

638
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.340
of pumping out energy.
Right?
You know,

639
00:37:51.341 --> 00:37:55.030
like when you get in shape and you get your body that really fit and you get

640
00:37:55.031 --> 00:37:57.420
your body used to exerting these,
you know,

641
00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.750
these big explosive burst of energy like lifting or Jujitsu or whatever it is,

642
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.770
your body sort of rec ramps up for that.
And then it's like,
hey,

643
00:38:05.771 --> 00:38:09.310
where's my release?
Right?
Like,
Hey,
we're ready to go.
Hey,
we're ready to go.

644
00:38:09.311 --> 00:38:12.150
Why am I going to fucking office man?
What's going on here?

645
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.890
I'm only going to kill something.
I'm going to shoot a bow at somebody.

646
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:19.000
What's going on?
Why can't I lift weights?
Yeah.
Hey,
hey,
this is kind of crazy.

647
00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.520
And you,
you don't have that release.

648
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.520
And I think our bodies are probably designed for a certain amount of that being

649
00:38:27.281 --> 00:38:28.630
that we were,
you know,

650
00:38:28.631 --> 00:38:32.050
for who knows how many thousands of years we were hunter gatherers and we

651
00:38:32.051 --> 00:38:33.790
essentially share the same DNA.

652
00:38:33.791 --> 00:38:36.880
So as human beings that lived 30 40,000 years ago,

653
00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:39.010
it's not much of a difference between us and them.

654
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.600
There's gotta be a lot of the old reward.
The,
the,
the,

655
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.170
the reward mechanisms of life like still in our DNA.

656
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:51.370
And I think that people who don't exercise those reward mechanisms,

657
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.720
you're missing out on a lot of what it is to be a person,

658
00:38:55.721 --> 00:38:59.950
a lot of what it is to be like excited by life.
It's um,

659
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.870
there's something like pretty intense about,
uh,

660
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.200
just fulfilling those reward mechanisms.

661
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.970
And I think hunting is one of those that I didn't realize until I started

662
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:17.230
hunting.
I really didn't realize like what an intense connection.

663
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.350
You're like your,
your,
your mom.
I want to say your spirit,

664
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:21.720
but that's not the fucking,
that's a word.

665
00:39:21.721 --> 00:39:25.240
It's been hijacked by somebody shitheads wearing crystals around their neck.

666
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:30.100
But it seems like there's something in you that like,

667
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:34.600
it opens up this weird path than like,
oh,
you didn't even know this was there.

668
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:40.120
This,
this Predator path,
this path of connection to the animals,

669
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.980
connection to the wild world,

670
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.010
going out there and getting an animal and eating it.
And,

671
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.560
and I don't even mean it in like a macho,
like,

672
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:51.580
look how cool I am way I really mean it in a spiritual way.

673
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:56.110
There's this weird spiritual connection you have to the mother earth when it

674
00:39:56.111 --> 00:39:59.350
provides for you to the animals of the wild itself.

675
00:39:59.351 --> 00:40:02.470
When you go out and you get one and then you,
you use it for sustenance.

676
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:07.300
<v 3>Yeah.
No,
and that's,
you know,
people who think it's just about getting meat.</v>

677
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.570
Like I heard,
I think you're talking with John Hackleman,

678
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:14.500
he didn't really understand hunting at all.
Yeah.
But,
uh,
you know,

679
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:18.190
did they think it's a kin to go into the store and buying a steak?

680
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.150
It couldn't be further from the truth.
I mean,
it's exact opposite of that.
Really.

681
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.440
Yeah.
You're,
you're getting meat and yeah,
you're eating it,
but it's the,

682
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:30.430
it's a connection.
It's the,
it's everything else that's,

683
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.190
that it's all about,
that's where the power comes from.

684
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:38.110
And a man without that,
I don't know.
I mean,

685
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:41.050
that's everything to me,
that's,
that's my life,
you know,

686
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:44.280
just gearing up for that is what I do so well.

687
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.870
<v 0>I do a lot of exciting things.</v>

688
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.730
I'm very fortunate person and whether it's standup comedy or whether it's a

689
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.890
working for the UFC,
the things that I do,

690
00:40:52.891 --> 00:40:56.410
I truly love doing and they're very exciting things.
I mean,
when,

691
00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.920
when the UFC starts,
when the fights are going on,

692
00:40:58.921 --> 00:41:03.690
I never feel like I should be anywhere else.
I'm always very excited to be there.

693
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.940
Honey is even more exciting than that.
Yeah,
the annex,

694
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.670
it's accessible to everyone.

695
00:41:08.671 --> 00:41:12.390
Whereas like not everybody gets to be the commentator for the UFC.
Lucky for me,

696
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:13.500
I'm the only one or you know,

697
00:41:13.501 --> 00:41:15.360
there's a couple other guys that do it when I'm not doing it,

698
00:41:15.361 --> 00:41:18.690
but they're not as good.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that.
I,

699
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.240
I think a lot of them are really good,
but this to me,

700
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.471
but you know what I'm saying,

701
00:41:22.471 --> 00:41:26.970
it's like that's a job that may be five people on the planet get to do as far as

702
00:41:26.971 --> 00:41:30.570
do commentary for MMA three and UFC,
WWE,

703
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.850
but hauntings,
everybody can do it.
Yeah.
A lot of people can do it,
you know,

704
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:37.430
and you,
that's the other thing that I really like about your approach.

705
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:42.320
You go on public land,
you,
you,
you do it in the national forests,

706
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:46.430
you do it in the areas where they're accessible to all these folks.
Yeah,
you can,

707
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:49.250
you can get a tag just like everybody else.

708
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.570
You get your license just like everybody else and you go out there and it's not

709
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:56.780
like doing one these canned hunts.
This is a,
this is,

710
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.420
this is really like the American wilderness

711
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:04.160
<v 3>entering into,
yeah.
And that's,
you know,
I have,
so I've had guides,</v>

712
00:42:04.161 --> 00:42:08.030
like when I go someplace where a guy's required Canada or,
or different places,

713
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.290
but,
uh,
we're,
I basically need made a name for myself,

714
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:16.370
was in the wilderness by myself onto the solo hunts.
And you know,

715
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:19.400
to tell you the truth,
I was worried.
I think,
let's see,

716
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:24.080
I wrote an article is either 99 or 2000.
I went with my buddy South Cox.

717
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:29.210
He's from California here.
The Dude,
you changed his name.
Now he's a stud.

718
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.730
He's north Cox is like

719
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.090
south stuff with the fucking parents hate him or something.

720
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.680
It would call them South Cox.
It's CLX.
Oh,
whatever.

721
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.180
Courtney.
Yeah.
So,
so,
uh,

722
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.540
we went and we both killed good bowls and I killed a buck also.

723
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:52.430
And I wrote this article about it and the,
the photos were awesome.
Um,
the,
uh,

724
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.580
just the whole experience is good and I thought this is going to screw up my

725
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:59.450
hunting because this is public land,
this eagle cap wilderness.
And uh,

726
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.870
this is probably the last time this hunting is ever going to be good because

727
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:04.820
people are going to see this and they're going to want to do it.

728
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.930
And now where I didn't see anybody for years,
um,

729
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.550
there's going to be tons of people.
Well,

730
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.390
the next year came around and went back in there.
There's nobody there.

731
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.830
And it's so,
you know,

732
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:20.360
I ended up writing a book about that type of hunting and still nobody was there.

733
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.100
And the bottom line is yes,
it's available to everybody,
but it's very tough.

734
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:29.720
And you're in year 12 miles from the nearest road and you're living off your

735
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:34.280
back.
And some of the most unforgiving country there is,
that's just never easy.

736
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.270
And so people try it.
And I've taken,
I've taken friends back there who,

737
00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:42.650
who I wanted to love it as much as I do.
And you know,

738
00:43:42.651 --> 00:43:47.570
we're back there for a day,
two days,
and they're like,
dude,
I'm ready to go.

739
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.400
And uh,
I'm like,
what are you talking about?
You Ready?
This is,

740
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:56.990
this is how this is as good as it gets.
They're like,
this is,

741
00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.380
isn't what I expected is going to be late her.
Yeah.
No.

742
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:03.980
And so the thing about it is just because you love it,

743
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.790
not everybody's going to love it.
And it's,

744
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:10.100
it's something that you can't make them know.
And so they see the photos,

745
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:13.550
they see the video,
they see the animals,
and they're like,
man,
that is awesome.

746
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:16.760
I want to do that too.
Unless it's in you,

747
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.940
it's just going to be a struggle.
And so it is,
it is available,
but it's,

748
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.940
it's still tough.

749
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.770
It's like taking someone who's a rap fan to your favorite country concert and

750
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.700
were like,
Jesus,
what's wrong with you?
And you're like,
come on man.
Yeah,
yeah,

751
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:37.290
no,
it's,
yeah,
it's gotta be,
it's gotta be,
yeah.
It's not for everybody.
Well,

752
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:38.170
that's the beautiful thing.
Yeah.

753
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.460
<v 0>But life,
there's a lot of choices.
There's so much variety.</v>

754
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:44.860
There's so many different things that you could be into.
The,
you know,

755
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.600
one of the real problems with life is people want you to be into what they're

756
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:51.540
into.
Right.
And if you're not into what they're into,

757
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:55.020
there's something wrong with you,
or they're not into what you're into.

758
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:55.943
There's something wrong.

759
00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.100
<v 3>Right?
Yeah.
But the thing about that is I don't need anybody to be into it.</v>

760
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.730
So I was just like,
so my buddy Roy,

761
00:45:03.731 --> 00:45:05.380
who I started hunting the wilderness with,

762
00:45:05.381 --> 00:45:08.740
he moved to Alaska and he's just a stud that he was my partner.
We,

763
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:13.540
we both like had the same mindset that there's no sacrifice too.

764
00:45:13.541 --> 00:45:17.500
Great.
We can't be in enough pain.
It doesn't even matter.
And he moved.

765
00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:18.840
So I'm like,
okay,
I need to find some,

766
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:23.290
I tried to find somebody to take and eventually I figured out there's nobody

767
00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:27.400
like really Roth.
So I'm just either going to quit hunting there or go on my own.

768
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.910
And so I just was like,
it's,
you know,
it's on my own.

769
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.260
And so that's where I started doing the solo wilderness.
Hans.
And,
um,

770
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.790
um,
you know,
this,
like I said,
it's a good thing about,

771
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.120
you don't need anybody else.

772
00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.320
People don't like doing it because you're so far out of your comfort zone.

773
00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:48.820
We're so distracted with everything that's going on in the regular world,

774
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.200
that being in the wilderness where there's nothing is overwhelming for a lot of

775
00:45:53.201 --> 00:45:57.700
people.
It's just,
I mean it's,
it's difficult mentally.
Okay.

776
00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.181
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

777
00:45:58.181 --> 00:46:03.181
I'm just being alone in the wilderness is gotta be like a very rare experience.

778
00:46:04.691 --> 00:46:07.840
Like people freak the fuck out when they're alone in the wilderness.

779
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:12.190
That's a scary thing for them because they worry about getting trapped.

780
00:46:12.191 --> 00:46:15.220
They worry about getting injured and not being able to get out and no one's

781
00:46:15.221 --> 00:46:16.570
going to be able to find them.
Like,

782
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:20.530
have you done to have a satellite phone and a backup satellite phone and a

783
00:46:20.531 --> 00:46:21.880
handgun just in,

784
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:26.980
there's a lot of fear involved in being in the actual wild itself.

785
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:31.600
<v 3>Yeah.
And they're,
they worry about stuff they make up stuff to worry about.</v>

786
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.480
I mean just to,
just to give him a way out.

787
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:39.430
And so that was,
and that was,
that was true for me too.
I mean,

788
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:40.630
it was overwhelming for me.

789
00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:44.110
I didn't go back in there in the mountains for a 10 day solo.
Huh.

790
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.330
Right out of the gate.
I went for like one night,

791
00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:50.230
like I went on a scouting trip and then stayed one night,
then came out.

792
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:55.300
And it's just kind of baby steps into it because,
um,
it's,

793
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.220
you know,
if you,
if you pull,
you know,

794
00:46:57.221 --> 00:46:59.200
I don't know how many people there are here in la,

795
00:46:59.201 --> 00:47:03.670
but how many people have stayed out overnight and in the mountains by themself,

796
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:09.430
it's can be very many people.
I mean,
it's,
I dunno five.

797
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.630
Yeah,
maybe.
I mean,
it's,
it's just not something people do in this day and age.

798
00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:18.130
And so it's because it's,
you know,
it's,
you're out of your comfort zone.

799
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.850
But if you can do that,
and that's why I became good at that.
And actually then I,

800
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.640
I,
I loved it.
I remember,
let's see,
it was a,

801
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:32.560
um,
let me think.
What,
I don't know.
Whatever.
I can't remember the year,

802
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:37.561
but I killed a six by six bull elk by myself and it was my best bull and I got

803
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:41.230
out of the wilderness,
has little Toyota four wheel drive.
I had this,

804
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.750
this bull loaded up and I was just so pumped.

805
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:48.190
Finally got cell service out on the highway and I'm driving home in,
uh,

806
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.010
I called my wife and I was like,
I was like,
hey trace,

807
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:55.960
I killed a six by six bull and she's like,
Princess Di died.
I'm like,

808
00:47:56.350 --> 00:48:01.180
what?
She's like,
Princess Di died.
I go,
who cares?

809
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:06.970
Killed a six by six bull.
It was just like,
you are so you know,

810
00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:10.660
to everybody else,
Princess Diana,
Diane was just like,
you know,

811
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:11.800
the world's going to stop,

812
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:15.790
but when you're back in the wilderness and you killed a six by six bullough,

813
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.970
nothing else matters.
And that's,
I just remembered.

814
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:23.560
That's the difference between living back there where it's just about,

815
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.660
am I going to find a place to sleep tonight?

816
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.970
Am I going to be warm and we'll have food?
That's it.
That's all you care about.

817
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.360
<v 0>Well,
we're inundated by information these days.</v>

818
00:48:32.361 --> 00:48:36.290
We have like constant information coming at us from all around the world,

819
00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:40.970
the 7 billion people in the entire planet.
It provides stories.

820
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:46.240
So anytime anything happens that's interesting or extraordinary or scary or

821
00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:50.060
disgusting,
you're going to hear about it.

822
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.960
And if you just sit in front of your computer like I do some days,

823
00:48:53.961 --> 00:48:58.370
like some days man,
I get on Twitter and I just can't stop clicking.

824
00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.690
I'm just like,
what?
That's not real.
Oh my God,
it has real holy shit.

825
00:49:02.691 --> 00:49:06.980
And I retweet it.
And then you know,
like you,
you could lose your day,

826
00:49:06.981 --> 00:49:09.690
your day.
It doesn't exist.
What you're doing is just,

827
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.330
you're just collecting all this information from around the world,

828
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:19.220
but it's not your life.
Your life is just Cameron Hanes,

829
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.920
left foot,
right foot,
left foot,
right foot.

830
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:25.610
And what do I see through my eyes were,
you know,
who's around me?

831
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:29.510
Where am my loved ones that that's your real life.
That's it.
But you know,

832
00:49:29.511 --> 00:49:31.400
he's sitting here wondering about whether or not,
what if,

833
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.300
when you shot the Arrow right as that Arrow hit,
that ball princess di died,

834
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:40.260
<v 3>that would not be fucked.
If that'd be crazy.
Maybe somehow some way I killed her.</v>

835
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:44.910
<v 0>Maybe that some good,
look,
there's a stranger.
Things have happened.
If you know,</v>

836
00:49:44.911 --> 00:49:46.970
if you believe in those things,
if you believe in uh,

837
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.980
the synchronicities of the world,
that would be crazy.
That would be,

838
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.470
that would be quite poetic because if,

839
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:57.180
cause if your wife's like Princess di died and you're like,
yeah,
I know.
Yeah.

840
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.570
Right through the lungs.
So it was a double lung.
She was in the form of an elk.

841
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:04.640
She was a spiritual elk,
right?
She,

842
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.480
she bugled and I shot one right through the lungs.

843
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:12.520
<v 3>She was hot but not,
not as hot as that bull elk at that moment.
So it was,</v>

844
00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:17.030
I dunno,
I dunno.
Maybe if that was like a eight by nine bull elk,

845
00:50:17.031 --> 00:50:19.250
it could've been her.
I don't think you're supposed to say she was hot,

846
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:24.200
I think is she was royal.
She's not really hot.
She has some royal hotness.

847
00:50:24.201 --> 00:50:28.290
You think so?
I think so.
Not My,
so

848
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.580
<v 0>I don't think she didn't just die.
I don't think she could get down.</v>

849
00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:35.480
I thought I thought she was partying when she,
she died in a car wreck,
right?

850
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.420
Well,
she was running away from the press.
Right.

851
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:42.200
Wasn't it like a Paparazzi situation?
The boyfriend,
she's partying.
Yeah.

852
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:44.960
She had a boyfriend,
right?
Yeah.
Was it was that was up.

853
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:49.520
She was breaking up with Prince Charles and she has,
her life was in turmoil.

854
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:54.200
That makes her hot.
I did not my type,
I'm not into that kind of check.
Okay.

855
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:57.410
She,
she doesn't seem like she could get down,
but that's just me.

856
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.330
I mean all due respect.
Rest in peace,
Mrs.
Yeah.

857
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.480
That's a thing though,
man.
People do really get caught up.

858
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.830
Like my wife tried to tell me some stupid celebrity shit the other day and she

859
00:51:09.831 --> 00:51:13.180
was going on about some things.
Can you believe it?
This said that and that's it.

860
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:17.510
I'm like,
I don't want to give a fuck.
I literally don't give zero.

861
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.680
I give zero fucks.
Like let's stop talking about this.
So much shit to talk about,

862
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.390
but those salacious,

863
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.070
gossipy things that gets people so interested,

864
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:31.100
it becomes so fascinating.
It become overwhelming.
I'm guilty of it too,
man.

865
00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.670
Somebody puts some thread on my,
a message board the other day about,
uh,

866
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.230
it's probably bullshit,

867
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:39.650
but it might be true that Bill Clinton had an affair with Elizabeth Hurley.

868
00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:43.070
Do you see that?
Man?
I thought about that shit all day.

869
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.540
I thought about it all day.
I kept going back to the thread.
Seeing what,

870
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:51.020
what recent,
what new developments first I got two things out of that.

871
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:55.730
First of all,
Tom Sizemore can't keep a fucking secret whenever you do,

872
00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.140
don't tell Sizemore who you're banging.
Cause that motherfucker spills the beans.

873
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:04.580
Don't trust heroin addicts,
but the truth,
that's one thing.
I'll write that down.

874
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:05.570
Yeah,
trust me.

875
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:10.670
And the other thing is I think that Bill Clinton is the last of the great

876
00:52:10.671 --> 00:52:15.050
American Presidential Dick slingers that Zit playboys,
it ends with him.

877
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.990
There's no,
you can't do that anymore.

878
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.170
We are going to be reduced to a c.

879
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:26.350
Not that there's anything good about being that guy because obviously he was

880
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:29.410
kind of a creeper.
You know what I mean?
He,

881
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.570
Bill Clinton was one of those weird guys that would just like whip it out on

882
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:35.270
girls.
Like if you talk to,
I didn't talk to,

883
00:52:35.271 --> 00:52:37.880
but if you read some of the accounts of some of those women that were like

884
00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:40.910
really angry at him from Arkansas,
he would get alone with them.

885
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:44.480
I just whip it out.
There's him,
Hurley for sure.
He hit that right.

886
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.940
God Damn Woo,
but that's it.

887
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:53.090
We're not going to have any more of those,
those guys.
No,
no,

888
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.870
and when you're talking about different things,
here's how it,

889
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.640
how it affects me.
So people talk about,
well,
Obama did this,

890
00:53:01.641 --> 00:53:04.880
this or that.
I'm like,
okay,
do I have to go to work tomorrow?

891
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.790
Because if I have to go to work tomorrow and not much has changed in my life,

892
00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:11.870
if I don't have to go to work for some reason,
then I'll start paying attention.

893
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.970
That sound,
that's how I figured it out.
Well,

894
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:17.740
that's a good way to look at your own life and that's a good way to,

895
00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:18.920
to manage your own life.

896
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:23.300
The problem of course is that this is supposed to be some sort of a community.

897
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:27.630
Are Our country supposed to be some big giant community and the people that are

898
00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:31.260
running this community that are in charge of dictating the rules and the

899
00:53:31.261 --> 00:53:34.200
regulations are clearly screwing it up.

900
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.100
Clearly this is not the optimum way to run any country.

901
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:43.530
I don't know if it's possible to optimally run a country with the mess that's

902
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:47.900
been created before the people that got into power in power before,

903
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.330
before they got into positions of,
of,
of,
of having any control.

904
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:56.570
There's probably so much bureaucracy and crazy shit behind the scenes as far as

905
00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:03.051
like special interest groups and lobbyists and the massive web is probably so

906
00:54:04.111 --> 00:54:06.270
deep.
You can never hack through it all,

907
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.290
clean it all up and and come up with some sort of a rational system.

908
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:12.870
So you've got two options.
One,

909
00:54:12.871 --> 00:54:16.560
you could obsess on it and work feverish visually until your fucking heart stops

910
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:20.920
beating and then you die and angry person.
This system sucks,
boom,

911
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.900
and it pump your heart blows in your chest and you fall down and shit your pants

912
00:54:24.901 --> 00:54:29.520
and die in agony.
Or You just live your life saying,
okay,

913
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.850
I'm going to leave that shit to somebody else,
let them run it,

914
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:36.480
and I'm going to go wandering through the woods with pointy sticks.

915
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.560
I like your approach better.
Well,
I think whoever is running the country,

916
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:43.750
they do a much better job.
If they were bow hunters,

917
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.430
if they had been in the mountains and actually tried to survive and then maybe

918
00:54:47.431 --> 00:54:51.150
even killed an animal and,
and that was took it back to their family,

919
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.940
I think they'd probably be a better commander in chief.

920
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.180
I think that's probably true.
I think if they were a martial artists,

921
00:54:57.181 --> 00:54:59.220
they'd probably be a better commander in chief.
I mean,

922
00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:02.520
I'm not a huge fan of Putin.
I think Putin has kind of a psycho,

923
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.230
but I respect the fact that he's a black belt in judo and he is a,
you know,

924
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:10.590
he's a real martial artist and he sort of carries himself in that way.

925
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.700
Like if Obama and Putin were going to throw down,
poon would fuck Obama up.

926
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:18.150
That bothers me that that disturbs me.
You know,
I,

927
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:22.450
I wished my president could kick a little ass.
Hello.
Nothing.

928
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.740
It's the most important thing in the world.
But supposedly he plays basketball,

929
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:27.810
whichever video clip I was seeing to him playing basketball,

930
00:55:27.811 --> 00:55:29.130
he looks like he sucks at that too.

931
00:55:29.131 --> 00:55:33.420
So supposedly plays pool and I'll fucking give him the six out in the brakes

932
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.710
anytime he went to gamble.
It's do it,
do it.
Obama,
come on.
You've got to spot.

933
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:42.210
I think,
um,
I think that any,
any like very,

934
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:44.400
very difficult thing that anybody does,

935
00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:48.510
whether it's bow hunting or martial arts or anything where it's incredibly

936
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:51.910
difficult to accomplish something,
it sort of separates the,
the,

937
00:55:51.911 --> 00:55:55.800
the people that will quit from the people that figure out a way to succeed.

938
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.490
And that's really that,
that overcoming adversity is,

939
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.760
that's where character comes from and that's what the things that we all admire

940
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.720
and that shit's hard wired into us,
man.
The admiration of that,

941
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:10.680
like just as simple as me watching your video of you carrying that rock up a

942
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:14.310
hill.
I mean is it important that you carry that rock up the hill and the greater

943
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.440
scheme of the universe?
No,
it's not.

944
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.530
But to me it was because to me that day I was like,

945
00:56:19.531 --> 00:56:22.230
this motherfucker is doing some shit that I probably can't do right now.

946
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.120
And when you see that and like make sure,

947
00:56:25.121 --> 00:56:27.490
like I don't want to be able to carry that rock up the hill.
All right,

948
00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:30.940
well if I'm going to fucking start out with a 35 pound plate and we carry that

949
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:35.350
up the hill,
I'm going to work my way up to that big rock.
And that,
you know,

950
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.410
that inspiring each other and the,

951
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:43.440
the ability to push yourself to these incredible heights is really one of the

952
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:46.480
more exciting aspects of being a person.

953
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.720
It's one of the things that makes being a man or a woman.
I mean,

954
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:51.670
I guess being a woman,
I'm not a woman,
so I don't know.

955
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:56.730
I've thought about it sometimes.
Would it be like?
Um,
but it makes it,

956
00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:02.020
it makes,
it gives you thrills,
it gives you excitement.

957
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:03.280
It gives you like these,

958
00:57:03.281 --> 00:57:06.560
these feelings of accomplishment when you achieve things there.

959
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.950
There's some of the greatest moments in life.

960
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.250
And I feel bad for people that have never stuck their neck out.

961
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:16.930
I feel bad for people that have never taken chances,
not because they're less,

962
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:21.310
because they're not less,
they're just,
they haven't reached their potential.

963
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.290
It's not that their potential is less.
I feel like probably inside all of us,

964
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.260
we all have the potential for greatness in one way or another.

965
00:57:29.261 --> 00:57:32.220
As long as we don't have any obvious physical problems.
We,

966
00:57:32.221 --> 00:57:37.221
we didn't get delta a terrible genetic hand of cards with a disease or something

967
00:57:37.511 --> 00:57:41.290
like that.
But if you don't have that,
I think all of us have potential.

968
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.333
We just did.

969
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:47.410
I feel bad for people who don't at least attempt to reach a potential in some

970
00:57:47.411 --> 00:57:50.070
way.
Yeah.
And that's,
you know,
for me,
I don't know,

971
00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:54.140
<v 3>I didn't feel,
I don't feel like I'm any different from anybody else,
you know,</v>

972
00:57:54.141 --> 00:57:58.880
because I've been back from my early twenties I remember I signed up for a 10 k

973
00:57:58.881 --> 00:58:03.530
race,
6.2 miles back home and quit.
I mean,
I was,

974
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:06.680
had been partying,
I was,
I dunno what,

975
00:58:06.681 --> 00:58:11.210
19 or 20 and uh,
just whatever,

976
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.610
not in shape.
And I'm like,
why am I doing this?

977
00:58:13.611 --> 00:58:16.610
And stepped off the course and that I've never forget,

978
00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:21.420
I'll never forget what that moment felt like being a quitter and that,
that was,

979
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:24.350
that is crazy.
But the point is,
is,

980
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:29.750
so if I've been that guy who quit a six mile race and I've come and now you

981
00:58:29.751 --> 00:58:31.190
know,
have done,
you know what I,

982
00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:35.030
what I can do or what I finally believe or figured out I could do,

983
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.860
anybody can,
you know what I mean?
I'm not like crazy talented or,

984
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:43.520
or have all this ability that just is natural.
It's just,

985
00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:45.120
but it's what I've,

986
00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.260
what I'm doing and we're not chasing what I work for every day and I've been

987
00:58:48.261 --> 00:58:51.050
able to achieve what some might consider,
you know,

988
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.680
big accomplishments and I'm just a regular guy.
You are regularly,

989
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:59.680
<v 0>hi,
but you're a regular guy who puts it out there and when you put it out there,</v>

990
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:03.580
that's what creates that energy.
That's what creates that inspiration.

991
00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:07.720
That's what creates action.
Because people will watch your video and go,
man,

992
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:08.920
I'm going to the fucking gym.

993
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:12.070
And they'll go to the gym and they'll start lifting weights or they'll do

994
00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:15.820
whatever it is that they do that they,
they'll get inspired by your hard work.

995
00:59:15.821 --> 00:59:18.670
Then watch that video of you getting up early in the morning and going running

996
00:59:18.671 --> 00:59:21.040
when you don't want to.
When they see you tired,

997
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.130
everybody feels that everybody's seen that alarm clock go off or her that alarm

998
00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:25.970
clock go off.
I'm like,

999
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.960
I do not want to get up now that everybody knows that feeling,

1000
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.450
but it's overcoming that feeling,
right?

1001
00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:36.190
It's developing that muscle of discipline where you look at that alarm.
Yeah,

1002
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:41.120
hit it.
And you just just get out of,
you know,
I had an ex girlfriend,

1003
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.850
um,
back when I was fighting who,
uh,
she,

1004
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:48.260
she used to get angry at the way I would get up because uh,
you know,

1005
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:52.220
she had to work and I,
I was a comedian.
I had,
you know,
a bunch of different,

1006
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.570
like small time jobs.

1007
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:58.640
But when I would get up I'd get up angry because I had sort of,

1008
00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.070
I this thing that I would do in the morning,

1009
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:03.980
like before my morning workouts about training,
I would,
uh,

1010
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:06.560
the alarm clock goes up and I would get up,

1011
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:09.440
like my life depended on it so the alarm would go off,

1012
01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:12.350
I'd hit it and I just fucking jump out of bed.

1013
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.140
Like the house is on fire because I was like,

1014
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:17.220
that's the way to do it because anything else is weak.

1015
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.750
Like I had a real problem when I was young.
Like I didn't want it.

1016
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.290
I was so crazy when I was competing.

1017
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.440
I compete in martial arts from the time I was like 15 till I was 22.

1018
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:28.274
That's all I did.

1019
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:33.740
And I was so crazy than I thought it was weak to want sex.

1020
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:38.600
That like wanting sex with my girlfriend was like a weakness and that pleasure

1021
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.810
was a weakness.
Wanting to taste good food was a weakness,

1022
01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.590
and so I was going to be miserable.
I was fucking crazy.
It was completely crazy.

1023
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.720
But I would,
I,
that alarm clock would get up,

1024
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:50.480
the alarm clock would go off and I would get up angry.

1025
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:53.820
I'll get up angry and urgent and that's how I'd wake up.

1026
01:00:53.821 --> 01:00:55.230
I'd just wake up instantly camp.

1027
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:59.660
We got to go and I'd get my shoes on and do my run or whatever I did that day in

1028
01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:02.660
the morning and you know,
she would go,
will you fucking stop doing that?

1029
01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.190
You fucking try me crazy.
You get up.

1030
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.330
I think the house is on fire or something like that.
Yeah,
she,
she's overreacting.

1031
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.520
Got Rid of that bitch.
Got a better one.
It wasn't,
she was overacting.

1032
01:01:13.521 --> 01:01:14.570
I was fucking crazy.

1033
01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:17.720
I wouldn't have wanted to hang out with me when I was 19 I was a fucking maniac.

1034
01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.980
But you know that that's probably better than hitting that fucking snooze button

1035
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:28.150
10 times in a row.
Yeah.
You know,
the developing the discipline,
the,

1036
01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:33.110
the muscle of discipline.
I get that through inspiration.

1037
01:01:33.111 --> 01:01:37.130
I get that through knowing that they're like watching a video of you seeing that

1038
01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:38.210
alarm clock go off,

1039
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.810
knowing that you're tired getting up and working out like you a instagrammed a

1040
01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:44.090
picture from Vegas when you were at the shot show,

1041
01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:47.240
you look in totally exhausted and you're lifting weights.
I'm like,
fuck yeah,

1042
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:51.110
he's doing it.
That's what you gotta do.
You don't want to lift weights,
good.

1043
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:54.760
Go lift weights.
You know,
you're tired.
He's always,
always an excuse.
Yeah.

1044
01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.890
There's always an excuse.
But when you get through it,

1045
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:03.190
you realize like it's life is a lot of times not about doing what you want to

1046
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:05.880
do.
Life is about doing what you say,

1047
01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.270
what you're supposed to do or what you should do,

1048
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:12.620
and then knowing that when you want to do it,
it'll be even easier then.

1049
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.110
Yeah.
No,
I,
you know,
that's part of my routine and people always ask,
well,

1050
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:22.860
so what do you,
what's your routine for getting shit?
I'm like,
it's real simple.

1051
01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:27.810
Actually.
I got it on my shirt right here on shoot.
I lift,
run,
shoot every day.

1052
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:31.830
Well,
what about,
okay,
so every day,

1053
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.650
every day you don't take Sundays off.
Nothing.

1054
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:38.820
Every day you don't take a day off a week for anything every day.
Wow.

1055
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.830
That's funny to me.
Days off every day to the bottom.
I take days off on,

1056
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.040
I like days off and people,
people post,
hey,

1057
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:52.580
I would like days off too,
but I can't do it.
I just can't do it mentally.
No,

1058
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.880
can't do it.
That's interesting.

1059
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:58.140
But people have this one guy I remember he posted on my,

1060
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.370
I don't know where it was,
Facebook,
I think he's like,
he's like,
yeah,
you know,

1061
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:04.200
I've been following you for a long time,

1062
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.850
but you know everything you're doing that it's just too much.
I'm like too much.

1063
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:13.200
What?
Too much for who?
For too much for you or too much for everybody.

1064
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:15.750
And so that was like my whole thing is now I want to,

1065
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.560
I want to be the guy who does too much cause how do you do too much?
Right,
right,

1066
01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:24.120
right.
Too much for it.
I mean who determines,
is there a council that says,

1067
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:28.650
okay,
it's been determined you're doing too much.
So I know what you mean.

1068
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.660
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well we,
we used to think is too much is now the norm.

1069
01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:37.620
Right.
You know,
I mean if you stop and look at like as far as like exercise,

1070
01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:41.610
like think about like what people used to do for exercise and now what people do

1071
01:03:41.611 --> 01:03:45.540
now,
like no one trains harder than MMA fighters.
Right.

1072
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.350
And MMA fighters,
the,
you know,
you deal with a guy like say a,

1073
01:03:49.351 --> 01:03:51.420
you know George Saint Pierre or John Jones,

1074
01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.960
they're training twice a day at least.

1075
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.180
At least twice a day.
Yeah.

1076
01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:00.780
And they'll take off recovery days or like Randy couture,

1077
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.540
we used to take very few off days.

1078
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:05.940
He would do what he would call active recovery.

1079
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.950
So instead of wrestle lift weights,
maybe he would go mountain biking.
You know,

1080
01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:15.540
maybe he would do something like,
you know,
something like where he's moving,

1081
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.150
he's getting some exercise in it,
but he would do like,

1082
01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:21.000
what did we call an active recovery day?
Maybe go hiking,
you know,

1083
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:22.230
it would still work.

1084
01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:27.390
But you're forcing your body to understand that your body,
this is what you do,

1085
01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:30.450
Dude.
This is what your body does.
Yeah.
And it might,

1086
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.380
I mean for those guys especially,
and it might be for one minute,

1087
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.700
they're five might be over in a minute.
Yeah.
It could be.
They're doing,
you know,

1088
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:40.710
like I watched your ride the other night.

1089
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:45.630
I know how hard he works and first round over.
Yup.

1090
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.000
That very,
that was a very unfortunate ending too.
Um,

1091
01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.650
and it was very unfortunate for Uriah in a lot of ways.
First of all,

1092
01:04:52.651 --> 01:04:54.390
he went into that camp,
um,

1093
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:58.530
right after the Mcdonald's fight and he had an injured knee and an injured

1094
01:04:58.531 --> 01:05:00.490
hamstring entering into the brow fight.

1095
01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.140
So he had a pulled muscle in his hamstring,
a partial tear.
And uh,

1096
01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.060
his knee was fucked up so he couldn't wrestle.

1097
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.620
So not the most optimum conditions to be fighting,

1098
01:05:10.621 --> 01:05:11.910
not just for a world title,

1099
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:16.410
but against easily one of the four baddest motherfuckers to walk the face of the

1100
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:19.720
planet.
That Barao is um,
he is a beast.
Yeah.

1101
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:24.870
That kid is so good and he hit your ride with one leg kick early in the fight.

1102
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:27.850
We see your right leg give out.
You see that?
Like that limp.

1103
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.770
There's a limp that a guy gets when you know that Shin really slammed into the

1104
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:36.400
meat of the muscle.
There's this like stutter step that they give.
I was like,

1105
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:41.290
oh boy.
Yeah,
it's long,
long night for your idea.
And then he got tagged.
Yeah.

1106
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:46.090
Even worse that unfortunately he got Steve Rinella.

1107
01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:50.080
Dino's Steve or no?
Yeah.
Hey Man,
I'm doing a fucking podcast with Cameron Hanes.

1108
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:54.900
I'll call you back.
Yeah,

1109
01:05:55.630 --> 01:06:00.250
Dude,
call me if you want to get,
he wanted to get on there.
Yeah,

1110
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.290
probably.
He's like,
listen,
this guy's full of shit.

1111
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:06.520
You need a 60 pound bow and that's it.
This guy's a maniac.
Stop all your lifting.

1112
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:10.450
This dude's Goddamn Billy goat.
We went pig hunting,
uh,

1113
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:14.770
two weeks ago and,
uh,
you know,
just following him up the hills.
Jesus,

1114
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.970
he doesn't get tired.
Yeah.
He's,
he's,
he's,
he has no muscle mass.
You know,

1115
01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:23.560
he's just thin guy,
but he can go for days for days,

1116
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.530
just doesn't get tired.
You know,
I was,
I was shocked when we were,
uh,

1117
01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:30.850
in Montana because I'm in pretty good shape,

1118
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.470
but I was following him up these hills and I'd be like,
and he'd be like,

1119
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.540
nothing.
Nothing.
Not even breathing.
Having,
yeah.
That,

1120
01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:42.180
that's what really got me onto this idea of a,

1121
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:45.820
of exercise and hunting being together and that the hunting is a difficult
thing.

1122
01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:50.170
Is that you carrying this?
Uh,
yeah.
Look at the horns on that thing.
Oh my God.

1123
01:06:50.171 --> 01:06:54.220
Those antlers are giant doing lunges there.
Is that what you're doing?
No,
no.

1124
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:58.000
He just picking it up.
Yeah.
That's a good way to do it though,
right?
Yeah.

1125
01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.350
Now is that,

1126
01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:03.040
is there any exercise that you do specifically to deal with the fact that you've

1127
01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:04.690
got so much weight on your back?

1128
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:08.170
Because when you're packing out like that and you're only talking about the
rock.

1129
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.200
Yeah.
But I mean what I'm saying is to compensate for that,

1130
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.920
not just doing that and carrying the rock,
but is there any other,

1131
01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:16.630
like do you do like,
um,

1132
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.680
like those Roman chair exercises or something to strengthen your lower back

1133
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.130
because it seems like,
like your core and a lot of,

1134
01:07:24.131 --> 01:07:29.131
a lot of the areas of your back are really taxed your spine carrying a lot of

1135
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:31.750
weight on you on a pack like that.

1136
01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:32.211
<v 3>Well,</v>

1137
01:07:32.211 --> 01:07:37.190
I mean I'm working core all that all the time from planks to all the lifts that

1138
01:07:37.191 --> 01:07:41.030
I do to shooting a bow is can be core.
You know,
I mean,

1139
01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:45.020
you're trying to hold steady,
you're engaging your core.

1140
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:49.970
So yeah,
I do.
And running the mountain,
so whether I have the rock or not,

1141
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:51.390
I'm running that mound.

1142
01:07:51.391 --> 01:07:54.830
And when you're on an uneven trail and you're joking around and stepping in

1143
01:07:54.831 --> 01:07:59.660
holes,
you know,
you're engaging your core.
So,
and then of course we do,

1144
01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:04.490
you know,
different regular lifts,
dead lifts and whatever else.
So,

1145
01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:06.050
I don't know.
I tried to mix it up.

1146
01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:07.580
<v 0>Yeah,
I would,</v>

1147
01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:12.230
I would imagine that there's a lot of crazy muscle groups involved and not just

1148
01:08:12.231 --> 01:08:16.280
carrying that,
uh,
that rock out,
but just shooting that bow.

1149
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:20.090
Do you balance out your body because you're pulling so hard on your right side.

1150
01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:24.970
Do you ever pull your bow just with your left side just to balance it out?
No,

1151
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:27.740
I just,
I think the lifting helps that,
you know,
I mean,

1152
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:32.360
because lifting is pretty much,
you're engaging both sides equally.
So the bow,

1153
01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.100
the bow just is what it is.
I probably,
I probably am a little unbalanced,

1154
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:40.070
but you wouldn't be able to tell.
But just from,
you know,

1155
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.670
27 years of doing it or whatever it's been.
Yeah.

1156
01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:48.430
My friend Steve Maxwell was a pretty famous strength and conditioning expert he

1157
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:50.360
wore,
he works with a lot of people that,
uh,

1158
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:53.590
have imbalances like kickers in the NFL.
Right.

1159
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.790
And he gets him to kick of the opposite side.

1160
01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.860
And one of the things that they've found is that when you use your weaker side,

1161
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.250
um,
know,
like say if you have a strong side and they,

1162
01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:05.300
they found this with Jujitsu as well,

1163
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.950
it actually enhances your ability on your strong side.
Hmm.
So,
um,

1164
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.740
if you,
uh,
I find that playing pool too,

1165
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:16.180
I shoot pool lefthanded sometimes like if I'm playing my daughter,

1166
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.360
if I'm playing someone who sucks,

1167
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:20.990
I'll shoot to lefthanded and then sometimes when lefthanded comes up,

1168
01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:22.790
like if there's a shot that I can't reach right handed,

1169
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.200
I'll shoot lefthanded and if I practice lefthanded then my right hand becomes

1170
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:30.020
better because I'm concentrating,
I have to concentrate so hard.

1171
01:09:30.021 --> 01:09:33.650
He's my left hand because it's all like,
yeah,
it doesn't know how to move right.

1172
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:38.630
Taffy,
it's not thinking right.
And my right hand just falls right into place.

1173
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:43.130
They say that using your weak side actually enhances your strong side using
your,

1174
01:09:43.131 --> 01:09:46.940
your less dominant side.
Yeah.
I don't know if I could shoot a bow.
Laughs.
I mean,

1175
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:50.750
I know you could don't say you couldn't.
You could 100% yeah,
no,

1176
01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.880
I'll bet everything I owned that you could shoot a boat left.

1177
01:09:52.881 --> 01:09:56.240
And the only difference in between that is,
you know,
you have your dominant eye.

1178
01:09:56.330 --> 01:10:00.350
Yes.
Right.
So to shoot lefthanded I'd have to use what isn't my dominant,

1179
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:04.310
I have to use my left eye to aim.
Yeah.
I don't think that'd be a problem.

1180
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:06.680
You know what I started doing recently at the rain just started shooting

1181
01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:10.340
lefthanded because I was shooting so many rounds with my right that I was

1182
01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:14.250
fucking up my right shoulder.
Oh really?
The 300 win Mag.
Oh,
oh yeah.

1183
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:17.180
I was slamming that thing into my shoulder so many times.
I was like,

1184
01:10:17.181 --> 01:10:19.490
let me just fucking shoot a bunch of rounds lefty.

1185
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:24.180
That's why rifle on his bad because this,
the,
the,
the,
the shock,
the impact.

1186
01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:27.260
Just get a muzzle break.
Too Noisy.
It's definitely noisy.

1187
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.120
But I got these cool earphones that you listened to.
Um,
they're,
um,
they're,

1188
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:32.790
they,

1189
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:37.790
they cancel the sound out except talking like the sound of gunshots gets muffled

1190
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:43.700
radically.
Perfect.
I can hear you loud and clear if you're talking to me like it.

1191
01:10:43.701 --> 01:10:46.650
Actually I can hear you louder than I could with my ears.

1192
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.120
It actually enhances the sound.
Yeah.
My friend Justin is a gun nut.

1193
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:53.480
Told me about them there.
They're incredible.
Justin Martindale.
No,
no,

1194
01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.300
it's different.
That back deck.

1195
01:10:55.490 --> 01:11:00.490
He's a different kind of gun that Justin [inaudible] Justin Martin Dale is a

1196
01:11:00.771 --> 01:11:03.320
different kind of gun nut but he is a gun that

1197
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:09.440
science.
But um,

1198
01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:14.110
I found that like shooting lefty,
like practicing lefthanded.

1199
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:17.340
<v 2>It made me like so happy that I could go back to right handed because there was</v>

1200
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:20.420
so much better at it.
You know,
I think that if you,
uh,

1201
01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:22.380
well you're so good at shooting bone Arrow anyway,

1202
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.770
but if you did start shooting lefthanded but I bet it would make your right hand

1203
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:26.700
better.
Yeah.
Maybe.

1204
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.160
Have you ever thought about getting a Hoyt to make your left hand and go,

1205
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.260
I think they do it.
Let's do it.
Let's call Hoyt up to,

1206
01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:36.740
I just want to thank you and Hoyt for bringing me this awesome bow Hoyt,

1207
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.510
which is one of the best bull manufacturers on earth,
brought uh,

1208
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:45.450
this Hoyt carbon spider turbo for me.
And it is amazing.

1209
01:11:45.451 --> 01:11:46.171
We shot a couple,

1210
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:50.280
shall we actually have a little bit of a archery set up back here in the back of

1211
01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:54.590
the studio?
So we shot a couple of targets with it,
but this boat was sick.
Yeah,

1212
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.050
I have one just like it.
It's amazing,
man.
It's really,
really awesome.

1213
01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.820
It feels great.
I bought,
I brought the factor.
Yeah.
Yours is 90 pounds.
Mine,

1214
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.420
the one who brought me a 70 pounds,
which makes me feels like a little girl.

1215
01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.020
I have to ramp it up.
Yeah,
that thing's incredible.

1216
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.860
I was amazed at how hard that is to pull back to.
It's really hard.
Yeah.

1217
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.690
I mean it's like,
you know,
it really is like doing a 90 pound row.
Yeah.
You know?

1218
01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.090
Yeah.
I didn't know it.
And it's a lot of it's technique.

1219
01:12:21.091 --> 01:12:23.100
You know you want to push at the left pole with the riot,

1220
01:12:23.101 --> 01:12:25.320
but he has got a lot of power and that's um,

1221
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.240
I built that or had them build that for me to hunt those a water buffalo and

1222
01:12:30.241 --> 01:12:33.440
Australia and then I'm going to use it in Africa and Cape Buffalo too.
Yeah,

1223
01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.860
Jamie had that video up.

1224
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:39.060
Jamie pull the video up so he could see that a water buffalo,
there's a,

1225
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:43.230
it's a long stalk,
a long patient stock on this buffalo.

1226
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.980
And I would imagine you would want to get a bunch of trees between you and him

1227
01:12:46.981 --> 01:12:51.180
just in case shit got hairy and he had a duck behind one of those trees yet.

1228
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.420
The thing about this,
so these animals here is they catch,

1229
01:12:55.530 --> 01:13:00.090
they catch movement.
So if,
if they're not looking while you're moving,

1230
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.260
they don't,
they can't pick that up.
So it's about going slow.

1231
01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:09.270
And then if he looks,
of course I stop.
So it's just about,
it's like right here.

1232
01:13:09.271 --> 01:13:13.140
So I stopped because his head's up and so he can see out of his eye,

1233
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:16.890
I'm not moving.
I puts his head down.
And one thing I did,

1234
01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:21.240
I figured out on these things is they might put their head down and pretend like

1235
01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:24.180
they're eating,
but really they're looking,
so you've got to be able to tell.

1236
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.411
He'll have his head down,

1237
01:13:25.411 --> 01:13:28.170
but if he's not ripping and grass side decide he's not eating,

1238
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:32.370
he's just testing me.
So he might have maybe picked something up,

1239
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.310
but he put his head down but his mouth wasn't moving.
So I just stop.
I'm like,

1240
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.270
okay,
you're trying to,
you're trying to catch me here.
But um,

1241
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:43.620
as long as they don't see a move,
you can,
you can walk right up right there.

1242
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:47.040
And I get to 40,
I'm not sure what we're filming here,

1243
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.290
but we get to 46 yards.
And,
um,
the crazy thing about this is,

1244
01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:54.180
is I want to let his,

1245
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:59.280
his leg go forward so I can slip that Arrow in as its legs forward,

1246
01:13:59.281 --> 01:14:04.080
opening up his vitals and I waited too long and you can watch this Arrow and it

1247
01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:08.700
clipped a tree in between me and it and it hit the Arrow hit a little lower than

1248
01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:11.590
what I wanted because it hit that tree.
But I have,

1249
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.180
<v 3>you know,
90 pounds and so much force.
It was,
it ricocheted,</v>

1250
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.660
caught a little bit of energy from that tree.

1251
01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:25.130
What was lessened but it still went in and heart shot on that buffalo shooting

1252
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:28.240
it.
Yeah.
So Watch,
watch that tree.
The the curved one.

1253
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.430
So I want his legs to go forward
and you barely,

1254
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:35.260
barely,
barely caught that.

1255
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.800
But if I would have had less poundage that could have,

1256
01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:43.630
so right there,
that's a heart shot on him and he has no idea what happened.

1257
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:48.820
So he's taken off and their vitals,
that looks like a bad shot.

1258
01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:52.780
Like if you were hunting elk,
that would be too forward and too low.
But on those,

1259
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:56.500
that's where the,
that's where the,
uh,
the heart is.

1260
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.750
So you have to know basically write tunes.
Yeah.

1261
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:00.970
It's a little bit different on those animals then what?

1262
01:15:00.971 --> 01:15:04.480
We're here in North America.
And so you see he's gonna run into a tree here.

1263
01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:09.010
He's pretty wobbly.
And so,
I don't know how many seconds this was,

1264
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.800
but you got a 2000 pound animal with the,

1265
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:16.390
just a razor sharp stick and he's down in a minute,

1266
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.460
maybe a minute and a half.
That's,

1267
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:22.330
that's a lot quicker than they're ever going to die in a natural habitat on

1268
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:23.164
their own.

1269
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.250
<v 0>Well,
no doubt.</v>

1270
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.340
And that's one thing that people need to understand when you're talking about

1271
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.360
animals and hunting animals,
uh,
in know people that are opposed to it.

1272
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.250
They need to understand first of all,

1273
01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:37.180
that in order you to do proper conservation,

1274
01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:39.670
to take care of these animals,
to make sure that their herds,

1275
01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:43.390
the population is strong.
You have to call some of the animals you have to,

1276
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:46.240
because otherwise they're going to die of starvation.
They're gonna,
you know,

1277
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.760
they're going to get diseased.
There's,

1278
01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:52.660
there's a lot of issues involved if you're not introducing predators.

1279
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:55.660
And then if you introduced predators to take care of the population,

1280
01:15:55.661 --> 01:15:58.940
well then you've got a whole nother problem obviously,
and a,

1281
01:15:58.941 --> 01:16:02.200
and they're actually seeing that right now in parts of this country with a,

1282
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:04.990
with wolves when they reintroduced wolves.
I mean they're,

1283
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:08.050
they're really ramping up wolf hunting now and Idaho.
Yeah.
No,

1284
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:10.450
because the wolves are just tearing up elk.
Yeah.

1285
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.440
<v 3>And it's,
yeah.
Decimating population.
Yeah.
You know,
like in Australia there,</v>

1286
01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:19.230
um,
there's no predators.
So those buffalo there,

1287
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:22.500
there's too many of them right now.
There's no limit on buffalo.

1288
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.720
You don't need a tag,
you don't need a license.

1289
01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:28.740
They just want him killed because they're,
they're not native.

1290
01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:32.010
Those are Asian water buffalo.
So they were brought over to Australia.

1291
01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:32.880
They're not native.

1292
01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:37.500
And so there are so many of them where there once was water and there's fish and

1293
01:16:37.501 --> 01:16:38.191
all sorts of things.

1294
01:16:38.191 --> 01:16:43.191
Now it's just basically a mud hole because it was buffalo get in there and you

1295
01:16:43.651 --> 01:16:47.790
know,
they,
they piss in there,
they do live in there,
killed everything.

1296
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.770
So they tear up the habitat,
they tear up the Wa,

1297
01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.490
they ruin the water source.
And so now they just want to kill it.

1298
01:16:55.491 --> 01:16:58.200
So when I was over there,
I killed three of those big old things.

1299
01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:01.590
And you could kill 20 of them if you want.
They need them gone.

1300
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:04.360
<v 0>Wow.
That's the same thing with New Zealand as well.
Right.</v>

1301
01:17:04.361 --> 01:17:06.570
And New Zealand has an issue with non native species.
Yeah,
yeah,

1302
01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.270
<v 3>Yup,
Yup.
That's it.
You know,
you know there's,
if,
I don't know,</v>

1303
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:13.760
there's tons of non native species in Australia.

1304
01:17:13.761 --> 01:17:17.400
I think I see the guy who was with Adam Green tree,
he killed,
uh,

1305
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:21.380
it's not a Dingo,
but it's uh,
sorta like a Dingo,

1306
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:24.230
but it's not a pure bred cause those are protected.
But uh,

1307
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:29.090
so like kangaroo yoked to use the chat room is falling the Cameron Hanes

1308
01:17:29.091 --> 01:17:34.000
program.
Yeah.
That's would not want to tangle with that room,
man.
That's,

1309
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:38.180
you don't need to be that Jack to be a kangaroo.
See,
he's,
he's wasting his time.

1310
01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:42.950
He's getting crazy
now.
But uh,
yeah.

1311
01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:43.880
So it's,
it was,

1312
01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:47.480
it was good getting over there and seeing different animals and learning from,

1313
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:48.081
uh,
let's see,

1314
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:51.890
Adam Green tree and Owens Strawn are over there and they've awesome bow hunters

1315
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.310
and,
uh,
you know,
getting a new country is just what I love to do.

1316
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.450
<v 0>Yeah.
And the non native species things that are fascinating thing to me because</v>

1317
01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:04.040
that's what we're dealing with in northern North America with the wild hogs that

1318
01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:05.300
had been introduced,

1319
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:09.050
they were introduced with the Europeans and they've run rampant all throughout

1320
01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.250
California.
We were in a to hone ranch.
Oh,
right.

1321
01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:17.251
I went hunting with Rinella and they have 50,000 hogs and this one ranch.

1322
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:22.310
I mean,
it's fucking everywhere.
Yeah.
It's insane.
Yeah.
See these herds of them.
Oh,

1323
01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:25.820
and they tear they,
I mean,
they're written around tearing up the ground.
Yeah.

1324
01:18:25.821 --> 01:18:29.480
And they breed all year round.
They're just constantly making babies.

1325
01:18:29.481 --> 01:18:32.380
And so there's a,
there's certain ranches in,
uh,

1326
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.220
California in southern California.

1327
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:38.630
There they're begging people to come on their ranch and kill hogs.
You know,

1328
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:42.950
in Texas famously,
they,
they're,
they're shooting them out of helicopters.
Yeah.

1329
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:48.160
I mean they actually have companies that take people on helicopter hog hunts and

1330
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:50.850
that's what they're all about.
They just fly around,

1331
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:52.700
they find the hawks and they're shooting him out of the sky.

1332
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:56.600
And part of it is novelty and in that,
you know,

1333
01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:59.490
you get to hunt from a helicopter,
but part of it is necessity.
Oh yeah.

1334
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.810
You can't get to these damn things you do to reduce the number somehow.
Yeah.

1335
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:07.700
Not the non native species thing.
It's very fascinating to me and you know,

1336
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:11.130
just the,
the understanding of,

1337
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.740
of population control is one of the things that I've really become fascinated
by.

1338
01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:18.860
What?
By getting into hunting,
understanding what the fish and wildlife,

1339
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:22.910
what they have to go through in order to,
to figure out like what,

1340
01:19:22.911 --> 01:19:26.880
how many tags to give out,
right.
What,
what the numbers are that they need to,
uh,

1341
01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:31.610
where they need to let animals recuperate where they need to to to go in and

1342
01:19:31.611 --> 01:19:34.700
take some of them and reduce them.
It's a fascinating thing.

1343
01:19:34.701 --> 01:19:39.560
And one of the most efficient programs in our country as far as like you want to

1344
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:41.240
talk about like government programs?
Well,

1345
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.540
fish and wildlife is a government program,
but damn,
it's effective,

1346
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:49.010
effective and efficient because it's run by actual hunters and fishermen and

1347
01:19:49.011 --> 01:19:49.844
outdoorsman.

1348
01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:54.450
<v 3>Yeah,
no,
and,
and the thing about,
you know,
hunting people still,</v>

1349
01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:56.130
if you're not a hunter,

1350
01:19:56.131 --> 01:19:59.430
it's hard to understand or some people still don't understand why in this day

1351
01:19:59.431 --> 01:20:01.730
and age you need to hunt.
Well,
you know,
like I,

1352
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.690
I work with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.

1353
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:06.810
There is a number one conservation group out there and they've,

1354
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:08.790
they've helped protect habitat,

1355
01:20:08.791 --> 01:20:12.240
I think over 6 million acres now of habitat for elk.

1356
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:17.160
So that's from hunters,
hunters dollars,
you know,
it's conservation groups.

1357
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.300
So hunters,

1358
01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:23.490
the money we pay for tag and license and everything else to use to be in,

1359
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.850
out there hunting with the weapon.
That's what goes into helping these animals.

1360
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:31.290
You know,
elk numbers now have never been higher.
That's,
yeah,
we're hunting them,

1361
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.610
but we're also pain and con,
uh,

1362
01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:39.330
contributing to the health and habitat.
And for elk and other wildlife.

1363
01:20:39.331 --> 01:20:39.960
And that's,

1364
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.560
that's what people don't understand without putting a value on those animals,

1365
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.090
then that's where,
I dunno,
that's,
that's where everything goes sideways.

1366
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:49.440
But because we value them,

1367
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.560
we're willing to pay money and help and we got outfits like the Rocky Mountain

1368
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.700
Elk Foundation that just do amazing work for us.

1369
01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.170
<v 0>Yeah.
I know why we're their mindset.
I know,</v>

1370
01:21:00.171 --> 01:21:03.610
I understand where they're coming from.
The people that are anti hunting,
um,

1371
01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.470
it's the,
they're coming from kindness.
I mean,

1372
01:21:06.471 --> 01:21:10.310
they don't want you to kill these cute animals and they don't want you,
they,

1373
01:21:10.311 --> 01:21:14.960
they,
they feel like it's a cruelty thing or that it's an evil thing to go out to

1374
01:21:14.961 --> 01:21:17.360
nature and find these beautiful things and shoot them and kill them.

1375
01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:20.390
I understand the mindset,
but it,

1376
01:21:20.391 --> 01:21:25.391
like many things in life is not nearly as cut and dry as everybody wants to

1377
01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.020
paint it.
As everybody wants to depict it.
It's,

1378
01:21:28.021 --> 01:21:32.480
it's far more complex and complicated issue and they have a hard time believing

1379
01:21:32.481 --> 01:21:37.481
that someone could have a deep love for animals while still hunting them.

1380
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:41.890
<v 3>Right.
No,
it's a,
I don't,
you know,</v>

1381
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:46.150
I don't think anybody could respect a bull elk more than I do.
You know,

1382
01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:47.860
maybe the same,
but it's,

1383
01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:53.100
I think about elk hunting every single day and those bowls are man once,

1384
01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.231
I don't know,

1385
01:21:56.231 --> 01:22:00.850
I dreamed about killing a six by six bull elk or first of all,

1386
01:22:00.851 --> 01:22:03.040
I didn't know if I had what it took.
I just like,

1387
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:07.870
am I good enough or am I tough enough or can I even do this?
I mean,

1388
01:22:07.871 --> 01:22:10.000
maybe I can't,
maybe I'm not even capable of it cause I,

1389
01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:12.430
I could kill some animals.
Like it killed a spike bull.

1390
01:22:12.431 --> 01:22:16.420
I killed some smaller bowls,
but a six by six bull mature herd bulls.

1391
01:22:16.421 --> 01:22:18.130
What every hunter dreams of,

1392
01:22:18.230 --> 01:22:19.610
<v 0>and for folks who don't know what you're saying,</v>

1393
01:22:19.611 --> 01:22:24.440
six by six means six homes and I'm a size six points on each side.
Yeah.

1394
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:28.190
This is an enormous them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For folks who don't understand,

1395
01:22:28.191 --> 01:22:32.270
you're talking about the antlers antlers that are bigger than my arms.
Yeah.

1396
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:35.490
Longer and thicker.
Even then my arms.
Yeah.

1397
01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:40.410
<v 3>Kay.
So I killed a six by six bowl this year in Colorado or in 2013.</v>

1398
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:43.560
And it was about 10 years old.
So to do that,

1399
01:22:43.561 --> 01:22:47.970
he's been through 10 hunting seasons.
He's endured 10 winters.

1400
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:50.520
I mean,
tough,
tough animal.

1401
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:55.020
And so for a long time I didn't know if I had,
if I had what it took.

1402
01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:00.120
And that was when I finally did do it is when Princess di died,
like I said.

1403
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:02.760
And so that was when I,
when I called,
it was just like,

1404
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:07.510
all I can think about it is I finally proved to I could do it.
And that's up.

1405
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:10.010
That's powerful.
That was the first time that you'd ever done it.
Yeah.

1406
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.330
There's one right there.
Yeah,
that's more,
that's more than the six by six.

1407
01:23:13.331 --> 01:23:14.164
That's a,

1408
01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:18.580
<v 0>that's it.
That's a monster books.
He's got an extra time in there.
But uh,
pull up,</v>

1409
01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.460
pull up a video of elks.

1410
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:24.600
Bugling I know we played one of those before just so people can hear it because

1411
01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:25.920
there's one on my,
uh,

1412
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.340
on my youtube from Colorado this year and the bowl's coming up the hill.

1413
01:23:29.341 --> 01:23:34.300
Bugling and it's so loud.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
What does that,
what,
what's the,
you know,

1414
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:38.280
the name of the video?
Um,
it should be something Colorado,
um,

1415
01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:43.110
cam in Colorado or something like that.
Well,
Jamie,
you'll find it,
but the,

1416
01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:46.090
that animal itself,
the,
the,
the elk is,

1417
01:23:46.091 --> 01:23:50.310
is almost like a mystical animal to me because if you've heard one,

1418
01:23:50.311 --> 01:23:54.300
I've heard one call before we were in Mount Rainier.

1419
01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:59.430
We actually weren't even hunting.
We were looking for big foot.
I was there.

1420
01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.580
My friend Duncan,
he didn't find it,
dude.
We found them.

1421
01:24:02.581 --> 01:24:07.410
I just like to keep secrets.
I'm not like Tom Sizemore.
I'm not all blabby.
No,
we,

1422
01:24:07.411 --> 01:24:09.240
um,
um,
it was,

1423
01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:13.530
it was for the sci fi show that I did called Joe Rogan questions everything and

1424
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:18.480
uh,
can hear it.
Yeah.
If you go to like,
like eight or nine,
eight or nine minutes.

1425
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:19.363
Yeah.

1426
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:20.520
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1427
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.570
<v 3>Let's see.
Can we,
can we hear the Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh No.</v>

1428
01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:27.720
This is where I took a selfie of a bull coming in.
I was past that.
Maybe were,

1429
01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:31.650
am I right in there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Turn.
Can you,
can we,
oh,
there we go.

1430
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:37.420
Listen to this.
How far away is that?

1431
01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:41.320
Right now?
He's about 70 that's him.

1432
01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:43.630
That's so,
yeah.
Listen to this.

1433
01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.470
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:50.330
<v 3>And that's a carbon spider turbo.
That's an 80 pounds out of carbon.</v>

1435
01:24:50.331 --> 01:24:53.390
That's a spider turbo.
That's before then.
That was last monologue.

1436
01:24:55.970 --> 01:25:00.500
That is amazing dude,
that we'll just put the hair on the back of your neck.

1437
01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.113
Wow.

1438
01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.250
<v 0>And so you have this scope in your hand that's a spotting scope that shows you</v>

1439
01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:07.660
the distance is the distance.

1440
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:10.250
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1441
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:14.150
<v 3>Rangefinder range finder.
Wow.
So he,
he's about 18 yards right here,</v>

1442
01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:17.090
but he's going to get the wind,
so I have to try to stop it.

1443
01:25:17.091 --> 01:25:19.640
I did that with my mouth.
I'm trying to stop him before he smells me.

1444
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:25.330
So he spooked right here and he goes to about 25 right here.

1445
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.200
My son Tanner's filming.
Oh,
right there.

1446
01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:34.720
So it was a perfect shot.
And you'll see,

1447
01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:39.340
here's how you see how lethal a a bow is.
He's bleeding on the other side.
Yeah.

1448
01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.350
Heroin went clear through.
Wow.

1449
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.750
He probably doesn't even know what the fuck did this happen?
No,
he's,

1450
01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:46.330
he's looking for a bull.
He hears that other bowl,
his bugle,

1451
01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:49.660
and he just got in a fight with a bowl.
Now he's like,

1452
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:55.030
he doesn't feel so good.
Wow.
So that's it.

1453
01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.860
That's a dozen animals.
Seven Times bigger than you.
Yeah.

1454
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:05.200
And that was just with a sharp stick.
And that's,

1455
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:08.390
so that's what you dream of is about every bow hunter dreams of that.

1456
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:12.380
And how many of those have you ever killed?
Oh,

1457
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:16.400
I don't know.
Probably 30.
Wow.
Dude,

1458
01:26:16.401 --> 01:26:20.300
you must have the most ridiculous freezer at home.
Yeah.
Now the freezer's full.

1459
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.310
Definitely.
What kind of a freezer do you have?

1460
01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:23.960
Do you have like one of them walk in freezers?

1461
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:28.910
I have to just two freezers to big giant freezer in the garage.
Yeah.

1462
01:26:28.911 --> 01:26:32.570
And it's full of bear and elk and everything else.

1463
01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:35.390
You probably never have to go to a supermarket for me right now,

1464
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:39.140
we still like a good beef steak.
Every once in a while.
You know,
I buy a,

1465
01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.460
I buy my beef from Adam Laroche.
He's,
uh,

1466
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.560
he,
he has a ranch in Kansas and it's just,
you know,

1467
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.410
that beef is raised,
no steroids are no,

1468
01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:55.220
it's just free range and that's where I buy my meat from.
He's um,

1469
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:57.980
he's another hunter he saw on that show,
but commanders,

1470
01:26:57.981 --> 01:27:01.940
he plays for the Washington nationals.
And is it a all grass fed?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1471
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:03.590
I mean it's as good as it gets.

1472
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:07.490
<v 0>The farm that we hunted on in Wisconsin this year as my friend Doug,</v>

1473
01:27:07.491 --> 01:27:08.830
Doug [inaudible] and uh,

1474
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:11.750
he actually has cows on his farm as well and raises them.

1475
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:16.640
Grass Fed gave us some of the beef is delicious.
Macing people don't realize,

1476
01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:20.840
man,
when you're feeding cows,
these,
these diets that are unnatural,

1477
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:23.240
them giving them corn,
they all,
all fat and shit.

1478
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.770
Like I was at a restaurant the other day,

1479
01:27:24.771 --> 01:27:26.650
I tried to give me some of that way Goo beef,

1480
01:27:26.710 --> 01:27:31.400
like it's our finest beef might get that sloppy fat,
stupid animal away from me.

1481
01:27:31.890 --> 01:27:34.300
Shrunk and animal.
No,

1482
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:37.460
this one is they get them drunk off beer that they're feed them beer and

1483
01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:42.290
fattening them up when you're not supposed to have all that fat and the marbling

1484
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:46.640
now got a nice grass fed steak and it's,
it's,
you know,
lean very lean.

1485
01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:50.200
It's darker.
It's a deeper red.
It's more like a game animal.
Yeah.

1486
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:54.000
<v 3>It's not as lean as elk and um,
and but like you said eating,</v>

1487
01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:58.950
is that Steve Calling again?
Texting shut this fucking thing.

1488
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:03.000
I'm Steve.
Yeah.
How dare dairy.

1489
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:07.650
But I've been in Colorado in that high country there and that's about 11,000

1490
01:28:07.651 --> 01:28:11.640
feet.
That's up in the mountains and I killed a bull,
I dunno,

1491
01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.920
I think it was three years ago and we cut out the backstraps built a fire and

1492
01:28:16.951 --> 01:28:17.431
cooked it.

1493
01:28:17.431 --> 01:28:21.700
I actually put it on one of my arrows cause my arrows are aluminum and cook.

1494
01:28:21.701 --> 01:28:26.701
The backstrap skewered on an Arrow over a fire and I don't care where I've eaten

1495
01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:29.670
or the Food I've eaten is,

1496
01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:32.820
it would never be better than that right there in the mountains.

1497
01:28:32.821 --> 01:28:36.090
Killing or eating a animal I just killed is amazing.

1498
01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.010
<v 0>We did that in Montana.</v>

1499
01:28:38.011 --> 01:28:43.011
We had a liver and liver and heart that we had killed the two hours ago and we,

1500
01:28:44.341 --> 01:28:47.610
uh,
we cooked it up at the campfire and we were all just like,
ah,

1501
01:28:47.611 --> 01:28:50.900
this is in Christ.
So good.
Yeah.
And the taste,

1502
01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.840
it's so vibrant to like the taste of elk.

1503
01:28:54.841 --> 01:28:58.350
Elk is extremely delicious animal.
It's a,

1504
01:28:58.770 --> 01:29:02.280
it's got a really unique flavor to it.
Yeah.
Almost sweet.
Right.

1505
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.810
<v 3>Well,
and it's just,
you know,</v>

1506
01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:08.340
so I was as cutting that back strap on a rock dirty hands,

1507
01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:13.080
just a knife that I'd got it.
It's just like,
so whatever.

1508
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:18.430
Um,
I don't even know how you'd describe it,
but it's just,
I don't know,

1509
01:29:18.431 --> 01:29:21.540
it just feels like that's,
that's how it's meant to be.

1510
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:25.140
That's almost how it feels like I'm meant to live.
You know,

1511
01:29:25.141 --> 01:29:30.140
it was just out there living in the,
in the mountains and I dunno,
just

1512
01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:32.860
<v 0>powerful.
Even not killing an animal.</v>

1513
01:29:32.890 --> 01:29:37.330
There's something to me about the mountains that's insanely appealing.
Um,
I just,

1514
01:29:37.570 --> 01:29:41.380
I love being in the mountains.
It gives you this weird,
I I've,

1515
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:43.090
it sounds like very hippie,

1516
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:47.020
but I believe that when you are in these areas,

1517
01:29:47.021 --> 01:29:50.740
like when you were in a mountain and there's all these trees and there's a river

1518
01:29:50.741 --> 01:29:51.820
or stream or whatever,

1519
01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:56.020
I feel like there's energy coming out of those trees and there's energy in that

1520
01:29:56.021 --> 01:29:59.440
hill and then these,
these life forms,
these,

1521
01:29:59.650 --> 01:30:04.210
these plants that grow there in the wild and they're these vibrant things that

1522
01:30:04.211 --> 01:30:06.790
have existed without any human assistance whatsoever,

1523
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:09.850
and we'll be here probably long after we're gone.
There's,

1524
01:30:09.851 --> 01:30:13.750
there's something to them where when you're in that environment,
you feel it.

1525
01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:17.950
You might not even know you feel it,
but sort of like you don't know.

1526
01:30:17.951 --> 01:30:19.660
When you breathe in smoggy air,

1527
01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:23.050
you're just breathe in smog air and then you get to a mountain and you get that

1528
01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:25.690
mountain area and you're like,
wow,
this is different.

1529
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.690
And then you're around those,
those plants.
I feel like,

1530
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:31.300
I mean it's not like they're communicating with you,

1531
01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.400
but I feel like they give off a vibe.

1532
01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:37.210
<v 3>Yeah.
That wasn't after he smoked a bunch of potluck.</v>

1533
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.150
I ate a bunch of books,
he even stone cold,
sober,
mad,

1534
01:30:42.151 --> 01:30:45.840
but that the Pi would definitely enhance.
No,
I believe that too.
You know,
I've,

1535
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:46.674
I've been,

1536
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.980
there's this place I used to go and camp by myself and eagle cap and are just

1537
01:30:49.981 --> 01:30:54.930
like on this rock shelf looking over this huge canyon.
And um,

1538
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:58.470
so I was,
I was sleeping there one night and uh,
you know,

1539
01:30:58.471 --> 01:31:03.330
stars are out and just before dark eyed,
glassed about 300 yards away,

1540
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.280
a bunch of big horn rams and sheep are just like the holy grail of hunting.

1541
01:31:08.281 --> 01:31:12.780
Right?
And so I was watching these sheep and it's just like,
it just,

1542
01:31:12.781 --> 01:31:16.140
so,
I don't know,
it's so amazing that moment.

1543
01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.490
So I went to bed and my bivy sack there and I woke up in the morning,

1544
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.760
the sheep were still there except there was one less.
And I'm like,

1545
01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:26.190
I wonder where the heck that other ram went.
Well,

1546
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:31.910
I went over there and found a lion had killed a ram the night before.

1547
01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.890
And so I found his leg.
I'm like,
oh,
okay.

1548
01:31:34.891 --> 01:31:39.060
Well here's one reason why he wasn't with them,
but it's just like those,

1549
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:43.860
those rams or they're feeding a one got killed by a lion.
They're still,

1550
01:31:43.861 --> 01:31:46.710
they're feeding.
Nothing had changed.
I mean,

1551
01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:51.990
the wind was still blowing to,
they were still feeding,
but one was gone.

1552
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:55.980
And it just,
to me,
it's just like,
man,
he,
I could die back here.

1553
01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.340
Nothing,
nothing changes.
I mean,
you are just,

1554
01:32:00.341 --> 01:32:03.190
you really figure out how you fit in.

1555
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:07.570
Nobody see nothing cares back there.
It's just like,
that's just the way it goes.

1556
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:11.890
There's life and death and nothing in the wilderness changes.
And that's just,

1557
01:32:11.891 --> 01:32:16.510
to me,
that was powerful.
You know,
you feel,
you really feel,
um,

1558
01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:21.610
how you fit in and it's,
you don't have much of an impact really.

1559
01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.040
You know,
who needs to feel that?
Who's that?
Kanye West.

1560
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:27.190
Take that motherfucker bow hunting.
There you go.

1561
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:30.220
Take them bow hunting and why he's in his little tent and he hears what,

1562
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.090
yeah,
here's some mountain goat.
Get taken out.
Well,

1563
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:37.570
I think a lot of people could benefit and couldn't.
Kanye,

1564
01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:39.100
almost everybody could benefit.

1565
01:32:39.570 --> 01:32:44.530
But have you ever had any encounters with mountain lines?
Um,
let's see.

1566
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:48.910
I've had a shot at one.
I've never killed one.
I've never been with dogs,
you know,

1567
01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:52.570
hunting lions.
So it's just kind of been on happen chance.
But,
um,

1568
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:56.290
I was still in that same country and I was walking on the top of this cliff and

1569
01:32:56.291 --> 01:32:58.540
I was looking down at the rocky mountain to goats.
I don't know.

1570
01:32:58.541 --> 01:33:02.920
Have you ever seen a goat?
It's a white with the little black horns.
Well,

1571
01:33:02.921 --> 01:33:05.350
they live up and notoriously steep country.

1572
01:33:05.351 --> 01:33:08.590
So I'm up on top of this cliff looking down at the goats and it was just by

1573
01:33:08.591 --> 01:33:13.591
myself sneaking along and I look up further down the down the cliff and there's

1574
01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:17.840
a lion standing there watching the same goats.
So I was on,

1575
01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:20.200
I didn't have a tag for the goat,
so I was just kind of watching them.

1576
01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:23.500
They only give one tag for that area.
It's really,
really tough to give,

1577
01:33:23.501 --> 01:33:25.870
but still they're just awesome animals.
And,
um,

1578
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.860
so I looked down and there's a lion watching the same goats and you could see

1579
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:33.980
they,
if those goats get too high,
they get killed by the lion.

1580
01:33:33.981 --> 01:33:37.030
So they kind of stay a little lower.
It doesn't,
they figured it out.

1581
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:39.310
But that line is just waiting for one to make a mistake.

1582
01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.250
Why was just seconds from being able to get a shot?

1583
01:33:42.251 --> 01:33:45.460
Cause I had an ally in tag mountain lion and,
uh,
you,

1584
01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:48.100
you guys can't hunt them here,
but we can hunt them and in Oregon,

1585
01:33:48.101 --> 01:33:50.650
but now we're not with dogs,
but,
um,

1586
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:54.250
I was seconds from getting a shot and right before he looked at me and,
um,

1587
01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:58.900
took off.
So I've seen that line.
Um,
I've,
uh,

1588
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:02.210
I saw a lion chasing a cow elk back there.
They're,

1589
01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:04.060
they're a nocturnal.

1590
01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:08.320
You just don't see many lions out in daylight unless our hunting like that.
But,

1591
01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:12.340
um,
I've seen him.
Do you hear them like when you're camping?
Um,

1592
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:18.670
yeah,
they may.
Yeah.
You,
you know,
I may not have known what it was,
but,
uh,

1593
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:22.450
they do make a noise and like you need,
you've ever heard,
you know,

1594
01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:26.830
and that's lions and it can just tell him.
I Dunno,

1595
01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:31.300
it'd be hard to describe but a shot.
No,
I can't,
I can't do a line impression.
No,

1596
01:34:31.301 --> 01:34:36.250
I can't do it.
No,
not like that.
No deeper.

1597
01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:40.750
Yeah.
It's a no,
that's more like a bear.

1598
01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:46.240
But uh,
yeah,
I dunno,
but creepy.
Yeah.
Something.
Right.

1599
01:34:46.241 --> 01:34:49.330
Exactly.
Something that you were like,
that's weird.

1600
01:34:49.630 --> 01:34:54.460
Have you ever seen the photo of the,
uh,
the lion and the ram dead on the road?

1601
01:34:54.630 --> 01:34:58.130
Well,
they had fallen off the cliff yeah.
With,
uh,
the line and the ram

1602
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:02.570
<v 0>or duking it out.
Yeah.
And uh,
apparently they both went over the edge.
Yeah.</v>

1603
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.200
That to me is one of the most powerful photographs of the struggle of nature of

1604
01:35:08.551 --> 01:35:12.800
the,
the Tooth Fang and claw of the wilderness.
And that happens all the time.

1605
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:16.850
You just,
you or you just don't have pictures of it.
Yeah.
It's not on a road,

1606
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.390
but uh,
yeah,
that's,
they deal with that all the time.

1607
01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:25.430
Both of them deal with that all the time.
Yeah.
And you know,
it is what it is.

1608
01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:29.550
Yeah.
Nothing,
nothing changes that picture Jamie.
It's a crazy picky.
Yeah,

1609
01:35:29.551 --> 01:35:33.710
this is the picture.
Yeah.
The series of them,

1610
01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:38.420
the two of them lying down on the road.
I mean,

1611
01:35:38.421 --> 01:35:40.630
that is such a powerful photograph.
Yeah.

1612
01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:45.940
It just makes you realize like what an insane struggle it is to try to be

1613
01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:49.460
surviving as an animal

1614
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:54.470
<v 3>in the wilderness.
That's all snow.
Pile it up there,
you know,
it's cold.
It's,</v>

1615
01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:58.340
I mean,
they're out there 365 days a year trying to survive.

1616
01:35:58.341 --> 01:36:00.480
So that's why I think about,
I,

1617
01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:05.630
I think about what they go through when I'm working out and it's just like,

1618
01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:10.490
there's so much tougher.
I mean,
we're such so weak as a society,

1619
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:13.160
you know,
we're used to laying on the couch watching TV,

1620
01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:17.480
having everything while a bull elk is laying out there in the rain and the snow

1621
01:36:17.481 --> 01:36:19.190
and the whatever,
getting so tough.

1622
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:24.440
And so I always think about there's this gap between me and a bull.

1623
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:29.950
I need to close that gap because it just getting wider and wider every day for

1624
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.300
most,
you know?
So if you can close that,

1625
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:34.040
if I can get tougher and tougher and tougher,

1626
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:39.670
I'm going to be more on an equal playing field and be more of a Predator like a

1627
01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:44.960
lion,
you know what I mean?
Or a wolf.
How did you decide to specialize in elk?

1628
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:50.180
Um,
it was just the biggest animal near you in Oregon.
Yeah.
He's just like,

1629
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:51.050
you know,

1630
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:56.050
it was probably the most respected and regal animal that I could afford to hunt.

1631
01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:01.320
You know,
I didn't,
when I first started hunting,
we bought,
uh,
a deer tag.

1632
01:37:01.321 --> 01:37:05.300
There's like 1150.
I couldn't afford an elk tag because they were 25 bucks.

1633
01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:09.440
I was like $25.
There's no way I'm ever going to hunt elk.
And,
uh,

1634
01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.080
so that's just the way it was,
didn't have any money.

1635
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:15.770
And then once I could afford ALC,
um,
it was that year that,
uh,

1636
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:20.540
that I killed that one with the bow.
And,
um,
you know,
so I'm in at like 30 bucks.

1637
01:37:20.541 --> 01:37:24.880
I'm like,
I need to get my money's worth out of this thing between,
uh,
you know,

1638
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:29.540
I think it went up a little bit,
so it was 27 50 or something like that.
But,
um,

1639
01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.860
yeah,
that was it.
There was just,
it was just the biggest,
most respected animal.

1640
01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:36.550
A bull elk is just like,
man,
you know,

1641
01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:40.110
I could never dream hunting sheep at that time or,
um,

1642
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:43.530
buffalo or whatever.
So it was elk

1643
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:47.790
<v 0>and elk.
I mean,
if you've got 500 pounds of meat off an animal,</v>

1644
01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:50.550
what is that worth?
Moneywise I mean that,

1645
01:37:50.551 --> 01:37:54.090
what a bargain for a $25 tag.
Get 500 pounds.
Well,

1646
01:37:54.150 --> 01:37:56.370
obviously you have to pay your equipment

1647
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:59.490
<v 2>and your time and your food and everything.
Get Out.
It doesn't pencil out.</v>

1648
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:02.880
It doesn't pencil out.
Once you,
once you figure out the time and yeah,

1649
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:06.470
<v 3>you know,
you look at these bones right here,
these are,
you know,
shoot,</v>

1650
01:38:06.471 --> 01:38:09.230
by the time you get this boat set up here with arrows and everything else,

1651
01:38:09.231 --> 01:38:13.670
it's like 2000 bucks.
So you don't want to pencil it out that it's not,

1652
01:38:13.671 --> 01:38:17.120
it's not about the value of it,
you know what I mean?
So,
uh,

1653
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:19.710
it's just about more about just the

1654
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:20.703
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

1655
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:24.430
And why did you decide to go to Australia to shoot these a water buffalo is just

1656
01:38:24.431 --> 01:38:25.360
for the experience of it.

1657
01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:29.420
<v 3>Yeah.
Just um,
I wanted it,
you know,</v>

1658
01:38:29.421 --> 01:38:33.890
it's like when I'm not hunting,
I dunno.

1659
01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:38.270
Just being in my office,
working at my regular work,
I feel like

1660
01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.080
<v 2>I'm dying basically.
Do you really?
Yeah.</v>

1661
01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:46.081
I just feel like what your boss is listening right now know that it's like,

1662
01:38:46.661 --> 01:38:51.130
what the fuck can you like it here?
No,
I do like,
like you in the office.

1663
01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:56.320
Well,
I mean,
I like it there.
Damage control.

1664
01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:00.760
Sorry boss.
Hey listen man.
I felt like I was dying when I was doing fear factor.

1665
01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.840
I know what you're talking about.
No,
but I just feel like that's not what I'm,

1666
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:06.430
what you want to do meant to do

1667
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:08.870
<v 3>need.
I need a,</v>

1668
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.200
I need to be outside and need to be challenged and so I'm,

1669
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:16.790
my God,
what can I do?
And so came out,
um,

1670
01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.760
it was in December just recently.
And I'm like,

1671
01:39:19.761 --> 01:39:23.050
I want to go do something I've never done.
So Hawaii,

1672
01:39:23.051 --> 01:39:26.510
it hooked me up with Adam down there in Australia and I wanted to do,

1673
01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.770
actually when I first decided to go there,
it was,

1674
01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.660
it was just going to be to give away a bow.

1675
01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.800
What I do with the Bose after I get done shooting them for the year is I hold

1676
01:39:36.801 --> 01:39:40.650
these contests and it's like when camps Bo and I just say,
um,

1677
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:43.340
if you want to win my bow from last year,

1678
01:39:43.341 --> 01:39:48.341
show up at this time and beat me at any challenge or beat me in the challenges I

1679
01:39:48.531 --> 01:39:50.150
put out there and you can have my bow.

1680
01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:54.530
And so I was just going to do a Winnebago in Australia because I have so many

1681
01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:59.000
people that ordered my shirts and hats and,
and everything else from down there.

1682
01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:01.460
I'm like,
I need to get down there and see these people.
You know,

1683
01:40:01.461 --> 01:40:06.020
I just wanted to,
I just felt so much support down there.
Oh,
that's cool.
Yeah.

1684
01:40:06.021 --> 01:40:09.560
So I asked Hoyt,
I said,
I want to do a Winnebago down and down there.

1685
01:40:09.561 --> 01:40:10.910
Can you help me set it up,
you know,

1686
01:40:10.911 --> 01:40:13.040
with the pro shops or the archery shops down there.

1687
01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.910
So just kind of turned into a hunt at the same time.
I'm like,
yeah,
I'll,

1688
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:19.670
I'll do a Han also.
So that was what I did,
the hunt.

1689
01:40:19.671 --> 01:40:23.180
Then I did the wind Candace bow contest and it was just tied it all together.

1690
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:27.380
And what was the,
the condos would they have to do to win your bow?
Um,

1691
01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:32.240
they had to beat me at running a well,
so we ran,

1692
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:36.950
then we did push ups,
then we did pull ups and then we did 100 yard shot.

1693
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:39.710
So if you beat me at those,
you get my bow.

1694
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:43.280
<v 2>All three,
they have to beat you at all of them for,
for all four of them.
Yeah.</v>

1695
01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:46.940
And then if nobody would,
if they only beat you have three of them,
not the night.

1696
01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:50.830
Next to know.
Then I get to choose who I give it to a,

1697
01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.620
so I give it away either way.
I mean I'm,
I'm not like

1698
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.160
<v 3>you guys suck.
I'm taking my boat home.
No,
I just,
then I get,</v>

1699
01:40:57.370 --> 01:40:59.560
so the thing is I'm going to give it away to somebody.

1700
01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.480
If somebody beats me at all of that,

1701
01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:04.240
it's no questions is your bow and if nobody does,

1702
01:41:04.241 --> 01:41:08.030
I choose out of the contestants.
And so I ended up giving it to this um,

1703
01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:13.390
13 year old girl there.
And um,
I just liked her heart,
you know,

1704
01:41:13.391 --> 01:41:17.200
it was a hundred degrees and like a hundred percent humidity.

1705
01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:20.230
It was just brutal.
And uh,
we were running,

1706
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:24.190
we ran 12 laps around this,
uh,
like it,

1707
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:29.200
I think it was cricket field,
but it's about,
you know,
a five k like 3.1 miles.

1708
01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:32.530
And so we're running in a,
nobody beat me at that,

1709
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.180
but she was just out there grinding and sweating and hot and just showing a lot

1710
01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:37.590
of heart.

1711
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:41.400
And she did the pull ups and of course didn't win the pull ups and she did push

1712
01:41:41.401 --> 01:41:45.940
ups.
And then at the hundred yard shot,
she made an awesome shot.
I mean,

1713
01:41:45.941 --> 01:41:47.170
she wasn't the closest,

1714
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:52.240
but made a good shot at a hundred yards at this three d Bullock.
And uh,
you know,

1715
01:41:52.241 --> 01:41:53.620
there's other people who beat her there,

1716
01:41:53.621 --> 01:41:56.260
but I didn't think anybody showed as much harder.
She did.

1717
01:41:56.261 --> 01:41:59.560
So I gave her the bow and you know,
it was an 80 pound bow.
So obviously,

1718
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.870
I don't know if I told her,
I said,
you don't need to keep it.

1719
01:42:01.871 --> 01:42:04.390
You can sell it and buy clothes.
You can do whatever you want with it.

1720
01:42:04.391 --> 01:42:08.500
The point is,
is your effort to me one this boat today.

1721
01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:13.650
That's cool man.
And it's up to you.
That's really cool.
Now when you um,

1722
01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:17.080
went out there,
uh,
hunting the water buffalo,
you camped out there?

1723
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:21.790
He camped out there in the bush.
Yeah,
there was,
there was actually a,

1724
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:24.640
we stayed in this village from the aborigines.
They were,

1725
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:28.780
we thought they were going to be there,
but there's actually nobody there.
And um,

1726
01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:32.500
we had to hunt.
It's called a traditional land native land.

1727
01:42:32.501 --> 01:42:36.550
You have to get permission from the aborigines to hunt it.

1728
01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:38.110
And w what did,

1729
01:42:38.111 --> 01:42:42.050
I was told it's probably only 50 white men and ever been there just because
it's,

1730
01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:44.710
it's wild country.
It's just where they live.

1731
01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:48.390
But nobody's in the village and we don't know why I was abandoned or whatever,

1732
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:53.410
you know?
So I guess if an elder dies,
they will leave.

1733
01:42:53.530 --> 01:42:56.410
They think there's bad spirits in the village,

1734
01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.180
so they just leave everything and take off.

1735
01:42:58.181 --> 01:42:59.860
So we don't know for sure why it was empty,

1736
01:42:59.861 --> 01:43:03.550
but we were just there by ourselves and we just basically slept on the porch of

1737
01:43:03.551 --> 01:43:08.530
this hut out there.
And uh,
we didn't Adam who,
uh,

1738
01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:11.690
who was went out there with,
he was like,
you know,

1739
01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:14.230
when we took a helicopter out there is the only way to get there.

1740
01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:18.520
It was a four hour helicopter ride.
And,
uh,
I said,
do we want to get any food?

1741
01:43:18.521 --> 01:43:21.850
He's like,
he was,
I think it would be better if we just lived off the land.

1742
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.460
And I'm like,
okay,
that's,
yeah,
that's cool.

1743
01:43:24.461 --> 01:43:27.940
I didn't know what was out there for sure.
It turns out there's not much.

1744
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:33.040
And so that was,
that was not the best idea to try to live off the land.

1745
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:37.510
Luckily another guy,
uh oh.
And when,
and he did bring so food,

1746
01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.640
but still we didn't have hardly have any food.

1747
01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:44.380
I mean I had a granola bar and it had some trail mix from the airport and um,

1748
01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:46.810
Adam had a granola bar and then Owen,

1749
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:48.910
he brought some apples and oranges and stuff like that.

1750
01:43:48.911 --> 01:43:52.520
But all that stuff was gone fast and we were out there five full days.

1751
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:55.580
It was 120 degrees Fahrenheit out there.

1752
01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:00.530
And the water was like,
it looked like this coffee.

1753
01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:04.130
I mean cause about the buffalo lived in it and they just piss and shit.

1754
01:44:04.131 --> 01:44:09.110
Hell yeah.
Just nonstop.
So you know,
we would,
we'd have to treat that water.

1755
01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:11.600
Oh,
you drank that water.
There's nothing else.

1756
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.420
Oh my goodness.

1757
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.480
So it was a process we had as buffalo piss tastes like.
Exactly.

1758
01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.730
It's surprisingly,
it's not that good.
Now.

1759
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:26.390
Do you put it through filters?
Do you use g boil it like we,

1760
01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.510
here's what we did first.
We poured it through our shirt.
Okay.

1761
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.460
I tried to get the big chunks out.
Right?

1762
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:33.980
Like an Owen brought back some water on time and he's like,

1763
01:44:33.981 --> 01:44:36.540
what does this smell like?
And I was just like,
oh my gosh,

1764
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:39.650
smells like Buffalo Pis and you knew you're going to have to drink.

1765
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:42.770
So we put it through the shirt and then we did it through a pump.

1766
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:46.490
Adam had a pump and then he had a steripen what kind of pump?

1767
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:51.080
A water,
you know,
it's for filtering water.
Okay.
Yeah.

1768
01:44:51.081 --> 01:44:55.200
I don't know what kind it was,
but it,
it filters through like a pump system.
Yeah.

1769
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:59.450
You carbon,
right?
Yeah.
It's a filter that's supposedly cleans water.

1770
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.060
So then we had a stare,
a pin,

1771
01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:05.420
which is a UV light that also cleans the water.

1772
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:09.890
And so we had the shirt,
the filter,
the stirrup pin,

1773
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:13.430
and then he's like,
okay.
So we got all that.
Now what does it smell like?

1774
01:45:13.431 --> 01:45:18.180
And isn't it like a cup like this?
And I was like,
oh,
mine still smells good.

1775
01:45:18.210 --> 01:45:22.610
It smelled no different.
So we drank that.
Oh my God.
Like that.

1776
01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.170
It's like that.
Like it was boiling it.
Nothing.
Oh my God,

1777
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:30.500
she drank straight buffalo piss and shit too.
Right?
Yeah.

1778
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:34.970
What about the bacteria and you know like that stuff that you get,

1779
01:45:34.971 --> 01:45:37.310
like when you drink a stream water,
what's that called?

1780
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:39.350
It's a real common giardia.
Giardia.

1781
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:44.270
Well that's what that stuff was supposed to kill or take out.
Wow.
Yeah.

1782
01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:45.490
So Adam,
he was,

1783
01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:49.480
he like took a drink of it and he was kind of went into convulsions a little
bit.

1784
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:53.990
He's like,
he's like my body's rejecting it.
And uh,
it was just nasty.

1785
01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:58.160
And then,
then there was another time.
So we,
we found this,
uh,

1786
01:45:58.550 --> 01:46:02.450
we found some hamburger patties that were from the natives there.

1787
01:46:02.451 --> 01:46:06.590
They had the freezer actually the government or whoever it is comes in there and

1788
01:46:06.591 --> 01:46:10.850
they put power and,
and water their solar power cause it's so,
you know,

1789
01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:15.590
it's hot and sunny down there.
So there was a freezer and it had some hamburger,

1790
01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.680
hamburger patty.
So we stole those and we're cooking those up.

1791
01:46:18.681 --> 01:46:21.440
So we're down to like one last patty and I had it,

1792
01:46:21.441 --> 01:46:26.300
I took it cause I had no food and I had it in my trail mix bag because I had no

1793
01:46:26.301 --> 01:46:26.961
more trail mix.

1794
01:46:26.961 --> 01:46:31.400
So I had it in there and I had one cook hamburger patty and I remember we were

1795
01:46:31.401 --> 01:46:35.090
sitting there and we just drank a big old vat of buffalo piss water.

1796
01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:38.570
And I'm like man,
you know what would go good with this?
Is that hamburger patty?

1797
01:46:38.571 --> 01:46:42.890
So I ended up my backpack and I pull out my trail mix with the hamburger bag

1798
01:46:42.891 --> 01:46:45.630
with the hamburger patty in it and it's just solid ants.

1799
01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:50.040
Ants are all filled up and it's this amount like regular little cool

1800
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.300
<v 2>black ants like we have here.</v>

1801
01:46:51.301 --> 01:46:56.301
It's just red mean whatever aunts and just all over in my backpack,

1802
01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:59.820
all over that patty.
But so all I did,
I just blew off,

1803
01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:03.570
scraped them off,
blew him off the hamburger patty and ate it.

1804
01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:06.430
Why didn't you just eat the ants too?
We should have.
Yeah,

1805
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:10.120
if they weren't totally against her.
I mean you drink it,
buffalo pass smells,

1806
01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:13.110
we'll eat some ants.
But,
but you know,
here's the thing is,
you know,

1807
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:17.220
experiences like that is,
that's where you appreciate,
you know,

1808
01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:22.130
I don't know how good we have it because you,
you realize all that,

1809
01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:26.340
all that matters is she got something to drink and something to eat.
That's it.

1810
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:28.950
Yeah.
You have to keep your body alive and there's no other way to know.

1811
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:31.350
And so you get home and you see people complain about,
Oh,

1812
01:47:31.351 --> 01:47:34.710
there's no ice for this water.
I got to drink this warm water.
I'm like,

1813
01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:37.380
that water looks pretty damn good.
I mean,

1814
01:47:37.381 --> 01:47:39.920
I've drank some nasty water and I'd take that,
you know,

1815
01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:42.540
so it just puts everything in perspective,
you know?

1816
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:45.210
And you have to make sure that you're not getting dehydrated too.

1817
01:47:45.211 --> 01:47:48.030
So you have to drink a lot of that piss water.
Yeah.
You do.
Yeah.

1818
01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:53.060
What kind of rocket diarrhea did you guys develop?
I just,

1819
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:55.800
I need to know because it must have been like some broken fire,

1820
01:47:55.801 --> 01:48:00.720
hydrate type diarrhea.
No,
you didn't.
No,

1821
01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:03.600
I must not.
I mean we must have got it pretty clean.

1822
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:07.590
You must have a strong constitution.
I guess,
so now the buffalo itself,

1823
01:48:07.591 --> 01:48:10.980
you said that you guys ate that we'd had nothing else to eat.

1824
01:48:11.370 --> 01:48:14.370
And when you were telling me about this before the podcast started,

1825
01:48:14.371 --> 01:48:18.540
but for the folks at home,
uh,
w what was that like?
Yeah,
it was a,

1826
01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:24.740
so the backstrap is typically the best cut of any game animals right along the

1827
01:48:24.871 --> 01:48:29.070
spine.
And there's no bones and it's just big solid meat.

1828
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:33.720
And it's usually just like an elk that's like,
it's good as it gets tenderloin.

1829
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:38.430
Yeah.
And so,
um,
we cut that off and we'll cook that up in these buffalo,

1830
01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.120
so cut that up and cooked it up.

1831
01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:46.350
So I'd take a bite and I was shooting my boat's middle of the day and uh,

1832
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.370
I was shooting for probably maybe a half hour,
came back,

1833
01:48:50.371 --> 01:48:54.300
still chewing the same bite.
And so the thing about these buffalo,

1834
01:48:54.301 --> 01:48:58.710
cause there's no predators and we were trying to kill the biggest bulls out

1835
01:48:58.711 --> 01:49:02.910
there.
Um,
book could be 30 years old.
Anything,

1836
01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:07.770
any animal that old in those conditions and the muscles are going to be,

1837
01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:11.370
so it's muscle you're eating,
the mussels are going to be,
you know,
whatever.

1838
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:15.540
Just not very pliable and yeah.
Dense.

1839
01:49:15.541 --> 01:49:20.490
And so I chewed that one bite of the premium cut for half hours.
Like you know,

1840
01:49:20.491 --> 01:49:24.780
eating a shoe.
So how's it,
what about the Oregon?
Did you eat the liver?
No.

1841
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:27.030
How come?
No,
I never yet.

1842
01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.570
You don't like liver now you don't like liver like from a deer?
No.

1843
01:49:30.610 --> 01:49:34.920
Really know why.
I don't know man.
That's my favorite part.

1844
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:38.950
That just filters all that crap.
It's so good for you though.
No,

1845
01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:43.290
that's a good job of filtering the crap.
I'm not a liver guy.
That's interesting.

1846
01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:44.191
You know the,

1847
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:47.830
the Alpha wolf is the one that gets the liver when they take out an animal.

1848
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:51.070
<v 0>Reconsider.
Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah.
The Alpha Wolf,</v>

1849
01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:53.050
they battle over who gets the liver in the,

1850
01:49:53.051 --> 01:49:56.860
that's how they determine the Alpha status of the pack is the,
the wolf.

1851
01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:59.440
Who's the baddest motherfucker if the one that eats the liver.

1852
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:04.570
There was a documentary on this guy who lived with wolves.
There was an a,

1853
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:08.740
an um,
there was a contained area,
uh,

1854
01:50:08.741 --> 01:50:11.110
I forget where it was,
I forget what part of the world,

1855
01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:15.970
but this one guy lived with these wolves in this contained area and he was the

1856
01:50:15.971 --> 01:50:16.750
Alpha.

1857
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:20.020
And the way that he became the Alpha is he was with these wolves since they were

1858
01:50:20.021 --> 01:50:23.740
little and he would always eat liver in front of them.

1859
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:28.180
So he would have an animal that they would give to these wolves and he would put

1860
01:50:28.181 --> 01:50:32.170
a liver inside of this animal and he would like open up the Ziploc bag,

1861
01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.910
pull this liver on eating in front of them.

1862
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:37.970
So they knew that because he was eating the,
the,
the liver,
he was the Alpha.
Yeah.

1863
01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:40.990
Well he went away because he had to deal with,
um,

1864
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:45.400
there was a local farmer that had a wolf invasion,
the wolf,

1865
01:50:45.401 --> 01:50:49.810
we're killing his livestock.
So this guy had to assist this farmer.

1866
01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:53.320
And one of the ways he assisted them and he set up all these speakers where he

1867
01:50:53.321 --> 01:50:58.321
had a house like he set up like as if there was like a new pack that in

1868
01:50:59.501 --> 01:51:02.140
encroached into this area and he uh,

1869
01:51:02.170 --> 01:51:05.980
set up this whole elaborate thing to try to ward off these wolves without having

1870
01:51:05.981 --> 01:51:07.660
to kill them.
And then,
you know,

1871
01:51:07.661 --> 01:51:12.160
some time went by several weeks and he went back to the,
uh,
the,

1872
01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:14.230
the wolves and the new Alpha was there.

1873
01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:17.170
So he had to beg for his life in front of this new alpha.

1874
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.670
He had a whimper and he had a like,

1875
01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:21.940
really it was really intense because it was baring its teeth.

1876
01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:23.890
It was challenging him for the Alpha position.

1877
01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:26.260
And so he had to get out of it by being a bitch.

1878
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.160
Cause normally wolves will Duke it out and find out,
well,

1879
01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:32.560
oh you're the alpha now.
Well let's see what's up bitch.
And you know,

1880
01:51:32.561 --> 01:51:35.770
they would Duke it out to see who this wolf was determined to eat that liver.

1881
01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:37.390
So he had to,
like,

1882
01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:42.580
they had a fight for his position in the pack by begging for his life.

1883
01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:47.390
<v 3>I like,
that's what I do.
Like how simple life is in the mountains,</v>

1884
01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:52.160
you know what I mean?
I mean,
there's one leader,
there's,
it's just that's the,

1885
01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:56.930
you know that when I was young I liked being back there because I didn't have to

1886
01:51:56.931 --> 01:51:58.780
worry about,
you know,

1887
01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:03.770
whether somebody liked me or whether I had money or whether any help from

1888
01:52:03.771 --> 01:52:07.100
anybody.
It was just like so simple and so cut and dry,
just like that.

1889
01:52:07.110 --> 01:52:11.810
There's one alpha wolf enemy either.
Are you tougher or is he tougher?

1890
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:14.630
You know what I mean?
And that's,
I just liked the,

1891
01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.920
how black and white the mountains are,
you know,
if you're not tough,
you die.

1892
01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:24.080
Yeah.
That's,
that's great.
If you're tough.
That's true.
Yeah.

1893
01:52:24.081 --> 01:52:26.480
If you're not tough,
you want to get back home to the Internet.
And I'm like,

1894
01:52:26.481 --> 01:52:30.710
fuck this place man.
I need air conditioning.
I need a blanket.

1895
01:52:31.010 --> 01:52:35.510
I did,
you know,
I did a commercial with the wolf for under Armour this.
Oh,

1896
01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:38.300
I dunno,
we filmed it last year,
but,
uh,

1897
01:52:38.630 --> 01:52:42.020
I thought the best ending to that commercial would have been if I could have

1898
01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:42.860
killed that wolf,

1899
01:52:43.190 --> 01:52:47.660
because is this like how it went is me and the wolf river running through the

1900
01:52:47.661 --> 01:52:50.300
woods,
we're both doing the same things.
And um,

1901
01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:54.770
and then the commercial ended with me.
I had a bull elk had killed,

1902
01:52:54.771 --> 01:52:56.510
but we just took the rack up there,

1903
01:52:56.511 --> 01:53:00.170
but I had it on my pack and the wolf came up and he saw me with that bull elk

1904
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:04.850
and it's like I won because we were both hunting the elk,
but I got it.

1905
01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:08.270
And so the wolf jumped up on the slog and he snarled and was not happy.

1906
01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:09.890
And I thought,
I said,
man,

1907
01:53:09.891 --> 01:53:14.891
this the best ending to this would be if I just erode that wolf to excuse you

1908
01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:19.220
got to kind of infer that I won.
But man,
that would,

1909
01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.990
that would still tell the story right there.

1910
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:24.440
<v 0>Well that that would really like send it home for under armor though.</v>

1911
01:53:24.441 --> 01:53:27.340
People would boycott,
they would stop killing wolves.

1912
01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:31.220
Is this the commercial play it,
yeah,
that's it.

1913
01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:36.080
Let's hear the volume with preparation and the right gear.

1914
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.810
You can become nature's equal.
That's even better.
You're like,
bitch already won.

1915
01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.580
Yeah.
That doesn't look at your real wolf though.

1916
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.270
That's what role will don't belong.

1917
01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:51.450
<v 3>It just looks like bitch ass trained walls.
Yeah.
Oh,
that was a train wolf.</v>

1918
01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:56.250
But it was an actual real trained wool.
A real wolf.
Not like a hybrid.
No,
no,

1919
01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:59.410
no,
no.
That was,
and that,
that wolf actually,

1920
01:53:59.710 --> 01:54:03.910
so it was that wolf had been in like the twilight movies,
you know,
I mean it's,

1921
01:54:04.150 --> 01:54:07.370
it's sort of a famous wolf,
but uh,
um,

1922
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:09.850
the thing about it is to make it snarl like that.

1923
01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:13.900
I took some elk stake up there and uh,
I was going to give it,

1924
01:54:14.230 --> 01:54:16.750
I was going to give it some elk after it did this whole thing,

1925
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:20.860
but to make it mad like that,
you had to give it meat and take it away,

1926
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:25.780
give it meat,
take it away.
And they said,
they said,
okay.
Yeah,
we,
the trainer said,

1927
01:54:25.781 --> 01:54:30.130
okay,
we can make it mad and snarl.
Like you'd need for the commercial.
But,
uh,

1928
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:33.730
once we do that,
we're,
we're done.

1929
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:37.780
Cause it's going to be pissed off for the whole rest of the day.

1930
01:54:38.230 --> 01:54:41.800
So that was the last thing.
So the,
that wolf had been,
um,

1931
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:44.860
I think they had it since he was five weeks old and it was 11 years old,

1932
01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:49.390
but still crazy.
Yeah.
I mean,
no wolf.
Yeah.
I mean you don't,

1933
01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:53.020
they have that in them.
So it was pretty,
it was pretty cool.

1934
01:54:53.190 --> 01:54:57.210
<v 0>Yeah.
I had a friend who had a hybrids,
they weren't even full wolves.</v>

1935
01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.940
They were like,
you know,
seven eighths will for something like that.

1936
01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:04.560
But he had them and they got away from him.
They got,

1937
01:55:04.561 --> 01:55:05.460
they were in his,
uh,

1938
01:55:05.490 --> 01:55:09.690
his yard and they went over to the neighbor's property and killed like something

1939
01:55:09.691 --> 01:55:11.420
like 18 sheep or something like that.

1940
01:55:11.590 --> 01:55:16.500
Just went on a just an orgy of murder and just slaughtered this guy sheep.

1941
01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:18.090
Yeah.
You know,
and then,
uh,
you know,

1942
01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:22.610
the ranch or comes over pissed at him and he tried to deny it,
gives us blurbs,

1943
01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:26.670
a bath.
And I'm like,
come on man,
what the fuck else is going to kill 18 of them?

1944
01:55:26.671 --> 01:55:29.490
I'm outline's going to kill one and eat it.
Now.

1945
01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:34.200
It's a well fed wolf dog that's going to go on this mat orgy of murder.

1946
01:55:34.290 --> 01:55:37.080
<v 3>Yeah,
I've read a lot.
You know,
I've always been a fan of wools,</v>

1947
01:55:37.081 --> 01:55:40.620
which is kind of cool to do that commercial with the wolf.
But you know,
I read,

1948
01:55:40.710 --> 01:55:43.860
you know,
call the wild and I was a kid and white,
all that.

1949
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.120
<v 0>But um,
um,
that they,</v>

1950
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.810
I read a lot about wolves and they're the one of the only animals that will do

1951
01:55:48.811 --> 01:55:53.100
thrill killing,
you know,
just kill a bunch of things just to kill them,
you know,

1952
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:57.960
whereas other animals usually kill just what they eat.
Yeah.
The um,

1953
01:55:57.961 --> 01:56:02.580
had a problem with that recently at this a ranch in Montana where these,
uh,

1954
01:56:02.581 --> 01:56:06.810
this pack of Wolf just got a hold of these calves and just slaughtered a bunch

1955
01:56:06.811 --> 01:56:11.370
of calves.
Like,
you know,
a ton of them,
like,
you know,
12 calves and just left him,

1956
01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:15.540
I mean eight part of them,
but left a lot of them just sitting there dead,
frozen.

1957
01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:17.730
And it's,
it was a really creepy scene.

1958
01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:20.700
It was on a television show that I was watching.
And when they're,
you know,

1959
01:56:20.701 --> 01:56:23.460
these calves that are mostly covered in snow,

1960
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:26.790
you see their bodies and you really see this,
the havoc that these things,

1961
01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:30.460
they're,
they're too close to people that's fucking walls.
You know,

1962
01:56:31.130 --> 01:56:34.500
they're creepy in a weird way.
They're smart,
they're sneaky,

1963
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:39.690
they're strategic in how they kill things and then they do this thrill killing

1964
01:56:39.691 --> 01:56:43.650
thing.
Yeah,
no,
I mean,
and you can't blame a wolf.
That's just how they are.

1965
01:56:43.651 --> 01:56:47.700
But we don't need a bunch of them running around the mountains.
I mean,
yeah,

1966
01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:51.620
people have a weird relationship with them because they look so much like dogs,

1967
01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:54.320
you know,
it's a strange sort of a,

1968
01:56:54.321 --> 01:56:58.950
a relationship that people who love wildlife have that they would be cured of

1969
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:02.940
really fucking quickly if they are out there in the woods and they saw a pack of

1970
01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:06.960
wolves because they would realize,
oh,
these are monsters.
These,

1971
01:57:06.961 --> 01:57:10.590
these are the things that they made little red riding hood about.
This is,

1972
01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:12.340
this is the big bad wolf.
Yeah.

1973
01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:17.130
Like there's a reason why all of those children's stories involved evil wolves,

1974
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:21.990
because wolves eat kids on a regular basis back then.
Well,

1975
01:57:21.991 --> 01:57:24.480
it's people,
there's not realistic about it.

1976
01:57:24.481 --> 01:57:28.350
And I mean a wolf that they're just looking for something to kill.
Yeah.

1977
01:57:28.410 --> 01:57:33.120
Whether it's your baby,
you,
yeah.
You a deer,
you know,
and people,

1978
01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:33.421
you know,

1979
01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:36.870
just like a Timothy Treadwell up in Alaska when he was living with the bears and

1980
01:57:36.871 --> 01:57:40.650
he thought,
Oh,
bears are my friends.
You know this?
Hello mister chocolate.
Yeah.

1981
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:44.370
They ate him and his girlfriend.
Yeah.
And it's just like,

1982
01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:49.570
they're not your friends,
not even slightly.
No,
they,
they,
they,

1983
01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:52.000
the only reason why there aren't eating you is because they don't eat you every

1984
01:57:52.001 --> 01:57:54.510
day.
So they're not used to seeing you as food.
That's it.

1985
01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:57.000
That's all it is with wolves.

1986
01:57:57.001 --> 01:58:00.160
They'll like this motherfucker might have a bang stick it like circle you are

1987
01:58:00.161 --> 01:58:03.030
looking at what's that thing in his hand?
Yeah.
I might go bang.

1988
01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:07.880
If they've heard the bang stick a few times,
then they go running.
Yeah.
I uh,

1989
01:58:07.881 --> 01:58:08.910
I'm not a big fan of wolves.

1990
01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:11.720
I am a big fan of wolves and I'm not a big fan of walls.
Like I'm a,

1991
01:58:11.721 --> 01:58:14.820
I'm a big fan as far as them,
like just like I'm a big fan of lions.

1992
01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:18.450
I think even mountain lions,
I think that fascinating.
Just wild animals.

1993
01:58:18.451 --> 01:58:23.010
Wild predators are absolutely there.
They're chanting in a way.

1994
01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:28.160
Just this idea that this thing exists along with us with our lattes and our

1995
01:58:28.591 --> 01:58:32.550
electric cars and our Wifi along at the same time.

1996
01:58:32.890 --> 01:58:35.250
If it's very same moment we're doing this podcast,

1997
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:39.870
there's some gangster ass mountain lion in Arizona right now getting shit done

1998
01:58:40.230 --> 01:58:41.530
on a mountain.
Yeah.

1999
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:45.520
Sneaking up on some ram or whatever the fuck he can get his teeth onto.

2000
01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:49.720
And that's what he does every day.
And there's thousands of them,
not just one.

2001
01:58:49.721 --> 01:58:52.450
There's a whole community of mountain lions and there,
that's what they do,

2002
01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:55.790
whether it's the wolves in Idaho that are destroying the elk because they're,

2003
01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:57.490
they're really,
really fascinating.

2004
01:58:57.490 --> 01:59:01.450
But people were anti hunting need to understand that just because a lot of

2005
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:04.510
people don't like to eat mountain lion or these,
cause nobody eats wolves.

2006
01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:06.430
You still need to kill those things.

2007
01:59:06.850 --> 01:59:09.640
And it's important because if it doesn't happen,

2008
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:14.910
they're going to creep into civilian areas the same way they used to back in the

2009
01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:17.770
day when they were writing those little red riding hood books.
Yeah.

2010
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:20.230
I've told this story in the podcast before,
but I'll tell it again.

2011
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:25.470
In Paris and the 14 hundreds wolves killed 40 people in Paris like they had a

2012
01:59:27.251 --> 01:59:29.650
corner wolves in the streets of Paris and,

2013
01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:32.550
and kill them with spears and sticks and rocks.
Yeah.

2014
01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:36.670
Like they're not to be fucked with this.
This is not,
they're not your dogs.

2015
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:41.050
This is not a beautiful animal that you know,
has a relationship with.
I mean,

2016
01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:44.800
even the way we treat like killer whales,

2017
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:47.230
killer whales don't kill people in the wild.

2018
01:59:47.410 --> 01:59:50.560
They actually help people that fall out of boats.
You know,

2019
01:59:50.561 --> 01:59:53.850
the killer whales might be a friends.
We should probably be way nicer to show.

2020
01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:55.130
Well then we at a wolf.

2021
01:59:55.270 --> 02:00:00.100
<v 3>Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah.
There's something about hunting a Predator,</v>

2022
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:00.963
you know,
I mean,

2023
02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:05.120
I've done a lot of bear hunts and I always up in Alberta this year and know,

2024
02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:08.470
you know,
a lot of people bear hunt and they'll,
they'll like sit up in a tree,

2025
02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:11.020
stand this and that.
I'm like,
I said,
I want,
I want to hunt,

2026
02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:14.710
I want to hunt a Predator and they're seven foot black bear.
They're huge,

2027
02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:19.540
but I want to be on the ground.
I was up there with John Rivet in,
uh,
in Alberta.

2028
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:20.141
I said,

2029
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:24.310
I want to be on the ground living amongst them and there's something about,

2030
02:00:24.311 --> 02:00:27.750
and so we did that.
This is,
you are here and you cook in here.
Oh,

2031
02:00:27.930 --> 02:00:30.250
that call that bear crack.
Yeah.

2032
02:00:30.251 --> 02:00:35.160
So you bait them up there and um,
there's so many bear up there.
You can kill two.

2033
02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:38.530
There's just like tons of bear.
You need to manage that number.
But uh,

2034
02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:39.580
so that bear,

2035
02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:44.710
we call it bear crack because once they get hooked on the crack there,
I mean,

2036
02:00:44.711 --> 02:00:45.410
they're coming in

2037
02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:48.080
<v 0>and what is bare crack with what do you,
what's in the,
what do you,</v>

2038
02:00:48.081 --> 02:00:49.070
what do you mix it in there?

2039
02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:54.040
<v 3>Marshmallows and Jello and stuff like that.
Just something that smells good but,</v>

2040
02:00:54.130 --> 02:00:58.900
but those bears get,
yeah,
just kind of get it wasting in the,

2041
02:00:58.901 --> 02:01:03.530
in the air and then the smoke goes off through there.
But uh,
um,

2042
02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:08.260
I wanted to,
I want it like that bear was probably,
God,
what was that like?

2043
02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:10.210
Maybe 12 feet.

2044
02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:14.300
<v 0>Yeah,
we'll pull that video up again.
Jamie.
Look how close.
Look at Ferris.</v>

2045
02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:17.180
That's a big pair too,
man.
Yeah,
that's a good bear.

2046
02:01:17.181 --> 02:01:20.570
And we should point out probably the black bear are much less likely to attack a

2047
02:01:20.571 --> 02:01:21.740
person than a grizzly.

2048
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:25.700
<v 3>Yeah.
That,
I mean,
they'll buy,
the thing is with a wild animal,</v>

2049
02:01:25.701 --> 02:01:29.150
they'll do whatever they want.
Yeah,
I mean,
yeah,
you can follow the book.
No,

2050
02:01:29.151 --> 02:01:32.570
I mean you might get attacked and you go,
hey,
you're less likely to do that.

2051
02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:37.070
You know,
it doesn't matter.
So you never know a bear,

2052
02:01:37.130 --> 02:01:42.130
a bear comes and they make any animal make a decision right then on what they

2053
02:01:42.771 --> 02:01:46.970
want to do.
You know,
if it's a predator,
if it's a,
a dominant Predator,

2054
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:52.250
dominant bear are more likely just to come walk in right in like that and just

2055
02:01:52.251 --> 02:01:56.240
say,
you better leave cause I'm coming in.
And those,

2056
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:59.330
those are the ones,
I mean those are the ones I go after.
I want the,

2057
02:01:59.370 --> 02:02:02.690
the dominant animal.
And uh,
and that one,

2058
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:05.870
that one wasn't like one of the giant that was a big bear,

2059
02:02:05.871 --> 02:02:09.440
but not one of the giant bear.
But there's something about being on the ground,

2060
02:02:09.441 --> 02:02:14.150
eye to eye with a,
a Predator like that.
That's a,
I mean,

2061
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.470
that's just what I like to do.
So you pass on that bear because it was too small.

2062
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:22.730
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a big pear.
Yeah,
that was,

2063
02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:27.390
but it wasn't seven foot,
400 pounds.
Like the ones that I got.
Well,

2064
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:31.250
how big was that when you think that was like s probably six foot,

2065
02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:35.180
maybe two 50 or two 75.
Wow.
No.

2066
02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:40.130
Why do you want the dominant ones?
Um,
there that,
you know,
there's older,

2067
02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:44.970
sometimes those old bores don't breed as much as they used to.
Um,

2068
02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:47.140
a lot of the old bores,
you know,

2069
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:51.560
especially a dominant bore will kill other bear.

2070
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:55.820
So even if it's an own cup,
I mean,
it breeds a lot of sounds,
you know,

2071
02:02:55.821 --> 02:02:56.960
when they're in their prime.

2072
02:02:57.170 --> 02:03:01.520
So the Saudis have cubs a dominant blur will kill the cubs because he's trying

2073
02:03:01.521 --> 02:03:06.260
to eliminate competition for him,
you know,
so he'll kill his own cubs.

2074
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:09.440
That's just how it works.
And they eat them too,
right?
Yeah,
they can,

2075
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:13.760
they eat them.
I mean,
I've,
I had this,
we were on Prince of Wales Island.

2076
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:17.900
That's where this video is right here at Prince of Wales Island.
One time or no,

2077
02:03:17.901 --> 02:03:20.960
no,
that's,
this is Alaska.
This is a Prince of Wales.
But,
uh,

2078
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:23.270
sky hit this bear and we can't write at dark.

2079
02:03:23.271 --> 02:03:27.170
We came back the next day to recover it and the dominant bull or had eaten his

2080
02:03:27.171 --> 02:03:31.130
bear.
That's just,
they are just,
I dunno,

2081
02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:35.150
it's just survival of the fittest basically.
So those,
so you want,

2082
02:03:35.151 --> 02:03:39.060
we take those dominant bores out of there and it pretty much helps the health of

2083
02:03:39.061 --> 02:03:43.280
the,
of the herd basically.
And not the heart,
but the numbers.

2084
02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:48.730
Bears aren't heard,
but whatever the,
how many bears are there,
it'll,

2085
02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:52.070
it'll help,
you know,
taking that big nasty dominant one out of there.

2086
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:57.140
And then that's,
you know,
I dunno,
I,
I,
I just don't need to kill,

2087
02:03:57.141 --> 02:04:01.110
just to kill,
you know,
I've killed,
you know,
when it first started,
I,

2088
02:04:01.111 --> 02:04:05.030
I killed anything I'd have a chance at.
I just wanted to notch that tag,

2089
02:04:05.031 --> 02:04:08.780
taking me home to my family and to have success now.
I mean,

2090
02:04:08.781 --> 02:04:13.670
like I hunted back home for deer in Oregon and I didn't kill,

2091
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:17.420
I passed up everything cause I never saw the animal that I wanted to kill.

2092
02:04:17.421 --> 02:04:21.890
I never saw the,
a mature buck one that I wanted to get.
So I just didn't kill.

2093
02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:25.700
I mean,
I don't need to kill.
I if I'm going to,
it's going to be something that,

2094
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:29.450
you know,
I'm really,
uh,
I don't know,

2095
02:04:29.451 --> 02:04:33.230
infatuated with are just sold on.
I really want that.

2096
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:36.200
So it was just a matter of you just,
did you see good deer?

2097
02:04:36.201 --> 02:04:38.820
You just didn't see a great one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So good box.

2098
02:04:38.821 --> 02:04:42.090
Probably most people would kill him,
but I just didn't see the one I wanted.

2099
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:46.770
What were you looking for?
How big?
Um,
like a big four by four.

2100
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.980
Um,
you know,
kind of like,
you know,
like what you got there.

2101
02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:53.880
But this is black tail back to,
yeah,
this is in western Oregon.

2102
02:04:54.210 --> 02:04:58.590
So a good four by four black tail,
you know,
five years old.

2103
02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:01.560
Good mature buck.
And I just never had a chance at one,
so I didn't,

2104
02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:02.503
it didn't kill anything.

2105
02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:05.790
<v 0>Now these bear that you're killing in a Alberta,
is that where it was?</v>

2106
02:05:05.791 --> 02:05:07.170
Or Prince Alaska.
Is it,

2107
02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:10.770
<v 3>where was it?
Prince of Wales or this last one,
like we showed that clip.
Um,</v>

2108
02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:15.540
that was,
uh,
Alberta,
Alberta.
Are you eating these bears?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2109
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:17.460
No,
I eat everything I kill.

2110
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:21.240
What does it taste like when you this big old bear chicken?
No,

2111
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:26.160
no bear.
You know,
bear,

2112
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:31.790
I've had really good bear and it used to be so like if you have a bear that's

2113
02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:34.200
living on berries and you get up there in the mountains,
you kill,

2114
02:05:34.201 --> 02:05:38.280
it's going to be really sweet meat cause it's eating blueberries or whatever

2115
02:05:38.281 --> 02:05:38.820
else.

2116
02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:42.720
If you have a bear that's coming in to bait and paint like some people bay down

2117
02:05:42.721 --> 02:05:47.400
here just with meat scraps or whatever might have maggots is probably not going

2118
02:05:47.401 --> 02:05:51.660
to be that good,
you know?
But those bare and Alberta mostly were,

2119
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:54.600
there's a just grain is what we're putting out there.

2120
02:05:55.170 --> 02:05:57.900
A little bear cracks of those bear are really good.
Um,

2121
02:05:58.590 --> 02:06:02.490
I don't know what it tastes like.
It's more like it's fatter meat.

2122
02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:07.830
Maybe more like pork,
but uh,
it's good.
What are they eating for the most part?

2123
02:06:07.831 --> 02:06:12.720
Like with their diet consist of [inaudible] in Alberta,
man,

2124
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:17.400
whatever.
They can get ahold of a lot of graphs.
A lot of grass.
Yeah.

2125
02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:21.570
Yeah.
It depends on the time of the year.
So,
but they'll take,

2126
02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:24.090
they'll take some oats over grass any day.

2127
02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:28.540
<v 0>Yeah.
I watched this episode of a meat eater with Steve Rinella where he,
uh,</v>

2128
02:06:28.541 --> 02:06:33.270
went for these,
um,
fall bears that were fattening up before a,

2129
02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:36.130
they would hibernate and they were eating berries,
they're eating blueberries.

2130
02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:39.730
And it was incredible because as he was cutting this bear open,

2131
02:06:39.731 --> 02:06:42.060
like you see the fat is actually blue.
Yeah.

2132
02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:45.250
It's got like a blue tint to it from all the berries that this animal had been

2133
02:06:45.251 --> 02:06:48.370
eating.
Right.
And he said it was just unbelievably good.
Good.
Yeah,

2134
02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.610
<v 3>I know.
And that's,
you know,</v>

2135
02:06:49.611 --> 02:06:53.810
you get those huge black bears or if they're eating fish,
like in Alaska,

2136
02:06:53.811 --> 02:06:56.520
if they're down downward,
like on Prince of Wales,

2137
02:06:56.521 --> 02:07:00.200
they can eat a lot of fish that come in and those bears are huge because of all

2138
02:07:00.201 --> 02:07:02.830
that protein.
I mean,
just,
it's sell about,

2139
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:06.320
about their diet and they get giant because they're eating solid protein all the

2140
02:07:06.321 --> 02:07:09.890
time.
But those bears aren't as good,
um,

2141
02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:14.240
from fish for whatever reason,
they taste fishy.
Uh,
I dunno about fishy,

2142
02:07:14.241 --> 02:07:15.560
just not as sweet.

2143
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.971
<v 0>You know,</v>

2144
02:07:16.971 --> 02:07:20.070
cause I've heard like diver ducks dive like there's two types of ducks for folks

2145
02:07:20.071 --> 02:07:22.830
who don't know,
there's duck city vegetation,

2146
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:26.280
there's diver ducks and go under the water and eat fish and those kind of tastes

2147
02:07:26.281 --> 02:07:29.740
like shit.
Yeah,
yeah.
Now it's probably,
you know,

2148
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:32.940
it's probably the same with anything you are with cheat.
Yeah,
exactly.

2149
02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:35.580
If you need a person,
make sure it's a vegetarian.
Yeah.

2150
02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:39.760
There's a Steve Rinella with this blueberry fat bear.

2151
02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:43.050
<v 6>Yeah,
it's bad.
It's just like a berry.</v>

2152
02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:45.930
It's almost half and liquid at room town.

2153
02:07:46.770 --> 02:07:50.580
Have you read old accounts from like pioneering Alaskans?

2154
02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:54.750
I mean not even that long ago.
Even back in the 1950s everybody

2155
02:07:58.390 --> 02:08:02.670
would want to kill a big fat bear in the fall like this on berries because they

2156
02:08:02.671 --> 02:08:07.650
didn't have butter and oil and they would kill these bears.

2157
02:08:08.070 --> 02:08:12.300
Take the fat,
just the lay by a winter's worth of butter and oil.
Wow.

2158
02:08:13.590 --> 02:08:14.820
I shouldn't call it border,
but you know,

2159
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:18.120
something to subs too is bought or you can spread the fat.
Once you cook it,

2160
02:08:18.121 --> 02:08:18.960
you can spread the fat.

2161
02:08:19.650 --> 02:08:23.390
<v 0>The other thing that's unfortunate is everybody can't do that because there's</v>

2162
02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:27.320
literally not enough game for everybody.
If the entire country went hunting.

2163
02:08:28.090 --> 02:08:29.040
<v 3>Yeah,
they're not going to eat.</v>

2164
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:32.680
It looks like I said when I started writing about my haunts in the mountains,

2165
02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:36.550
even people that thought they wanted to do it didn't want to do it.
I mean,
you,

2166
02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:39.340
yeah.
Not everybody wants to do that.
Yeah.

2167
02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:43.720
<v 0>Well,
it's hard work,
man.
It's hard work.
I enjoyed it very,
very much.</v>

2168
02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:47.320
But uh,
I'm not,
I'm not scared to work hard and I like new experiences.

2169
02:08:47.321 --> 02:08:50.680
So for me it was a,
it was very exciting and invigorating,
but

2170
02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:55.540
<v 3>I could see someone who's a bitch who,
uh,
couldn't handle it.
Oh yeah.
No,</v>

2171
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:56.360
there's nothing easy.

2172
02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:00.590
Nothing easy about carrying all your gear or your survival gear,

2173
02:09:00.591 --> 02:09:02.810
trying to get an animal.
I mean it,

2174
02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:07.060
sometimes I've been on hunts even now that are so tough.
I'm,

2175
02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:10.160
I wondered how have I ever killed anything with a bow.

2176
02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:14.810
It just seems impossible to get in bowl range and make a good shot and then

2177
02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:18.860
recover the animal and it's just so tough.

2178
02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:23.030
<v 0>Rinella was telling me about this Mousse that uh,
they shot where uh,</v>

2179
02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:27.160
he had to carry it.
They did nothing but go out to this moose,

2180
02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:31.630
cut it up and carry it back for three days.
Cause it was like a nine mile trip.

2181
02:09:31.690 --> 02:09:34.360
Yeah.
So they would go to camp,
they would get up in the morning,

2182
02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:37.780
go hike out to where the Moose was,
take pieces of the Moose,

2183
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:39.580
put it in their packs and then walk back.

2184
02:09:39.581 --> 02:09:42.040
And they did it for three days in a row and he said he wasn't right for two

2185
02:09:42.041 --> 02:09:44.680
weeks,
said his body was just broken down.

2186
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:48.750
<v 3>Yeah,
no,
that's a,
you know,
you earn everything you get out of the mountains.</v>

2187
02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.640
They'll get,
they'll get it out of your one way or another.

2188
02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:53.760
And most people are just not going to experience that.
It's unfortunate,

2189
02:09:53.761 --> 02:09:57.690
but when you do do it,
the people that do do it,
they kind of,

2190
02:09:57.691 --> 02:10:01.500
one of the thrills of it is that most people are not getting experienced that.

2191
02:10:01.710 --> 02:10:04.860
No,
but I think you should be able to respect it.
You know?
That's the thing.

2192
02:10:04.861 --> 02:10:08.010
So it's not saying you need to do it,
but man,

2193
02:10:08.011 --> 02:10:10.320
it's not too much to ask to respect what it takes.

2194
02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:14.110
Do you find that people disrespect it?
Well,
I just think that they,

2195
02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:16.740
they minimize their,
just thinking like,
oh,
you know,

2196
02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:19.830
do you think you're a big man from going out and killing?
You know,

2197
02:10:19.831 --> 02:10:23.940
I get anti hunters who post on my,
some of my videos or you know,

2198
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.290
from killing an innocent animal.
It's just like,
no,
you don't.

2199
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:33.030
You don't even get it.
Yeah.
That's a weird thing that people love to say.

2200
02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:34.220
We love to say that,

2201
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:35.960
<v 0>you know,
you're killing an innocent animal.</v>

2202
02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:39.260
There's nothing innocent about being an animal.
By the way.
You know,

2203
02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:43.460
animals are living by the wild.
I mean that's,
that's what they're doing there.

2204
02:10:43.461 --> 02:10:45.110
This,
there's nothing innocent about it.

2205
02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:48.830
It's probably the least innocent thing that a living creature does.

2206
02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:52.160
<v 3>Yeah.
If they have to kill to survive and the animal will.
Yeah.</v>

2207
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:55.370
I mean that's what it's about.
Yeah.
And dealt by the way.

2208
02:10:55.371 --> 02:10:58.160
They'll run you over with those fucking antlers.
Oh yeah.

2209
02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:00.800
They'll make a charge at you and run those fucking things through you like a

2210
02:11:00.801 --> 02:11:04.310
shish Kebab.
Now I know it's so,
I just,
you know,

2211
02:11:04.311 --> 02:11:06.770
I just think so that's,

2212
02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:11.800
that's kind of why I like videoing the work and the effort and all that because

2213
02:11:12.230 --> 02:11:16.280
you don't necessarily have to do it.
I do,
but just respect it,
you know?

2214
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:21.290
And that's the thing.
I mean that's,
I don't show all that for,

2215
02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:24.840
to try to,
to get respect,
but I just want,
you know,

2216
02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:29.510
people have an easier time with bow hunting for whatever reason.

2217
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:32.750
Cause it seems like it's harder,
you know?
Then they'll,

2218
02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:36.470
they'll easily say negative stuff about rifle hunting because they say,
oh,

2219
02:11:36.471 --> 02:11:39.290
you don't have to be close or you can shoot from 400 yards or whatever.

2220
02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:40.880
But with bow hunting for whatever reason,

2221
02:11:40.881 --> 02:11:45.430
we get a little more of a pass because it is difficult.
So,
um,

2222
02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:47.180
and rifle hunting his heart too,
I'm not,

2223
02:11:47.181 --> 02:11:49.970
I don't want to say rifle on is easy because it's a whole different deal.
You're,

2224
02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:54.380
you're hunting in.
Um,
there's more competition with the rifle out there,

2225
02:11:54.381 --> 02:11:56.780
so you're competing against other guys.
Uh,

2226
02:11:56.781 --> 02:11:59.840
the animals had been hunted a little more so there will be more wary by that

2227
02:11:59.841 --> 02:12:02.500
time of year.
So rifle hunting is still tough and,

2228
02:12:02.630 --> 02:12:07.250
and those guys have my respect as well.
But just for the general population,

2229
02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.790
it seems like bow hunting and bone is cool right now.
Yeah.

2230
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:14.780
I mean it's gaining in popularity.
It,
she has really.
Yeah.
It's just,
you know,

2231
02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:19.140
what,
what do,
do you attribute that to?
I Dunno.
Cameron Hanes videos online.
I'll,

2232
02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.930
I'll,
me,
I did it all.
No,
I mean from a hunger games,

2233
02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.850
you know,
you know,
Katniss out that well,
it's just Kinda,
it's just kinda cool.

2234
02:12:28.851 --> 02:12:33.851
And then I get a lot of emails and correspondence from young guys who want to be

2235
02:12:34.670 --> 02:12:38.720
more Badass,
so to speak.
And,
and,
and bow hunting.
I mean,

2236
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:43.170
shooting a bow is just cool.
Yeah.
You know,
well,
for folks looks

2237
02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:45.990
<v 0>you don't even want to shoot anything.
They don't want to kill an animal.</v>

2238
02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:49.500
You might be a vegetarian,
whatever.
You,
you might just be fine.

2239
02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:52.980
John Hackleman style,
go into the supermarket and buying your steak.

2240
02:12:53.310 --> 02:12:57.450
Nothing wrong with that.
But I really love archery and I've rediscovered it.

2241
02:12:57.451 --> 02:13:01.140
I did it when I was a kid.
I was in the boy scouts and I enjoyed it then,

2242
02:13:01.141 --> 02:13:02.310
but I never really got into it.

2243
02:13:02.311 --> 02:13:05.620
I just did it a few times and I always thought it was fun.
But man,
I'm,

2244
02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:08.970
since I picked up,
uh,
the,
this,
uh,
bow,
uh,

2245
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:12.660
I guess I got it about a couple of months ago.
Um,
I really enjoy it.

2246
02:13:12.690 --> 02:13:14.370
I just enjoy shooting targets.

2247
02:13:14.371 --> 02:13:18.780
It's really fun because when you're concentrating on that target,

2248
02:13:19.170 --> 02:13:22.290
you're not thinking and nothing else.
It's very difficult.

2249
02:13:22.291 --> 02:13:24.390
You're trying to be steady and when you're trying to be steady,

2250
02:13:24.391 --> 02:13:28.620
there's something zen in that and went in that zen activity.

2251
02:13:28.770 --> 02:13:32.190
There's something that's,
it's cleansing or,
I mean,
I don't,

2252
02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:36.060
<v 3>I don't know what it is,
but in order to really be accurate with a bow,</v>

2253
02:13:36.061 --> 02:13:40.740
it requires so much discipline.
Yeah,
it does.
And that's,

2254
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:44.700
you know,
getting out,
shooting a bow.
I like getting out in the summer,
uh,

2255
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.980
shirt off,
listening to music just by myself.
I usually go by myself and just,

2256
02:13:50.370 --> 02:13:50.671
you know,

2257
02:13:50.671 --> 02:13:55.140
there's something about watching an Arrow arc and drop into the target and

2258
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:59.430
that's just,
I don't know,
it's powerful.
It's relaxing.

2259
02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:02.860
It's as in like,
you know,
like what you mentioned and um,

2260
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:07.680
I think people see that and then you look at the Bose and the bows look cool.

2261
02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.080
You know,
everybody there,
you know,
you'll,

2262
02:14:10.110 --> 02:14:12.870
you'll get into it also by your Arrow is like your signature.

2263
02:14:13.050 --> 02:14:17.460
So everybody has their Arrow and it's got their colors,
you know what I mean?

2264
02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:19.470
And it's got,
you can get custom wraps on it.

2265
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:24.180
So I have wraps that say fear is a liar and Fletcher say beast mode.

2266
02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:27.630
And so your Arrow becomes,
you know,
everybody,

2267
02:14:27.631 --> 02:14:29.610
if you walk in someplace and you're shooting with other guys,

2268
02:14:29.611 --> 02:14:31.950
everyone's looking at your arrow.
It's just kind of cool.

2269
02:14:31.951 --> 02:14:33.720
So you can customize people,

2270
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:37.920
they see their bows and they take a lot of pride in how they're both set up and

2271
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:41.910
everybody believes that their setup is better than the next guys because for

2272
02:14:41.911 --> 02:14:46.080
whatever reason,
and it's just,
you know,
people get so invested in,

2273
02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:50.160
in archery,
it's just,
I dunno,
it's powerful in,

2274
02:14:50.161 --> 02:14:54.600
like I've said before,
bowhunting has changed my life.
I mean,

2275
02:14:54.601 --> 02:14:55.434
I went from,

2276
02:14:55.950 --> 02:15:00.950
from a kid who had no direction basically to now I know exactly what I want to

2277
02:15:01.711 --> 02:15:04.140
do and who I want to be.
And it's,
you know,

2278
02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:08.850
allowed me to get on talk to Joe Rogan here in La.
Bow Hunting.
Is that,

2279
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:13.680
that's just,
I mean,
that just seems crazy to me.
So it's,
uh,
it's,

2280
02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:16.680
it's just a powerful deal.
And you're wearing an under Armour shirt,
man.

2281
02:15:16.681 --> 02:15:20.730
Under Armour sponsors you,
I mean,
they make your shirts,
they do just that alone.

2282
02:15:20.731 --> 02:15:24.060
You're in an under Armour commercial with a wolf.
Yeah,
no,
under armor.

2283
02:15:24.330 --> 02:15:27.960
They've been my longest sponsor and I think,

2284
02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:33.210
I think they told me I'm their,
their longest tenured professional athlete.

2285
02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:38.310
Really?
Yeah.
Nine.
Incredible.
How did you get involved with that?
Um,

2286
02:15:39.090 --> 02:15:42.930
it was actually,
we were at shot show like,
so 10 years ago I think,

2287
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:47.100
and I walked by their booth and they had a,
there's a picture,
Randy White,

2288
02:15:47.101 --> 02:15:49.350
he was wearing under Armour and the headed in their booth.

2289
02:15:49.650 --> 02:15:52.410
He standing out there with a bow,
you know,
Randy White played for the cowboys,

2290
02:15:53.190 --> 02:15:58.030
Superbowl MVP.
And uh,
he had this bow and I'm like,
I'm going to,

2291
02:15:58.040 --> 02:15:59.790
Dang,
he's looks like a monster.

2292
02:15:59.790 --> 02:16:02.730
He's like 50 some years old and just veins everywhere.
Just a stud.

2293
02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.170
I caught my attention.
I'm like,

2294
02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:08.040
so I talked to Eric Crawford was the guy's name at the,
at the booth there.

2295
02:16:08.041 --> 02:16:10.710
And I'm like,
so,
uh,
how come you guys are here?
You know,

2296
02:16:10.711 --> 02:16:15.450
I thought you were sports,
you know,
just,
you know,
football and baseball,

2297
02:16:15.451 --> 02:16:17.670
things like that.
They go,
oh,
we're getting into hunting.

2298
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:20.760
And all they had was like the,
the green or the Brown,

2299
02:16:20.761 --> 02:16:25.710
just tight stuff or hunting.
Just that first layer.
And I said,
oh,
that's cool.

2300
02:16:25.711 --> 02:16:30.160
So it just Kinda,
he had seen me,
I was editing this magazine called Eastman's

2301
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.150
<v 0>bowhunting journal,
and he had got the magazine so he knew who I was.</v>

2302
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:37.810
So just kind of started from there.
I signed on with them.

2303
02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:41.650
And they're hunting line now is huge.
Yeah.

2304
02:16:41.651 --> 02:16:45.030
There's a commercial that,
uh,
I make fun of,
uh,
when I,

2305
02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:48.850
when it comes on because it's so silly.
There's a,
all these athletes,

2306
02:16:49.090 --> 02:16:51.580
like there's this woman who's like a professional skier,

2307
02:16:51.581 --> 02:16:54.340
I guess there's all these different athletes do when all this athletic stuff.

2308
02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:58.960
And then there's the duck dynasty guy was big fat moon pie face.
And he's,

2309
02:16:59.030 --> 02:17:01.870
he's looking around and they're talking about athletes and he's blown his duck

2310
02:17:01.871 --> 02:17:06.580
call Mike.
That it's not an athlete that's willy.
You can't,
what's,
who's willing?

2311
02:17:06.581 --> 02:17:08.350
The fat guy's willing.
Yeah.
You can't make fun of them.

2312
02:17:08.351 --> 02:17:12.280
I think that's like against some sort of law.
Nope,
I just did.
He's a fat fuck.

2313
02:17:12.310 --> 02:17:15.550
And his,
he's got a big fucking dinner plate face.
He's big boned.

2314
02:17:16.090 --> 02:17:20.320
He's fat dudes.
Fat As fuck.
That dude couldn't go hunting with you.

2315
02:17:20.321 --> 02:17:23.610
He's sitting around waiting for ducks to fall.
This guy rant.

2316
02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:28.300
But it's just hilarious that when his fat moon pie face comes on,
no disrespect.

2317
02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:31.260
That's what it says.
That's what it says.
Athletes.

2318
02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:36.010
Like they say the word athletes,
you know that we make clothes for athletes.
Like,

2319
02:17:36.011 --> 02:17:38.380
come on man.
No I don't.
They didn't call me for that.

2320
02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:41.200
They should call you for that is what I'm saying.
We,
you know,

2321
02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:45.310
do you think America is ready?
I mean,
look,
we have this duck dynasty show,
right?

2322
02:17:45.311 --> 02:17:49.390
So it's a reality show,
which is,
let's be honest,
it's not really a reality show.

2323
02:17:49.391 --> 02:17:51.850
It's scripted.
There's fake scenarios,

2324
02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.110
but the premise of the show involves hunting.

2325
02:17:56.530 --> 02:18:00.940
And I think that's fascinating.
Um,
I think,
I think the show is ridiculous.

2326
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.230
Um,

2327
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:07.230
but I liked the fact that it's a hugely popular show and the show's about

2328
02:18:07.481 --> 02:18:08.314
hunting.

2329
02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:12.520
And I think there's a real hypocritical attitude that a lot of people in this

2330
02:18:12.521 --> 02:18:17.110
country have because of the fact that food is so readily available because it's

2331
02:18:17.111 --> 02:18:20.020
so easy to just go to the supermarket and buy food.
People say,

2332
02:18:20.021 --> 02:18:21.670
well why would you want to get it yourself?

2333
02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:24.340
You must be a cruel person that wants to go out and shoot animals.

2334
02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:28.180
I think even though it's a baby step,
a show,

2335
02:18:28.810 --> 02:18:32.590
we're like a duck dynasty type show where you see these guys that are hunters

2336
02:18:32.591 --> 02:18:35.800
and it's a hugely popular show or 16 million people watching it now.

2337
02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:36.813
Whatever the hell it is,

2338
02:18:37.090 --> 02:18:42.090
that's good because that's slowly starting to integrate and it's okay cause it's

2339
02:18:42.281 --> 02:18:45.640
ducks and people don't really have as much of an affinity to docks as they do to

2340
02:18:45.641 --> 02:18:46.420
Bambi.

2341
02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:50.030
You know like a deer hunting show will be a little bit more problematic button.

2342
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:52.300
They need to do a show with you.
Dude,

2343
02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:56.470
this is what I'm getting at a show with you out there and I'm telling them right

2344
02:18:56.471 --> 02:18:57.910
now they'll listen and trust me.

2345
02:18:57.911 --> 02:19:00.550
There's a lot of Hollywood people listen to this show.

2346
02:19:00.551 --> 02:19:04.080
The shows have been made because of people being on the show.
That would be a,

2347
02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:08.950
there's that fat moon pie face back that shit up.
Okay,
this come on son.

2348
02:19:09.010 --> 02:19:12.910
Rant,
rant.
Look at that.
Big Fat fit.
You are not an athlete,
man.

2349
02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:18.190
Got To look at that ramp ramp.
He's not a stud.
Look at that.
Look at that.

2350
02:19:18.191 --> 02:19:21.400
That's a fat man.
It's not as thought.
You're a stud.
That's a fat man.

2351
02:19:21.401 --> 02:19:25.240
I know you're being nice,
but you've got to cut that shit.
I mean,
it'd be a stud.

2352
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:28.880
He's got the potential inside of them,
but he's eating fucking Cheetos,

2353
02:19:29.550 --> 02:19:33.300
his own pies.
His Dad,
his dad.
Um,

2354
02:19:33.350 --> 02:19:35.870
on that show on duck dynasty.
He,

2355
02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:39.890
he was an athlete at I think Louisiana state or something like that.

2356
02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:44.540
But his backup,
he's a quarterback on the football team.
Willie's Dad,
Phil,

2357
02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:49.490
and his backup was Terry Bradshaw.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.

2358
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:52.610
Yeah.
That's fascinating.
Yeah.
That's interesting.

2359
02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:57.620
But how come fills all angry at the gaze?
Got Real problems with the gays?
Yeah,

2360
02:19:57.621 --> 02:20:01.660
he does.
See right there.
He's right.

2361
02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:04.970
I heard was Phil Robertson and football.
I see.
He was a stud.
Yeah.

2362
02:20:04.971 --> 02:20:08.450
At one point in time.
Now he's a gay basher.
It's all angry about gays.

2363
02:20:08.770 --> 02:20:11.870
Kind of let go Phil.
They don't care about you.
You shouldn't care about them.

2364
02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:15.680
But you know,
as far as me being on the TV show,

2365
02:20:15.681 --> 02:20:20.540
so I a nice segway and change gears like how you did that.
That's professional.

2366
02:20:20.541 --> 02:20:23.500
That's how a good man in the media would do it.
No.
Uh,

2367
02:20:23.850 --> 02:20:28.460
so I have to turn in a contract today for a reality show here in la.
Yeah.

2368
02:20:28.530 --> 02:20:31.970
Really?
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons why you're here.
Um,
yeah.
Okay.

2369
02:20:31.971 --> 02:20:33.140
We'll talk to me about it afterwards.

2370
02:20:33.141 --> 02:20:36.230
I'm make sure they will fuck you over because things get tricky in the world of

2371
02:20:36.231 --> 02:20:39.380
reality TV.
Yeah.
Well this is just for the pilot.
Okay.

2372
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.590
If you sign on for the pilot,
you sign up for the rest of your life.

2373
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:47.770
I have a friend who they asked him to do a reality show and fortunately for him,

2374
02:20:48.231 --> 02:20:50.540
he,
uh,
he has his own business and he's doing well,

2375
02:20:50.660 --> 02:20:52.190
but it was his girlfriend's idea.

2376
02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:55.430
She wanted to do this reality show and he read the contract and he calls me up

2377
02:20:55.431 --> 02:20:57.500
on the phone.
He's like,
listen to this shit.

2378
02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.630
It's like they own my likeness for a life.
Like they own him for like,

2379
02:21:02.740 --> 02:21:05.420
like what they're realizing because of what,

2380
02:21:05.421 --> 02:21:10.160
you know from survivor to fear factor all these shows on cause they realize like

2381
02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:11.413
fear factor.

2382
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:16.010
Michael Yo is probably the only person that I know of that became famous because

2383
02:21:16.011 --> 02:21:19.880
of fear factor.
And Michael you always a comic and he's on he really,

2384
02:21:19.881 --> 02:21:23.070
really nice guy.
But you're famous.
Yeah,
but I was famous already,

2385
02:21:23.450 --> 02:21:26.510
wasn't really famous already but it was on a sitcom and I don't know who Michael

2386
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:31.380
Yo is.
So very nice guy.
He's a comic.
But my point was that like,
um,

2387
02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:33.291
I guess I,

2388
02:21:33.291 --> 02:21:36.270
I certainly became more famous because if you're a factor but fear factor,

2389
02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:40.340
we really didn't make too many stars,
but some of those shows made stars,

2390
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:44.060
some of these reality shows,
whether it's the bachelor or you know,

2391
02:21:44.061 --> 02:21:46.550
of course like,
uh,
the uh,

2392
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:49.520
singing shows like American idol made a lot of stars.

2393
02:21:49.860 --> 02:21:54.320
So they've realized that there's potential money to be made.

2394
02:21:54.321 --> 02:21:56.540
Once you're from,
you're on that show,

2395
02:21:56.750 --> 02:22:00.230
they make you a star and then you're a business,
you're a brand.
Well,

2396
02:22:00.231 --> 02:22:02.440
they want that brand.
So they,

2397
02:22:02.470 --> 02:22:07.470
they are some unscrupulous producers and networks there.

2398
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:12.560
They have these all encompassing contracts that are insane.
Like you,

2399
02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:16.850
you're on this show and then they fucking own you and they can use your likeness

2400
02:22:16.851 --> 02:22:21.500
till the day you die.
I mean,
they own you forever and it's,
it's,
it's insane.

2401
02:22:21.501 --> 02:22:23.840
And people are like,
I'll take it.
I want to be famous.

2402
02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:25.740
Like they'll do whatever they can.

2403
02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:28.080
And so like if you went and did something else,

2404
02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:32.040
say if you did that and the reality show takes off and does well,

2405
02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:35.820
but or doesn't do well and then it gets canceled and then you wind up doing

2406
02:22:35.821 --> 02:22:39.290
something else and that becomes a,
they still own you.
They did.

2407
02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:42.720
The first guy still owns,
you tracked over there.
You need to look at it,

2408
02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:47.370
but you need to get a lawyer to look at it.
It's,
it's,
it's a tricky business.

2409
02:22:47.371 --> 02:22:49.380
This world of reality TV.

2410
02:22:49.410 --> 02:22:54.410
And they look at people as commodities and they look at reality as being

2411
02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:59.850
flexible.
So the,
their version of reality is not really reality.

2412
02:22:59.851 --> 02:23:01.590
I mean they're calling it reality shows.

2413
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:05.400
But a lot of what you're dealing with is these people that were involved in,

2414
02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:10.320
in fiction,
they were involved in like sitcoms or dramas or what have you,

2415
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:15.000
and they're producing reality TV now,
so they engineer it.
It's all fake.

2416
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:17.790
Like they have fake setups,
fake scenarios.

2417
02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:21.030
I had a problem with the show that I did for [inaudible].
We're an editor,

2418
02:23:21.031 --> 02:23:24.960
put a fake seen in.
They put a totally,
they took a video,

2419
02:23:25.050 --> 02:23:26.940
they added sound to the video,

2420
02:23:26.941 --> 02:23:31.140
and they said that a listener or a podcast listener had sent this video and

2421
02:23:31.141 --> 02:23:33.780
total lie complete fabrication.

2422
02:23:33.781 --> 02:23:36.690
I found out about it and I went fucking crazy at a shit fit.

2423
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:41.130
I couldn't believe they because especially my show was all about trying to find

2424
02:23:41.131 --> 02:23:41.831
the truth.
You know,

2425
02:23:41.831 --> 02:23:45.120
it was about Joe Rogan questions everything except this fake fucking video

2426
02:23:45.121 --> 02:23:49.920
apparently,
but it's standard.
That's what they've always done.
They've just been,

2427
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:52.180
they do it because they think it makes a better they,

2428
02:23:52.181 --> 02:23:55.470
they call it creative license,
right?
They think it makes it better show.

2429
02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:58.830
It doesn't make it better show.
They don't have to do it.
It just,

2430
02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:03.420
they need to fall.
Cameron Hanes,
the bow and Arrow hunting for elk.
Yeah.

2431
02:24:03.450 --> 02:24:05.880
What will we call it?
I don't know.
Dealt with.
Well,

2432
02:24:05.881 --> 02:24:09.600
let's do it off the air because some of them fucking steal our idea off.

2433
02:24:09.601 --> 02:24:11.910
The air will come up with a way to do it with you.
Okay.

2434
02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:15.540
I've gotta be careful though,
man.
Don't get in bed with the wrong cats because,

2435
02:24:15.541 --> 02:24:20.280
uh,
this is,
this is a sneaky town,
you know,
and they know,
Oh,

2436
02:24:20.281 --> 02:24:23.940
look at this nice guy from Oregon.
He's a sweetheart.

2437
02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:28.650
Probably tells the truth all the time.
Poor bastard.
Probably.

2438
02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:32.420
He's probably honest.
Eat Him alive.
Yeah.
Out there hunting and everything.
No,
no,

2439
02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:34.760
no.
Go ahead.
We've got the contracts,
whatever,
whatever.

2440
02:24:34.770 --> 02:24:37.590
Don't worry about all that.
We gotta take care of you.
We'll take care of you.

2441
02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:40.590
I think that'd be a great show.
I've,
I've said that about Steve Rinella.

2442
02:24:40.591 --> 02:24:42.660
Show to Steven Ellis show,
in my opinion,

2443
02:24:42.661 --> 02:24:46.140
is that best hunting show on television meters are great show and it's a great

2444
02:24:46.141 --> 02:24:50.430
show.
Not just because it's a hunting show,
it's a great,
you know,

2445
02:24:50.431 --> 02:24:53.880
quote unquote reality show.
But it is a real reality show.

2446
02:24:53.881 --> 02:24:57.000
Like he got charged by a grizzly last night,
the episode that I watched,

2447
02:24:57.001 --> 02:24:59.700
like they were in the woods and they were,
uh,

2448
02:24:59.701 --> 02:25:03.780
they were actually bear hunting and a grisly mother with her,
uh,
her,

2449
02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:06.840
her cat,
no,
what did we call them?
Cubs.
Cubs.

2450
02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:10.850
Cubs charged her and charged them.
And it was fucking crazy.

2451
02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:15.540
See this giant grizzly running through the Bush at them.
It's like,
whoa.
Yeah,

2452
02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:18.390
that's tense.
And the narration,
you know,

2453
02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:22.470
Steve is a really well read guys.
He's very intelligent and articulate.

2454
02:25:22.471 --> 02:25:23.410
So it's fascinating.

2455
02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:27.490
He's an introspective guy too because the w the way he looks at these scenarios

2456
02:25:27.491 --> 02:25:30.100
in life itself is really interesting.
And him,
you know,

2457
02:25:30.101 --> 02:25:34.560
just talking about grizzly bears in Chicago,
talking about,
you know,
the,
the,
it,

2458
02:25:34.570 --> 02:25:39.350
it becomes an interesting show outside of the fact that it's a hunting show.

2459
02:25:39.351 --> 02:25:42.730
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
no.
Yeah.
You could have a good show even,
you know,

2460
02:25:42.731 --> 02:25:45.070
where the kill is secondary.
This is it right here.

2461
02:25:45.071 --> 02:25:48.840
This is back it up so he could see it before she runs at them.
Cause it's,

2462
02:25:48.841 --> 02:25:50.050
it's kind of fascinating.

2463
02:25:51.390 --> 02:25:54.210
She that she was like circling around towards him and they started getting

2464
02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:58.870
nervous.
So where they,
where they grizzly hunting.
Oh yeah.

2465
02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:01.390
Yeah.
But they didn't want the female obviously.

2466
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.120
<v 6>Yeah,
they're trying to spook her front of her</v>

2467
02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:14.670
at all.
I mean all these to be called you're behind or like what's going on?

2468
02:26:14.970 --> 02:26:18.920
I will shoot kill this side was all

2469
02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:24.930
spins away and Callahan says,
I'll never forget.
I want to give them a tee shirt.

2470
02:26:24.931 --> 02:26:29.670
Was it him and his mustache and this said smell loss now 80 smells.

2471
02:26:29.671 --> 02:26:32.920
Now Lady,
that's a sentence that comes to Callahan's minute.

2472
02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:37.680
The grizzly bear changes his mind besides not the mall is referring to is as she

2473
02:26:37.681 --> 02:26:42.270
caught,
she gets down wind directions,
you know.

2474
02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:46.800
And so Ryan saying like now the wind will carry my order to realize that we're

2475
02:26:46.801 --> 02:26:50.670
people and we shouldn't be messed with and saw what he yells and us now lady,

2476
02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:53.700
you kind of are,
it's like immediate around with right now.

2477
02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:58.360
<v 0>It seems like she would have known from the rifles going off too,
but well,
yeah,</v>

2478
02:26:58.361 --> 02:27:00.100
well she heard it as she was running.

2479
02:27:00.101 --> 02:27:03.530
She was probably breathing and grounding and everything.
Yeah.

2480
02:27:03.570 --> 02:27:06.230
He's probably didn't know exactly what it was until it was too late.
Yeah.

2481
02:27:06.490 --> 02:27:10.690
They get pretty tunnel vision about protecting.
I think these shows,
uh,

2482
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:11.591
there's,

2483
02:27:11.591 --> 02:27:16.591
there's an element of reality in a good hunting show that would be fascinating

2484
02:27:17.681 --> 02:27:20.710
on regular television and these shows,
a lot of them,

2485
02:27:20.770 --> 02:27:24.250
they're on the sportsmans channel,
the outdoors and network or you know,
these,

2486
02:27:24.251 --> 02:27:27.880
these,
these,
what channels you're show on outdoor channel,
outdoor channel.

2487
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:31.180
And so these channels,
like a lot of people don't go to that area.

2488
02:27:31.181 --> 02:27:36.181
Like for me it's like 600 605-SIX-OH-FOUR-606 on direct TV.

2489
02:27:38.530 --> 02:27:40.930
And a lot of folks don't go to that area unless they look at it from Mexican

2490
02:27:40.931 --> 02:27:45.210
porn.
That's like a few channels.
So six isn't it six 18 or something?

2491
02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:48.880
Well there's a,
you know,
some Fox sports is a,

2492
02:27:48.881 --> 02:27:51.670
there's Fox sports two or something like that.
It's up there as well.

2493
02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:55.180
One of those,
you know,
some,
some sports channels are up in that area too.

2494
02:27:55.181 --> 02:27:59.260
But you know,
it's just a weird area of the dial.
And I think it's unfortunate.

2495
02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:02.590
I think,
um,
that's the untapped area.

2496
02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:06.490
I don't want to say this for Hollywood because these same fuck heads who make

2497
02:28:06.491 --> 02:28:08.860
fake scenarios are going to come in and ruin it.

2498
02:28:08.861 --> 02:28:13.660
But a show like meat eater or a show following you around elk hunting with a
bow,

2499
02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:19.080
there's so much drama and reality in that without having to add bullshit.

2500
02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:22.280
Yeah.
You know,
and someone's got to do something

2501
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:24.590
<v 2>like that.
I mean mediator does,
but someone else could do it too,</v>

2502
02:28:24.591 --> 02:28:27.610
where you make a pledge.
Like there's going to be no lying.

2503
02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:31.500
There's going to be no shit.
This is all real real and it's great.
Yeah,

2504
02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:36.210
no emotion,
real,
real providing.
And you know,

2505
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:40.760
I've had that pitch to me recently about just showing,
because just like the,

2506
02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:45.680
the train,
not only the training for the hunt,
but the,
um,

2507
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:49.460
comradery,
getting out there,
like the challenges I do for my bow giving back,

2508
02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:50.050
you know,

2509
02:28:50.050 --> 02:28:54.320
just that is all part of the story and yet we're killing an animal at the end.

2510
02:28:54.321 --> 02:28:58.910
Hopefully.
Maybe not,
you know,
cause a lot of hunts and with no Keel but just the,

2511
02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:03.410
the whole journey,
you know,
and it seems like it would make good TV,

2512
02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:07.580
but Steve shows a lot of hunts that have no kills.
Um,

2513
02:29:07.650 --> 02:29:10.280
I liked that.
I liked that.
It keeps it real like that.

2514
02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:13.880
I hate that expression though.
Keep it real.
God expressions beaten up.

2515
02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:17.990
That is a beaten up and expression.
But the,
you know,

2516
02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:21.470
having that ethic.
Cause you know,
he had a mountain lion hunt.

2517
02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:25.610
They didn't even see him out in La.
They went for nine days,
didn't see one.

2518
02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:29.260
He had a,
a recent elk hunt,
saw a bunch of elk,

2519
02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:32.210
never got close enough to get a shot at one.
And you know,

2520
02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:36.980
I think that's important,
man.
I think it's important to show people that this is,

2521
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:41.120
it's called hunting.
It's not called shooting right here.

2522
02:29:41.121 --> 02:29:43.420
We're going to shoot animals today.
Come on and watch us.
Oh,

2523
02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:47.720
people think that you drive out in the truck and drinking beer or whatever you

2524
02:29:47.721 --> 02:29:50.510
do and just see something and to shoot at it.
You know,
that's,

2525
02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.820
that's definitely not my hunting.
Well,

2526
02:29:52.821 --> 02:29:57.821
that is the problem that the public opinion of hunting faces is the ignorance,

2527
02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:04.750
you know,
the Hollywood helps that too.
Does it?
Yeah.
I mean,
just like a scene.

2528
02:30:04.751 --> 02:30:09.230
A Wolverine,
is that what you mean?
Right.
Yeah.
So I mean they're showing,
um,

2529
02:30:09.410 --> 02:30:11.660
supposedly hunters out there,
they shoot this,

2530
02:30:11.930 --> 02:30:15.800
I think it's actually wolverine as he was,
uh,
an animal,
but she,

2531
02:30:15.801 --> 02:30:17.300
him with the poison pot Arrow,

2532
02:30:17.301 --> 02:30:21.830
which I don't even have never even seen a poison pot arrow,
but so,
um,

2533
02:30:21.980 --> 02:30:26.480
has poison on the Arrow shoots him.
He turns back into Hugh Jackman or whatever,

2534
02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:29.540
and then he goes and he wants to,
he's a window.
You serious?

2535
02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:33.800
I think he misread it.
It was a bear,
but he found the bear.
Oh,

2536
02:30:33.801 --> 02:30:36.890
was that what it was?
Yeah.
He didn't turn into a bear.
No.
Well,

2537
02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:39.090
I thought it wasn't a shit out of people,
man.
Okay.

2538
02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:42.440
So how hard were you when you are watching this man?
No,
I was on a plane,

2539
02:30:42.840 --> 02:30:45.580
was probably in and out of sleeping,
but the,

2540
02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:49.970
but the point was they got this,
this Arrow out of the bear,

2541
02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:55.070
I guess.
And he went,
he found the hunters,
they were at the bar and,
uh,

2542
02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:57.660
they're drinking at the bar and he went in there and you know,

2543
02:30:57.780 --> 02:31:01.280
shoved the poison Arrow through the leader's hand.
And it's just like,

2544
02:31:01.281 --> 02:31:05.060
so it's just showing hunters as the bad people,
you know what I mean?

2545
02:31:05.180 --> 02:31:08.230
And it's just like,
that doesn't help anybody who does.

2546
02:31:08.810 --> 02:31:12.560
I've never been to a bar after hunting and definitely never use poison arrows.

2547
02:31:12.561 --> 02:31:17.300
It's just like,
it's perpetuating that stereotype.
Well,
yeah.
And not only that,

2548
02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:20.430
the way you shoot it,
the poisoned won't even get to him blow right through them.

2549
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:24.320
Poison being the Arrow and the other side of town.
Yeah,
right.
No,

2550
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:26.580
not even an effective way to transmit poison.
You know,

2551
02:31:26.581 --> 02:31:28.650
you've got to get it into the bloodstream.
You know,

2552
02:31:28.651 --> 02:31:31.950
when you're shooting a missile through a bear's body,
it doesn't work that way.

2553
02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:36.210
That is,
you know,
look,
these are Hollywood stereotypes,

2554
02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:41.190
these classic black hat villains.
It's just so easy to do.

2555
02:31:41.191 --> 02:31:44.730
It's just lazy.
Yeah,
that's all it is.
But so I mean,
yeah,

2556
02:31:44.731 --> 02:31:47.370
I think people just have the have the wrong idea.

2557
02:31:47.371 --> 02:31:50.190
And so having a show that would show that,
you know,

2558
02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:55.520
success on elk with a bow is around 10% so it's like 90% of the guys out there

2559
02:31:55.651 --> 02:32:00.540
pursuing elk with a bone Arrow are failing.
And a,
it's not guaranteed.

2560
02:32:00.541 --> 02:32:04.230
It is really tough showing that struggle.
And that's why,

2561
02:32:04.290 --> 02:32:06.270
I mean that's one of the reasons why I train the way I do.

2562
02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:08.730
I don't want to be in that 90% you know,

2563
02:32:08.731 --> 02:32:10.860
my goal is to be successful every single year.

2564
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:13.230
So if you do with the average guy does,

2565
02:32:13.231 --> 02:32:18.150
you're gonna fail nine times out of 10 if you do more than average,

2566
02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:22.110
if you do more than anybody else or the the standard,

2567
02:32:22.530 --> 02:32:25.650
then maybe you'll have more success.
And so as it is,

2568
02:32:25.651 --> 02:32:29.250
I kill my bull every single year.
And it's just,

2569
02:32:29.370 --> 02:32:31.440
I think it's not because I'm any better,

2570
02:32:31.441 --> 02:32:34.050
it's because I just work harder preparing so well,

2571
02:32:34.051 --> 02:32:38.040
you've become better through hard work.
You become better with knowledge,

2572
02:32:38.041 --> 02:32:41.790
you become better with training,
with fitness,
with preparation,

2573
02:32:41.791 --> 02:32:46.290
with arrows shooting,
you shoot arrows every day,
right?
Yup.
Yup.
So it was just,

2574
02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:47.850
you know,
and that's,

2575
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:51.810
but if people could see how difficult it really is and see that,
you know,

2576
02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:55.200
like we did film in Australia where we have no food,

2577
02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:59.840
we have no water is 120 degrees drinking piss and drinking piss.

2578
02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:01.780
That I think,
you know,

2579
02:33:01.781 --> 02:33:05.970
that would make compelling TV because they're like,
wow,

2580
02:33:05.971 --> 02:33:10.200
this is a lot different than I saw in the wolverine movie.
You know?

2581
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:15.520
And I don't know.
I think I,
I think it'd be not,
I don't know.

2582
02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:19.380
I think it'd be important to get out there because hunters are the number one

2583
02:33:19.381 --> 02:33:24.210
conservationists there are and sharing that story.
Yeah.
I,
I agree.

2584
02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:27.420
And you know,
some people find that contradictory.
It's like a,

2585
02:33:27.421 --> 02:33:29.970
I had a conversation with someone,
we were talking about,
uh,

2586
02:33:30.090 --> 02:33:34.620
people and I was saying,
well,
okay,
if you,
if you could only,

2587
02:33:34.621 --> 02:33:38.640
you know,
if you only hunted like one person a year,

2588
02:33:38.850 --> 02:33:42.660
but the rest of the people you made sure you fed them and you took care of them

2589
02:33:42.661 --> 02:33:46.580
that got great education and took care of their environment and made sure that

2590
02:33:46.581 --> 02:33:50.520
the streets are clean.
Would it be okay to go out and hunt one person?
Right.

2591
02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:52.230
You know,
people were like,
fuck no.

2592
02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:56.730
And so like when you apply that to animal hunting,

2593
02:33:56.990 --> 02:34:01.560
it's for a lot of people that's sort of the same sort of feeling they have.

2594
02:34:01.710 --> 02:34:05.430
But what they don't understand is as the apex Predator people don't like to

2595
02:34:05.431 --> 02:34:07.020
think of as us as the Apex Predator,

2596
02:34:07.021 --> 02:34:09.690
especially if you're a vegetarian or if you're an animal rights lover.

2597
02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:14.190
But there's a war going on between all lifeforms on this planet.

2598
02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:18.310
We are just so far ahead of the other animals that we forgot it's war.

2599
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:22.900
<v 0>And we forgot that we have these POW camps in our cities and we call them zoos.</v>

2600
02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:26.140
Okay.
And that's what that is.
Those are prisoner of war camps.

2601
02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:28.510
That's what we dominate this planet.

2602
02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:32.770
And the reason why you can get out of this office and go walk down the street

2603
02:34:32.771 --> 02:34:36.670
and not worry about getting mauled is because we paved this motherfucker and we

2604
02:34:36.671 --> 02:34:40.600
killed everything that can kill us.
And we made sure that anything that comes in,

2605
02:34:40.690 --> 02:34:44.590
we call the cops and they sent helicopters and they fucking circle the area with

2606
02:34:44.591 --> 02:34:48.190
a flashlight until they find that cat and then they've tranquilize it and they

2607
02:34:48.191 --> 02:34:49.910
get it the fuck out of here we,

2608
02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:53.320
this is our domain and you don't like to think it's our domain because you don't

2609
02:34:53.321 --> 02:34:57.220
have to do any of the work,
right?
But the reality comes into full force.

2610
02:34:57.790 --> 02:35:01.720
If you're alone in Idaho with a bow and Arrow and you get circled by a bunch of

2611
02:35:01.721 --> 02:35:04.750
howling beasts and they're trying to take the elk away from you,

2612
02:35:05.050 --> 02:35:09.760
that's comes real clear then fuck yeah,
it does.
We are the apex predators.

2613
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:13.240
Whether you're a Predator or not,
the human animal is the Apex Predator.

2614
02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:17.020
And as that we have to be the stewards of the land.

2615
02:35:17.021 --> 02:35:19.510
We have to manage this whole situation.

2616
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:24.220
And that includes managing predators.
It includes managing game animals,

2617
02:35:24.221 --> 02:35:27.610
it includes the whole kitten caboodle.
And that's what hunters are.

2618
02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:30.200
That's what hunter's dollars do is they,

2619
02:35:30.250 --> 02:35:34.570
they put that hundreds of the grass roots out there,
feet on the ground,

2620
02:35:34.571 --> 02:35:37.540
making it happen.
And if you don't do that,
you know what the other option is?

2621
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:39.640
You got to pay someone to go kill these animals,

2622
02:35:39.641 --> 02:35:44.500
which is even more ridiculous cause then you have to take taxpayer money away to

2623
02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:48.430
go take animals that are made out of food and you've got to kill them.

2624
02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:53.650
These are animals that people could have paid to go kill and then enjoyed the

2625
02:35:53.651 --> 02:35:54.580
food themselves.

2626
02:35:54.730 --> 02:35:56.920
Now you've got to hire it like what they're doing in the Hamptons.

2627
02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:00.190
You heard about that.
And you know New York,
they have oh dear,

2628
02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:03.100
massive deer population.
So they're hiring snipers.

2629
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:04.300
They're trying to figure out what to do.

2630
02:36:04.301 --> 02:36:09.301
They might spend money on ready for this strap in birth control for deer.

2631
02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:13.960
If you're talking about spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to give dear

2632
02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:16.930
food with birth control in it,
to keep them from breathing,

2633
02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:19.570
they're made out of food.

2634
02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:22.810
There's plenty of people who would like to go and help them control those

2635
02:36:22.811 --> 02:36:25.870
animals and pay to do it.
Well,
the problem is that it's an urban area,
right?

2636
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:27.410
And it's because they've been,

2637
02:36:27.430 --> 02:36:32.400
they've let it get so out of control that the surrounding areas,
you know,

2638
02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:35.770
where you would have a safe area where you can hunt,
especially bow hunt,

2639
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:38.170
you can't do it.
So it's,
it's so crazy.

2640
02:36:38.170 --> 02:36:39.940
Like they're going to have to hire snipers.
They're gonna,

2641
02:36:40.210 --> 02:36:42.420
they're gonna have to figure out a way to,
I mean,
I,

2642
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:46.640
you don't want the hunters roaming around in the Hamptons.
Right.
Especially mean,

2643
02:36:46.690 --> 02:36:49.060
I wouldn't mind you doing it,
but you know what I'm saying?

2644
02:36:49.061 --> 02:36:52.210
Like the average Yahoo,
the average dude,
you know,

2645
02:36:52.211 --> 02:36:55.810
you find out he can go hunting in the Hamptons and,
you know,
I don't know,
man.

2646
02:36:55.811 --> 02:36:56.110
I mean,

2647
02:36:56.110 --> 02:36:59.920
I think you should have to have like a black belt and hunting to go hunting in a

2648
02:36:59.921 --> 02:37:02.170
Hamptons.
Yeah,
I hear you.
Even then,

2649
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:04.900
I don't know if I'd be really cool with you hunting near a playground.

2650
02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:09.730
Now you know your Arrow misses the mark and goes flying into some kid on a slide

2651
02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:11.780
arrow.
What?
Not Yours.
Right,
okay.

2652
02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:15.070
Meaning that other guy out there that doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

2653
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:19.610
I you,
I missed once,
but it's,
I bet you did,

2654
02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:20.880
but it's,
that's a,

2655
02:37:20.890 --> 02:37:25.490
that's the reality of the situation is that we're the ones as the intelligent

2656
02:37:25.491 --> 02:37:29.720
creatures that can communicate.
We're the ones who have made an assessment.

2657
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:34.580
We've made a detailed analysis of all the different animals and the numbers and

2658
02:37:34.581 --> 02:37:38.060
we monitor them on a yearly basis and folks who don't know,

2659
02:37:38.090 --> 02:37:39.590
they don't appreciate that.

2660
02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:43.190
I wasn't a hunter when I was young and I didn't understand hunting and I thought

2661
02:37:43.191 --> 02:37:45.200
there was something fucked up about it.
I would say,

2662
02:37:45.201 --> 02:37:47.780
why would anybody want to kill a deer man dealer?
Dear beautiful.

2663
02:37:48.050 --> 02:37:49.610
I was a fisherman.
I used to go fishing,

2664
02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:53.210
but that's where it ended for me because I can't relate to a fish.

2665
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:56.390
Fishing for me is like tricking aliens.

2666
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:59.780
Like they live in this water world that I can't even see in.

2667
02:37:59.781 --> 02:38:01.700
I throw something in there and pull it out and eat it.

2668
02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:03.950
Like I can't relate to them.
You know,

2669
02:38:03.951 --> 02:38:07.430
they're running around breathing water like I can eat you.
I got no,

2670
02:38:07.540 --> 02:38:09.930
you don't even take care of their young.
They just like you're,
you're,

2671
02:38:09.931 --> 02:38:14.450
you're on your own.
Get the fuck out of here.
It was a different thing for me.

2672
02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:17.860
So I can relate to people that can't relate to hunter.

2673
02:38:18.850 --> 02:38:22.680
<v 3>Yeah.
That uh,
and I dunno,</v>

2674
02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:26.350
I think getting down there to the boat shop and even just like you said,

2675
02:38:26.351 --> 02:38:28.270
shooting a bow,
you don't necessarily have to be a hunter,

2676
02:38:28.570 --> 02:38:32.710
but if you can listen to a hunter and kind of listen to their stories and listen

2677
02:38:32.711 --> 02:38:35.410
to it,
you don't,
I mean you don't have to go kill,

2678
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:39.310
but a lot of guys learn a lot of good life lessons out in the mountains and

2679
02:38:39.311 --> 02:38:42.090
maybe you can pick up on that.
I like hanging out with the,
you know,
the,

2680
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:47.020
the shop to set up your bow.
Yesterday or not yesterday,
day before,

2681
02:38:47.021 --> 02:38:51.880
I think was,
is the bow rack in Springfield,
Oregon.
And that's like,

2682
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:56.110
it's like a bar with no alcohol as far as listening to stories.
It's awesome.

2683
02:38:56.620 --> 02:39:00.190
I love sitting on the stool picking things up from other guys and just hearing

2684
02:39:00.191 --> 02:39:03.850
stories and that's uh,
you know,
you don't have to be a hunter to,

2685
02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:07.300
to enjoy that and enjoy fire and a few arrows.
It's uh,

2686
02:39:07.530 --> 02:39:08.890
it's soothing.

2687
02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:12.380
<v 0>Well,
people that participate in the same sort of discipline,
they,
they,</v>

2688
02:39:12.381 --> 02:39:14.360
they enjoy that camaraderie together.

2689
02:39:14.361 --> 02:39:16.760
They understand each other in a way that maybe other folks don't.

2690
02:39:17.090 --> 02:39:20.780
You get that from Jiu Jitsu Gym.
You know,
you get that from a kickboxing gym.

2691
02:39:20.781 --> 02:39:23.450
You get that from a,
you know,
crossfit studio.

2692
02:39:23.451 --> 02:39:27.680
You get that from anything that you do where the people can sort of relate to

2693
02:39:27.681 --> 02:39:31.880
this unusual activity that you partake in.
And a,
I think that that's,

2694
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:34.350
that's something about archery.
You know when you go,

2695
02:39:34.430 --> 02:39:38.540
like the place that I went to the archery outpost in Los Alamitos,

2696
02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:42.040
there's a bunch of people around there talking about the obvious,

2697
02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:43.160
seen the new Hoyt,

2698
02:39:43.161 --> 02:39:46.160
you know they got a new cam on the Matthews and this has got it.

2699
02:39:46.170 --> 02:39:50.450
Oh they got to the Bowtech and 355 feet per second and blah blah blah.

2700
02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:55.590
You know all that shop talk and it's a lot of people are missing that sort of

2701
02:39:55.611 --> 02:40:00.611
comradery in their everyday life because most days from nine to five you don't

2702
02:40:00.651 --> 02:40:02.510
get to talk about what you want to talk about.

2703
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:04.870
You have to talk about what you're getting paid to talk about.

2704
02:40:04.890 --> 02:40:09.020
You get to talk about what your job entails.
And for most people they're trapped,

2705
02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:12.140
trapped in this,
this world like you know,

2706
02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.540
unfortunately you said you are and some days I didn't say that.

2707
02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:18.030
Get this reality show brother.
Get cracking.

2708
02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:22.560
You be right up there with that fat moon pie face guy on TV.
Sounds good.

2709
02:40:22.590 --> 02:40:23.390
No duck style.

2710
02:40:23.390 --> 02:40:28.390
Just elk bugling elk and arrows and bears and everything stuff.

2711
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:32.520
Cool stuff.
Yeah,
mountains.
Yeah.
Dude,
listen man,

2712
02:40:32.521 --> 02:40:35.190
this had been a really fun podcast.
I enjoyed it very much.
Thanks.

2713
02:40:35.191 --> 02:40:37.390
We're going to do this again.
Yeah,
for sure.
Thank you.

2714
02:40:37.410 --> 02:40:41.100
And keep me posted on this a reality show and keep us posted and if it actually

2715
02:40:41.101 --> 02:40:44.790
does come off,
we will promote the hell out of it.
Man.
Promo write pretty slowly.

2716
02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:48.750
So if anybody wants to find Cameron Online,
it's a Cameron Hanes on Twitter,

2717
02:40:48.751 --> 02:40:53.130
but he don't use that.
So you've got to find him on Facebook.
He uses Facebook,

2718
02:40:53.131 --> 02:40:55.300
but Facebook goes straight to Twitter.
Yeah,

2719
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:58.800
it's one of those you don't even know your,
your Twitter Password Day somehow.

2720
02:40:58.801 --> 02:41:03.160
Magic.
Yeah.
Somehow a magic connection.
I had my,

2721
02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:05.940
I had my buddy Colin set that up for me.
Well,

2722
02:41:05.970 --> 02:41:07.650
they'll probably give it think you probably reset it.

2723
02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:10.500
I'm sure they can reset it for you,
but you should get on Twitter.
Two men,

2724
02:41:10.501 --> 02:41:14.670
Twitter.
Twitter is a,
it's a great resource.
I'm on Instagram also.
Oh yeah,

2725
02:41:14.671 --> 02:41:16.860
that's right.
And great photos on Instagram by the way.

2726
02:41:16.861 --> 02:41:19.770
You put a lot of cool stuff on Instagram.
Very inspirational.

2727
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:24.090
You're an inspirational guy.
Uh,
I love your story.
I love your,
the,
your ethic.

2728
02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:28.890
I love what you're,
the,
the philosophy that you take in this life.
And I really,

2729
02:41:29.070 --> 02:41:31.380
really,
truly believe what I said.

2730
02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:36.381
That what you do is inspirational and it creates action that inspiration it,

2731
02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:40.050
it makes people do things.

2732
02:41:40.050 --> 02:41:44.280
It gives them the energy and the enthusiasm to go out and accomplish things on

2733
02:41:44.281 --> 02:41:46.320
their own.
And I think that's what life is all about really.

2734
02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:51.210
We're all in this together and I think that we all benefit from each other and

2735
02:41:51.211 --> 02:41:53.940
we benefit from fine examples of other human beings.

2736
02:41:54.210 --> 02:41:55.620
And I think you're an excellent example.

2737
02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:58.110
And I'll begin with thing and it's an honor to meet you,
sir.
Oh,

2738
02:41:58.180 --> 02:42:02.540
thanks for having me,
Jo.
Thanks.
And let us know.
And when you're doing a show on,

2739
02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:06.290
on,
on the outdoor channel,
and what is it?
Well,
I've been on team elk teammates,

2740
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.030
that's where I've been appearing,
but we're,
uh,
you know,

2741
02:42:09.031 --> 02:42:13.050
I've had a number of people approach me about doing my own show and so just

2742
02:42:13.051 --> 02:42:14.160
trying to get that hammered out.

2743
02:42:14.161 --> 02:42:17.640
Then in addition to these reality shows that once some the hardcore hunter

2744
02:42:17.641 --> 02:42:22.050
character that,
so we'll see what happens.
Probably nothing will happen.

2745
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:25.080
And then the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the something will happen.

2746
02:42:25.081 --> 02:42:27.930
Don't say nothing.
What if you want something to happen,
it'll happen.
Okay.

2747
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:30.540
We're going to,
we're going to help you make it happen man.
Oh,
