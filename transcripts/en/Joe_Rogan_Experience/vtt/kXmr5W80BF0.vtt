<v Speaker 1>some evaluation,</v>

37
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.640

38
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the government's going to be able to step in and tell you what you just get,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>

43
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you should have to write a blog and the internet could decide whether or not</v>

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

152
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a picture of you that a pot leaf next to you somewhere,</v>

155
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.420

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

158
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:41.820

<v Speaker 1>What did you pick guys with this guy that she was laced?</v>

176
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I'd never smoked nothing like this had been smoking alone.</v>

186
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.780

212
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>guy's fucking room is just smoked out.</v>

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.114
<v Speaker 1>well fuck it though.</v>

216
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to take on to get high here.</v>

217
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>So he gives me this three foot bong,</v>

218
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>one of those graphics,</v>

220
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 1>one's memory,</v>

221
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>the old graphics acrylics with the,</v>

222
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>like the tin bottom and shit.</v>

223
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>So he gives me one of those.</v>

224
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I take a hit filling.</v>

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

226
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

227
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>It goes around the circle,</v>

228
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>comes back to me,</v>

229
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

230
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.743
<v Speaker 1>I hit another one,</v>

231
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>third comes back a third time.</v>

232
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>So after the third time I'm like feeling extra high and I've like,</v>

233
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>that's usually nothing to me.</v>

234
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:41.951
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

235
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:42.784

00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know there was hash on the bottom of the bowl,</v>

256

273
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:35.774
<v Speaker 1>like a champ,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

278
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>June dude,</v>

279
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>after like 15 minutes I was just like,</v>

280
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.961
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

281
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling crispy is going on.</v>

282
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>This usually is just a warmup.</v>

283
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I took a cookie once on a plane and it was a,</v>

285
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>every now and then you'd get a cookie that just blows.</v>

286
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It blows your head.</v>

287
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

288
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:02.750

289
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>fucking an hour and 20 minutes.</v>

290
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's usually what it takes right before you're just not moving wherever you</v>

291
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>are is where you stay.</v>

292
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I got on board,</v>

293
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 1>got in just in time,</v>

294
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>but the plane takes off,</v>

295
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I strap in,</v>

296
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I pull back,</v>

297
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:17.421
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

298
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>click on the seat.</v>

299
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

300
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And just go into orbit.</v>

301
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Eyes closed.</v>

302
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching like neon cartoons,</v>

303
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>fuck in front of my eyeballs,</v>

304
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.540
<v Speaker 1>literally seeing hallucinations and I'm feeling my body flying through the air</v>

305
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>going for a hundred miles an hour.</v>

306
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:43.361
<v Speaker 1>I'm like super hyper aware that I'm in this metal tube hurling through the sky</v>

307
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.340
<v Speaker 1>back in my chair while this is going on.</v>

308
00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:48.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

309
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

310
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy and I'm hallucinating at the same time and seeing crazy things and</v>

311
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.933
<v Speaker 1>you'll you'll,</v>

312
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you'll take cookies and you'll be convinced it's over.</v>

313
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

314
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:00.861
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

315
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

316
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

317
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't survive this.</v>

318
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 1>The cookies are misleading.</v>

319
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>The cookies are misleading because cute.</v>

320
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

321
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 1>they taste so fucking good you like,</v>

322
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>and then they don't hit you right away.</v>

323
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:11.991
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>

324
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

325
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe I got an email.</v>

326
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>And then before you know it,</v>

327
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>you're like three in and fucking toasted beyond belief.</v>

328
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I know I've said this a hundred times in the podcast before,</v>

329
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 1>but I just have to say it in the interest of that.</v>

330
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Somebody might not know this.</v>

331
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>If you eat it,</v>

332
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different with different high because your brain or your body</v>

333
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite.</v>

334
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>It's by,</v>

335
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.411
<v Speaker 1>by eating it,</v>

336
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>it gets processed by your liver and it's like four to five times more</v>

337
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive than THC.</v>

338
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's the real issue with it.</v>

339
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And saying,</v>

340
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

341
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>no one educates anybody about this.</v>

342
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.673
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

343
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>you just think it's,</v>

344
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.591
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

345
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>this is strong.</v>

346
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not just strong.</v>

347
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Something you've never experienced before that if you do too much you'll freak</v>

348
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:51.571
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

349
00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychedelic.</v>

351
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

352
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

353
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:53.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

354
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:54.171
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

355
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>If you have enough of it for sure.</v>

356
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely have one of those freak outs where you're like,</v>

357
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.423
<v Speaker 1>I want it to end.</v>

358
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.303
<v Speaker 1>I want it to end.</v>

359
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is you cannot make it in.</v>

360
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You got to ride it all the way.</v>

361
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.740

365
