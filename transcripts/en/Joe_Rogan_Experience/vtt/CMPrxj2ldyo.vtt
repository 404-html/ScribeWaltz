00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.110
Experience

2
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.030
pumped up with caffeine straight off the plane and in traffic.

3
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.470
Cameron Hanes,

4
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.080
<v 1>slaves and gentlemen.
Good to see you buddy.
Sup Man.</v>

5
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.910
You fucking literally pushed through all night.
Yeah.
Yeah.

6
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.530
It was a,
it was a grind and then the La traffic hall,

7
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.640
dude,
there's something about la traffic that's so frustrating.

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.920
More frustrating than even no sleep.

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.370
<v 2>Oh yeah,
I know.
Sleep is fine.
That's gravy.
I do that all the time.</v>

10
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:48.720
But even today,
trying to get,
I want to get here if want to get here on time.

11
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.900
I hate being late anywhere.
I'm a pretty punctual person.

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.750
And this a traffic,
you know,

13
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:58.020
I was honking to the guy ahead of me just to go 50 feet further cause he's

14
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:59.240
letting that get,
he's texting me,

15
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.770
he's letting that gap get too big and I'm like okay,

16
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:04.440
I'm not gonna go anywhere but I'm going to be 50 feet ahead of where we're at.

17
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.910
<v 1>Yeah,
there's something going on here.
There's too many God damn people.
It's on.</v>

18
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.620
I don't know what the fuck else is going to be like in 10 years.

19
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.520
I came here in [inaudible] 94 so I've been here for 20 years now and when I

20
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.910
first came here it was nothing like this.
Nothing like this.
Traffic sucked,

21
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.280
but it didn't suck like to the point where you're like,
this is just,

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.030
this doesn't make sense.
This is just unmanageable.

23
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:30.080
There's too many God damn people.
Yeah,
it's tough.
And you live in Oregon,

24
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:31.850
which is like way more relaxed.

25
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.180
He spent all his time in the woods shooting arrows at elk.

26
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.790
The way quieter,
way less people.
The good life.
Good luck.

27
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.670
And now we're forcing you to get on that fucking goofy 101 and get jammed up in

28
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:47.900
the boxes of metal and fucking breed that carbon dioxide.

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.900
It's worth it.
It's worth it to be here.
Of course it is.

30
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.900
Of course it is my friend.
Good to see you again buddy.
Great seeing you.

31
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.820
So what are you doing?
You hanging out with Luke Bryan?

32
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.070
Listen to country music song.

33
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.210
This is mother fucker got me hooked on some country music pop songs.

34
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.050
I know.
I told him,
yes,

35
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.810
<v 2>we're up blurb bear hunting and watching music videos,
country music.</v>

36
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.890
<v 1>What are we watching?
Well,
our friends,</v>

37
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.600
John and Jen,
she give them a plug.
I live in the dream.
What is their,
uh,

38
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:23.010
their website?
Is it live in the dream?
Probably live in the dream.com.
Hold on.

39
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.630
I don't actually have to remember anything anymore.
It Google everything.
I know,

40
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.360
right?
Isn't that amazing?
Live in the dream with John and Jen.
Right?

41
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.280
Something like that.
Yeah,
we'll find it.
Um,

42
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.200
but anyway,
yeah.
Living the dream at John and John live in the dream productions.

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.550
That's what it is.
Living the dream productions.com.

44
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.800
And uh,
those are our friends in uh,
in Canada,
in Canada,
up in Alberta.

45
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.490
And that's where we went bear hunting.
And these motherfuckers,

46
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.880
all they listen to is country music.
All they watch is country music,
television.

47
00:02:56.881 --> 00:03:00.130
That's all you need.
So

48
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 3>every day there was me mocking it.
It's just some of it is really good.</v>

49
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.760
I like a lot of country music.
I really do.

50
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.520
Like we had Sturgill Simpson on this week.
I fucking love that guy.

51
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.400
I don't know if you've ever heard Sturgill Simpson.
Now I saw your plugged down.

52
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.460
I was thinking I'm going to check him out.
Oh,
he's good man.

53
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.290
He's real old school like Merle haggard style country music.

54
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.860
He's legit.
Please.
I'm later.
But um,

55
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.820
you guys just won't let it go.
Like there was no,
there was no breakups.

56
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.590
It was just every day there's no,

57
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.130
it didn't like every now and then let's watch yo MTV raps or whatever the fuck

58
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.090
it was.
Just country music,
television over and over again,

59
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.430
being surrounded by deer heads.

60
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.430
You would think that you were in like Alabama somewhere,
but no,

61
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:46.450
we're two hours north of Edmonton.
Yeah.
In what happened?

62
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.960
What's the moral to the story?
Uh,
I don't know.
Oh,
they got me,

63
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.860
they got me singing that fucking Luke Bryan Song,
man,
play it again.
It's shit.
I,

64
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.890
I was,
I was somewhere,

65
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:00.550
I forget where it was and it started coming on and I knew the fucking words and

66
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:04.810
I started humming along and I'm like,
fucking Cam Haynes.
He got me.
Yeah.

67
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.490
They're listening to Luke Bryan skinny,
not your bear.
Yeah.
And that's just,

68
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.930
I don't know,
it just,
it works.
And you,
it's just,
it's etched in your memory.

69
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.200
What is it about country music and outdoors people though?

70
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.230
Because it's like I always associated country music with the south,

71
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.280
but it's a big candidate think too,
like especially northern Canada.

72
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.410
I don't know.
I think it's just uh,
you know,
grassroots people,

73
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.220
hardworking people and uh,
they identify with country music.

74
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.530
Hardworking people can't like ACDC.
No,
it doesn't make any sense.

75
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.730
That's for headbanging possum ogre.
Oh my people.

76
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.900
I've got a bunch of my people in various walks of life.
My people are confused.

77
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:47.734
They don't know where to go.

78
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.390
You got a lot of appeal to a lot of a wide range now.
Bow Hunters.
Yeah,

79
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.350
I'm mixing it up.

80
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:56.560
I always say I'm the bridge between the meatheads and the potheads.

81
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.160
I'm the bridge.
I bring them all together.
I'm an island.

82
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.890
Just bow hunters campaigns island.

83
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.260
So you've had a bunch of hunts since I saw you.
You killed two elk.

84
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.340
One in Colorado,
one in Utah.
I saw the pictures.
And you did an Africa hot.

85
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.890
Yeah,
Tanzania.
But you did a real African hunt and I,

86
00:05:15.891 --> 00:05:19.930
one of those pussy ass high fence hunting in a backyard.

87
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.530
No scenarios.
You were out in the wilds of Africa?

88
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.510
Definitely the wilds of Africa.
I was with that Green Leaf Tanzania and it's uh,

89
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.460
you know,
planes don't even fly over there.
This,
this where we were hunting.

90
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.500
No rose,
no anything,
no anything.
I mean to,
to bounce around in a jeep,

91
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:40.630
it takes you eight hours to cross the,

92
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.250
I guess the piece of property we were hunting and it's very expansive.
Wild.

93
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.520
And when you,
when you bow hunt in these areas,

94
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.270
how often are people bow hunting in these areas or is it mostly rifle hunting

95
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.380
and you just come in and bow hunt,

96
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.000
right it word I where I had been there never been a bowhunter

97
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 2>there.
So bow hunting and Tanzania has only been legal I think for seven years.</v>

98
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.040
And um,
so it's new and when people go there,

99
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.780
it's expensive to get there.
It's time consuming.
Um,
the animals are very tough,

100
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.830
very tough to kill.

101
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:17.630
So nobody really wants to screw around and making it even harder with a bow.
But,

102
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:22.580
uh,
that's where I come in.
So that's that.
I was our first bow hunter there ever

103
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.780
<v 4>for a lot of people know about the controversy that's going on right now.</v>

104
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.520
There's a,
Steve Brunello wrote an excellent piece on this,
uh,

105
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:35.180
about what's going on in Africa with these a high fence operations where people

106
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:35.990
are,
it's,

107
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.190
it's a lot of it is people seeing like a pretty girl with like a dead animal and

108
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:45.020
then freaking out and going off.
And the,
the most recent one wasn't even Africa.

109
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:47.400
Did you see this kid that shot a,

110
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.690
an albino deer and he's getting death threats?
Yeah.
Just,
yeah.

111
00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:54.290
And it was a nice buck.
Yeah.
It's deer.
It's a fucking deer.

112
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:56.660
It happens to be white.
Who wouldn't shoot it?
Yeah.
They're like,

113
00:06:56.661 --> 00:07:00.230
you can't let it go.
You can't let it live.
So it can become a,

114
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:03.390
would ferry and cure cancer a unicorn,

115
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.090
invent six g cellular.
It's just a deer.
It's just a deer.
It's a deer that has a,

116
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.340
you know,
rare disorder.
One out of every 20,000 deer turned out to be albino.

117
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.320
<v 2>I guarantee those coyotes or anything else that would like to kill and eat a</v>

118
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:18.150
deer could care less what color it was.

119
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.740
<v 4>Yeah,
and or it would have frozen to death or it would have starved.</v>

120
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.770
I mean there's a lot of folks out there just have this idealistic view of what

121
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:28.611
nature is.

122
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:33.611
They have this view of nature being this place of peace and harmony and not,

123
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.690
it's a fucking brutal,

124
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.200
horrible environment where no one gets out alive.

125
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.750
All those animals die and they die.

126
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.950
They don't live past like seven or eight years if they're really,
really lucky.

127
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.813
Exactly.

128
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.500
And the idea that there's something wrong with someone stepping in there and

129
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.590
killing one of them and getting the meat off of it as opposed to going to a

130
00:07:56.661 --> 00:08:00.260
supermarket and getting some corralled up penned up animal.

131
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.800
It's lived its life in hell.
It just shows you how goofy we are.
Yeah,

132
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.610
<v 2>yeah.
No,
I know.
We're kind of,</v>

133
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.820
we're talking about Tanzania and now we're talking about me,
but I just,

134
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.140
the other day I put up a picture of me and you with your bear and just the

135
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:16.240
comments I had from Facebook and he's just like,

136
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.440
one of them that just stuck out to me was,
why would you kill a bear?

137
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:24.940
I thought bears were endangered.
They're definitely endangered in cities.

138
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.130
They're endangered if I'm around.
But,
but no,
it's,

139
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.400
there's how many bears are there others

140
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.060
<v 4>where we were.
It's unbelievable how many,</v>

141
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.650
<v 2>so that,
but that's the,
that's kind of to your point,
people are just so lost.</v>

142
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:43.660
They just don't get it.
I mean,
bear,

143
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.480
the bear numbers have never been higher than they are right now.

144
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.780
They need to be managing to be hunted and people still think they're endangered

145
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:51.430
because I guess they don't see,
I'm down here start.

146
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.040
<v 4>Well,
there's also the anthropomorphizing,
you know,
that,
that that's that uh,</v>

147
00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.170
expression where you connect human characteristics to animals like Yogi bear and

148
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:03.960
you know,
Donald Duck and shit like that.

149
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.950
Like these animals are so fucking ruthless.

150
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:11.940
The idea that people love bears is so beyond crazy.

151
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.650
While we were there,
uh,
John's son John,
right?
Yeah.

152
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.330
John Sons John to write was Johnson name.
Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Yeah.

153
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.860
Jonathan,
uh,
watched,
uh,

154
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.100
a bear kill a cub for like attack this female kill the cub,

155
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.370
ate half of it,
then took off the female,

156
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:37.320
came back and finished off her own cup.
She ate it right?
Like this is the,

157
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:40.530
these are the animals you're talking about and these are the animals were when

158
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.000
spring rolls around the,
the bears wake up and they go out looking for cubs.

159
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.830
That's what they do.
They go look in the cubs.

160
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:50.950
I had sue Aiken on the podcast yesterday from that pot,

161
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.650
uh,
life below zero show.
I don't know if you've ever seen that show.

162
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.820
She lives 200 miles north of the Arctic circle and you know,

163
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:03.450
she's talking about just the bear population in our area and how she was

164
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:07.020
attacked by a bear and like really fucked up,
bad dislocate her hips,

165
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.430
cracked her skull.

166
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.920
A young male bear attacked her and basically grizzly.
Yeah.

167
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.590
Basically wasn't,
she was like,
if it was older when an Eaton me,

168
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.070
but it just basically kicked my ass and took my territory,

169
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.700
like decided it took her territory so she went back and shot it and killed it.

170
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.650
Perfect.
Yeah.
She's bad ass bitch.
She's by herself in the middle of nowhere.

171
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:30.180
She's gangster as they come.

172
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.210
But this idea that people have in their head about bears is that the bears,

173
00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:39.250
these peaceful,
you know,
creatures of the forest.

174
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.650
There is some of the most brutal predators and cannibals that we know of in

175
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:47.730
nature and delicious.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
They're very delicious.

176
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:50.550
That's the other thing that I got from our trip.
People were like,

177
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.280
why would you eat bear?
What would you be?
Bears are gross.

178
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.190
People don't even eat bear.
That's so not true.
Yeah.

179
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.060
We had some amazing meals up there off the bear.

180
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:03.450
We killed the gin just cooked up.
I mean,

181
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.070
I remember sitting out there in that plastic table with all of us and just

182
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.640
eating this food bite after bite thinking this is some of the best meat I've

183
00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:16.590
ever had.
And it's very,
really good.
Yeah.
And people have this conception that,

184
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.510
that you can't eat bear bear meat isn't good.
It's just like amazing.
Well,

185
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:23.340
any meat if you don't prepare it right,

186
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.670
if you don't take care of it after you kill it,
no,

187
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.090
I mean you can get cow meat that rots,
you know,
if you don't take care of it,

188
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:30.990
if you don't prep it,

189
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.670
if you don't properly cool it and put it on ice or whatever you have to do.

190
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:39.360
But Jen knows how to cook it.
Yeah.
She did a great job with it.
Oh yeah,

191
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:42.900
it was good.
But um,
yeah,
like what you're talking about what those boards,

192
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:44.910
they come out and they kill the cubs.
You know,
I'll,

193
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.440
I'll a big male dominant board cares about is his genetics being passed on.

194
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:54.010
So when he sees those,
those cubs out there that aren't his,

195
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.380
<v 2>he's like,
well those aren't my jeans.</v>

196
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:59.320
So he wants to kill him so that female comes back and heat and then he can breed

197
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.340
her.
And that's the whole thing.
And then as you said,
once that cope,

198
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.530
even that that female is cub was dead.

199
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:08.830
It went from being her cub when it was dead.
Then it was just,
okay,

200
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:12.670
it's just more food.
Yeah.
That was a transition and it's just so,

201
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.760
there is no emotion involved in anything.

202
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.760
It's purely survival and purely passing on genes.
Yes,

203
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:21.310
it

204
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.170
<v 4>and the numbers are stunning.
When we were up there,
we saw so many bear,</v>

205
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:28.180
we got to see a bear UFC bout,

206
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.170
remember those to bear that we're going at it because the mail kept coming back

207
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:34.240
in and the females trying to chase him off.

208
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:39.250
Me and cam and I were on the ground and were probably like 20 yards from these

209
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:42.130
bears duking it out.
Yeah.
And they would go,

210
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:44.590
this one male bear kept sneaking back in.

211
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.880
He kept wanting to to to get to where the bait was and the females trying to

212
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:50.080
chase him off cause their cubs were there.

213
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:54.130
Her cubs ran up a tree and she chased him off and he came back and she chased

214
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:58.180
him off and he came back and then she took off and then she's like,
fuck this.

215
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:00.670
And she came back in again.
And then they start duking it out.

216
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.350
And when they're duking it out there like
primal.
Oh,

217
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:09.820
it's so wild.
Because I mean,
this wasn't in a zoo.
I mean,

218
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:12.040
they could have just said,
you know what?
Fuck this.

219
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.170
Let's go eat those people the right there.

220
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.620
And they just could have just made a mad run for us.
We would have been fucked.

221
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.890
<v 2>Oh yeah.
Well,
and you know,</v>

222
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.560
you mentioned the bait there and that's another thing people don't really

223
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:27.060
understand because baiting,
um,
gets a black eye sometimes,
um,

224
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.940
for hunting,
but up there,

225
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.410
it's really the only way to control those bare numbers.
There's so many bear,

226
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.700
they kill so many Moose.

227
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.880
That country is so thick and if you're going to hunt them,

228
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.410
you have to bring him to you somehow and be able to kill him.

229
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.070
And if you didn't bait,
you would probably never kill a bear up there.

230
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.510
<v 4>The only time you would get one is maybe you would get the fall bears that were</v>

231
00:13:50.511 --> 00:13:53.990
eating the berries right on the hills where you could see them.
But the,

232
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.980
the thickness of the forest,
I compare it to like a box of Q tips,
right?

233
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.500
It's like you're not seeing anything 30,
40 yards in,
you're not seeing shit.

234
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.020
It's just all trees.
It's so dense.

235
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:06.740
<v 2>And,</v>

236
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.420
and another key to baiting and seeing those bear up close is identifying what

237
00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:15.410
you're killing because you want to take out those dominant males that have

238
00:14:15.411 --> 00:14:18.020
already bred,
that are older,
past their prime.

239
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.100
And that's what we're trying to kill up there.
We're not taking,
um,

240
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:25.430
sounds with cubs.
We're not taking young males that are,
haven't reached,
you know,

241
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:29.300
John and Jen,
what they liked,
they liked to kill seven foot plus black bear.

242
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.560
So to do that,
you know,

243
00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:35.120
people look at bear and all bear looked the same to the uneducated I,
well,

244
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.140
once you,
when you can see him up close,
how,

245
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.870
how we were hunting them on the ground,

246
00:14:38.871 --> 00:14:42.590
you get a real good idea of what you're shooting.
What's your hunting,

247
00:14:42.591 --> 00:14:46.580
which you're going to pass up.
And that's,
that's a key too.
So it's just,

248
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.290
it's just,
um,
it's wildlife management at its best.
Really?
Yeah.

249
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:51.980
That's the best way to

250
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.221
<v 3>put it.</v>

251
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:57.221
Wildlife Management and the number of people that even hunt other animals are

252
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.240
kind of a bit ignorant to it.

253
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:04.120
Like there was folks that Jen was telling us that some local moose hunters
where,

254
00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:06.860
uh,
giving her a hard time and she was like,

255
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:11.270
do you understand that the majority of these moose calves are getting killed by

256
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:15.350
bears?
Right.
Like the majority,
like,
right.
Like when they're out of their mother,

257
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:19.850
like that bear smells that and starts looking for him.
Yeah.
It's like,
I mean,

258
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.810
and that's nature.
That's,
that's what,
what's what,
what happens out?

259
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.820
Can't blame the,
be the bear.
No,
I was just being a bear.

260
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.180
But you can control their numbers and help the Mousse.
Yeah.

261
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:32.360
I couldn't help think about grizzly man though when we were out there.
I'm like,

262
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.790
David,
I'm like,

263
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.200
how fucking I'm making fun of this Timothy Treadwell guy like on a daily basis

264
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.120
here on the ground,

265
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.690
stand next to his bow hunting maniac who only hunts on the ground.

266
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:46.970
He doesn't want to go up in Trieste dance cause that's for pussies.

267
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.630
I,
you know,
I just like being,
I don't know,

268
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:57.170
I liked that connection with the animal on the ground.
Yeah,
it's a connection.

269
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.550
I mean it,

270
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.550
it can be real and it can be very intense as you experienced,

271
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:08.600
but there's nothing like it for me.
It's very wild,
very wild.
Um,

272
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.501
it's a,

273
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:13.820
it's a totally different kind of hunting because just the sheer numbers and you

274
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:15.440
just really do see a lot of bear.

275
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:18.680
And John was saying that he thinks in his area where he hunts,

276
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.000
there is somewhere between three and eight bear per square mile,

277
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:27.380
which is a lot.
I mean that is a lot of animals.
Yeah.
Yeah.

278
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.510
Now there's a,
you know,
people are used to seeing quite a few deer,

279
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.840
quite a few elk.
Maybe if they live in the right country,
white deal,

280
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.700
dear specialty.
That's how bear are back back there.
It's just amazing.
Yeah,

281
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:44.240
it's a really wild place.
Albert is amazing.
So beautiful.

282
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:48.950
It's just so thick with wilderness and trees and it's just so much wildlife up

283
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:52.980
there.
So much cool shit to say.
Yeah.
And that's,
to me,
that's the big,

284
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.470
not not,
I mean that's one,

285
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.630
one more draw for hunting is when you're just driving through country and you're

286
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:02.330
just kind of in the cities and you're driving around maybe in a car,

287
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.050
you don't get to experience what that country is.

288
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.340
I mean to be out there to live it to,
uh,
you know,
when I go to the,

289
00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:13.040
all these places,
Tanzania,
Alberta,
Australia,

290
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.700
and I live out there and sit on the ground and see the animals and,
and,

291
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.840
and hunt them,
what one on one.

292
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:26.200
That's when you really get to experience everything that country has to offer.

293
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.150
And that's,
that's so valuable.
I mean,
people,

294
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.310
that connection has made me who I am,
whether I'm killing anything or not.

295
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.200
Just being there and just being part of part of the country.
It's,
it's a,

296
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.910
I don't know.
It's amazing.
Yeah,

297
00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:44.930
it's definitely something that we're completely disconnected to by standing in

298
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:49.931
the one on one traffic over and over and over again and just grinding out every

299
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.100
week.

300
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.360
<v 4>The sort of the same way you start this becomes life.
It becomes life.
It becomes,</v>

301
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:57.060
this is life.
Life is you get up,
you,
your alarm clock goes off,

302
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.810
you got an hour commute and you really should be about a three minute commute,

303
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:02.400
but you're going to get stuck in traffic.

304
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.620
And when you go to a place like Alberta and you're,
you're out there and just,

305
00:18:06.621 --> 00:18:08.850
just unbelievably beautiful,

306
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.880
dense forest and you're out there and you're out there doing something that

307
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:16.470
requires a tremendous amount of discipline to the,

308
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.450
one of the things that I really enjoy about,
uh,

309
00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:24.360
archery and about bow hunting is it's not as easy as like set up.

310
00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:28.560
I'm not saying that rifle hunting is easy because it's debt.
None of it is easy,

311
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.630
but it's not.
If you have a good rest for your rifle,
you know,

312
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:36.690
and the animals no more than,
you know,
a hundred yards away,

313
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.890
he is pretty good likelihood that you're going to shoot that animal a hundred

314
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.260
yards away with a bone out.
Good fucking luck.
Just started.
Yeah.
You're,
you're,

315
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.930
you know,

316
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.500
most likely you're not going to hit that thing that's really fucking far.

317
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.910
<v 2>No,
that's,
you know,</v>

318
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.710
cause I rifle hunted for three years before I started bow hunting and uh,

319
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.670
what I started rifle hunting.
I loved it.
I loved the challenge.

320
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:04.020
I still love going out on rifle Hans.
I haven't rifle hunter for 26 years,

321
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:08.900
but I just like the hunting atmosphere and environment and,

322
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960
and working together.

323
00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:14.220
But what I notice when I transitioned from rifle hunting to bow hunting is where

324
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:18.750
the rifle hunt ended.
Like,
as you said,
a hundred yards,
200 yards,

325
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:22.350
where that,
where it ended,
it was over.
If you made the shot game over,

326
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.530
that's where the bell hunt really begins.
So you,

327
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.880
you're a hundred yards or 200 yards and now you gotta be on your a game.

328
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:34.910
You're now getting from there to the red zone or bow range of an animal.

329
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.410
That's where it starts to get.
That's where it's difficult

330
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.850
<v 4>for you.
Comfortable is like 60 yards in.
Is that where it's comfortable for you?</v>

331
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:42.130
Yeah,

332
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.730
<v 2>I like him at eight yards,
but uh,
yeah,</v>

333
00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.950
I mean I practice a lot.
Um,

334
00:19:47.951 --> 00:19:50.920
I've very comfortable I can make the shot at 60 yeah,

335
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.670
<v 4>it's just a different discipline.
Archery is,</v>

336
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.790
and one of the things that I've talked about with some of my friends that have

337
00:19:57.791 --> 00:20:02.200
really gotten into archery is about how the world sort of goes away when you're

338
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:06.940
focusing on the bullseye.
It's a weird zen state and it really,

339
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.260
in that sense,
the practice for someone who has no interest in hunting,

340
00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:14.320
maybe you're a vegetarian.
I totally respect that that's what you want to do.

341
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.030
But archery in and of itself is an amazing pursuit.

342
00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:23.320
Just like for the meditative aspects of it.
There's something about archery.

343
00:20:23.321 --> 00:20:27.730
I would go,
I screwed my shoulder up,
man.
You eat too much,
shooting too much.

344
00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:31.930
I was doing a hundred 150 hours a day after the moon.
After the bear hunt,

345
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.830
I've got a little fucking crazy and I developed a little tendinitis in my

346
00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:36.530
shoulder.

347
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.800
<v 2>The on the bear hunt,
if you,
if you recall,</v>

348
00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:41.240
I don't know how many bowl hundreds we had.

349
00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.940
We had maybe six bow hunters up there,

350
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.130
but you shot at least double more than anybody else.
I mean,

351
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.280
<v 3>so you,
you like shooting the ball obviously,</v>

352
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:55.870
but then you ramped it up after that.
Yeah,
I,
I liked,

353
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:59.970
I was doing more than anybody because first of all,
you know,
there was a,

354
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.120
I felt like a real obligation to make an accurate shot and I wanted to be 100%

355
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:11.470
prepared.
And I'm,
I'm a big stickler on preparation.

356
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.030
No matter what I do,
if it's martial arts,
if it's comedy,
any,

357
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:19.160
anything I do,
I prepare the shit out of things and I,
I'm,

358
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.950
I'm an obsessive compulsive in that way.
So even like when we were all hanging,

359
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:26.470
everybody was hanging around,
joking and laughing.
I was like,

360
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.950
I could be shooting more hours,
so I would just go off and start shooting arrows.

361
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:33.550
What everybody else was goofing off.
I just had to,
it's,
you know,

362
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.540
it's been maybe if people could even misconstrued as being antisocial,

363
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:41.530
but I just had to do it and I had to get those arrows in.
Yeah.
I,
I,

364
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.320
the way I perceived it was,
that was it.

365
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.910
That was your first ever bow hunt and you just wanted to do everything you could

366
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.360
to make,
to really,

367
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.610
we're trying to kill an animal ethically and quickly.

368
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.290
And so I know you took and take a lot of responsibility and that,

369
00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:02.500
and our role as a steward of the land and the animals.

370
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.120
And so got to make that shot.
You know,
it happens so fast.
Even,

371
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.910
even if you're hunting,
bear in a controlled environment,

372
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.950
it's with a bow at is still tough.
It's still tough.
So,

373
00:22:14.951 --> 00:22:17.740
I mean,
I,
uh,
slit you for your commitment.

374
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.220
They're practicing and you made a great shot on your bare.
Yeah,
it was perfect.

375
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.990
Yeah.
It died in seconds and that's what I wanted.
I wanted it to just be,
oh,

376
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.160
and also it's beautiful having a friend like you who could talk me through all

377
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:30.994
that stuff,

378
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.380
who can talk me through the right way to prepare and all the right equipment.

379
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.750
Having the right bow,
you know,
you get people give you a hard time because you,

380
00:22:39.751 --> 00:22:42.520
you shoot really powerful bows and they're like,
you don't need to shoot a Bogo.

381
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.230
Powerful you down.
I'm just retarded.
Why would I shoot that?
That's stupid.

382
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.980
Well,
the idea being that the more powerful the bow,
the,

383
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:57.010
the more impact the Arrow has and the more it can penetrate into an animal.

384
00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:02.170
It just makes sense.
But not everybody has cam Haynes guns.
That's what's up,

385
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.800
you know,
uh,
you know,
that is a real pet.

386
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.040
I feel bad sometimes because sometimes,
you know,

387
00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:11.950
I'll talk about my bow and then out of the blue somebody says,

388
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.870
why do you need to shoot 80 or 90 pounds?
And I've heard it for years,

389
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.600
probably thousands of times.

390
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:23.020
And I just feel like lashing out at that one person who maybe that was the first

391
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:25.570
time they've ever even been on my Facebook page or whatever,

392
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.180
that that's what's happened the other day.
And I didn't,

393
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.190
I didn't lash out because I don't,
you know,
I try to respect everybody.
I don't,

394
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.220
whatever,
I don't,
I've just tried to be respectful.

395
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.670
And so all I said to that guy was,
uh,
you know,

396
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.560
he says he's killed all these animals that got pastors with 62 pounds.
Okay.

397
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.040
I said,
all right,

398
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.460
<v 2>well what,
what about the guys who shoot 50 pounds?
They'd probably say to you,</v>

399
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:54.200
why do you shoot 62 pounds?
I shoot 50 and kill my animals.
So they would say,

400
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:58.580
you're doing too much.
And my whole thing is I pro,

401
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:03.160
I hope for the best,
prepare for the worst.
And so,
um,

402
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.690
the worst is on a big bull elk.

403
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:10.460
You catch your shoulder blade or you drill a big heavy rib or from Hunting Cape

404
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.220
Buffalo,
um,
I hit a rib,
which is like a two by four.

405
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.850
So I'm preparing for the worst,
I hope for the best.
You know,

406
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:20.210
if you think in almost any bow with a razor sharp broadhead,

407
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.870
if is just hitting soft flesh between the ribs is going to kill it.

408
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.100
You could probably do that with 40 pounds,
maybe even 30 some pounds,

409
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.600
but you're hoping for the,
the very best situation.

410
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.220
It's not going to happen every time.
It's probably going to be rare.

411
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.890
So that's my whole thing.
Prepare for the worst hope for the [inaudible].

412
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:40.131
<v 4>Well,</v>

413
00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:42.530
it's interesting is that you've got a whole group of people that are sort of

414
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:46.820
following philosophy now.
Like this whole,
you know,
your,
your,
your uh,

415
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.050
your catchphrase.
Keep hammering.
Yeah.

416
00:24:49.051 --> 00:24:53.710
I see all this Hashtag keep hammering people in the gym preparing for bow hunts.

417
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.970
Yeah.
It's like people prepare for bow hunts now.

418
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:57.680
Like they're preparing for an athletic event.

419
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.670
I see these dudes doing all of these rows and lifts and Chin ups and pulling

420
00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:05.900
their back muscles and getting everything in order and then running up hills and

421
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:10.130
all following your lead and treating this as like an athletic endeavor.

422
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.180
If you've ever seen it.
Actually did we,
we didn't play your,

423
00:25:13.181 --> 00:25:17.600
your under armor commercial the first time.
Do we,
did we play it the wolf?

424
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.560
Did we play that commercial?
We say if we did,
we probably did.

425
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.890
I love that fucking commercial.
But that commercials the perfect,

426
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.170
it's like it shows you preparing,
you know,

427
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.190
running up hills and that's also part of this,

428
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:36.310
this bow hunting thing is that you're preparing for an event as much of an event

429
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:41.480
as a marathon,
as much of an event.
And maybe even more so because it's this,

430
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.830
you know,
people don't like the,

431
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.030
the term spiritual when it's connected to hunting,

432
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.480
but there is something that's very spiritual about taking an animal,

433
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.350
respecting it's alive,
taking out that meat and then eating it.

434
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.360
And this feeling that you have of being connected to this cycle of life,

435
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.290
it's a very,
very different thing than anything I've ever done before.

436
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.520
Anything I've ever done where,
um,

437
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.480
especially anything that you've ever done where you've eaten meat and meat,

438
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.850
do you ever eaten meat from a store or meat from a restaurant?

439
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.060
There's a complete wall up between you and the process and the bow hunting part

440
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.220
is like one more step closer.

441
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.810
It's like there's the rifle thing but then the bow hunting thing is one more

442
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:32.900
step.
Yeah,
this is,
this is in the under Armour one though.

443
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.730
<v 2>Brandon shocky did this on this is but this,
that's,</v>

444
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.800
that's the training part definitely.

445
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.130
<v 4>Yeah.
There,
there is a different one.</v>

446
00:26:41.131 --> 00:26:44.340
There's an under armor commercial but that one's cool to too,
but you could,

447
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.370
you could see the amount of preparation that's involved in in this and so you

448
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:52.920
know this is a lot of people out there that are like really into crossfit and

449
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:57.570
they're really into like working out and you are and I am and like I had this

450
00:26:57.571 --> 00:27:00.600
dude who was on fear of fact and wants him and his girlfriend.
Nice folks.

451
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.200
They were crossfit people and I was like well what do you do?

452
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.670
Like with all that exercise you just exercise and for exercise,

453
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.000
you know like it's good to be in shape and everything like that.

454
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.950
Why don't you take up Jujitsu or something like that?
Go put it to use,

455
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:17.060
like see progress in an athletic endeavor.
Yeah.

456
00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.400
Well one of the best and ultimate ways is hunting because you,

457
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.400
you're putting that progress,

458
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.140
you're putting that athleticism and that training and that all that hard work.

459
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:33.350
You're putting it into this really primal situation where you're going uphill

460
00:27:33.561 --> 00:27:36.760
hill.
Especially like the elk hunting,
which I can't wait to get up,

461
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.330
get a part of next year.
Yeah.
We're going to go bow hunting for elk next year.

462
00:27:41.331 --> 00:27:45.060
Yeah.
That seems to me like probably the ultimate of though.

463
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.330
<v 2>Yeah.
The,
I think the thing with elk,
for me that's a,</v>

464
00:27:50.331 --> 00:27:51.020
that's been,

465
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.750
we've probably mentioned that before because if anybody who's going to talk to

466
00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:57.290
me about bow hunting is Alex going to come up.
Um,

467
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:02.120
that was always that the biggest dream was killing a big bull elk with my boat.

468
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.350
And it's so hard.
It is so difficult.
And,
uh,
it,
you know,

469
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.110
I killed a bull elk my very first year of bow hunting.

470
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.670
I think I was 19 and,
um,
I killed a spike bull.

471
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.990
Took a long time to do it.
Um,
but when I said,
okay,

472
00:28:17.991 --> 00:28:20.630
I want to kill now a mature big bowl,

473
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.510
six by six in the wilderness by myself,

474
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.400
that took eight years to do eight years of bow hunting to ever I killed other

475
00:28:28.401 --> 00:28:32.910
bowls.
I killed some five points,
a few,
five points,
another spike,
um,

476
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.250
a six by five.
But it took me eight years to get that quote,

477
00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:41.390
Dream Bull and to anybody at to,
to I guess a seasoned,

478
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.980
I dunno,
a trophy hunter.
It,
they probably wouldn't even a shot it,

479
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.600
but it was a nice six by six,
scored about 275 inches,
pope and young.

480
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.760
And uh,
it was a wilderness on my own and that took eight years.
So it's,

481
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.940
it's a tough deal

482
00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.810
<v 4>when you have a wilderness hunt on your own and you shoot this animal,</v>

483
00:28:58.811 --> 00:29:00.730
you're miles away from civilization.
Yeah.

484
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.390
You just hike it back in steps one at a time.
Well,

485
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.230
<v 2>with that bowl,</v>

486
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.010
at that time I owned with my buddy Roy,
um,

487
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:10.990
for llamas.

488
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.370
And so we would train these llamas and Aloma isn't like a horse.
Um,

489
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.210
but they can pack 60 pounds.
So four of them,

490
00:29:19.211 --> 00:29:23.290
you got 240 pounds of meat you can haul out or gear or whatever else.

491
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.680
So on that hunt,
I had four lamas available.

492
00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:30.820
The problem was I killed that bull opening day of the season.

493
00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:34.780
We had just walked in with those lamas with me and these other guys.

494
00:29:34.781 --> 00:29:38.170
I was by myself about 10 miles away cause I liked,
I didn't,

495
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.640
I like to be by myself.

496
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:44.670
I mean right now I just kind of tolerate the camera man and you know,

497
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.280
if I'm with somebody,
but really what,

498
00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:53.281
I'm drawn to his solo hunting on my own just because just the,

499
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.310
I just liked the test of that.
So anyway,
I was by myself.

500
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:01.990
I killed his bull is opening day,
I skinned it out,
got it hung up.

501
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:07.050
And in that high country I killed it as probably about over 7,000 feet.

502
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.040
So even though it was September and it was warm in the evenings at 7,000 feet or

503
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:15.550
at night it gets cool.
The air is dry.

504
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.780
So if you hang that meet up like in a north facing timber where the sun stays

505
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:23.890
off of it and it stays cooler in there and he'd get up off the ground where the

506
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:26.560
wind can move,
uh,
you can get what,

507
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.710
what hunters called the meat would glaze over.

508
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.600
So it basically cools glazes over.
And I've had even in,

509
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.300
in,
um,
early season like that I could,

510
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.230
you could hang a deer and elk for five days and the meat would be fine.

511
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.550
And so what I did with that is I broke that all down and I'm like,
well,

512
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:46.740
I'll go see how the lawn mowers are doing.

513
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.200
I packed all the way back long was because we just came in the day before.

514
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.650
We're too tired there.
They're only about 300 pounds.

515
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.900
So it's not like they got a ton of muscle.

516
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.430
They'd walked 12 miles in with gear and I knew they couldn't get that bull out.

517
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:05.431
So I waited for these other guys who were hunting 10 miles away from me that

518
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.930
night to come back to camp.
And I'm like,
guys,
I said,
I killed a bull.
If,
uh,

519
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:14.830
if you guys help me get it out,
you know,
we'll go down to la grand.

520
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:18.730
I'll get us a hotel room,
I'll buy us pizza,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
do this whole thing.

521
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.740
I was like,
it would do anything.

522
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:25.330
And so me and three other guys packed that whole bowl out,
12 miles,

523
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.520
took it to the meat locker there and then packed back in and 12 miles with how

524
00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:34.240
many,
how big was the bull?
Is that,
is that first six by six bullet killed?

525
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:37.690
So we probably had,
I don't know,

526
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:42.790
there's probably 240 pounds of me.
250 pounds a meter,
you know,
split up.

527
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:46.030
So I mean,
that's it.
Yeah,
that's an enormous animals.

528
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:48.850
So we were talking about like 1200 pounds on the hook for something like that.

529
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.030
No,
that one was probably 800 800.

530
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:53.880
And what's the like the biggest one you've ever seen?

531
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.230
The biggest bull I've ever killed was in 2010 it was a Roosevelt Bolen,
Oregon.

532
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.050
I was with my buddy,
uh,
Jodi Cyr.

533
00:32:02.051 --> 00:32:06.280
He called that or I think he would know he was filming and then Kevin Acres was

534
00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:10.300
calling just,
we all grew up bow hunting there in Oregon,
just,
you know,

535
00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:14.590
kind of bow hunting,
rednecks from I guess the Bush of Oregon.

536
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.270
And so we got this bull in and I ended up killing it.
And uh,
it was,

537
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.480
you know,
we're thinking 1100 pounds.

538
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.140
It was just a giant six by six,
uh,

539
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.350
old 12 or 13 year old bowl.
And uh,

540
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.110
that's a biggest body bullet ever seen.

541
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:37.420
Elk is interesting too because the old animals still tastes delicious.
Yeah.
Yeah.

542
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.010
And I'm not sure.
Yeah,
because

543
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.520
<v 3>like deer,
you can get like a ruddy old buck that's like a eight,</v>

544
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:45.440
nine year old buck and it's like,
Whoa,

545
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.940
you might need to throw this one in the steam cooker crock pot or something.

546
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:51.890
You know,
that was like those,
you know,

547
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:56.030
that water buffalo or a couple of my killed in Australia,
they were,

548
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.680
they can get old.
The Cape Buffalo I killed in Tanzania.
Dude,

549
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.600
that meat,
I mean,
in Tanzania with that Cape Buffalo,
we use that for Lion Bait.

550
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:11.150
I mean it's just not good meat cause those bulls are so old and so tough and

551
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:14.510
it's just,
you know,
if he had needed,
I guess you could,

552
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:16.880
I'm sure the natives there would definitely eat it.
Yeah.

553
00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:20.360
We just make carpaccio out of it.
And that she would like Turkey I guess.

554
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.640
I don't know,
be like a Cape Buffalo steak.
Good luck.
Right?
Yeah.

555
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.130
Dan's ass animal.
No,
but you know,

556
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.880
so I killed a kudu that was excellent meat.
A sable,

557
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:36.410
they're beautiful meat who's,
who's supposed to be one of the best.
Right?
Yeah.

558
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:39.800
I mean,
and sable to yeah.
Just uh,
yeah,

559
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:41.810
there's a lot of those animals,

560
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.020
a lot of good eating animals are not just not buffalo.

561
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.000
The controversy about African animals is,
um,

562
00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.990
I mean you get what I call Facebook controversy,
which is very,
uh,

563
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.700
sort of cursory controversy.

564
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:58.400
Like it's not people that are really investigating it and trying to figure out

565
00:33:58.401 --> 00:33:59.121
what is going on here.

566
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:02.450
They just see a picture of a pretty girl from Texas with a,

567
00:34:02.451 --> 00:34:04.610
with an animal on the ground and they go,
oh,

568
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:08.150
that pitch and Rinella wrote this article,

569
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:11.030
which is really interesting where he was saying that a lot of what you're

570
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:13.460
dealing with is just trade up sexism.
Yeah.

571
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.300
You're dealing with people that don't want to see a pretty girl in that

572
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:21.740
environment and for whatever reason they need to decide it's not her place or

573
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:23.300
especially because she's pretty,

574
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:26.630
they have some certain amount of resentment about her anyway because she carries

575
00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:29.240
around a certain amount of privilege and you know,

576
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:33.890
easy access to life because she's so pretty doors just open up for which is
true,

577
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:37.610
right?
Yeah.
But what people,

578
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:43.090
what they fail to do is really sort of investigate what's going on in Africa in

579
00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:45.890
that these people that live in these communities,

580
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.650
if it wasn't for these high fence hunting operations,

581
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.130
their resources would be severely diminished.
Yeah.

582
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:56.300
They're making so much more money because the money that comes in from tags from

583
00:34:56.301 --> 00:34:57.134
hunters,

584
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.440
and there's an industry there now and it's kind of a fucked up thing to say to a

585
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:03.740
lot of people like,
hey,
there's an industry in killing animals.
Yeah.

586
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.010
But that industry has served two purposes.
One,

587
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:11.330
those animals are in gigantic healthy populations now where they're on the verge

588
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:15.740
of extinction just a couple decades ago.
Right?
Yeah.
And it's uh,

589
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.610
yeah,
hunting there.
I mean,
especially,
you know,
the high fence thing,
that's,

590
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.080
that's a whole nother thing.
That's basically,
I guess you could,

591
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.540
it's close to farming.
It is really close to as farming animals.
Um,

592
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.550
but it is industry there.

593
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:34.450
It is a way for locals to make money and be involved and,

594
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.800
and generate income for their family.
So I mean,
how do you,

595
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.080
<v 2>who am I to judge that?
I can't,
um,</v>

596
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:45.890
in Tanzania there's even less so that most,

597
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:50.030
the high fence hunting is in South Africa and Tanzania and the,

598
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.480
in the Bush way back there,
there is even less opportunity for those people.

599
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.370
There's no food or not.
I mean,
there's limited food,
but no power,

600
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:04.110
no water,
grass shacks or huts.
It's,

601
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:08.720
uh,
you know,
I,
I,
it's real poverty.
It's,

602
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.340
yeah.

603
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.960
<v 1>Poverty on an intense scale that I think us as Americans,
we,
you know,</v>

604
00:36:13.961 --> 00:36:15.100
you dip your toes in,

605
00:36:15.101 --> 00:36:18.990
you go visit for a little bit and you're still not really grasping the idea of

606
00:36:18.991 --> 00:36:22.450
being born there now with no opportunity to get out.

607
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.080
<v 2>I don't see how you ever could,
you know,
but what's weird,</v>

608
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.590
and so I was wrestling with this whole time because when I go to these places,

609
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.640
I love the culture.
I love the people.
Um,

610
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.680
even there as trying to learn Swahili with some of the,
um,

611
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.950
the trackers that we're working with me.
Uh,

612
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.490
Rashidi awesome guy speaks only Swahili,
but I,

613
00:36:45.491 --> 00:36:50.491
so I really invest myself into the culture and I just want to learn.

614
00:36:50.651 --> 00:36:55.570
I want to sorta get,
I want to see things through their eyes.
Well,

615
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.960
I saw these grass shacks and all these people in the,
you know,

616
00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:03.220
every grass shack had six little kids running around it.
And it was just like,

617
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.070
I'm thinking this is awful.
I mean,

618
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:11.080
it's no hope for six kids at every grass shack that seems,
I don't know,

619
00:37:11.081 --> 00:37:12.700
it just seemed very sad to me.

620
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:17.920
But we were there getting ready to cross this river in the truck and the river

621
00:37:17.921 --> 00:37:22.920
was high,
so we were kind of out,
uh,
Ryan Shalom is the,
he's,

622
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.350
uh,
he owns Greenleaf,
Tanzania.
And so we're,

623
00:37:26.351 --> 00:37:28.900
we're there and we're kind of seeing what's going on.

624
00:37:28.901 --> 00:37:33.520
And there was a village about a quarter mile away.
And,
uh,

625
00:37:33.521 --> 00:37:36.100
as we're looking at the river and trying to make a game plan,

626
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.990
there was music and just people singing.
And I'm like,

627
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.190
is it happy hour here?
What is going on?
And it just,

628
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.670
that really just hit home.
It's like,
you know,

629
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.980
I see him and I think there's no hope and they must be miserable.

630
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.780
But they're laughing and singing and dancing.
Maybe.

631
00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:00.970
Maybe they're okay.
I don't know.
I mean,
are they happy?
They seemed happy to me,

632
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:05.920
so I don't really cause,
so it's weird.
It's,
you know,
I don't know.

633
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.280
I can,
I can look at it from outside and judge and say,
Oh,
you know,

634
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.380
you must be so depressed.
Maybe they're not.

635
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.740
<v 1>Yeah.
Well I think people are incredibly adaptable.
And um,</v>

636
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.330
when people grow up in an environment that's just what they're used to,
you get,

637
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.050
you get used to it and that's how you live.
And if that's all you know,
you know,

638
00:38:28.051 --> 00:38:28.281
you know,

639
00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:31.220
you don't know what it's like to stay at the four seasons and eat at the buffet

640
00:38:31.221 --> 00:38:35.150
in the morning and you know,
have the valet pull your car around all the shit,

641
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.010
you know,
some

642
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.540
<v 4>people think is the good life,</v>

643
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.740
but those people that are living like that at the four seasons,
you know,

644
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:44.380
checking their Rolex,
where is this Goddamn Valet?

645
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.230
I know those people might be on fucking antidepressants.

646
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.680
People in Africa is singing and playing the Bongo drums and having a great old

647
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:51.570
time.
You know,

648
00:38:51.571 --> 00:38:54.510
what would cause the people at the four seasons the most heartache?
What?

649
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.110
The fricking Wifi wasn't working.
Yes.
So God damn,
why Fi's pulse shit.

650
00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:04.120
You know,
I tried to get a kudu stake this morning.
You don't even have Kudu.

651
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.490
Yeah.
W W we,
we think that this is the only way to,
let me look.

652
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:12.970
Life is about friendship experience,

653
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.160
having fun and staying healthy and whatever those people can do to make that

654
00:39:18.161 --> 00:39:23.161
happen and what whatever is in their environment that they can take advantage of

655
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:26.790
as far as like,
you know,
nutrition and you know,

656
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.010
being able to take care of their family,
you know,

657
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:32.200
they do what they can with what they've got.

658
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.530
And that's also something where the hunters help out.

659
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.150
And this is off often been criticized as just like all people,

660
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.750
just using that as an excuse and that a lot of the meat goes to these families

661
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:45.910
and these villages and it is a huge,

662
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:50.410
huge benefit to them to get fresh protein like,
um,

663
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.850
like Brian Stevens that we were talking to when we were on that hunt was talking

664
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:58.670
to me about an elephant killed.
They had,
yeah,
they killed an elephant and you,

665
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.720
and you talk about killing an elephant and everybody goes,
oh my God,

666
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.030
you killed an elephant.
How the fuck could you kill an elephant?

667
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.250
I don't have any desire to kill an elephant,

668
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.600
but I wanted to listen to his perspective and see what he had to say about it.

669
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.110
Well,
one of the things that he was saying was that when you kill an elephant,

670
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:15.520
the village,

671
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:20.550
they all pile in to get a piece of that health and so welcome like this,

672
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.560
these photos of these people with these just great baskets filled with elephant

673
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:30.730
meet and there's dozens and dozens of people taking this meat away and this is

674
00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:34.930
protein that they wouldn't ordinarily not have been able to get.
Then you've,

675
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:38.840
you're dealing with the money that this guy had to pay to harvest itself and

676
00:40:38.841 --> 00:40:43.100
which is a substantial amount of money.
I think it's like 30 or $50,000 can be.

677
00:40:43.101 --> 00:40:43.510
Yeah.

678
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.690
And then you're dealing with the reality that in these certain circumstances,

679
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:49.420
in some of these places they have a population problem.

680
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.180
People don't want to think that they think that elephants are endangered.

681
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.910
They are in some places.
Yeah.

682
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:59.590
But Africa is fucking huge.
It is a huge,
huge,

683
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:00.580
huge continent.

684
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:05.440
So if they have an issue in one area where they don't have very many elephants,

685
00:41:05.441 --> 00:41:10.220
it doesn't mean the entire place is,
you know,
has a,
a lack of animals.
No,

686
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.400
no.
And you know,
one thing I was,
I was fascinated with,
you know,
we,

687
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.740
we had to deal with poachers when I was back there in Tanzania and,

688
00:41:18.741 --> 00:41:22.220
and most of the poachers we dealt with were simply what they,

689
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.890
they call us after protein all there,
they're up there,
they're killing buffalo,

690
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:29.140
they're killing.
So I say we wouldn't want you to buffalo.

691
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:34.010
They will gladly take a buffalo but a,
so they go up there and we ran across

692
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.330
<v 2>three poachers at one time.
Usually there's a shooter and two packers.</v>

693
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:43.250
And what they do is they kill an animal.
They live up there.
They,
they cut it up,

694
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:45.620
they dry it out,
and then all their packing out,

695
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.720
all this meat with is a burlap sack with like wire straps.

696
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.220
So wire through the burlap.
And then they load that up with this dried out meat,

697
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.470
which I don't know even know what it would weigh at that time.

698
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.980
But that's how they get it out and they're not selling that.

699
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.810
They might sell the protein when they get out,
but it's just meat.

700
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.770
It's not like this high level poaching operation.
Right.

701
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.060
So ivory or something and they're willing to get that meat.

702
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.240
They're willing to shoot you and the game scout who were we were with is willing

703
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:25.220
to shoot them.
A lot of times it's whoever can shoot first and that's,
that's,

704
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.960
that was a eye opening experience.
I mean,
you know,

705
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:32.870
we have somebody,
you just don't do that here.
It's just,

706
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.170
it's just different to there.
It's just like whoever can shoot first.

707
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.390
And that one that the first guy that we saw didn't shoot at us because he didn't

708
00:42:41.391 --> 00:42:42.560
have any ammo.

709
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:47.420
He had to basically load his gun like a muzzleloader as a rifle.
But he had,

710
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.750
I found their camp and we investigated everything they had in their camp.

711
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.440
And so we had like ball bearings and pieces of lead and thinks he would shove

712
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:57.950
down the barrel and he had wadding and he had uh,

713
00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:02.180
a firing pin mache heads to ignite it gunpowder.

714
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.900
And so basically he would get one shot and to get that one shot,

715
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:08.300
he had to be close.
So that's why he didn't shoot at us.

716
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:09.830
We were at about a hundred and some yards.

717
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:12.890
He ended up circling around getting to 50 yards and he's just standing there,

718
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:17.120
but he only knew he only had one shot.
So anyway,

719
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.980
the whole point is they're willing to risk their lives to get protein.

720
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:27.290
Now we did find a dead,
there was an elephant skull there.

721
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:31.580
And so just had me,
you know,
curious as to how that works.
I said,

722
00:43:31.581 --> 00:43:35.750
so obviously somebody came in here and poach this elephant.
What,

723
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.140
how much are they getting for that ivory?
You know,
and,

724
00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:43.880
and so we figured maybe a 20 or 30 year old elephant is,

725
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.420
they say would 50 pounds of ivory.
Just roughly.
It could have more,

726
00:43:47.421 --> 00:43:50.060
could have less,
um,
50 pounds of ivory.

727
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:53.240
So for 50 pounds of ivory a poacher,

728
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:56.510
we'll get $250 wow.

729
00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.490
$250 I was thinking maybe they're going to get thousands of dollars,

730
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.920
$250 whereas,
you know,

731
00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:08.600
you mentioned Brian Stevens and the elephant hunt that Americans would go on or,

732
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.640
or you know,
a,

733
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:14.660
a hunter that would pay for it and they're paying upward maybe $50,000 so you're

734
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:16.550
trading the life of an animal.

735
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:21.380
If it's poached for 250 or if a hunter goes over there to hunt it and the meat

736
00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:26.150
is utilized by the whole village,
$50,000.
Now what helps a community more?

737
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.390
Yeah,
well it certainly helps the community more if a hundred pays.

738
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.070
But the real question that have is why does

739
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:32.970
<v 3>a hundred want to do that?</v>

740
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.130
Why would someone want to go over and shoot an elephant?

741
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:38.910
And I kind of see their point of view.
Like what,
what is it about an,

742
00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.930
why would you want to go over there and shoot this big magnificent animal?

743
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:47.310
Why couldn't you just go over there and enjoy looking at it?
Right.
Um,

744
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.270
good question.
You know,
I guess,
uh,
for me,
I can't

745
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.970
<v 2>relate to an elephant and I've never,</v>

746
00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.980
I've never really thought about killing an elephant or even pursued the

747
00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.230
opportunity,
but I want to kill a lion.

748
00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.910
I went over there to kill an African lion with my bow and,
uh,
people,

749
00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.030
same question,
why?
And to me,

750
00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:15.110
to me,
the reason why I do what I do every day is a test.

751
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:19.010
And I feel like if I'm going after that

752
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:23.290
<v 3>King of the jungle,
so to speak,
or Simba with my bow,</v>

753
00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.030
that's the ultimate test.
And I mean,
if you're not testing yourself or for me,

754
00:45:28.031 --> 00:45:33.010
if I'm not testing myself,
what's the point?
But then,
okay,
so here's the argument.

755
00:45:33.011 --> 00:45:34.540
People would be like,
you fucking asshole.

756
00:45:34.541 --> 00:45:36.880
Why do you want to go over there and shoot a lion?
Lions,

757
00:45:36.881 --> 00:45:39.940
a beautiful majestic animal.
It's the king of the jungle.

758
00:45:39.941 --> 00:45:42.010
Why would you want to shoot it?
You're not even going to eat it,

759
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.560
but you are going to eat it.
Yeah.
No.

760
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.340
And you should see it's such a,
I don't know,

761
00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.790
there there's a connection with the,
the natives of the Tanzania is over there,

762
00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:52.950
right.
Are

763
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:57.420
<v 2>we were in,
if any cat has killed.
And when I was there,
um,</v>

764
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.480
one of the guys I was with Richard Bucca,
he killed a leopard and when,
uh,

765
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.590
any cat is killed or an elephant,

766
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.520
the whole village or all the guys that were there working,

767
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.980
you basically stop in the jeep up on the hill.

768
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:16.190
They get the jeep all put brush all over it and they have this chant and they,

769
00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.750
they sing this chant as you drive down,

770
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:23.580
they shoot the gun twice to announce to the hunting camp that were coming in.

771
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.820
And we got a special animal.
And uh,
you know,

772
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:29.250
Ryan explained this whole thing to me.
Um,

773
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.360
but we've got a special animal and so it's either a cat or an elephant and they

774
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:36.180
come in and it's just,
it's the biggest celebration.

775
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:41.160
When Richard killed that leopard,
they all,
all the guys there,
the,

776
00:46:41.161 --> 00:46:45.360
the Tanzania there were singing this chant and it was just,

777
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.730
it was so powerful.
And they had him,

778
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.780
he sat in this chair and they lifted it up in this chair and we're carrying them

779
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:55.200
around the camp.
That was for,

780
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.690
to honor the life of the,

781
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.860
the leopard and four in lions,

782
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:06.330
or even one step above for them.
Simba is,

783
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:12.110
they have so much reverence and respect for a lion.

784
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:15.570
It's,
uh,
you know,
I,
I couldn't even really understand it.

785
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:20.520
Only they could probably explain it,
but it says no,
that when that animal dies,

786
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.970
it's not just,
you're just killing an animal is to kill an animal.
There's,

787
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.870
there's a lot,
there's a lot of,
there's a connection that goes into,
uh,
uh,

788
00:47:27.871 --> 00:47:32.820
the animals valuable.
The animal was a just revered.
And,
um,

789
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:37.710
and um,
I assume they also have to keep the populations down.
Yeah.
That's,
uh,

790
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:42.070
you know,
lion hunting is,
I mean,

791
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.660
a lot of people look at Lyons and judge the Hunting Forum saying what?

792
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.980
And there might be a time when there is no more lion hunting just because of the

793
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:55.450
of public outcry basically.
But as it is now,

794
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.690
Ryan were Schlom where I was hunting with Greenleaf.
Um,

795
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.160
I had the opportunity,
we could have killed.

796
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.610
We had in it bait a four year old lions,

797
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.290
male legal,
big manes by themself,

798
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.770
definitely could kill him.
He wants to,

799
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:19.000
he wants to let those four year olds age to s six or greater.

800
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.700
He only wants to kill six year old lions are greater because then they're past

801
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:26.230
their prime passer breeding pot prime.
They've done their job for the population,

802
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:29.350
so to speak.
And that's when he'll take 'em out.
And not before,

803
00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.740
even though it's legal,
but um,
just to build that pride up.

804
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:35.150
And then another thing that they'll,
um,

805
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:38.440
he does is if a male lion is with a pride,

806
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.610
so meaning there's females there and there's cubs there that if he's there with

807
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:46.120
them,
they're his cubs.
Otherwise he'd kill him just like the bare,
same,

808
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:47.080
same type of deal.

809
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:52.530
But he would never kill a male lion that had a pride or is even close to a pride

810
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.300
that,
um,

811
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:59.430
because what that would do if you kill the male,
even though it's legal,

812
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:04.840
um,
what that would do is another mail would come in.
So the mail,

813
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:08.380
you killed his dad,
another mail would come in.
Those wouldn't be his cubs.

814
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.730
So he would kill them.
So you'd have two generations alliance gone.

815
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.100
And so part of his management practice there is,
um,

816
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:22.120
only old lions,
only old loan lions,
male lions.

817
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.300
And that's it.
So you're basically catching a line at the end of his run.

818
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:29.380
That's it.
Once they're,
they're not breathing anymore,
it's,

819
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.600
they've done their job.
Basically.

820
00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:35.350
The only value they have now is for a hunter.

821
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:39.850
<v 1>The only value,
but there's still there a life.
There are life.</v>

822
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.470
They're living creature,
a majestic living creature.
And that's definitely,

823
00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.040
that's where people have the issue.
Right.

824
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.850
Do you try to look at it from their point of view ever?
Do you ever say like,

825
00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.300
like the,
the anti hunting people like anti honey,

826
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:54.190
people fall into a bunch of different categories.

827
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:56.980
There's people who don't think you should eat any meat at all.

828
00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.660
That's the super extreme.
Then there's people who can respect you,

829
00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:06.280
eating animals that were raised in an ethical way,
free range,
cows,

830
00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:09.400
free range chickens,
and the only way I would do it,
that's it.
That's some group.

831
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.410
And then there's people that say,
well,

832
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:13.900
I really respect people who go out and hunt their own meat.

833
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.660
But as you get like deeper and deeper into the,

834
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.940
you know,
the,
the categories of,

835
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:26.860
of people that have problems with hunting at the very top of that list,

836
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:28.250
which is like the most

837
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.280
<v 4>hated,
is people that hunt only for the trophy trophy.
Yeah.</v>

838
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.040
And that's what a lot of people think of when they think of elephant.

839
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.620
A lot of people think of when they think of lion,

840
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.300
and I have no desire to shoot anything.
I'm not going to eat it.
Never will.

841
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:42.411
I just,
it's not,

842
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:47.411
my goal with getting into hunting was to connect with the food that I eat to try

843
00:50:48.081 --> 00:50:52.280
to figure out,
I mean,
when I've,
when I first hunted with Rinella,
I was wondering,

844
00:50:52.281 --> 00:50:55.010
I was like,
what if I shoot this deer and say,
fucking,
I'm a vegetarian now.

845
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:58.480
I'm never doing this again.
Yeah.
It was the exact opposite,
right?
Like,
I've,

846
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.050
I've felt like an immediate,

847
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:04.160
incredible connection to is very exciting and thrilling and people don't want to

848
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:07.780
hear you say that.
They want to hear it like a very somber moment.
Yeah.

849
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:11.750
But I mean,
look,
there's Hbo Real Sports Air to the other night.

850
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.650
There's this thing where,
uh,
they did this,
uh,

851
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:19.930
this whole piece on hunting and this whole a eat what you kill movement with

852
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.840
what they called it.
And they had the clip of me shooting my first deer and I,

853
00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:28.310
you know,
I kind of forgot like how,
like I was pretty emotional when it happened.

854
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.870
Yeah.
So there's,

855
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.110
there's definitely a sense of loss when something like that happens,

856
00:51:33.111 --> 00:51:37.280
but it's not,
it's not sad,
you know?
That's,
that's an animal that I wanted to eat,

857
00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.050
you know,
but,

858
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.760
but there's a difference between that and just going after some animal just to

859
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:47.450
shoot it.
And it was just,
I needed to get this on my list and I want to have,

860
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:48.440
I have a fucking,

861
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:51.830
I have a basketball court in my house filled with dead animals and you know,

862
00:51:51.831 --> 00:51:53.270
this is my next one.
Right.

863
00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.420
<v 2>Yeah,
that's true.
You know,
and,</v>

864
00:51:55.510 --> 00:52:00.510
and I guess what I'm thinking about it when I leave and God judged when you

865
00:52:01.961 --> 00:52:06.700
killed your bear because we had a picture of a smiling with the dead bear and,

866
00:52:06.701 --> 00:52:09.610
uh,
you know,
I have a hard time,

867
00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:15.400
the people on the fence who needed to be convinced or,
or it could go either way.

868
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.690
Those are the people I can appeal to and maybe make an argument that,
you know,

869
00:52:19.691 --> 00:52:23.260
how hard I work and how much hunting means to me and how much I respect these

870
00:52:23.261 --> 00:52:26.500
animals,
those people,
the extreme people.
You're,

871
00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:29.560
I don't think you're ever going to win those guys over.
No,
I don't think so.

872
00:52:29.561 --> 00:52:33.910
He's a whatever.
That's just a lost cause.
But the,
the other ones,
that's why,

873
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.180
you know,
and I've,
I've posted this before when I,
when I had,

874
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.250
when I kill an animal,

875
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.030
I don't want a bunch of blood and hunters have said bloods part of it.
Why?

876
00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:45.070
Why are you worried about showing blood?
Well,

877
00:52:45.071 --> 00:52:49.750
because I don't want to offend the people who might be in the middle,

878
00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.030
you know what I mean?
But when you get judged,

879
00:52:52.031 --> 00:52:56.250
we got judged for smiling because with your dead bear.
Yeah.
Um,

880
00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:00.760
the reason why I'm,
yeah,
when the animals,

881
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:05.830
I guess it's not,
I don't feel sad,
but I respect when an animal dies.

882
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.020
But the smiling part is,

883
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.150
I'm proud of everything that went into how much work is involved and how much

884
00:53:13.151 --> 00:53:17.950
sacrifice.
You know,
when you killed yours,
you made and that's just,

885
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:22.090
it's a celebration.
You killed an animal.
We're going to eat it.

886
00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:25.770
All that months and months of work paid off.

887
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.370
<v 4>That should feel good.
There's nothing wrong with,
hey,</v>

888
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:33.120
we're celebrating this moment.
It's such a special cherished moment

889
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.270
with smile.
Well,
this is the weird,

890
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:40.320
the weirdness of modern civilization is that no one has a problem with you

891
00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:44.040
smiling when you're eating a cheeseburger.
If you look at it,
any burger king ad,

892
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:48.690
any Mcdonald's ad,
when someone's eating,
ah,
big smile on their face,

893
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.580
maybe you're eating a fucking animal.
It lived its life in torture,
right?

894
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.680
I mean there's very little possibility that that animal was a free range animal.

895
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:00.810
That animal most likely it was corralled up,

896
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.860
was fed and unnatural diet to fatten it up was stuffed full of antibiotics to

897
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:08.070
deal with the fact that it was fed this unnatural die because it would otherwise

898
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:11.970
get sick.
All sorts of indigestion problems,
stomach problems,

899
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.270
and that's what you're eating with a big stupid smile on your face.

900
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.570
And no one bats an eye,
right?
The,
I had a,

901
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.710
I wrote a blog post and I still haven't put up yet cause I dealt with so many

902
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:26.490
fucking idiots getting mad at me after I shot that bear.

903
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:31.710
But one of them was this guy at the airport,
um,
who had seen the picture of us.

904
00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.740
You were arrogant.
You remember that?
Oh yeah,
that was a lady

905
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.040
that was a good story.
Actually.

906
00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.430
W Cam and I were on the plane and there was a gentleman who was a flight

907
00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:44.220
attendant that was a little bit light in the loafers.
Uh,

908
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:48.510
he was perhaps a gay man.
Uh,
let's just say 100%.
He was a gay man,

909
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.010
a very nice gay man.

910
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.190
He was very friendly and he was really cool and we were having fun with the guy.

911
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.730
We were,
you know,
he was just,
it was just being a friendly guy,

912
00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:59.580
but he kept complimenting Cam's arms.

913
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.210
Cam's a very athletic and muscular man.
He works out a lot.

914
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:05.520
He's got a lot of veins in his arms and stuff.

915
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.380
And this guy kept calling them muscles and he's like,
you know,

916
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:14.220
how would he say it though?
He's like muscles.
He was so flamboyant.

917
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.300
I mean,
he was a great guy.
He was just super,
super nice guy.
Don't get me wrong.

918
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.130
So anyway,
he,
he just kept complimenting cam and what do you do?
What do you do?

919
00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:27.450
And he's like,
well,
you know,
I'm workout and stuff.
I bet you too.
I bet you do.

920
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:32.370
I mean,
it was fun.
It was fun.
Totally lighthearted.
So as we're leaving,

921
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:34.020
I said to Kim,
I go,

922
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:37.030
if that guy doesn't at least smack you on the ass on the way out,

923
00:55:37.031 --> 00:55:40.200
I'm going to be very disappointed.
That's all I said.

924
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.810
And so we're waiting for our luggage.
And this woman came up to me,
then he goes,

925
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.210
he didn't,
by the way,
didn't really sad.

926
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.260
I mean I felt like you guys had a connection.

927
00:55:51.261 --> 00:55:54.210
I kind of tensed up and I walked back cause I was getting ready,

928
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:59.400
but it was just me and cam having fun.
And it wasn't mean spirited at all.

929
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:00.030
We were talking,

930
00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:04.560
we were sitting by each other talking to each other and talking like at this

931
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:08.520
level.
It wasn't like we were yelling out back
on it.

932
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.960
I think he's gay.
They don't care.

933
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:17.210
It was US having a private conversation behind us happen to be a lesbian,

934
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:20.220
I'm assuming a lesbian and her girlfriend.
And uh,

935
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:23.980
when we're waiting for the luggage,
the woman started giving me a hard time.

936
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:28.870
Just con call me arrogant.
Here's so arrogant.
I go,
how am I arrogant?
She goes,

937
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:33.510
she goes,
that man was a nice man.
I go,
he's a very nice man,
and she goes,
you,

938
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.640
I heard what you said about him slapping your friend in the ass.
I go,

939
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.430
he was flirting with my friend.
I go,
first of all,
it's not arrogant.

940
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:44.230
My friend's a handsome man one way,
flirting.
Let's not,
I don't want this one way.

941
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:49.360
Absolutely one way we were flirting.
You were being very,

942
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:53.680
very friendly to him in a n I am not gay way,

943
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:58.630
but let's be honest,
we look like we could be a couple like broodish gay guy.

944
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.770
I mean there's a lot of those deals.
If you go to West Hollywood,

945
00:57:02.771 --> 00:57:04.300
and I presume you don't when you're in town,

946
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.640
but if you go down Santa Monica Boulevard,

947
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:11.641
there's several clubs that have a lot of men that are built very similar to us.

948
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:16.870
They also might have beards,
like we do go hunting.
They know it's about gay sex,

949
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:22.330
so you know he could have gotten,
you know,
he'd be,
he was testing the waters.

950
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.970
The guy that's,
if you're gay,
you never know.
Look,

951
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.190
you've got to think if you're gay,
what is it?

952
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:30.640
They say it's like 10% of people are gay,
but I don't even think it's that.

953
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:32.590
I think that's wishful thinking.

954
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.810
I think it's probably like probably like one out of 20 let's say 5% whatever the

955
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:39.760
number is that people like.
I keep looking at Jamie,

956
00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:44.530
I don't know why he's straight as fuck,
but whatever the number is,

957
00:57:44.531 --> 00:57:46.870
you know,
how does a gay guy know whether another guy's gay?

958
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:50.280
You've got to ask him.
So if he says to you,
look at you muscles and you're like,

959
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:54.430
look at you,
Bam,
it's on.
You know,
you landed in Edmonton,

960
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:58.780
the g exchanged numbers.
Things get poppin.
How's the guy find out?

961
00:57:58.781 --> 00:58:00.370
He doesn't find out unless he talks to you.
Right?

962
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.450
But there was nothing inappropriate the way he was communicating with you.

963
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.090
There was,
it was just fun.
There's was nothing inappropriate.

964
00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:10.660
The way we were joking around about it,
I lightheartedly said,

965
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:13.380
if he doesn't smack you on the ass on the way out,

966
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.740
I'm going to be very disappointed.

967
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:19.030
We were just laughing and this woman read me the fucking riot act.

968
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.630
You'd be an arrogant.
Yeah.
She was saying I was arrogant and I go,

969
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:25.480
how was that arrogant?
I got my friends very good looking.
I look at him,

970
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:28.690
he's a handsome guy and she goes,
that flight attendant was very nice.

971
00:58:28.691 --> 00:58:32.890
He was very friendly.
I go,
he was very nice.
I just think you're very arrogant.

972
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:36.880
I go,
how am I arrogant?
I go,
I just,
I don't understand that,
how that's arrogant,

973
00:58:36.881 --> 00:58:38.910
but I think my friends good looking that up.
I'm a,

974
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:42.070
I'm upset that the guy didn't hit on them.
I don't understand.

975
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.100
You want the whole fucking flight,
the whole flight.

976
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:49.090
He's flirting with you the whole flight one way.
There's one way floating.

977
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.983
Thank you.

978
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:56.040
It was just the woman was upset that I made like that I was having fun.

979
00:58:57.070 --> 00:59:00.370
She would want her to make an issue,
I think in front of her partner.
Exactly.

980
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:04.610
I guess,
yeah,
just it puts you in your place.
It backfired horribly.
It is.

981
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:09.520
I was mocking her.
I was smiling and mocking her.
I,
and I never got upset.
Like,

982
00:59:09.521 --> 00:59:13.660
I never said fuck off,
dummy.
You know,
W which is we're getting close to fuck off,

983
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:16.390
dummy.
No,
cause she kept saying arrogant and I'm like,
look,

984
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:19.300
I'm probably the least homophobic person that looks like me.

985
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.960
You're ever gonna meet,
you know,

986
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.050
<v 3>I'm just not,
I don't care.
I grew up,</v>

987
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:28.310
I lived in San Francisco from the time I was seven to 11 my neighbors were gay

988
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:32.000
and that formative period of my life,
I just was around gay people all the time.

989
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.480
And then being in show business,
I know so many fucking gay people.

990
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:39.590
I have a lot of gay friends,
just gay comedians.
I don't know that dude.

991
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:44.350
But if I be friends with him just to find out about Scientology,
I really would.

992
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.160
So anyway,
where do,
how'd that,
how do we take that hard turn?

993
00:59:49.161 --> 00:59:52.640
You're talking about arrogant buddy in the airport.
Oh yeah.

994
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.100
So this is a totally different time in the airport.

995
00:59:55.290 --> 01:00:00.290
When you posted that picture up on Facebook and I got this fucking raw people

996
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:03.080
that were angry at me.
First of all,
you said,

997
01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.530
I think you put up a clip the first time.

998
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:10.280
I was up there with Luke Bryan and I shot this bear.
Yes,
right.

999
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:14.570
A Hundred Job's filmed it and we had the Arrow coming out.
Amazing video.

1000
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.620
We should show that line.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a crazy video,
man.

1001
01:00:17.621 --> 01:00:22.080
It's all how big fucking bear too.
So anyway,
this Arrow comes out,
you,

1002
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.750
you retweeted it or did something to it.
Anyway,
you got hammered.

1003
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:29.960
So you're like,
he goes,
hey Joe.
He's like,
you're swimming.

1004
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:32.090
We go in this bear hunt.
He goes,
I don't want any pictures.

1005
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.860
I don't want any video.
He,

1006
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.740
I can't deal with this negative when you deal with it and this hate.
He goes,

1007
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:39.530
that's all I've been dealing with for two or three days.

1008
01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:44.450
And so then we kind of rethought it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought it.

1009
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:47.360
And I was like,
wait a minute.
What?
What do I believe?
Yeah.

1010
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:51.020
What do I believe in in my,
in my changing what I'm putting out there.

1011
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.610
And a lot of people do do that.

1012
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.050
You change what you put out there because you worried about the negative impact

1013
01:00:57.051 --> 01:00:59.690
of something that you actually believe in.
And I thought about it and I was like,

1014
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.440
oh,
fuck that man.
I don't,
I don't not believe in hunting.

1015
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:07.040
I don't not believe that you should be killing this bear and eating it.

1016
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.820
There's nothing wrong with it,
so fuck it.
So you put the picture up and then woo.

1017
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:15.800
The tidal wave of,
of hate just came my way.

1018
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:19.910
So I wrote this blog entry.
I will eventually put up and I want to put it up to,

1019
01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:23.190
uh,
promote,
uh,
John and Jen too,
because I think they're,

1020
01:01:23.191 --> 01:01:27.520
they're just awesome folks and I'd love to pump up their business.
But,
um,

1021
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.010
this guy came up to me at the fucking airport.
Fucking disgusting.
Meatheads oh,

1022
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:35.060
that was actually the one that was on the blaze.
Yeah.
That was actually,

1023
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.530
that was actually in support of me as I put up a whole series of tweets

1024
01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:42.080
explaining my position.
They had that on there.
Yeah.

1025
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.210
That was very cool of them to do that.
And that had,

1026
01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:45.260
did you see that number there?

1027
01:01:45.261 --> 01:01:49.910
That had a 16 16,000 shares?
Yeah,

1028
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.840
I mean,
that got to me,
that whole thing.

1029
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:57.320
This whole thing gets the hunting message out,
you know,

1030
01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.650
the right type of hunting message out there.
Um,

1031
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:04.570
and that's just what I'm trying to do it,
love it,
love it.
But anyway,
yeah,

1032
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.230
I guide the airport,
comes up to me and he goes,
hey,
um,

1033
01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:12.590
I can't believe you killed a bear that's just so beyond fucked up.

1034
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:15.110
And I just looked down and I go,
dude,
you're wearing leather shoes.

1035
01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.010
You wearing leather shoes.
And he goes,
a cow is not a bear.
I go,

1036
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.810
<v 4>yeah,
you're right.
When we were there,</v>

1037
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.670
a bear a a cub and then the mother came by and finish the cub off.

1038
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:29.280
I told them that story then we talked about earlier.
Yeah,
I go sign.

1039
01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.260
Never heard of a cow doing that.
So yeah,
you're right.

1040
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:33.810
Cows and bears are different.
The fuck he talked.

1041
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:36.390
This hierarchy of animals that you're allowed to eat.

1042
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:39.990
I'm not saying you should eat your neighbor's fucking dog.
Okay.
You know,

1043
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:44.810
don't eat pets.
You know,
I love my cats.
I love my dogs.
I love animals.

1044
01:02:44.811 --> 01:02:46.080
It's not,
I'm not an animal hater,

1045
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.220
but this idea that there's like an animal that is sacred,
you know,

1046
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:53.940
like some magical Phoenix beast.
That's what I always hear.

1047
01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:57.240
That's what they're raised for.
Yeah.
That's so stupid that,

1048
01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.630
that argument is so stupid.
That's worse.

1049
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.260
It's worse than an animal is imprisoned.
It's entire live.
Right.

1050
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:06.210
It's only existence to be slaughtered,

1051
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:10.860
to be slaughtered when you shoot a deer and that deer is wandering around eating

1052
01:03:10.861 --> 01:03:15.160
acorns and then boom,
or for you with,
you know,
the,

1053
01:03:15.161 --> 01:03:16.980
the Arrow hits him.

1054
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.600
His life is over in seconds and his life was 100% wild until the moment it

1055
01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:27.690
ended.
Right.
That's a far better existence.
Far Better.

1056
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.110
The moment my Arrow pass through that bear,

1057
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:36.150
that bear was dead inside of 30 seconds.
We heard,
cause it's kind of creepy.

1058
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:41.120
Um,
bears do a death moan,
um,
especially when you shoot them to the lungs,
right?

1059
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:45.030
They do.
And so within 15 seconds we heard

1060
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.130
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

1061
01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.430
<v 4>and you know,
John and user.
That's it.
You got it.
It was perfect.</v>

1062
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.900
And it was done within 30 seconds of that Arrow hitting it.

1063
01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.360
That animal's dead lived its entire life,

1064
01:03:58.361 --> 01:04:03.361
how many years it was alive and then one moment and it's dead and then we're

1065
01:04:03.701 --> 01:04:05.680
skinning it.
And then we ate it that night.

1066
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:11.010
And the idea that someone can come up to you and be wearing leather shoes and in

1067
01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:17.200
some way judge you for killing and eating an animal and I'm having the hide

1068
01:04:17.201 --> 01:04:19.420
tanned.
I mean,
um,
or uh,
you know,

1069
01:04:19.421 --> 01:04:23.590
the skin is being treated so I'm going to have a rug made out of it.

1070
01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:27.650
I'm still eating the animal.
I feed it to my family.
I mean,

1071
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.270
I'm taking advantage of every single aspect of this animal.

1072
01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:36.550
When you pass by a restaurant,
when you pass by a supermarket,

1073
01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:40.030
every road you drive down in America,
pretty much.

1074
01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.740
You'd go by a gas station and you see a fucking package of slim Jims.

1075
01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.040
Every animal that has been involved in making those products lived a life,

1076
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:56.910
a horrifying existence that is unimaginable suffering in comparison to an animal

1077
01:04:58.481 --> 01:05:02.610
that you hunt.
Yeah.
Not,
not Turkey jerky though.
They're there.

1078
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:04.540
That was paying the,
they lived a perfect life.

1079
01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:08.770
They don't even feel it when you tell him,
don't even know if it,

1080
01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:13.980
and then I guess on the polar opposite of that or I don't even know this whole

1081
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.950
trying to figure out what the these people think.

1082
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.740
I get people when you killed your bear,
and I had that up there,

1083
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:25.360
people were posting messages on my Facebook saying they're going to kill my

1084
01:05:25.361 --> 01:05:28.900
daughter and put her head on the wall.
Whoa.

1085
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:33.910
Is that how,
how do people get there?

1086
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:35.740
Yeah,
they get there.
Well,

1087
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:40.060
there's a lot of people involved in what's called the animal liberation movement

1088
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:44.410
and it's so intense that there are folks that break into restaurants and steel

1089
01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:48.650
lobsters and let them loose back in the ocean.
You know,
God,

1090
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.830
these mother fuckers don't understand that.

1091
01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:55.540
The reason why people are here today is because your ancestors ate animals.

1092
01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.540
If we were all just eating grass and fucking berries,

1093
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:01.690
we would still be jumping out of trees because leopards are attacking us.

1094
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.840
We literally wouldn't be here.
Right.
The human beings.

1095
01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:08.230
One of the main contributing factor to the growth and development of the human

1096
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:12.790
brain was the fact that we changed our diet from plant based diet to a meat

1097
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:13.540
based diet.

1098
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:18.540
So the human intestines changed our whole digestive process change and it freed

1099
01:06:19.931 --> 01:06:23.230
up resources that allow the brain to grow and develop.

1100
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:26.110
This is like accepted scientific fact.

1101
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.500
Obviously I'm a fucking idiot.
So when I'm telling you this,

1102
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:30.970
it's not based on anything.

1103
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:34.630
I truly understand them basically repeating things that smart people figured
out,

1104
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.160
but that is what they figured out.
I mean,

1105
01:06:36.161 --> 01:06:40.240
that's a main scientific point when it comes to the development of the human

1106
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:44.840
brain.
So that's why we're here,
dummy.
You know,
we're not here for Tofu.
All right?

1107
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:48.220
And by the way,
they've also been proved,

1108
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:50.650
been proven over the last decade or so,

1109
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.770
that plants have much more understanding of their environment than we ever gave

1110
01:06:56.921 --> 01:06:57.581
them credit for.

1111
01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:01.270
And just because they don't have the ability to communicate with us.

1112
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.140
They don't scream when you pull them out of the ground or they don't try to get

1113
01:07:05.141 --> 01:07:05.980
away.
When you go.

1114
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:10.750
Reaching for a turnip doesn't mean that they're not a life form that reacts to

1115
01:07:10.751 --> 01:07:14.050
its environment.
The same way in animal does.
When an animal,
you know,

1116
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.260
turns its ears up and looks around because it it,
it thinks a predator,

1117
01:07:17.261 --> 01:07:19.210
it's coming.
That's a natural reaction.

1118
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:24.310
Plants have natural reactions to plants develop toxins in order to discourage

1119
01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:25.510
predation.
They,

1120
01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.830
they have literally things that they develop over time to keep things from

1121
01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:32.050
eating them.
They didn't want to be fucking Eaton.
Okay.

1122
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:34.750
When you're eating cauliflower,
I have to feel sorry for plants.

1123
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:38.770
Now you have to feel sorry for plants.
You know,
clients can scream.

1124
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.340
No one w why people couldn't be so self righteous.
It's true.

1125
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:46.480
It's a really foolish notion that life eats life.

1126
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:49.960
It's always eaten life.
That's what happens.
That's how humans get by.

1127
01:07:49.961 --> 01:07:53.650
That's how plants get buy.
Everything eats some form of life has to,

1128
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:58.680
there's a cycle and we somehow or another want to disconnect ourselves from that

1129
01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:03.520
or disconnect ourselves from the,
the concept of things that are sentient,

1130
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:06.640
things that are aware of their environment,
that things that can see in here.

1131
01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:09.160
They're similar to us,
but it,
you know,

1132
01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:14.140
not everybody wants to be disconnected because after the last podcast I was on

1133
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:16.340
with you,
do you know how many new

1134
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.130
<v 2>bow hunters wanted to listen to what we talked about?</v>

1135
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.950
Listen to the connection we talked about and never had thought about bow
hunting,

1136
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:27.080
never had shot a bow and all of a sudden they were at their pro shop or they

1137
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:29.840
want to learn more.
I mean,
I've had guys who said,

1138
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:34.010
I just as I think it was yesterday,
this Guy Siemens Meshes,
he goes,

1139
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.890
I hadn't heard of you before Joe's podcast.
He goes,

1140
01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:40.730
that I sat one night and watched every one of your videos.
Wow.
I mean,

1141
01:08:40.731 --> 01:08:42.910
so that's awesome.
So there's,
there's people,

1142
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.930
there are people who are disconnected,

1143
01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:50.170
but there are people who I guess had been inspired by talking about this and

1144
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:51.470
talking about,
you know,

1145
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.610
the type of hunting and the connection we have and want that same thing,

1146
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:59.900
you know,
and want to have something to train for and want to have a purpose.

1147
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.640
You know,
like you said,
um,
why are you in shape?
You know,
are you competing?

1148
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:05.474
Are You well,

1149
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.860
are my purpose is to be the ultimate Predator would be the very best at what I

1150
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:12.500
do.
And other people are interested in that too.

1151
01:09:12.501 --> 01:09:13.600
And finding out what that's about.

1152
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.481
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1153
01:09:14.481 --> 01:09:19.481
And I think that this disconnection that people have in society is a main cause

1154
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:22.700
of people just feeling like shit all the time.

1155
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.980
They don't feel rewarded by life when your day to day existence is just doing

1156
01:09:27.981 --> 01:09:30.560
something that you don't enjoy and then coming home and resting,

1157
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:35.450
getting ready to do it again.
It sucks when you have something that you enjoy,

1158
01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.690
whether it's bow hunting or any sort of hobby,
any,

1159
01:09:38.691 --> 01:09:42.920
any sort of existence and any sort of a um,
uh,
discipline or practice,

1160
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:47.270
you work towards something and you get a reward for that work,
right?
Feels good,

1161
01:09:47.271 --> 01:09:48.350
sacrifice,
reward.

1162
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:53.470
And then there's the nother notch that is above that is this sacrifice worked

1163
01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:59.270
for something,
achieve the results,
and you actually live off those results.

1164
01:09:59.271 --> 01:10:01.010
You're eating it.
And that's,

1165
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.690
that's a very primal thing mannerful but it doesn't mean we're less evolved.

1166
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:09.180
This is what people have to get into their mind lit,

1167
01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:13.250
release all your preconceived notions of what a hunter is.

1168
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:15.950
These rednecks just out,
they're torturing animals.

1169
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:20.951
You psychopaths release all those preconceived notions and take in the concept

1170
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.640
of wild of what wild is.
Just it,

1171
01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:30.641
just to be out in nature and watch all these things run around.

1172
01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:33.770
Watch animals chase after each other.
Watch.

1173
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:39.020
Watch this natural process that gives zero fucks if you're there or not there

1174
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:43.550
and then realize that this can be your source of sustenance.
This,

1175
01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:47.810
you can live in that world for brief moments in time.
Train for it,

1176
01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:48.800
prepare for it,

1177
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:53.840
bring back that protein and live and live a healthier life too.

1178
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:54.120
Yeah.

1179
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.120
<v 2>That I think that if that fact right there will you just explain affects every</v>

1180
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.860
minute of my life every day.
I mean,

1181
01:11:02.861 --> 01:11:07.270
because that's basically I'm known as a bow hunter,

1182
01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:11.260
the bow hunter,
whoever this guy who does whatever.
So that's,

1183
01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:16.030
that's had such a powerful on me,
thus all,

1184
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.010
I mean,
it's not all I am,
but it's a big part of what I am.
And that's,

1185
01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:22.030
that's what I always say.
I always say,
well,
Bowen,

1186
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.890
he's changed my life and I see these people who,
who messaged me and,
uh,

1187
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:31.170
because of your podcast and they want that same,

1188
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:35.490
could impact my life that same way could give my life that type of meaning.

1189
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:40.380
And uh,
uh,
I do want to address one thing people talk about,
you know,

1190
01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:44.700
hunters being rednecks are barbarians or heartless or this or that.

1191
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.700
Um,
you know,
my buddy,
uh,

1192
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.710
Rick Carone is battling cancer right now.
And when I do,

1193
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.740
when I was going to sell something like I've sold bows,

1194
01:11:55.741 --> 01:11:59.340
highest bidder type thing,
hunters are the most generous,

1195
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.380
heartfelt people.
I mean,

1196
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:06.381
that's basically all my followers are hunters and they are so giving and so

1197
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:11.430
caring and loving of somebody they've never met.

1198
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:15.360
They've just learned about maybe,
you know,
from my website or,

1199
01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:20.070
or from whatever else.
And I dunno,
I just,
I have a hard,

1200
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:25.260
I mean it's just amazing to me just the heart hunters have.

1201
01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:29.100
And if people are so far,
so wrong on,

1202
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.140
I guess wouldn't what moves us,

1203
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:35.250
what's important to us because I see people giving thousands of dollars to help

1204
01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:36.120
somebody they've never met.

1205
01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.430
<v 4>Well,
uh,
the,</v>

1206
01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:40.870
the amount of negativity that you get from nonhunters in comparison to the

1207
01:12:40.871 --> 01:12:43.060
amount of negativity and hate you get from hunters,

1208
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.200
it's hugely disproportionate.
What you talked about,

1209
01:12:47.201 --> 01:12:50.890
about being respectful about how when you say you disagree with someone on

1210
01:12:50.891 --> 01:12:51.221
Twitter,

1211
01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:55.000
you don't say fuck off you fucking dummy and you don't get involved in any of

1212
01:12:55.001 --> 01:12:55.370
these,

1213
01:12:55.370 --> 01:13:00.370
these negative exchanges because of that you attract this very positive

1214
01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:02.411
following.

1215
01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:06.640
And I've been to your Facebook page and I've read the comments when you,

1216
01:13:06.641 --> 01:13:11.380
when you put something up on Instagram and it's an incredibly positive group of

1217
01:13:11.381 --> 01:13:13.240
people.
Yeah.
Credits,
incredibly positive.

1218
01:13:13.241 --> 01:13:18.241
And also people that recognize the rewards of this lifestyle and recognize the

1219
01:13:18.281 --> 01:13:22.600
negative impact or the negative opinion that a lot of people don't understand it

1220
01:13:22.601 --> 01:13:23.260
have.

1221
01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:28.260
And so they feel connected with each other in sort of solidarity against what

1222
01:13:28.511 --> 01:13:31.030
they perceive to be these ignorant people that judge them.

1223
01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.660
<v 2>Yeah.
Right now it's uh,
I know and that's the thing.</v>

1224
01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.760
So I do get negative every once in a while and all I do,

1225
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:42.970
I block them and delete it just because I don't want that one person skewing one

1226
01:13:43.311 --> 01:13:47.750
person can skew the whole
comment train basically.

1227
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:50.060
And then just,
it takes away from the whole point,
right.

1228
01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:55.310
Maybe I'm living or created this fantasy land of positivity by doing that.

1229
01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:00.290
But that's fine because it,
it helps me,
I see other people at impacts.

1230
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:04.190
And I guess the closest thing to negativity that I've,

1231
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:06.000
I've done lately is just this,

1232
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:10.160
this slogan I have on my new shirt and it's nobody cares.
Work harder.
Yeah.

1233
01:14:10.161 --> 01:14:13.810
And that's,
I always say,
because everything else is all positive.

1234
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:17.440
The nobody cares.
It's tough love.
It's a little bit of tough love.

1235
01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:21.640
It's like everybody has issues,
everybody has hurdles,
everybody has challenges.

1236
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:23.770
But at the end of the day,
they'll listen to you.

1237
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:27.640
They don't really care that much.
If you don't have what you want,

1238
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:31.290
you need to work harder.
So that's,
that's all I've done.
I'm,

1239
01:14:31.291 --> 01:14:35.050
I'm not looking for sympathy on anything and,
and,
uh,
I just,
you know,

1240
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.170
I just hope other people take that from this,
you know,

1241
01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.000
I still love you and care about you guys.

1242
01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:42.160
We just need to work harder if we don't have what we want.

1243
01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:45.780
<v 4>Well that's you dude.
You're,
you're that guy.
Every time we were in a,
in camp,</v>

1244
01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:46.950
you were out there running,
you went,

1245
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.100
you went running basically every day fucking Alberta.
You,

1246
01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:53.370
you put in the work man.
And that's why you become successful.
What you do.

1247
01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.420
I like people that work hard and push through things because it inspires me to

1248
01:14:57.421 --> 01:15:00.360
do the same thing.
So even that shirt would,

1249
01:15:00.361 --> 01:15:03.510
might be conceived as Nang or perceived as negative.
I don't think it's negative.

1250
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:06.780
It's,
it's inspirational.
It's like people need to hear that shit.

1251
01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:11.370
Just get your fucking ass out of it.
People love to find an excuse.

1252
01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:15.870
Oh my fucking hangnails really bugging me,
man.
I can't lift.
Just,
just do,

1253
01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:18.390
just get out and do something.
And that's why that just do it.

1254
01:15:18.391 --> 01:15:21.180
Campaign was so powerful for Nike,
you know,

1255
01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:25.050
because just do it is really what you need to hear sometimes.

1256
01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:27.780
Just shut the fuck up and go to work.
Get it done.

1257
01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.380
I read the rocks tweets in his Instagrams.
Oh yeah,

1258
01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.650
because that guy will fly into somewhere at,
you know,

1259
01:15:34.651 --> 01:15:38.550
four o'clock in the morning and he's at the gym at five and he takes pictures

1260
01:15:38.551 --> 01:15:41.430
and,
and he's fucking killing it every day.
His Dad.
Yeah.

1261
01:15:41.431 --> 01:15:45.510
And that's why he looks that way.
Yeah.
You see him in that movie Hercules.

1262
01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.501
I haven't seen it.

1263
01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:50.610
You don't get that way by taking the day off cause you have a hangnail you get

1264
01:15:50.611 --> 01:15:50.910
that.

1265
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:55.500
You get to look like that pause where because of some artificial and supplements

1266
01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:56.301
and I'll find him.

1267
01:15:56.301 --> 01:16:00.240
I had been frozen sort room but there's also a lot of hard work involved.

1268
01:16:00.241 --> 01:16:03.840
No doubt a fucking bout it.
You could take all the steroids in the world.

1269
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:08.760
Your body doesn't grow like that.
It grows like that from hard work period.

1270
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:14.100
In a local storage and hard work is a magical ingredient if you can.

1271
01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:18.930
If you could apply that magical ingredient to almost everything in life and hard

1272
01:16:18.931 --> 01:16:21.780
work also comes with hard thinking,
hard work.

1273
01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:23.310
Everybody likes to think of as being like,

1274
01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.710
oh you just grunt and put in the effort.

1275
01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.330
No hard work is also preparation,
thought process.

1276
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:33.780
Understanding,
and that is a big part of hunting as well.

1277
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:38.130
It's not just about,
you know,
oh,
it's really hard to get up that hill.

1278
01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:42.330
Get to that set fest,
7,000 feet elevation where those elk are.
No,

1279
01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:43.170
you got to understand the,

1280
01:16:43.171 --> 01:16:45.810
when you got to understand the behavior of these animals,

1281
01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.140
you got to understand what's,
what's going on in the Rut.
What is this?

1282
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:50.850
What does this bull elk attracted to?

1283
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:55.500
Are you going to attract a bull by pertaining to be a cow which she wants to

1284
01:16:55.501 --> 01:16:58.290
have sex with?
Or are you going to be a bull,
which we want.

1285
01:16:58.291 --> 01:17:01.800
He wants to challenge and you got to know what to do,
what and what to do.

1286
01:17:01.801 --> 01:17:03.330
When I,

1287
01:17:03.331 --> 01:17:08.331
I'm amazed at how much knowledge is involved in hunting and how much like

1288
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.730
<v 1>Steve Rinella is of a goddamn encyclopedia.</v>

1289
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.710
I need to get you two together.
I want to do is a lot smarter than me.
Uh,
well,

1290
01:17:18.711 --> 01:17:21.590
he's a very educated man.
I mostly just a bow hunter.

1291
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:25.030
You guys would get along great though.
Well we need to do is,
uh,

1292
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.080
when we go next year,
when we go,
I'm a bow hunting for elk.
Yeah.

1293
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.420
We should do it for his show.
Yeah.
It might be a few extra people though.

1294
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:35.420
It might be a pain in the ass.
I know you liked her.
It will solo.

1295
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:37.100
It would be a huge pain in the ass,

1296
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:40.940
but it might be worth it to get you two together.
It'd be really interesting.

1297
01:17:40.941 --> 01:17:42.140
I think you guys get along great,

1298
01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:47.141
but that he's really opened my eyes to how much information is involved in

1299
01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:51.860
hunting.
I mean how much knowledge,
how much,
how much you have to know.
Especially,

1300
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:55.490
you know,
he's doing it all year round,
so he's constantly aware of the cycles,

1301
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.000
the breeding,
mating,
food patterns,

1302
01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:01.730
all the different things that you have to pay attention to about each individual

1303
01:18:01.731 --> 01:18:05.570
animal.
This is just a lot going on there,
man.
It's a rich,

1304
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:07.010
intense world.

1305
01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:10.530
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
it's so,
it's so far removed from,
you know,
the,</v>

1306
01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:13.260
like we probably addressed it the last time,
but the,

1307
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.920
the bubba hunting stereotype of driving around drinking beers,

1308
01:18:16.921 --> 01:18:17.790
shooting from the truck

1309
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.800
<v 1>that's still out there.
Right.
But that's out there with everything.
I mean,</v>

1310
01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.400
I get that with the UFC,
you know,
people are like,
oh,
you're a UFC great.

1311
01:18:24.401 --> 01:18:27.610
What are you doing man?
You fucking hanging around with a bunch of assholes,

1312
01:18:27.611 --> 01:18:30.610
beating the shit out of each other.
Look,
come to Jujitsu class with me.

1313
01:18:30.611 --> 01:18:33.790
You'll meet some of the nicest,
friendliest people in.
A lot of them are nerds.

1314
01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.930
Okay?
A lot of my friends were Jujitsu.
If you looked at them,
you would say,
oh,

1315
01:18:37.931 --> 01:18:40.330
that guy's like a nerd.
He's like a nerdy guy,
Magen nerd.

1316
01:18:40.331 --> 01:18:45.250
We'll fucking strangle you with his legs.
You know,
like,
it's,
what it is,

1317
01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:49.750
is people that really get into something that is ultimately very rewarding.

1318
01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:53.830
And I think it's ultimately very rewarding to accomplish something that's

1319
01:18:53.831 --> 01:18:57.310
difficult to do.
And it's something that's missing from a lot of people's lives.

1320
01:18:57.310 --> 01:19:00.550
A lot of people are doing something that's easy to do and they're looking to

1321
01:19:00.551 --> 01:19:03.800
take coffee breaks and they're looking to take a nice long lunch break and they

1322
01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:06.040
were going to take a newspaper and the John when they take a shit,

1323
01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.470
cause nobody can say anything.
Hey I got to go to the bathroom,
man,

1324
01:19:08.471 --> 01:19:12.520
what do you want?
And there's a lot of people that I look to use paper files,

1325
01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.800
they have to write a fucking run out of batteries on the toilet and we read his

1326
01:19:17.801 --> 01:19:19.990
paper.
That's true.
Some people do,
man.

1327
01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.270
Brian counts still reads the newspaper every time I'm with them,

1328
01:19:22.271 --> 01:19:25.000
motherfuckers got the New York Times.
Especially if someone's looking,

1329
01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.350
<v 2>I like having a paper breakfast.
I'll say that.
Hey,</v>

1330
01:19:29.351 --> 01:19:33.250
so this is one thing I forgot to ask last time,
but,

1331
01:19:33.251 --> 01:19:37.600
so my kids are big,
typical regular sports fans like NFL.

1332
01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:40.870
Of course I like Alec Ufc.

1333
01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.580
So they're like dad,
do you think a UFC fighter?

1334
01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:48.820
It's like say somebody like a Chad Mendez.

1335
01:19:48.821 --> 01:19:53.380
Who's fighting Joseph Aldo tomorrow night.
Tomorrow for the title.
Love Chad.

1336
01:19:53.381 --> 01:19:58.180
He's a,
he's a hundred by the way.
This year.
I know,
I know he's a stud,

1337
01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.820
but uh,
so say Patrick Willis,

1338
01:20:00.821 --> 01:20:05.380
who's this huge 240 pound linebacker who would win in a fight?
Chad?

1339
01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.860
200%.
100%

1340
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:13.000
<v 1>and so that's hard to explain because what,
what people are my kids anyway.</v>

1341
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:17.010
See is this huge jacked,
you know,
giant guy,

1342
01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.630
NFL and then Chad,
who's what,
what is,

1343
01:20:20.631 --> 01:20:25.410
he won 55 he walks around probably one 60 fights at one 45.

1344
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:29.870
Okay,
so why,
why would he beat him?
Well,
he def,

1345
01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:33.120
he did definitely doesn't have to win.

1346
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:36.510
Like it is possible that the NFL guy could pick them up and smash them.

1347
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:38.550
Just drop them on a rock or something like that.

1348
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:40.890
Cause you're dealing with a hundred extra pounds.

1349
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.920
Alpha male testosterone and bone and,

1350
01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.150
and aggression and Mexican supplements.
But is that him right there?

1351
01:20:48.151 --> 01:20:50.700
That's the guy.
Why am I looking at his dick,
bro?
What the fuck?

1352
01:20:50.701 --> 01:20:54.000
Kind of gay porn shit.
That's the first one that comes up.

1353
01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:55.440
Tell that due to pull his pants up.

1354
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.350
I don't need to see those fuck muscles at the top of your head.

1355
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.800
He listened to me.
Boys,
if you're trying to attract the gals,
I understand it,

1356
01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:03.710
but when you're around other men,
pull up,

1357
01:21:03.711 --> 01:21:05.550
pull your pants up so I don't see your fuck muscles,

1358
01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:09.420
those weird upper hip muscles.
You know what I mean?
There's gotta be sexy.

1359
01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:11.580
The v part,
this shit.
Yeah.

1360
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:14.700
These things right in there and you can see it and see it up there.
No,

1361
01:21:14.701 --> 01:21:17.370
I'm not going to show you,
but I'm just standing up.

1362
01:21:17.371 --> 01:21:21.090
So look at that is I'm seeing way too much dick.
Anyway,
that's,

1363
01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.000
that's Patrick was his only hope is,
well there's two parts.

1364
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:28.260
If he has martial arts training chats fucked.
You mean if he doesn't,

1365
01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:31.380
if he's like a brown belt in Jujitsu,
he knows how to kickbox chats.
Fuck.

1366
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:32.310
Cause he's just too big.

1367
01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.550
But if he's just a regular dude with no martial arts training at all,

1368
01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.470
jazz going to get us back.
He'll just,
he'll have to choke him out.

1369
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:44.010
He's not going to,
not might knock 'em out.
Chat hits pretty fucking hard,

1370
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:45.450
but he's going to have to hit him.
Perfect.

1371
01:21:45.451 --> 01:21:48.690
You're dealing with a much larger skulled and Chad's right.
You know,

1372
01:21:48.691 --> 01:21:51.540
when you're dealing with Chad's size hands compared to his hands,

1373
01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:53.370
which probably our biggest,
my fucking laptop.

1374
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.760
Right size is very important though.

1375
01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:01.680
The idea that size doesn't mean anything that's ridiculous.
Size means a lot.

1376
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:05.070
It just doesn't mean as much as technique.
Technique means the most,

1377
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:08.820
but there's a lot of factors involved in like who would win in a fight.

1378
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:12.150
The most important factor is knowledge and technique.

1379
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:16.350
There was a dude I used to roll with a 10 plan.

1380
01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.570
It was a really nice guy who's a former football player.

1381
01:22:18.571 --> 01:22:21.330
He was 250 pounds and whenever I used to roll with them,

1382
01:22:21.331 --> 01:22:24.510
I just call it riding the bull.
[inaudible]
got to go ride the bull.

1383
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:29.820
Cause every time I get on top of him,
well,
when anytime we'd scramble,

1384
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:33.960
I would have to initially let him get on top because he's just too God damn big

1385
01:22:33.961 --> 01:22:34.830
for me to take them down.

1386
01:22:34.831 --> 01:22:38.040
So I'd let him get on top and then I'd have to sweep him and then I'd eventually

1387
01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:40.940
ride them and then eventually catch them.
Right.
It would take me a while.

1388
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:44.340
I have to wear his big ass out.
Right.
But I was just better than him.

1389
01:22:44.341 --> 01:22:48.000
I'd been doing Jujitsu for 15 years and he'd only been doing Jujitsu for like

1390
01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:52.320
six months.
So it was just a matter of riding the bull.
I would just hang on,

1391
01:22:52.321 --> 01:22:55.290
knew him,
but God damn,
he was fucking strong as shit.

1392
01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:59.270
And I always think if this motherfucker knew half of what I knew I'd be doing

1393
01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:03.540
that just be,
there's a huge advantage of being bigger and stronger.

1394
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.740
It's just not as much of an

1395
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.013
<v 4>excuse me.</v>

1396
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.680
Not as much as an advantage as being a technical and understanding what's going

1397
01:23:13.751 --> 01:23:14.980
on in,
in,
inside of fight.

1398
01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.750
<v 2>One thing I was going to ask too about,
you know,</v>

1399
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:22.100
I get a lot of questions on diet and,
and putting on muscle and this and that.

1400
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:25.190
How many,
I think we've,

1401
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.800
you said eating meat has evolved the brain basically.
But,
uh,

1402
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:35.210
I think eating meat is how I've been able to retain muscle and still run as much

1403
01:23:35.211 --> 01:23:39.950
as I do.
Just all the protein I take.
So I was wondering how of fighters,

1404
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:43.820
how many of those guys are Vegan or vegetarian?

1405
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:48.270
<v 4>There's no elite fighters that are vegan except for Jake shields who is a Vegan.</v>

1406
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:53.370
Um,
but he still eats eggs I think.
Um,
because uh,
and he would eat game.

1407
01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.340
He said he would eat like a,
I'm an animal that's hunted,

1408
01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.530
but he just doesn't believe in factory farming.

1409
01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.980
It does it purely for ethical reasons.
But Jake,

1410
01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:06.120
although Jake is fairly elite,
he was cut from the UFC.

1411
01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.810
Now he's fighting in a smaller organization cause he couldn't beat the best of

1412
01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:12.750
the best guys.
You know,
it just lost recently in Hector Lombard,

1413
01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.400
who knows how much better Jake would be if he existed in us.
Uh,

1414
01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.470
a diet of black bear and elk.
I mean,
I don't know,
man.

1415
01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:22.410
I don't really a lot better.
Who knows?
If you want to make the UFC,

1416
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:25.760
you better eat meat.
I don't know.
Jake is really fucking good,
really,

1417
01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.790
really good grappler.
Um,
but he's also just tough as nails.

1418
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:33.600
I think that every edge counts.

1419
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:35.760
There was a reason why people take vitamin supplements.

1420
01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.840
There's a reason why people take protein supplements,
amino acids,

1421
01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.640
all the things that are legal that people take.

1422
01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:45.450
They take it because it gives you an edge.
It might be a small edge,

1423
01:24:45.451 --> 01:24:49.830
but that small edge could be the difference between escaping a submission and

1424
01:24:49.831 --> 01:24:50.490
tapping out.

1425
01:24:50.490 --> 01:24:55.170
It could be the difference between synching up a submission and and the guy gets

1426
01:24:55.171 --> 01:24:55.501
away.

1427
01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:59.580
It could be the difference between getting that final push to make a take down

1428
01:24:59.581 --> 01:25:03.480
and not and it's those small edges all add up.

1429
01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.430
Massage therapy,
a yoga,
every little edge.
Meditation,

1430
01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:13.490
isolation tanks was like guys are doing everything to get every little edge and

1431
01:25:13.561 --> 01:25:16.500
the idea that you would do all these different things but you wouldn't eat meat.

1432
01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.160
Man,
it's the science is all there.

1433
01:25:20.161 --> 01:25:25.161
This idea that Vegan athletes are superior is fucking preposterous.

1434
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:28.200
It's so difficult to get B12.

1435
01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:32.130
It's so difficult to get all of the amino acids.

1436
01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:34.560
It's so difficult to get a full,

1437
01:25:34.561 --> 01:25:39.561
complete balanced protein without eating meat cause that's really fucking hard

1438
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.930
<v 2>now.
And so and that that brings me back to bow hunting.</v>

1439
01:25:43.931 --> 01:25:47.160
You talk about all those little edges added up to give Earl,

1440
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:50.230
those little things add up to give you an edge.
That's,
that's bow hunting,

1441
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.980
bow hunting.
Because people will say,
well,
you don't need to do this.

1442
01:25:53.981 --> 01:25:57.460
You don't need to do that.
That's overkill.
That's too much to me.

1443
01:25:57.461 --> 01:26:02.461
I'm thinking I'm just adding one more little positive edge to my arsenal and

1444
01:26:03.171 --> 01:26:04.370
then that's how,

1445
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.110
<v 4>you know,
killed</v>

1446
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.310
13 bowls in the last five years.
You know,

1447
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:15.170
they all haven't been just perfect.
I've needed little edges to make it happen.

1448
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:17.360
And so that to me,

1449
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.810
fighting is a lot like something as difficult as bow hunting.

1450
01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.190
I think there's a lot of ego involved.
You know,

1451
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:24.410
there's a lot of people that don't,

1452
01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:28.610
they don't want to think that they're not putting in as much work as you.

1453
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.690
So they're like,
you know,
all these guys meathead.
Yeah,

1454
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.260
you don't need to pull that much weight,

1455
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:37.340
but what's that much weight to you and what's that much weight?
To me,
you know,

1456
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:42.200
my question is,
okay,
how much weight do you lift when you let go to the gym?

1457
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:45.770
If you can only like do a curl with like 25 pounds and I can do it with a

1458
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:49.370
hundred how much stronger am I then you and what is the difference between a 50

1459
01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:52.530
pound bow to you and an 80 pound boat?
To me exactly.

1460
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:56.480
I fucked my shoulder up by pulling a 90 pound bow a hundred times a day.

1461
01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.420
150 times.
It's not bad.
It's a,
I actually,

1462
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.960
I'm just finishing this Regina king treatment.
It's the attendance,

1463
01:27:02.961 --> 01:27:04.010
attendance were strained.

1464
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.850
You're given all this repetitive ammunition now for why you shouldn't shoot a

1465
01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:10.970
heavy bow e well,
you know what,
if I worried about injuries,

1466
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:14.210
I would have never done anything.
Right.
And then I've had three knee surgeries.

1467
01:27:14.211 --> 01:27:17.950
I had my nose fixed.
I'm,
I'm uh,
I've,
I'm full of fucking surgeries.

1468
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:19.510
That's what guys say to me.
Cause you know,

1469
01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.290
I run basically I do the same thing every single day,
my training and they say,

1470
01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:28.070
you know,
what are you going to do?
And 40 years when he's still on a hunt,

1471
01:27:28.071 --> 01:27:30.520
but you won't be able to hunt because you've been running every day and wearing

1472
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:34.070
out your joints.
I'm like,
I don't know if I'm going to be alive tomorrow,

1473
01:27:34.330 --> 01:27:37.760
let alone 40 years from now,
I'm going to worry about tomorrow,

1474
01:27:37.761 --> 01:27:40.400
tomorrow and today I'm going to get my best.
Well,

1475
01:27:40.401 --> 01:27:42.680
people are always looking for some negative man.

1476
01:27:42.681 --> 01:27:45.860
They're always looking for something and they could point at you that makes you

1477
01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:48.950
less than them or makes you less than you think you are.

1478
01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.120
People look to diminish.
Look,
I look to diminish.
I'm a fucking comedian.

1479
01:27:53.121 --> 01:27:55.340
That's what I do.
I point holes a thing and I look at Shit.

1480
01:27:55.341 --> 01:27:58.120
I go to this stupid bitch had done to do that right now my thing,

1481
01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:02.540
but that is what I do,
so I understand the mindset,

1482
01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:07.510
but it's a very disempowering mindset to instead not be inspired to,

1483
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.010
to,
to not be inspired to just poke holes in things like you.

1484
01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:13.640
You don't need 80 pounds.
How bunch is just be inspired to go.

1485
01:28:13.641 --> 01:28:15.710
How about you doing a little bit of exercise?

1486
01:28:15.711 --> 01:28:20.210
How can you not worry about a guy who was obviously far physically stronger than

1487
01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:22.850
you,
who only pulls an extra 20 pounds of weight.

1488
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.350
It's really not that big of a God damn deal.
Right.
But yeah,
it's,

1489
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:29.490
it's an ego thing.
I think in a lot of guys that,

1490
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:33.140
that the crabs in a bucket was a good one of our most popular stories from the

1491
01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.480
last time.
Yeah.
But uh,
yeah,

1492
01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:38.450
so there's that still I guess always going to be out there.
It is.

1493
01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.560
It's always going to be out there.

1494
01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:44.980
I'm fascinated by the technology involved in bow hunting too.

1495
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:49.280
Um,
I mean I,
in the back here we have a,
one of those uh,

1496
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:54.050
radar things we shoot an Arrow through the chronograph tells you the exact speed

1497
01:28:54.051 --> 01:28:54.884
of the Arrow.

1498
01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.880
And that was another thing that like I had to learn that I thought was really

1499
01:28:58.881 --> 01:29:02.250
interesting.
The spine of the hour,
how stiff the Arrow

1500
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:02.671
<v 1>is.
Well,</v>

1501
01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:07.671
how many grains the are ways in relationship to the bow in relationship to the

1502
01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:11.730
speed of the Arrow.
Then you have to calculate all that and put out a site tape.

1503
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.750
And that that's how you figure out with the guys at the bow rack.

1504
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.530
D made it me a sight tape for the carbon spider and it's fucking amazing.

1505
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:22.080
It's so dead on because mine was all goofy.

1506
01:29:22.081 --> 01:29:25.410
The last one that I printed out myself,
it's like a lot involved

1507
01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:30.180
<v 2>and we're basically has run scientist.
No,</v>

1508
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:35.130
no that's,
we do have to give a plug to the bowl rack.
Yeah,
we have Springfield,

1509
01:29:35.131 --> 01:29:36.570
Oregon,
Springfield,
Oregon.

1510
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.980
We have such an advantage having Bose set up by professionals,

1511
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.600
guys who do it every single day.

1512
01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:47.610
There's a lot of guys in small towns south throughout everywhere that they can

1513
01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:50.940
buy the same bow by the same arrows,
by the same everything.

1514
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:52.770
The bow is not set up correctly.

1515
01:29:52.771 --> 01:29:56.070
It's not tuned and it's just not going to perform.

1516
01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:01.230
So we know when we go out,
especially cause I'm at the bowl rag,

1517
01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.840
I paper to my Bose,
we put it into Hooters shooter,

1518
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:06.810
which is a machine that shoots your bow for you to,

1519
01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:11.370
to to tell you whether the boat's set up correctly or there's some human error

1520
01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:14.040
involved.
So basically at the end of the day when we go hunting,

1521
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.710
we know the bow is at the top,

1522
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:20.670
the top of its capability and any error is us.

1523
01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:23.280
So then if I can control my errors,

1524
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.430
arrows going to go right where it's supposed to go.
And um,

1525
01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:31.080
that's also been using,
you know,
Hoyt bows.
Yeah.

1526
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:34.890
Best bows out there as far as I'm concerned.
And you're right,

1527
01:30:34.891 --> 01:30:37.230
that technology is just fascinating.

1528
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.420
<v 1>Yeah.
These Hoyt balls are just incredible man.</v>

1529
01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:43.890
The carbon fiber spider turbo that we used when we were in a candida,

1530
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:48.180
you're talking about a bear,
I mean 250 plus pound animal.

1531
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:53.160
This arrow went straight through its body and went so deep into a log that I had

1532
01:30:53.161 --> 01:30:55.320
to break it off because I couldn't get the broad head out right.

1533
01:30:55.321 --> 01:30:58.140
And that that Arrow is sitting up on the wall in my office.
I mean,

1534
01:30:58.150 --> 01:31:01.770
it pass clean through this animal like that,
like butter.

1535
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:06.150
And this is a giant difference between that and what you think of as a bow and

1536
01:31:06.151 --> 01:31:07.800
Arrow that like from the boy scout days,

1537
01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:09.060
you know when you would shoot those little,

1538
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:12.840
those little Shitty recurve bows like 20 pound poll or whatever it was,

1539
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:16.650
they just don't have the kind of impact that these boats have with the cams and

1540
01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:20.580
the technology and the way they engineer these risers.

1541
01:31:20.581 --> 01:31:25.030
I mean these things are incredible pieces of work and engineering.
Well,

1542
01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.160
<v 2>and I w let's see,
what did I just get?</v>

1543
01:31:27.161 --> 01:31:30.610
I just got the brand new night drum and actually I brought it at sitting over

1544
01:31:30.611 --> 01:31:32.620
there.
And you,
you just asked when I walked in and you're like,

1545
01:31:32.621 --> 01:31:35.470
why did you bring your bow?
I'm like,
cause I take my bowl everywhere.

1546
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:40.170
Why wouldn't I bring it?
I need to keep that thing in my sight.
So uh,
yeah,

1547
01:31:40.171 --> 01:31:42.430
bring that when you go on the road and you,
you set up targets,

1548
01:31:42.431 --> 01:31:46.810
places meet like here people say,
no,
I'm going to be in la.

1549
01:31:46.811 --> 01:31:49.750
So they want to shoot and where are you going to shoot today?

1550
01:31:49.810 --> 01:31:52.120
Are going to shoot somewhere today?
Yeah,
yeah.
Now they're going to go,

1551
01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.770
there's guys will,
uh,

1552
01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.520
there's three people here who have places that they shoot.

1553
01:31:57.521 --> 01:32:00.010
So I don't know if it's a range or if it's their,
but

1554
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.420
<v 3>they've all invited me to meet up.</v>

1555
01:32:01.421 --> 01:32:03.700
I'm going to meet up with at least one of them.

1556
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:07.150
Maybe they'll all be there and we're going to shoot bows and one of them is

1557
01:32:07.151 --> 01:32:09.460
going to be,
that flight attendant is going to be waiting for you.

1558
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.980
He's going to be wearing velcro underwear,

1559
01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.860
uh,
Japanese,
uh,
he probably is from here.

1560
01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:22.400
Chances are he is from California.
Everyone's gay in California.

1561
01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:25.690
And so he trying to say,
how dare you.
How dare you.
That's cool though,

1562
01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:27.760
that you have this sort of connection with a,
with fans.

1563
01:32:27.761 --> 01:32:31.630
I know you do a lot of those,
uh,
Cabela's openings or bass pro shops,

1564
01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.150
whatever it is.
Which one is it?
Both.
Both of them.

1565
01:32:34.151 --> 01:32:38.920
You do both of them do appearances at both.
And when I go,
I just,

1566
01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:42.880
like I said,
I liked the,
the positive atmosphere,
like the comradery.

1567
01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:47.890
I like to see people working.
So I'll say,
hey,
I went to Alaska.
You know,

1568
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:48.760
and I've said,
I'm going to,

1569
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:51.940
I did the bass pro shop grand opening and in Anchorage and I said,

1570
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.090
let's go run some mountains up there.
So I met up with a couple of guys,

1571
01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:57.220
did two different runs and uh,

1572
01:32:57.310 --> 01:33:02.290
we hammered out some tough mountain runs and it just was soaking wet,

1573
01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:06.220
freezing and never felt more alive.
That's so awesome.

1574
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:09.520
That's cool too that you connect with people like that because that's also what

1575
01:33:09.521 --> 01:33:11.560
I saw him when we were in camp in Alberta.

1576
01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:14.530
All of those guys had come into that camp that we,

1577
01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:15.790
cause they knew that you were going to be there.

1578
01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:19.840
They wanted to hunt during that week.
And what a positive group of people.

1579
01:33:19.841 --> 01:33:23.460
How best you guys guys.
I never met any of them before.
Yeah,
it was,

1580
01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:27.940
they hadn't met each other before.
That was what was crazy when we got there,
we,

1581
01:33:27.941 --> 01:33:31.600
it was almost like they were all old buddies that were hanging out together.

1582
01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.760
And then slowly I started piecing together.
I'm like,

1583
01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:37.140
when did you guys meet yesterday?
You guys don't even fucking know each other.

1584
01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:41.050
Like,
this is like this grand party of like really friendly guys.

1585
01:33:41.370 --> 01:33:45.910
I thought it was just a bunch of old high school buddies got together,
but no,

1586
01:33:45.911 --> 01:33:47.770
just super positive,

1587
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:52.510
super friendly and we had a great time.
Yeah,
no,
I mean I,
I,

1588
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:56.830
I would,
I don't know what type of group of people you could bring together that,

1589
01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.240
that in that short of time and have that type of connection.
I don't know.

1590
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.830
Hunting just seems to do that to people.
I mean,
I don't know about you,

1591
01:34:05.831 --> 01:34:10.780
but when I'm somewhere I don't care where here,
uh,
were whatever town I'm in.

1592
01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:15.800
When I see somebody in Cammo,
I'm like looking at him wondering if you know,
hey,

1593
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:20.080
do you want to talk about hunting?
You Hunt w why are you wearing Camo?

1594
01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.780
But it's just like that brotherhood.
It's,
it's weird.

1595
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:26.740
I had a Hoyt hat on and I was at the airport and this old dude sat next to me

1596
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:29.410
and it just plopped down right next to me and he goes,

1597
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:33.070
how long you've been bow hunting?
It's the old dude from Texas.

1598
01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:37.480
He had a Lonestar belt buckle on and he started just telling me stories about

1599
01:34:37.481 --> 01:34:40.900
hunting for elk and hunting for this and that and bow hunting.

1600
01:34:40.901 --> 01:34:42.910
He does all kinds of hunting,
but he does a lot of bow hunters too.

1601
01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:44.740
And just that was the green light.

1602
01:34:44.741 --> 01:34:47.590
He just plopped down next to me and just started talking and we had like a half

1603
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:52.510
an hour conversation.
Well,
and nowadays,
you know that old school dude.

1604
01:34:52.511 --> 01:34:57.050
That's awesome.
Nowadays the young guys are the guys that seem,
I don't,

1605
01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:58.070
I can't,

1606
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.360
<v 2>I'm in communication with,</v>

1607
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.230
they're so passionate about new bows and technology.

1608
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:06.800
Like you mentioned like the unveiling of a new bow.
Like,

1609
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.280
so if you have a Hoyt that people are like,
what year is it?

1610
01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:14.540
It's like right us 2014 oh yeah,
you don't,

1611
01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:18.590
so you don't have a 2015 nitrogen turbo yet.
Huh?
And this is like,

1612
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:23.690
it's crazy.
These and so Hoyt and you know all these other companies,
biotech,

1613
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:24.950
they have this,

1614
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.910
you know it's going to come out on the 15th and they'll give teasers and people

1615
01:35:28.911 --> 01:35:32.720
are just on all these forums.
Trying to guess what's,

1616
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:36.240
what's going to be different with the new technology is going to be and it's,

1617
01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:41.060
it's just so fun and so people are so passionate about it.
It's a,

1618
01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.600
I don't know,
it's like the release of a new iPhone.
Oh totally.

1619
01:35:44.601 --> 01:35:47.560
It's really similar.
It's real assemble and you find out,
oh look at this,

1620
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:49.520
I got this new anti torquing technology.

1621
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:53.230
What is the new anti torquing technology?
What does that all about?
That's a,

1622
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:56.030
on the cable roller,
it's supposed to.

1623
01:35:56.690 --> 01:36:01.190
How that set up is it's going to help you tune your bow because there is no

1624
01:36:01.191 --> 01:36:03.050
torque in that one.
Normally when you,

1625
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:07.700
when you pull your string back and your cable,
there's a lot of tension,

1626
01:36:07.701 --> 01:36:10.690
a lot of torque right there.
Typically back in the old school days,

1627
01:36:10.691 --> 01:36:15.680
I would just kind of slide on a bar.
And now Hoyt has come up with this system,

1628
01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:19.650
the anti torquing technology where there's no torque on that and,

1629
01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.400
and how they've designed the riser is,
is like,

1630
01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:27.020
it's just helps all the tuning issues,
the performance of the bow,

1631
01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:29.030
that's the antique torquing is one part of it.

1632
01:36:29.031 --> 01:36:33.020
The riser design is another part of it.
All the little tweaks they make,

1633
01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:38.200
it's just making a s m suite or smoother shooting bow that tunes up quicker.

1634
01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.230
And what that does is you talked about your bear,

1635
01:36:42.850 --> 01:36:47.300
how that Arrow flew straight blew right through there for that to happen,

1636
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:51.470
excuse me,
is uh,
that Arrow has to be just flying perfect.

1637
01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:56.090
And all that plays into that and that's,
that's how you get those clean,

1638
01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.490
quick kills.
And if you're shooting targets,

1639
01:36:58.610 --> 01:37:00.590
that's how you get every Arrow in the X.

1640
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:04.400
And so it's all those little things like people will say,
actually,

1641
01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:07.120
I shot the bow and uh,
you know,

1642
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:12.130
speed wise it was a little bit slower than the carbon spider turbo is three feet

1643
01:37:13.251 --> 01:37:17.480
per second.
Slower.
But you look at the,
the brace height,

1644
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:21.800
which is a big part of why a bow is fast and why it's not the British side is

1645
01:37:21.801 --> 01:37:25.520
the distance between the string and the rifle,
the riser Izer,
right?

1646
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:28.280
So the taller that is the,

1647
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:30.920
the quicker that the Arrow is off the string.

1648
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.060
So that means as you as a shooter have less impact on it being imperfect.

1649
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:39.560
The shorter it is,
it's going to be on that string longer,
longer,
longer.

1650
01:37:39.561 --> 01:37:42.590
And then it finally comes off right when it gets close to your hand and that

1651
01:37:42.591 --> 01:37:47.090
riser there.
And so because it's propelled for longer,
it's going to be faster,

1652
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:51.380
but you also have more time to drop your bow arm or,

1653
01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:55.500
or do or flinch or do whatever risk,
torque or that.

1654
01:37:55.710 --> 01:38:00.090
And so it's generally a less accurate arrow.
So my,

1655
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:03.540
my new bow is a little slower,
but it's got a taller brace height.

1656
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:08.340
So meaning it's more forgiving.
Three feet is pretty nominal.

1657
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:12.330
Not that big a deal,
but it's so sweet shooting.
I mean,

1658
01:38:12.331 --> 01:38:14.580
I went down there and tuning a bow,

1659
01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.640
used to be this whole elongated process and it would take sometimes days to get

1660
01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:24.600
that thing shooting through paper.
Right.
And get the Arrow fly.
And Ryan is like,

1661
01:38:24.601 --> 01:38:26.430
is the Arrow under spine,
am I,

1662
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:32.390
am I talking my wrist is having my thumb behind my neck affecting all the stuff

1663
01:38:33.361 --> 01:38:38.190
now I go down there,
it was like two shots.
Perfect.
And you knew it was ready.

1664
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:39.110
Perfect.

1665
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:40.910
<v 1>Well you're an expert archer.
So I,</v>

1666
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.590
one of the things I've learned from watching your videos is I've seen your old

1667
01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.310
spider turbo and then you went from that to the carbon spider tour.

1668
01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.770
When she see the difference in the amount of feet per second,

1669
01:38:51.771 --> 01:38:53.630
how smooth it feels dead.

1670
01:38:53.631 --> 01:38:57.620
And you could see in your own videos the progression of the technology,

1671
01:38:57.621 --> 01:38:58.310
which is really kind of

1672
01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:03.140
<v 2>cool.
Yeah.
Uh,
what I've noticed,
you know,
even those old bows,
those,</v>

1673
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:08.350
those would kill those would probably get the job done probably 90% of the time.

1674
01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:10.950
But it's that,

1675
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:15.230
those little things I said that 10% that's going to make a difference,
you know,

1676
01:39:15.231 --> 01:39:19.520
is,
is it going to be a lethal shot or is going to be just a wound,

1677
01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.970
a flesh wound?
And so those little things.
So yeah,

1678
01:39:23.690 --> 01:39:28.690
before I've killed for 26 years and the Bose that I started with are night and

1679
01:39:30.051 --> 01:39:34.040
day different than the Bose now,
but still,
it's a primitive sport still.

1680
01:39:34.041 --> 01:39:37.460
It's very difficult still.
There's a lot of human

1681
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:41.000
influence on that Arrow and whether it's going to fly,

1682
01:39:41.001 --> 01:39:42.770
we're supposed to so you can still mess it up.

1683
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.450
One thing that I've noticed that I've,

1684
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:47.420
that's helped me more than anything is that long distance shooting.

1685
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:52.430
I shoot out a hundred yards all the time and we shot long distance up in Alberta

1686
01:39:52.431 --> 01:39:56.060
actually.
Um,
the guys want to do that because that's sort of what I'm known for.

1687
01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:59.800
And what that does is I'm not going to be out there should,

1688
01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:02.570
you didn't animals at 140 yards or anything like that.

1689
01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:07.850
But man at that slam dunk range of what I would consider slam dunk 30 40 yards,

1690
01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.020
I'm going to able to make that shot because technique wise,
I know I'm dialed in,

1691
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:16.160
I know my my whole week shooting money because it's tuned perfectly.

1692
01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.840
And so that's what's happened.
I mean I killed,
you know,
those bowls this year,

1693
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:24.170
one Arrow,
they were down in seconds.

1694
01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.310
Those are big 800 pound animals and it's just perfect.

1695
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:30.920
And that's,
you know,
that's what it's all about.

1696
01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:35.160
<v 1>And the discipline involved is so fascinating because it seems like such a</v>

1697
01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:38.430
straightforward thing.
Your arms out straight,
you pull the string back,

1698
01:40:38.431 --> 01:40:41.790
aim through sight and he let the Arrow go.
But meanwhile we're in camp,

1699
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.760
there's fucking 10 dudes in camp,
all of them bow hunters.

1700
01:40:45.090 --> 01:40:50.090
You are consistently outperforming all of us consistently nail and bulls eyes

1701
01:40:50.191 --> 01:40:52.920
over and over again.
And everybody's perplexed and puzzle how that,

1702
01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.280
what the fuck am I doing wrong?

1703
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.700
<v 3>Like what's the deer and the differences just inches,
inches here,
left,
right.</v>

1704
01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:02.970
But it's just the amount of time you put in and the focus and the discipline and

1705
01:41:03.011 --> 01:41:06.400
just,
just the,
the knowledge that you've accumulated after all these years.

1706
01:41:06.401 --> 01:41:09.580
And that's one of the things that's so attractive about it is that it's not

1707
01:41:09.581 --> 01:41:12.220
something that's easy.
I thought you're going to be attractive about me.

1708
01:41:12.221 --> 01:41:13.780
And I was like,
go right back to,

1709
01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.330
it's the fact that it's not easy is exciting.
You know,

1710
01:41:19.331 --> 01:41:20.500
the fact that man,

1711
01:41:20.501 --> 01:41:25.501
when you shoot a bullseye at 40 yards and it just sits right in there is so

1712
01:41:26.411 --> 01:41:31.060
satisfying.
Oh,
it feels so good.
Yeah,
it's weird.
It's like you would think like,

1713
01:41:31.061 --> 01:41:34.390
I've watched videos online now of archery competitions.
Yeah.

1714
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:37.570
But guys are just shooting at a piece of paper 40 yards away.

1715
01:41:37.571 --> 01:41:38.620
And when it goes in that bull's eye,

1716
01:41:38.630 --> 01:41:43.210
everybody cheers and it's this something really satisfying about it.
Dude,

1717
01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:47.200
you watch.
So on my youtube channel,
I don't know,

1718
01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:51.730
there's almost 3 million views on there,
which isn't that big a deal.

1719
01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:56.800
If I,
for Katy Perry for a bow hunting,
it's quite a few years.
But,

1720
01:41:56.890 --> 01:41:59.730
so I have a hundred and I don't know,
maybe 50 videos.

1721
01:41:59.731 --> 01:42:04.731
So if you go on there and you say most viewed out of all those videos and I've

1722
01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:08.770
got some cool stuff on there.
I had got bears,
dine,
water,

1723
01:42:08.771 --> 01:42:13.771
buffalo dying and l dying and you know it's a sheep are on cliffs,

1724
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.680
the most viewed or all shooting a bow.

1725
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:20.410
Just targets standing there shooting a bow.

1726
01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.730
Cause people who who bow hunt or even just people who do archery,

1727
01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.050
they want to see someone who's better at it than them doing it.
So they could go,

1728
01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:33.010
okay,
what's he doing here?
And going on maybe.
So yeah,
it's very,
I lie,

1729
01:42:33.011 --> 01:42:36.520
enjoy watching you shoot it.
And this is ridiculous.
I have my own fucking bow,

1730
01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:40.540
but I like watching you do it cause I'm old.
What's he doing right here?
Yeah,

1731
01:42:40.570 --> 01:42:42.670
it's different.
Well and I get a lot,

1732
01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:46.780
I had to turn the comments off a lot of a lot of the videos because so many

1733
01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:49.840
stupid comments that drove me crazy.
So I'm like,
I'll turn this,

1734
01:42:49.841 --> 01:42:53.470
turn off the comments.
But on the comments that I've left on with the equipment,

1735
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:58.360
it's people just,
they watch everything I do and they're like,
what side is that?

1736
01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:01.640
What rest is that?
Why is he moving his hand like that?
Well,

1737
01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:06.260
I mean it's just like you said,
studying and studying and studying and that's,

1738
01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:10.660
it's just,
to me it's just awesome that people care that much.
Yeah.

1739
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.140
And this is like,
we go back to this is what archery can do.
It can impact people,

1740
01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:20.250
give them something to think about and not obsess about weird negative stuff.

1741
01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:23.370
It's,

1742
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:28.030
they're thinking in their minds working about bow hunting and archery and how

1743
01:43:28.031 --> 01:43:30.160
they can be better.
And that's,
I like that.
And again,

1744
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:35.161
there is some sort of a zen meditative aspect to just shooting a bow into a

1745
01:43:36.281 --> 01:43:40.870
target.
And I recommended really highly to people that have zero desire to hunt,

1746
01:43:41.170 --> 01:43:45.850
just fine an archery range.
And if you can take a lesson,
take a lesson,

1747
01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:49.960
you know,
and get a bow figuring out how to set it up.
Maybe you know,

1748
01:43:49.961 --> 01:43:52.190
if there's a pro shop near you that's really good.
Someone

1749
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:56.950
<v 1>can help you,
man.
Just a fun,
fun way to spend time.
I,</v>

1750
01:43:56.990 --> 01:44:00.620
my kids do it,
man.
I got a six year old.
A four year old is shoot bows and arrows.

1751
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:04.870
<v 2>Yeah.
Oh,
kids love my daughter.
Oh,
we'll go out there and here's the,</v>

1752
01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:07.770
here's what's funny about shooting far.

1753
01:44:07.771 --> 01:44:12.240
You know like the popular ones like me shooting 140 or I think I shot a balloon

1754
01:44:12.241 --> 01:44:16.340
at like 227 yards or something like that.
But we,

1755
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:17.430
I take my daughter out there,

1756
01:44:17.431 --> 01:44:20.910
she's 10 she's got this little white recurve and so she's shooting,

1757
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:25.170
we had this shooting a 20 yards is a big bag and she's like,
dad,

1758
01:44:25.770 --> 01:44:29.580
how far is that bear?
I'm like,
I dunno.
It's like 70 yards.
She's like,

1759
01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:33.780
could I shoot at it?
I mean she was to shoot far too,
right?
Yeah.
She just,

1760
01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.200
you just want to know if you can hit it right and that's just,

1761
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:40.350
she's not thinking about hunting or doing anything.
She's thinking about,

1762
01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.350
she wants to see if that Arrow will hit that where she wants it to.

1763
01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:43.601
<v 1>Well,</v>

1764
01:44:43.601 --> 01:44:46.870
people who shoot a free throw want to know if they could shoot a three pointer.

1765
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:49.510
Yeah.
You know,
you want to know,
you want to back up a little.
All right,

1766
01:44:49.511 --> 01:44:51.880
let's try it.
Color.
Can you hit it back here?
You know,

1767
01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:56.080
that's what people are all about.
I mean,
that's part of what's wrong with us.

1768
01:44:57.370 --> 01:45:01.570
We constantly,
constantly pushed the boundaries.
More.
More is better.
Yeah.

1769
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:03.960
What are you thoughts on crossbows?
What do you think about crossing?

1770
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:08.150
<v 2>Well,
um,
to me,
I mean I've never even shot across bow,</v>

1771
01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:13.480
but what I know about them is you don't need to practice at all basically once

1772
01:45:14.991 --> 01:45:18.020
you get,
once it's cited in,
it's like a rifle.

1773
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:23.510
I don't like crossbows during bow season.
Uh,
I don't,

1774
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:27.320
if people want to use a crossbow,
that's fine.
I have nothing against crossbows.

1775
01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.530
I don't think they should be allowed in bow season because it's different.

1776
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.950
We talked about the discipline and the commitment and,
and everything.

1777
01:45:33.951 --> 01:45:36.530
You need to be proficient with a bow.
You don't need,

1778
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:38.000
you don't need that with a crossbow

1779
01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:41.020
<v 1>walking dead's got everybody crossbow happy.
Yeah.</v>

1780
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:44.430
That dude on the walking dead fucks everything up.
But that crossbow

1781
01:45:44.530 --> 01:45:47.340
<v 2>due to Darrell Darrell,</v>

1782
01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:52.110
imagine what he'd do with a mean kid shoots at crossbones.

1783
01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.280
It goes six inches in some rotten zombie.
Right.

1784
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:59.790
I'll play,
you would go through 10 rotten zombies.
Well,

1785
01:45:59.791 --> 01:46:03.410
do they have a lighter arrow?
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
Yeah,
because it's,

1786
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.070
it's shorter,
but the Arrow,

1787
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:09.300
the shaft is similar but it's half the length or I don't know what it is,

1788
01:46:09.301 --> 01:46:13.680
but it's,
and that's lighter,
so it's not carrying that energy,
that momentum.

1789
01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.690
<v 1>So they have a problem with like pass throughs and stuff like that with a like</v>

1790
01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:18.800
passing through an animal.

1791
01:46:18.801 --> 01:46:21.560
Is it more difficult with a crossbow because it's a lighter,

1792
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:26.450
<v 2>well,
the lighter towel.
Yeah.
I mean you get,
okay,
the whole thing with an Arrow,</v>

1793
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.110
the light or the Arrow,
the less kinetic energy you're going to have.
So,

1794
01:46:30.730 --> 01:46:33.710
and people will talk about,
well that's not momentum,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1795
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.920
But usually a kinetic energy or Arrow possesses the more penetration it's going

1796
01:46:40.511 --> 01:46:44.810
to get,
um,
to increase kinetic energy.
All you do is add weight.

1797
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:50.760
So your boat could be slower.
But if the arrows more kinetic energy,

1798
01:46:51.210 --> 01:46:54.540
so it's a heavier arrow going slower,
but there's more behind it.
Right.

1799
01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:58.170
So it's almost more important to have weight than it is to have,

1800
01:46:58.290 --> 01:47:00.170
but there's a point of diminishing returns,
right?
Yeah.

1801
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:04.320
That's way up at like 800 and some grains.
Oh really?
Which is a very,

1802
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:07.560
I've never even shot an arrow that heavy that what I used for,
uh,

1803
01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:12.240
what the water buffalo in Australia was a 650 grand in Arrow and that's heavy.

1804
01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.520
You know what we use for bears for 50.

1805
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:20.030
So the diminishing return point is over 800 grains and it 450 grains still

1806
01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:24.910
shooting 288 feet a second.
Yeah.

1807
01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.690
Which is for folks who don't know what that looks like,

1808
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:31.980
you don't even barely see the arrow.
Yeah.
So for make energy,

1809
01:47:31.981 --> 01:47:34.650
that's probably,
I think,
I know I did it.

1810
01:47:34.651 --> 01:47:39.340
It's like 80 some foot pounds,
kinetic energy with,

1811
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:44.730
and that doesn't mean anything to anybody other than it hits hard.
Shit's lethal.

1812
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:47.580
It's very lethal.
Especially you put them on tech,

1813
01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:52.710
you know the heads we use were Mantech broadheads razor sharp heads.
Yeah.

1814
01:47:52.711 --> 01:47:55.860
It's going to,
it's going to blow through there.
And like,
like I said,

1815
01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:59.700
we went through the animal and then so deep into a log that I couldn't get it

1816
01:47:59.701 --> 01:48:01.200
out.
I had a break off the tip.

1817
01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:04.500
You know what was shooting a bow like we talked about,

1818
01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:09.180
just the fascination behind it is when I was in Tanzania,
those guys,
you know,

1819
01:48:09.181 --> 01:48:13.740
the natives they had had,
who knows what type of Bose they've seen.

1820
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:18.740
So we're setting up Elian Bait there and had a like half a buffalo hanging and

1821
01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:23.550
I'd put a little yellow leaf there and I'd get back 40 yards.
Uh,
I want to see,

1822
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:27.780
you know,
if,
if,
if a lion was here,
where would my arrow hit?

1823
01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:30.240
So they'd be standing there.
I'd be standing back.

1824
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:34.110
We'd have the bait there at the leaf on it.
And I had Stan and everybody ready.

1825
01:48:34.111 --> 01:48:37.320
Yeah.
Everybody's ready.
So I'd draw back,
shoot,
you know,

1826
01:48:37.321 --> 01:48:40.740
hit the leaf and they would just be like big smiles on their face.

1827
01:48:40.741 --> 01:48:45.300
It's watching that Arrow just like,
couldn't believe that Arrow just whack.

1828
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.860
And it just,
it was,

1829
01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:50.530
they just want it to look at it and I'd give him the Arrow in the bow and they'd

1830
01:48:50.531 --> 01:48:53.940
just be holding it thinking like it was some like witchcraft.

1831
01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.610
So awesome.
They have traditional bows.
Did they make their nose?
They May.

1832
01:48:59.611 --> 01:49:02.880
I didn't see any,
you know,
they hunt themselves or did they,

1833
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:08.610
what did they do for food?
Um,
yeah,
they've,

1834
01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:12.420
you know,
uh,
see,
let me think.
Well,
you're talking about the one guy,

1835
01:49:12.421 --> 01:49:16.850
the poacher that had really made his own sort of muzzle loader.
Yeah.
Regular,

1836
01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:21.720
right?
Yeah.
Those guys obviously hot,
uh,
the guys in camp,

1837
01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:26.160
you know,
they would eat what,
what the hunters killed basically.
And then,
uh,

1838
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:27.480
but they've all hunted.

1839
01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:32.280
Some of them are like Rashidi who I mentioned,
he's a,

1840
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:34.860
what they call a tracker.
And so they can,

1841
01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:39.360
what they do is they look at the tracks of the animals and they can look at them

1842
01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:44.700
and they can tell you whether that track was from a few hours ago,

1843
01:49:45.150 --> 01:49:50.110
this morning,
last night or two days ago,
just by the track.
And I'm,

1844
01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:53.530
you know,
I've hunted a lot,
I've seen a lot of tracks,
but when I look,
I'm like,

1845
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:57.990
that's pretty fresh.
That's it.
That's it.
You know,

1846
01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:58.873
we're full clock.

1847
01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:03.700
They're aging that thing by the hour essentially.

1848
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:06.760
So that's what a tracker can do.
And then when you hit an animal,
if there's,

1849
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:10.150
if there's a blood trail,
um,
just,

1850
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:14.020
I learned so much from those guys,
you know,
and I would ask,

1851
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:19.030
what are you looking at?
What's telling you that that's,
you know,
this age,

1852
01:50:19.031 --> 01:50:22.270
you know,
and it's just grains of sand that has fallen off the edge.

1853
01:50:22.271 --> 01:50:25.660
Just things like that.
So,
uh,
you know,
I think they've,

1854
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:29.080
they've probably killed a lot less than they've hunted,
if that makes sense.

1855
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:33.130
And they eat lions.
They,
yeah,
they'll,

1856
01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:34.780
they'll eat what,

1857
01:50:34.781 --> 01:50:39.610
they won't eat hyenas basically the Buffalo,

1858
01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:40.600
I'm sure they'll eat,

1859
01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:44.410
but they'd rather use them for bait because they're just nasty.

1860
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.940
But definitely there's animals that they won't eat.
Um,
I'm not sure.

1861
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:50.920
I couldn't tell you honestly what,

1862
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:55.750
how they feel about lions because the,
like I said,

1863
01:50:55.751 --> 01:51:00.520
they're so revered over there.
It's just like all anybody could think of is,

1864
01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:02.290
you know,
we're hunting a lot of different things,

1865
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:05.950
but symbol was always the topic.

1866
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:10.930
It was where Simba.
And so that was what we were after.
And I don't really,

1867
01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:14.290
we never killed one,
so I don't really know what they would do.

1868
01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.060
Is that because they fear of those lines cause those lines we'll take people out

1869
01:51:19.061 --> 01:51:22.030
and they do on a regular basis.
They're right.
They will.
It's just like there's,

1870
01:51:22.031 --> 01:51:25.210
I've heard,
I heard stories from him over there about,
um,

1871
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.170
the lions would come into villages and if you didn't act afraid of 'em,

1872
01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:36.370
they wouldn't hurt you that they,
they told stories like this.

1873
01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.940
So we'll just walk through the village and the kids,
the kids,

1874
01:51:40.690 --> 01:51:45.370
the kids wouldn't act afraid of them.
So the kids could be around them and watts.

1875
01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:50.080
Yeah.
And kids go play with the lines.
You had to wash the dishes.
Yeah.
Um,

1876
01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:53.740
wow.
It's,
I dunno.
In lions are different.

1877
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:58.850
Lions are so dominant.
I mean I,

1878
01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:00.311
let's see,

1879
01:52:00.311 --> 01:52:05.311
I stocked to within 60 is 68 or 69 yards and I had a big male lion,

1880
01:52:06.881 --> 01:52:09.460
a shooter and it was quartering to me.

1881
01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:13.150
Obviously I just had my bow with a rifle would have been done deal.

1882
01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:18.210
He was a six year old mature to kind of lie and we wanted to kill as a mentioned

1883
01:52:18.670 --> 01:52:21.580
and I didn't have the right angle in the shot so I wasn't going to take it.

1884
01:52:21.581 --> 01:52:25.810
So I ended up,
I didn't shoot,
he got in the brush,
I got 50 yards from him,

1885
01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:28.990
but he knew I was there the whole time.

1886
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:33.850
So they're not like a deer and elk,
there's just going to take off.

1887
01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:37.870
They're like,
the thing about it is if you,

1888
01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:41.530
if you get too close and you make that shot with an Arrow,

1889
01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:46.070
he's probably going to get you before he's dead.
You know what I mean?

1890
01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:51.500
<v 3>And they cut though.
You can look at all the videos you want wounded.</v>

1891
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:56.450
They'll come hard a lot of times at Uw,
at whoever,

1892
01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:00.200
at whatever wounded them.
So what was your plan for that?
No plan.

1893
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:03.650
I don't know.
It's um,

1894
01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:07.700
that seems like flawed.
Yeah,

1895
01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.840
I know it's a,
you know,
Ryan,
Ryan,
um,

1896
01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.120
he was there behind me and he had,
he had a four,
16,

1897
01:53:17.121 --> 01:53:21.530
which is a big gun and uh,
I trust him.
So that's the plan.

1898
01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:26.360
I wasn't her,
I didn't ever care about the plan to me.
I was never like,

1899
01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:28.180
are you okay?
You gotta you know,
I,

1900
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:33.490
I never would look one time what the plan was or verify there was a plan to me.

1901
01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:37.480
I don't even want to say,
well,

1902
01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:40.270
my mind set is because people just probably just called bs.

1903
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:44.660
I'm not going to say no,
I'm not going to say month.
But anyway,
it's ridiculous.

1904
01:53:44.661 --> 01:53:46.730
You can't say you're not going to say it and then that's it.
No,

1905
01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:50.560
that's a little kids.
Do they tried to trick other kids to tell her no.

1906
01:53:50.561 --> 01:53:54.170
When little kids do,
as I say,
I'm not going to tell you and then they don't.

1907
01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:56.870
Then they didn't.
They tell you no.
Then they tell you though,

1908
01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:59.570
when they get called out,
they'll be like,
okay,
but don't tell anybody.

1909
01:53:59.571 --> 01:54:01.070
I'm telling you me,
you can't say,

1910
01:54:01.071 --> 01:54:04.310
I'm not going to tell you because you'd call bs.
People won't call Bs.

1911
01:54:04.311 --> 01:54:07.610
Just speak your mind.
You won't tell anybody.
I won't tell anybody.

1912
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:12.200
I won't even repeat it.
It will never leave this room.
Okay?

1913
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:17.500
My stupid light thought process is if I go there,

1914
01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:23.750
I'm not worried about the backup plan or being covered or anything like that.

1915
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:27.590
If I tried to kill the line,
but instead it kills me.
That's just the way it goes.

1916
01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:31.130
So you have this mindset you like,
this is just,

1917
01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:35.090
you're excepted reality of life.
That's it.
I mean it.

1918
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:39.830
I'm trying to kill it.
If I lose and I'm on the other end of that,

1919
01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.280
this is where it goes.

1920
01:54:42.281 --> 01:54:46.280
That's like some intense native American talking out loud Josie Wales type shit

1921
01:54:46.290 --> 01:54:50.300
done.
No words of life.
People are probably just say,
oh he's,

1922
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:54.620
he's full of crap this,
you know,
but I believe you,

1923
01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:57.080
I believe you're crazy enough to actually have that mindset.

1924
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:59.630
You of saw it bear hunting.

1925
01:54:59.631 --> 01:55:04.631
I guess a couple of times he walked down some barriers and scared him off you.

1926
01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:09.080
You definitely,
that's the whole thing about the hunting on the ground.

1927
01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:12.080
Nobody's doing that.
Very few people were hunting bears on the ground.

1928
01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:13.760
But you had that whole camp doing it.

1929
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:15.200
There's a lot of guys who were doing it there.

1930
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:19.340
Well the thing with the bears and in you saw it is there's like this,

1931
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:23.150
there's like this line.
And so what they do is they'll,

1932
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:27.560
they'll stay out there at 15 yards or whatever and we're there and they know

1933
01:55:27.561 --> 01:55:28.670
we're there and there's like,

1934
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:32.240
but then they sort of come a little closer and then they'll go back and then

1935
01:55:32.241 --> 01:55:36.350
they sort of come a little closer and then pretty soon there's this line that

1936
01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:39.980
at,
I'm thinking once they get there,

1937
01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:44.070
they're probably just going to come because you've let them get

1938
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.170
<v 2>there.
It's like you have to have a boundary.</v>

1939
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:49.730
So as you noticed on those bear when they would get,
I don't,

1940
01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:51.510
I can't remember what,
maybe it was five yards,

1941
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.910
but I would stand up and I'd be like,
no,

1942
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:57.300
like that with in holding the knife or whatever and that,

1943
01:55:57.301 --> 01:56:01.020
because once they're past that line is what are you going to do?

1944
01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:02.940
You can't let them get there.

1945
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:07.740
<v 1>That's the video.
We'll,
we'll play the video of you shooting this a bear,</v>

1946
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.750
the one that caused all the controversy,

1947
01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:14.000
but one of the things that's as shocking about it is not just the,

1948
01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:18.060
the Arrow going through the bear,
it's how fast the bear runs.

1949
01:56:18.450 --> 01:56:22.560
Once it gets hit,
it's like,
Geez,
that's like some Usain Bolt Shit.
Yeah,

1950
01:56:23.610 --> 01:56:27.720
no,
they can move,
man.
If they want to come,

1951
01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:32.790
we're in trouble.
But the bait thing is the,
the big controversy.

1952
01:56:32.791 --> 01:56:36.330
And you explained very clearly like why it's important because you have to

1953
01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:40.620
really identify the sex of the animal and how old the animal is.

1954
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.420
But the weird thing is that people don't have any problem with using bait for

1955
01:56:45.421 --> 01:56:46.710
fish.
No.

1956
01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:50.670
And people don't have any problem with people going trophy fish hunting.

1957
01:56:50.671 --> 01:56:55.140
I caught a Marlin,
you know how many people eat Marlin's?
A few Hawaiian folks,

1958
01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:57.510
they'll eat them.
Apparently.
Marlin's not that bad.

1959
01:56:57.511 --> 01:57:02.400
It's just people think it's bad.
Yeah.
I killed a Marlin.

1960
01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:06.000
I caught a Marlin long time ago and uh,
they said they were going to smoke it.

1961
01:57:06.001 --> 01:57:08.640
The guys who own the boat,
they have a weird thing in Hawaii.

1962
01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.390
Like they'll give you some of the fish,
but you know,
they take most of the fish,

1963
01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:14.730
you know,
some sort of a weird,

1964
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:18.300
unless you like make some sort of a previous arrangement because it's very

1965
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:21.480
valuable to them,
you know.
But uh,
you know,
like,
uh,
Marlin,

1966
01:57:21.481 --> 01:57:25.370
like mine was about 70 pounds wasn't a big one,
but a 70 pound Marlin.

1967
01:57:25.371 --> 01:57:28.260
It's probably worth quite a bit of money and it's a lot of meat,
you know,

1968
01:57:28.261 --> 01:57:32.130
the smoke it,
but nobody has a problem with that.
But if you,

1969
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.550
if you go and take some sort of an animal,

1970
01:57:35.551 --> 01:57:38.190
it's like we differentiate between a fish and an animal.

1971
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:43.080
If you take a trip to Africa because you want to catch some exotic fish and eat

1972
01:57:43.081 --> 01:57:46.290
it on the boat,
nobody has any problem with that and like,
oh you did you eat it.

1973
01:57:46.291 --> 01:57:47.220
Yeah,
it was delicious.

1974
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:50.430
But if you go and you say one went to Africa and shot a kudu and ate it,

1975
01:57:50.431 --> 01:57:52.680
like why the fuck would you go there and shoot a kudu?

1976
01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:55.530
Like you're not doing that for food.
You're not bringing it home to fill you,

1977
01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:56.290
feed your family.

1978
01:57:56.290 --> 01:58:01.290
They have like very rigid ideas about what you should and shouldn't do with a

1979
01:58:01.561 --> 01:58:05.580
mammal as opposed to what you should and shouldn't do with a fish.

1980
01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:06.930
Like look at these fucking,

1981
01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:11.960
these swamp people shows where they go and they're shooting 500 fucking

1982
01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:15.570
alligator a season.
They have fun.
They don't eat one of them.

1983
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.300
They're not eating any of them.
Yeah,

1984
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:22.090
they're just purely using the skins skins.
It's fine.
It's,

1985
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:25.710
yeah,
for whatever reason.
Cause it's a dinosaur.
Nobody gives a shit.
Yeah.
He,

1986
01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:30.090
while alligators like some of the highest protein,
lowest fat,

1987
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:33.630
lowest cholesterol meat you can get,
like it's really good for you.

1988
01:58:33.631 --> 01:58:37.150
And it's just wasting just boats full of alligator.
Yeah.

1989
01:58:37.290 --> 01:58:39.030
I mean I don't know some,
maybe some of them eat them.

1990
01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:43.040
<v 2>Yeah,
probably.
But uh,
you know,
and it's,
yeah,</v>

1991
01:58:43.450 --> 01:58:44.920
I guess when you talk about baiting,

1992
01:58:45.130 --> 01:58:48.550
when deer coming into an agricultural type setting,

1993
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:52.330
that's bay tacit bake cause you're setting up on a trail they like to use to get

1994
01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:54.040
there or if you're,

1995
01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:58.770
a lot of people hunt antelope and they're coming to water [inaudible] there

1996
01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.900
you're setting up basically waters the bait.
Yeah.

1997
01:59:02.170 --> 01:59:06.910
So not everything fits in a perfect box is I think,
you know,

1998
01:59:07.330 --> 01:59:09.940
I'm not saying I'm not guilty of it either.
But uh,

1999
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:12.880
I mean with hunting especially,
you know,

2000
01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:15.150
<v 1>well I can tell you when I first started hunting,</v>

2001
01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:18.330
one of the things that I said I wouldn't do is I would never bait.
I wouldn't,

2002
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:20.220
I wouldn't do that and I didn't want you to bury there.

2003
01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:21.420
Those two things I didn't want to do.

2004
01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:24.750
Now I have no problem with it because I became educated sell to the devil.

2005
01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:28.320
That too,
I became educated will show the video.
Now,
most people would get a,

2006
01:59:28.330 --> 01:59:32.250
this is,
this is the video,
they got everybody mad at me and this is,
uh,
the,

2007
01:59:32.251 --> 01:59:35.930
the website is living the dream promotions and this is a,

2008
01:59:35.931 --> 01:59:39.600
our friends John and Jen up a up there in Canada.
And uh,

2009
01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.900
was this on my youtube?
Yeah,
yeah,

2010
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:46.980
<v 0>yeah.
Shot is only six or seven yards,</v>

2011
01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:50.040
but I always take a practice shot.
So I have the target out there.

2012
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:55.050
It's like a Godzilla movie.
My mouth isn't matched to shot.
Oh,
is it off?

2013
01:59:55.710 --> 01:59:59.670
I've seen crazy things happen a little bit.
A little bit too.

2014
01:59:59.671 --> 02:00:02.650
People see that bear crack back there.
Yeah.

2015
02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:03.431
<v 1>Bear crack.</v>

2016
02:00:03.431 --> 02:00:08.431
Is this a mixture of marshmallows and gelatin and all sorts of smelly things

2017
02:00:08.771 --> 02:00:12.130
that cam heats up so that the bear smell it

2018
02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:15.990
<v 2>so that that target,
I'm shooting at us seven yards,
six or seven yard likes that,</v>

2019
02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:19.920
like I said,
I just want to have that confidence that when a bear comes in,

2020
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:21.360
I'm going to make that shot.

2021
02:00:21.361 --> 02:00:26.280
So even though it's a slam dunk chip shot with bow hunting,

2022
02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:29.410
there's no such thing.
And even though you've been doing this,
your whole lot.

2023
02:00:29.411 --> 02:00:31.860
So here,
look at this size of this fucking bear.
Yeah.

2024
02:00:31.861 --> 02:00:36.030
So that's me back there in the back wash the Arrow go through it.

2025
02:00:36.031 --> 02:00:36.960
This is where it's crazy.

2026
02:00:41.490 --> 02:00:46.320
Oh fast.
That thing moves and that sound.
But yeah,

2027
02:00:46.321 --> 02:00:48.690
so if it would have just veered to the,
there I am,

2028
02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:53.610
veered to the right instead of the left then it would have ran you over.
Yeah.

2029
02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:57.010
<v 1>Yeah.
I didn't even know you were there or if it did know you were there,</v>

2030
02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.040
it wouldn't have cared.
It was running full speed

2031
02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:03.140
<v 2>Brent.
Yeah,
it's a no,
at that time it was just,</v>

2032
02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:08.390
you know,
that was a lethal arrow.
It was just going to,
is basically going to die,

2033
02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.790
you know.
So what happens when an Arrow hits like that?

2034
02:01:10.791 --> 02:01:15.140
His blood pressure's dropping quickly.
It's just like your bears,

2035
02:01:15.141 --> 02:01:18.980
you mean dead in seconds.
They are affected immediately.

2036
02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:22.070
And I mean even,
you know,
you hear about people who,

2037
02:01:22.071 --> 02:01:24.800
they cut their for moral artery so they,
they do something,

2038
02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:28.550
cut something in their leg,
30 seconds.
Yeah.

2039
02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:32.480
When that happens is her blood pressure just drops.
And so that,

2040
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:35.510
that bear at that point is not thinking about,
oh,

2041
02:01:35.511 --> 02:01:39.110
I'm going to identify what did that and attack it.
It's just like,

2042
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:44.330
it's over basically that fast,
you know,
death sprint.
Yeah.
Yup.
I hear,

2043
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:46.970
I heard a guy recently got killed by a beaver,

2044
02:01:46.971 --> 02:01:50.490
a beaver bid his thigh and severed his film,
or odd or,
yeah.

2045
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:55.460
Nothing nuts that can happen.
Fucking beaver took a dude out.
Yeah,
you can.
Yeah.

2046
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:57.830
You know,
that's,
that's a thing with,
uh,

2047
02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:00.920
with archery as opposed to guns,
you know,

2048
02:02:00.921 --> 02:02:04.070
and I had a little video the other day on my website or,

2049
02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:08.090
or I mean on youtube and it was just a,
you know,

2050
02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:10.210
an Arrow kills by hemorrhage,
uh,

2051
02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:15.110
just by cutting flesh and Oregon's and a rifle kills by shock generally.

2052
02:02:15.111 --> 02:02:15.944
And generally the,

2053
02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:18.860
if you hit him good with the rifle and breaking down you hip bone or whatever

2054
02:02:18.861 --> 02:02:23.150
else,
it's pretty,
it's pretty grizzly type thing.
But it's effective.

2055
02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:27.380
They're down.
An Arrow going through is more like,

2056
02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:30.540
they're not sure what happened.
Blood pressure drop in.

2057
02:02:30.541 --> 02:02:33.830
They don't necessarily feel that pain,
so to speak.
Um,

2058
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:38.600
and they're dead quickly.
But two totally different things.

2059
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:43.750
And what that was is I had shot a bull elk and Utah and I wasn't 100% shirt.

2060
02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:47.630
Certain of the shot I was hoping it was in the heart is a little lower than I

2061
02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:50.570
had wanted.
I wanted to shoot for the lungs,

2062
02:02:50.571 --> 02:02:54.770
which is a little higher up on the body.
I hit low.
Um,
just,

2063
02:02:54.771 --> 02:02:58.550
I made an error hit little lower than I wanted and it was hoping for the heart

2064
02:02:58.551 --> 02:03:01.190
and it was just kind of that process.
But we're in that video.

2065
02:03:01.191 --> 02:03:04.820
I explained the difference between Boeing rifle and,
and um,
you know,

2066
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:09.850
you see it right there and wouldn't one thing when I was hunting Cape Buffalo in

2067
02:03:11.001 --> 02:03:13.160
Tanzania,
I shot this big,

2068
02:03:13.161 --> 02:03:17.330
the biggest bull in the herd that other animals did nothing.
He did nothing.

2069
02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:23.110
You couldn't tell anything happened other than he was dead pretty soon.
Wow.

2070
02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:28.160
Nobody ran nobody,
no excitement.
And Ryan who is with me at that time,

2071
02:03:28.161 --> 02:03:28.820
he's like,

2072
02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:33.820
I like bullied a lot better because a rifle goes off and you got a stampede and

2073
02:03:34.341 --> 02:03:37.280
then that bowl that you had just shot,
it's just like,
it's,

2074
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:41.850
it knows something serious is going on.
And those bulls are,
you know,

2075
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:45.500
they call them black death.
They're very dangerous.
So once they're injured,

2076
02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:49.700
even with rifles,
they use a multiple times.
I mean,

2077
02:03:49.701 --> 02:03:54.080
those things are so tough and so full of testosterone,
um,

2078
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:57.230
1800 pounds of just solid muscle.

2079
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:59.780
But what they do is they go and what they call the tall grass,

2080
02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:03.650
which is about 10 foot high grass.
And so you're on blood.

2081
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:08.830
And those buffalo will go in there and do a little button hook and as your blood

2082
02:04:09.171 --> 02:04:12.890
trailing them,
if they're not mortally wounded,
like dead,
dead,

2083
02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:15.950
you'll be trailing at that a blood trail.

2084
02:04:15.951 --> 02:04:18.080
And because they did that button hooked,
they're sitting there waiting,

2085
02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:22.490
they'll just pound you.
And so they're really,
they kill,

2086
02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:27.020
they kill people every year in Africa,
a Cape Buffalo do.
And,
uh,

2087
02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.390
it's,
you know,
tough animals.
But with the bow,
uh,

2088
02:04:33.230 --> 02:04:37.190
we,
you know,
I'm not saying it was an easy kill because a,
there's,

2089
02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:41.910
they're very tough,
but it was way less dramatic way.

2090
02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:46.290
Everything was calm.
It was just,
I dunno,
is much different than a rifle.

2091
02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.230
Did you bring both of your bows over there and you bring the 90 pound and the 80

2092
02:04:49.231 --> 02:04:52.470
pound one?
I did,
yeah.
Did you shoot the buffalo with the 90?

2093
02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:55.190
I actually shot it with the 80.
Really because,
uh,

2094
02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:57.840
I did a penetration test on a,

2095
02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:02.040
on a hippo when one of the guys I was with killed a hippo there.
So I'm like,
hey,

2096
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:06.120
how often do you ever get a chance to shoot an Arrow into a hippo 5,000 pound

2097
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:06.690
hippo?

2098
02:05:06.690 --> 02:05:11.690
So I shot both those Bose into the hippo and actually the 80 pound carbon spider

2099
02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:14.430
arrow penetrated.

2100
02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:20.130
Neither one of them did a good job because there's big albums.
They're set up.

2101
02:05:20.210 --> 02:05:24.090
The setup wasn't conducive to hunting a 5,000 pound animal.

2102
02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:26.250
I would need a cutting tip.
Broadhead,

2103
02:05:26.251 --> 02:05:30.750
not the lock on the [inaudible] car has a cone tip sent or chiseled tip.

2104
02:05:31.110 --> 02:05:34.680
And so that has to push through until you get to the blades and you need a

2105
02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:35.730
thousand green Arrow with,

2106
02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:40.320
with a two blade broad head that doesn't have to open that hole before it gets

2107
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:45.300
in.
So the point is neither one was conducive to killing a hippo.

2108
02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:49.560
But I measure penetration and the carbon spider with the smaller diameter

2109
02:05:49.561 --> 02:05:54.561
injection shaft that we shoot from Easton penetrated as much as that the heavier

2110
02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:59.790
a full metal jacket,
dangerous game shaft.
And so I decided,
well,

2111
02:05:59.791 --> 02:06:03.050
I'm just going to go with the carbon spider because I had more,
more um,

2112
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:05.640
confidence in it at longer range.

2113
02:06:05.641 --> 02:06:09.750
And those animals were so difficult to get up on because they're living with

2114
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:14.280
amongst hyenas and lions and they're hunted every single day.

2115
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:18.750
And lots of lions there.
I mean,
we saw,
we probably saw,

2116
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:23.640
I'm trying to think at least 10 lions I would thank,
and so it was like those,

2117
02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:27.180
and you,
you don't see all the lions.
So I mean,
they're hunted a lot.

2118
02:06:27.181 --> 02:06:29.100
So I was having a hard time getting close.

2119
02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:33.900
So I ended up killing that my buffalo at 62 yards with the carbon spiders 80

2120
02:06:33.901 --> 02:06:35.730
pound bow.
So the,
the,

2121
02:06:35.731 --> 02:06:38.540
the thinner diameter made a difference in the front of diamond.

2122
02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:43.500
Oh the Arrow does that plays a part as well as the weight?
Yeah.
Cause uh,

2123
02:06:43.590 --> 02:06:46.320
the thinner diameter as opposed to a thicker diameter shaft,

2124
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:47.970
that's just less surface area.

2125
02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:52.500
So the less surfacer dragging through the wound channel,
um,

2126
02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:55.440
you're going to penetrate more.
What was your favorite animal?

2127
02:06:55.450 --> 02:06:59.490
The hunting out for go?
Um,

2128
02:07:00.650 --> 02:07:04.890
was it the kudu cause he ate it.
No,
now the,
that was cool.

2129
02:07:04.891 --> 02:07:08.910
I mean I it a big bowl,
54 orange bowl.
They had never killed a kudu.

2130
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:13.560
And the fact most people kill anything over there with the bow is that water

2131
02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:16.310
when you're talking 54 inches,
you're talking about the length of the horns?
Yeah,

2132
02:07:17.230 --> 02:07:21.210
there's a spiral horns.
So you measured that spiral horn and it's 54 inches.

2133
02:07:21.450 --> 02:07:23.880
But most of the,
if anybody's killing anything with the bow,

2134
02:07:23.881 --> 02:07:28.260
it's usually at water.
And so I didn't kill anything at water.
I,
uh,

2135
02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.110
I spawns docked and Kudu,

2136
02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:34.190
they call them the gray ghost over there are their vision,
their antelope.

2137
02:07:34.191 --> 02:07:36.670
So they're like antelope here in regard to vision,

2138
02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:38.950
but they're tall so they can see over everything.

2139
02:07:38.951 --> 02:07:43.270
They're there as tall as an elk and uh,
they can see very well.

2140
02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:46.780
People just don't kill him.
Spawn stock with the bow.
This is a special,

2141
02:07:46.781 --> 02:07:50.530
Kale is a 64 yards.
But my,

2142
02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:54.400
I think my favorite probably,
I mean I want her to lion.
I didn't get one.

2143
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:58.010
The pursuit of the lion was a memorable,
um,

2144
02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:00.010
probably the Cape Buffalo does because the,

2145
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.430
the notoriety it has as being black death.

2146
02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:07.090
It's one of what people term the Big Five of Africa,

2147
02:08:07.091 --> 02:08:11.170
which is a five most dangerous animals of Africa,
an elephant,
um,

2148
02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:15.790
cape buffaloes in their lion,
leopard and a rhino.

2149
02:08:16.210 --> 02:08:17.440
And so that's the big five.

2150
02:08:17.441 --> 02:08:22.441
So to kill one of the big five with a bow spawn stock in a place that had never

2151
02:08:23.681 --> 02:08:28.630
been done.
Very special.
But what's your goals are at right now?
Like,

2152
02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:32.260
do you have any other places that you really want to go and hunt?
Like Africa,

2153
02:08:33.370 --> 02:08:35.360
I want to get lion.
I still want to get a lion.

2154
02:08:35.690 --> 02:08:38.800
Just some weird thing you got in the back of your head about a line.
Yeah,

2155
02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:43.420
I dunno.
Why just it just the test.
I don't know why.
I just want to,

2156
02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:46.890
I never even thought about it up until the,

2157
02:08:47.110 --> 02:08:51.550
it's been traveling and doing more and,
and uh,
I dunno.

2158
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:54.520
So then I got it in my head and once I get something in my head,

2159
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:59.290
it's just what I want to do.
But really,
and I've said this before,

2160
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:04.990
I don't,
I mean I don't long to hunt anything.
I don't need to hunt any.

2161
02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:08.410
If I could hunt elk every year,
I'm going to be satisfied.

2162
02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:11.110
I love being in the mountains.
I love bull elk.

2163
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:15.400
I love the challenge of trying to get in close on a big bowl and make a perfect

2164
02:09:15.401 --> 02:09:19.210
shot.
And that's,
if that's all I ever did,
that's enough for me.

2165
02:09:19.570 --> 02:09:24.490
But you've got weird things like you won't hunt Turkey.
No.
Is that weird?
Yeah,

2166
02:09:24.491 --> 02:09:29.290
it's weird.
Stephen.
No loves Turkey hunting.
Yeah.
It's funny to hear you.

2167
02:09:29.291 --> 02:09:33.990
Like the last thing I want to do is go Turkey hunting.
Well,
you know,

2168
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.410
I've never killed a Turkey and then,
uh,
you know,
in,

2169
02:09:37.411 --> 02:09:41.700
in out west Turkey hunting just has never had the,

2170
02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:44.800
the draw that it has in the south and the east.

2171
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:48.850
It's just people live for Turkey hunting back there out west is just like nobody

2172
02:09:48.851 --> 02:09:52.120
even ever hunted them cause we had,
we had deer,
elk bear,

2173
02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:55.660
we have all this big cool stuff,
predators,

2174
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:59.380
big game animals to hunt.
And so Turkey was like,

2175
02:09:59.381 --> 02:10:00.780
why would you waste your time to county?

2176
02:10:00.810 --> 02:10:03.340
So that's sort of still my mindset just from that.

2177
02:10:03.341 --> 02:10:07.900
I guess Turkey's delicious though.
Yeah,
that's fine.
That's just fine.
Is Fine.

2178
02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:11.320
Wild Turkeys supposed to be better,
right than domestic Turkey.

2179
02:10:11.321 --> 02:10:15.880
It's a more darker meat.
Um,
it might be healthier.
It's probably not.

2180
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:19.900
I like white meat personally.
Yeah.
And it's probably not going to be,

2181
02:10:19.901 --> 02:10:22.570
it's going to be,
I would assume tougher.

2182
02:10:23.530 --> 02:10:27.010
I don't even know if I've eaten wild Turkey,
but uh,
you know,

2183
02:10:27.011 --> 02:10:29.980
back east where basically all they are than the south.

2184
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:33.830
All they have is deer in the fall and Turkey and the spring.
Yeah.
People were,

2185
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:36.650
<v 3>they want to hunt.
So that's what they're going to do.</v>

2186
02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:40.190
You don't think it's just because they enjoy Turkey?
No,

2187
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:44.780
I'm telling you,
you need to get with Rinella.
He loves Turkey hunting.

2188
02:10:44.781 --> 02:10:47.670
That dude loves it.
I think they,
and they always say that,
you know,

2189
02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:51.500
Turkey hunting is just like elk,
Connie.
It's just like Al [inaudible].

2190
02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.270
You're calling them in,
your come in and it's just like a bull coming in.

2191
02:10:56.540 --> 02:11:01.250
I'm like,
well yeah,
it's just like elk hunting except you can't kill a bowl.

2192
02:11:01.610 --> 02:11:05.050
So it's not like yell cutting.
Yeah,
it was.
Well it can't be like,
oh Connie,

2193
02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:06.590
you're dealing with a little skiddish bird.

2194
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:11.570
They say the only difference they say elk or a book is like a 700 pound Turkey.

2195
02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:17.150
Well,
Turkeys,
like what's a big Turkey?
Like 30 pounds or something.
Yeah.
And yeah,

2196
02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:21.800
so what I say,
I'll,
you know,
Turkey hunters out there like,
hey,

2197
02:11:21.801 --> 02:11:24.650
if you're passionate about it,
it's awesome.
But what I always have said is,

2198
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:27.720
you know the best thing that's going to happen on a Turkey hunter's you'll kill

2199
02:11:27.721 --> 02:11:31.280
or kill a Turkey and that's not that good.
What about like bird hunting?

2200
02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:34.730
Duck hunting,
pheasant hunting and that kind of stuff?
I've killed one pheasant.

2201
02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:39.110
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was the only bird bird of every kid you saw about big animals.

2202
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:43.070
Yeah,
and I,
like I said,
I'm not judging anybody.
That's just me.

2203
02:11:43.130 --> 02:11:45.350
Of course he judging people when they're not.
When you're not judging them.

2204
02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:47.180
I'm going to talk off air folks.

2205
02:11:47.181 --> 02:11:51.520
He's going to judge the shit out of Turkey and duck and pheasant hunting

2206
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:56.480
assholes and now if the those guys in the spring,

2207
02:11:56.481 --> 02:12:00.230
if they can't go home bear like I do hunt Turkey.
It's awesome.
Good job.

2208
02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:05.020
<v 1>The thing about bird hunting,
it seems fun is the whole dog thing,
like the dogs,</v>

2209
02:12:05.021 --> 02:12:08.200
like flush them out like when a dog points and then the,

2210
02:12:08.230 --> 02:12:10.600
the pheasants flying in the air and they blast amount of sky.

2211
02:12:10.601 --> 02:12:11.710
That looks like it would be exciting.

2212
02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:15.510
<v 3>Yeah,
I bet it would be.
I know people,
you know,
that's a whole thing.</v>

2213
02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:20.170
Just like a hunting bear with dogs is they have that connection,

2214
02:12:20.190 --> 02:12:23.040
the training with the dog.
And that's the same thing with the Bert.

2215
02:12:23.070 --> 02:12:26.940
I know people who have bird dogs and it's just like those dogs are their

2216
02:12:26.941 --> 02:12:31.830
partners and I totally risk,
I've been,
I've been on a,
I did one dog,

2217
02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:36.810
a hunt for bear and the hounds are amazing.

2218
02:12:36.811 --> 02:12:40.270
And then the hounds men are just does an art.
Yeah.

2219
02:12:40.271 --> 02:12:44.100
That's a totally different experience.
It's like you have,
like you said,
partners.

2220
02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:46.340
Yeah.
Those are your buddies.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2221
02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:49.410
There's a lot of mountain lion hunting if they did with dogs.
Right?
Yeah.

2222
02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:51.360
I haven't done that either.
But I'd like to.

2223
02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:55.470
<v 1>California,
we've got some crazy laws when it comes to hunting.</v>

2224
02:12:55.471 --> 02:12:57.180
And when I say crazy,

2225
02:12:57.210 --> 02:13:02.210
it's because they're not designed by people who are a wildlife specialist.

2226
02:13:02.491 --> 02:13:07.110
They're designed by people who are more animal rights,
uh,
people.
It's,
it's like,

2227
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:09.180
instead of the Department of fish and game,

2228
02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:12.360
they call it the department of fish and wildlife and their,

2229
02:13:12.450 --> 02:13:14.730
their regulations about hunting,

2230
02:13:14.731 --> 02:13:19.440
they've completely removed hunting for mountain mines and hunting for bears.

2231
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:20.671
The bear hunting.

2232
02:13:20.671 --> 02:13:23.670
Now you can't do with dogs and if you can't do it with dogs and he can't do it

2233
02:13:23.671 --> 02:13:28.050
with Bait,
good luck.
Yeah.
You essentially have banned hunting.
Yeah,

2234
02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:31.920
and people don't.
Th this idea baiting

2235
02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:36.930
<v 4>is offensive to some people and because of what we talked about earlier and the</v>

2236
02:13:36.931 --> 02:13:41.130
idea of using dogs is equally offensive to some people because you're using an

2237
02:13:41.131 --> 02:13:44.520
animal and sticking it on an animal.
It seems sort of like a barbaric thing,

2238
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:48.790
but that is really the only way to effectively hunt these animals in,

2239
02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:51.750
in the type of terrain that we have here in California.
So because of that,

2240
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:56.070
it's a ton of bear and a ton of mountain mine and especially the mountain lion

2241
02:13:56.071 --> 02:13:57.780
as a kid was just attacked and Cupertino.

2242
02:13:57.781 --> 02:14:00.780
That's where the fucking apple campuses,
a kid,

2243
02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.600
a six year old kid was attacked by a mountain lion in front of his parents.

2244
02:14:03.850 --> 02:14:07.320
I mean they're,
they're out there.
There's a lot of 'em out there in California,

2245
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:11.460
definitely to hone ranch if Tom said it before,
but there's a guy up there,

2246
02:14:11.461 --> 02:14:15.810
it's Cody bank said that he,
he has a trail camera that has,

2247
02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:18.960
it's over a pond.
They have 16 different mountain lions.

2248
02:14:18.961 --> 02:14:20.130
They've caught on this trail camera.

2249
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:22.790
<v 2>It's crazy.
Yeah.
No,
I mean,
yeah.</v>

2250
02:14:22.791 --> 02:14:25.760
Lion's haven't been hunted here and what was 40 years?

2251
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:29.900
It's been a long 30 some years.
But yeah,
it's uh,
I dunno,

2252
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:35.180
they uh,
they,
you know,
a lion kills,
they say every three days,
kill something.

2253
02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:40.490
Deer,
elk,
hopefully not kids,
but just going to kill.

2254
02:14:40.570 --> 02:14:43.540
<v 4>No.
Why?
People would want more lines than deer.</v>

2255
02:14:43.810 --> 02:14:47.430
While you would want more predators then game animals.

2256
02:14:47.431 --> 02:14:49.240
It's a balance that it's,
well,

2257
02:14:49.241 --> 02:14:53.560
it's balanced everywhere else everywhere else except California.
I mean,

2258
02:14:53.561 --> 02:14:57.910
California is just so goofy with some of their laws and again,
they're not,

2259
02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:03.100
this is not like a rational approach that's based on real fish and,

2260
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:07.510
and game people that have been doing this and calculating numbers and take an

2261
02:15:07.511 --> 02:15:09.670
accurate assessments and audits of the area.

2262
02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:14.080
This is all done by people who really don't want anybody hunting at all.
Yeah.

2263
02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:18.790
And they really loved it.
And League grant is a few licenses and a look.

2264
02:15:18.791 --> 02:15:20.350
If you keep a lot of mountain lions around,

2265
02:15:20.351 --> 02:15:23.140
he don't have to grant as many deer tags.
Right.
Because guess what?

2266
02:15:23.141 --> 02:15:24.150
There's no fucking deer

2267
02:15:24.230 --> 02:15:25.180
<v 2>now and then that's,</v>

2268
02:15:25.210 --> 02:15:29.810
that's a whole thought process behind hunting and the antis with hunting is they

2269
02:15:29.811 --> 02:15:34.490
want to take away or that thing.
Whoa.
Is that four of them

2270
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:38.730
<v 4>in Glendora.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Back that up.
I want to see that thing again.</v>

2271
02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:43.030
What creepy God damn animal.
Yeah.
Four of them I think.

2272
02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:45.510
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2273
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:50.240
There's four of them just wandering around on a trail camera.
Oh Mike.

2274
02:15:50.250 --> 02:15:51.330
I said I'll pay that again.

2275
02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:55.160
<v 2>That's,
that's going to cause some problems for deer.</v>

2276
02:15:55.710 --> 02:15:58.080
<v 4>That's going to cause some problems for fucking anybody.
Yeah.</v>

2277
02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:01.470
Imagining if you're out there camping and you go to take a leak and you say

2278
02:16:01.530 --> 02:16:03.780
eight eyeballs staring back at you like that.

2279
02:16:03.930 --> 02:16:08.400
<v 2>Not Good.
So big al too.
Yeah,
that's,
that's what people have said.
You know,</v>

2280
02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:12.150
the Anti Israel,
they want to take away small chunks of our hunting rights.

2281
02:16:12.151 --> 02:16:15.510
So they'll say,
well this is just lions.
And then it's just this,

2282
02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.140
this baiting for bear and then it's just this and then pretty soon it's all
gone.

2283
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:21.660
So that's why,
you know,
as hunters we,

2284
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:25.860
I think we just need to protect our lifestyle and just keep preaching the

2285
02:16:25.861 --> 02:16:27.450
positive aspects of it.
So,

2286
02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:32.080
but I want to say before I get hate from the Turkey hunters,
I will,
I will,

2287
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:37.240
I will somebody,
there's somebody want to take me Turkey hunting,
I'll go,

2288
02:16:37.241 --> 02:16:40.960
I'll kill on and then I'll judge whether it's like oak honey shotgun.

2289
02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:44.200
Either only bow,
but I can't really say.

2290
02:16:44.201 --> 02:16:47.920
It's not like elk hunting if I haven't done it.
That's not fair.
That's not fair.

2291
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:49.940
Well they do call them and all that.

2292
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:56.290
Sounds like a good call.
Make them make a call.

2293
02:16:56.291 --> 02:17:00.400
Like just a little recording the Joe Rogan Turkey slash play it on your iPhone.

2294
02:17:00.510 --> 02:17:04.450
So I gotta I to kill one.
Then I'll make the judgment on how,

2295
02:17:04.630 --> 02:17:07.960
how much I like it,
I guess.
Yeah,
I would imagine.
Well,
like,
what,

2296
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:11.410
what other animals are there that are like sort of underrated hunting animals?

2297
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.350
Well,
they always say the blacktail deer back home in Oregon.
Those are,

2298
02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:19.930
because a lot of the country,
you know,

2299
02:17:19.931 --> 02:17:23.800
black blacktail or only in western Oregon or western Washington up in British

2300
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:26.950
Columbia a little bit.
And then down there,
down here in Kelowna,
black tails,

2301
02:17:26.951 --> 02:17:30.730
right?
Yeah.
Columbia blacktail but in Oregon it's like more rain forest,

2302
02:17:30.731 --> 02:17:34.900
so it's very dense,
very dark.
Um,
those big bucks.

2303
02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:39.520
Basically they're nocturnal all year except for when they start breeding.

2304
02:17:39.521 --> 02:17:42.970
And even during the ruts,
still very tough to,

2305
02:17:43.630 --> 02:17:46.930
they don't pattern like a white tail,
so to speak,
like white tail.

2306
02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:50.980
A lot of guys kill him because they see these bugs on the trail cameras and they

2307
02:17:50.981 --> 02:17:53.590
know they're coming in the gate.
They wait for the wind to be right.

2308
02:17:53.591 --> 02:17:54.520
The prevailing winds.

2309
02:17:54.521 --> 02:17:58.570
And then they said in their tree stand and then that buck hopefully comes by and

2310
02:17:58.571 --> 02:18:02.740
it's,
it's patentable with black tail.
The,
uh,
the,

2311
02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:07.090
the legend is they're not as pattern Boland.
And I would,
I would buy into that.

2312
02:18:07.390 --> 02:18:11.920
And so killing a big black tail isn't on top of anybody's bucket list really are

2313
02:18:11.921 --> 02:18:14.830
very many people,
but it's very difficult,
very tough trophy.

2314
02:18:15.350 --> 02:18:18.830
<v 1>You know,
all this hunting talk that we've had and the two podcasts,</v>

2315
02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:22.280
it always leads to people getting excited about it.

2316
02:18:22.281 --> 02:18:27.230
But beginning the hunting process is extremely difficult.
Yeah.
Where to start.

2317
02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:31.580
Yeah.
I think that that's something that's a gap that we would really,

2318
02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:35.600
a lot of people would be really well served if we could figure out how to bridge

2319
02:18:35.601 --> 02:18:39.830
it.
And I've talked to Rinella about this and you've talked about like possibly

2320
02:18:39.831 --> 02:18:44.831
setting up a first timer's camp where you would take people to a game rich

2321
02:18:45.021 --> 02:18:48.800
environment.
Like maybe say like a white tail deer place where you know,

2322
02:18:48.801 --> 02:18:49.400
there's a lot of white,

2323
02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:53.960
like he won't have anything to do with high fence hunting is very admirable,

2324
02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:55.970
right?
Um,
so it wouldn't be that,

2325
02:18:55.971 --> 02:19:00.530
but something along those lines where you're going to a very game rich

2326
02:19:00.531 --> 02:19:04.340
environment and it,
he'll set it up for you,
bring it to a range first.

2327
02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:08.810
Really get you to understand a rifle safety,
gun safety.

2328
02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:13.610
Make sure you really,
truly understand how to squeeze the trigger,
how to,

2329
02:19:13.670 --> 02:19:17.840
you know,
stay down on a shot and then get you to an animal,

2330
02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:22.610
have you shoot an animal and then teach you how to butcher it and make like a

2331
02:19:22.611 --> 02:19:26.000
couple of preparations with the meat.
And to do something like this.

2332
02:19:26.001 --> 02:19:27.980
Start like camps that,
yeah,

2333
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:32.420
like think about this a bear hunting thing that we did in Alberta.

2334
02:19:32.421 --> 02:19:34.940
All those guys were pretty much seasoned hunters,

2335
02:19:35.210 --> 02:19:37.850
but a lot of them were drawn there because of you.

2336
02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:39.510
<v 2>Pretty much all of them.
And that's,</v>

2337
02:19:39.570 --> 02:19:43.440
that's why I learned you to go on that hunt for the first bow hunt because it's,

2338
02:19:43.470 --> 02:19:46.740
it's basically just what we were talking about.
What are we,

2339
02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:49.890
what you were explaining.
It's,
it's a target rich environment.

2340
02:19:50.250 --> 02:19:52.200
It's a more controlled setting.

2341
02:19:52.201 --> 02:19:55.670
Then if you're up in the mountains after mule deer and then,
you know,

2342
02:19:55.680 --> 02:20:00.000
we processed the bear,
you skinned out your bear,
we cut the meat off.

2343
02:20:00.090 --> 02:20:01.980
So that's exactly what we did.
You know,

2344
02:20:01.981 --> 02:20:06.560
your first bow hunt was exactly like what you described and um,

2345
02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:09.360
you know most of those guys up there that were there,
they were seasoned hunters,

2346
02:20:09.361 --> 02:20:12.150
they hadn't bear hunted.
So that's that.

2347
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:16.230
And measure how much did you learn on that hunt?
Quite a bit.
Yeah.

2348
02:20:16.231 --> 02:20:18.960
You learned a ton and you don't,

2349
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:23.550
if you're on a like a high country mule deer hunt,
that is so difficult.

2350
02:20:24.990 --> 02:20:28.080
You're probably not going to kill one for a number of years.

2351
02:20:28.470 --> 02:20:33.180
A lot of guys get frustrated by that.
They'd like what's I wasted all this time.

2352
02:20:33.181 --> 02:20:36.540
I wasted all this money.
I just can't get it done.

2353
02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:41.660
So I like hunts like the bear hunt to get that the honeys hunting embers,

2354
02:20:41.881 --> 02:20:43.960
heat it up and burning hot and uh,

2355
02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:47.990
that's like what you're describing is perfect.
We should consider

2356
02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:52.510
<v 1>doing something like that.
Like a camp for like a first timer camp.</v>

2357
02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:54.430
Like figuring out some way to set something up.

2358
02:20:54.431 --> 02:20:56.290
Cause I've had so many people email me,

2359
02:20:56.500 --> 02:21:00.640
I've had a lot of people tweet me and 70 Facebook messages saying that they got

2360
02:21:00.641 --> 02:21:04.000
into hunting because of our podcast.
Because the podcast with Rinella,

2361
02:21:04.330 --> 02:21:06.850
which is great.
I don't know how they did it though.
I don't know how they got it.

2362
02:21:06.851 --> 02:21:08.110
I got into it because of Rinella.

2363
02:21:08.111 --> 02:21:10.930
If it wasn't for him taking me and Brian Cowen out into Montana,

2364
02:21:10.931 --> 02:21:13.450
I don't know how I would have started.
I don't know how to start.

2365
02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:16.840
And I think that that is the really difficult thing for people,

2366
02:21:16.841 --> 02:21:18.880
like you said as a seasoned hunter,

2367
02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:22.840
but you really like to do is go out by yourself.
But you're a guy with,
you know,

2368
02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:26.830
years and years,
decades of experience hunting for a person just starting out,

2369
02:21:26.831 --> 02:21:29.260
going off by themselves.
They're gonna make so many mistakes.

2370
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:32.870
<v 2>Well just you and I sitting on the,
on the bear bay.
I mean,</v>

2371
02:21:32.871 --> 02:21:36.700
remember the talks we had about movement,
you know,
moving

2372
02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:40.460
<v 1>edge detection,
right?
They see any movement they see,</v>

2373
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:42.060
<v 2>right?
Cause like I said,</v>

2374
02:21:42.061 --> 02:21:45.740
we were sitting there and so you'd see what time it was or you,

2375
02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:48.810
you want to take a photo and I,
and I said,

2376
02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:53.150
you can do all that just slower move,

2377
02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:55.340
like to not a predator.
Right.
So,
but when you're,

2378
02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:57.180
when you don't have somebody there with you,

2379
02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:01.470
you make all those mistakes and then it just elongates that learning curve.

2380
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:02.850
So I would,

2381
02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:07.880
I would love to take first some first time hunter and sit there with them just

2382
02:22:08.041 --> 02:22:11.210
like with you and just,
you know,
I know,
you know,

2383
02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:13.410
I'm not saying I have all the answers or whatever.

2384
02:22:13.411 --> 02:22:16.410
I've just made a lot of mistakes.
Right.
You know,
so I've learned,

2385
02:22:16.470 --> 02:22:20.130
I don't want people to have to make all the mistakes I did.
And um,

2386
02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:24.310
<v 1>I practiced for a long time,
but it wasn't really that long.</v>

2387
02:22:24.311 --> 02:22:28.440
It was only like six months between the time we met in a time we started at that

2388
02:22:28.441 --> 02:22:29.440
camp.
Um,

2389
02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:34.520
but through that six months I was steady shooting arrows basically on a daily

2390
02:22:34.801 --> 02:22:35.980
basis.
Diligent.
Wow.

2391
02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:40.440
How much time do you think someone would need from being introduced to archery

2392
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:43.920
to going in a controlled environment,
a bear hunt like that?

2393
02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:48.390
<v 2>Um,
you know,
if it just,
the thing is,</v>

2394
02:22:48.391 --> 02:22:52.880
is there's so much more to bow hunting than just shooting paper,

2395
02:22:53.210 --> 02:22:57.170
you know,
and it's just that mindset and the,
and the respect thing.

2396
02:22:57.171 --> 02:23:00.260
But it's so hard to learn that when you haven't done it.
So it was just like,

2397
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:03.680
it's like how do you measure all that?
But with a bow,

2398
02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:08.000
killing an animal with a bow,
it the biggest thing for new guys,

2399
02:23:08.001 --> 02:23:11.900
just what you did.
It's just being proficient with your weapon.
You know,

2400
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:13.580
being proficient with your weapon,

2401
02:23:13.970 --> 02:23:18.710
knowing where you're going to hit and having the confidence to make that shot

2402
02:23:18.711 --> 02:23:21.830
because,
um,
even though it is close range,
I mean,

2403
02:23:21.831 --> 02:23:24.080
you saw me take a practice shot at seven yards,

2404
02:23:24.350 --> 02:23:28.250
even though I've done it probably millions of times and killed many,

2405
02:23:28.251 --> 02:23:30.290
many bear still.

2406
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:35.030
I'm still diligent in my process.

2407
02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:35.381
<v 1>Well,</v>

2408
02:23:35.381 --> 02:23:39.040
we actually talked about that because the day after we went hunting and I got

2409
02:23:39.041 --> 02:23:43.870
that bear,
we went again and you actually put it in my head that it's easy to,

2410
02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:46.030
once you've done it,
then take it for granted.

2411
02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:49.810
So you have to maintain that same mindset that you have the very first day when

2412
02:23:49.811 --> 02:23:50.800
you made the perfect shot.

2413
02:23:51.130 --> 02:23:53.500
And I thought that was a very important point that you said to me,

2414
02:23:53.501 --> 02:23:55.030
because I know that people do go,

2415
02:23:55.031 --> 02:23:58.000
I've done this before and then you could screw up and wound.

2416
02:23:58.870 --> 02:24:00.540
<v 2>And that's another thing.
Um,</v>

2417
02:24:01.150 --> 02:24:05.470
another thing I remember sharing with you is the bear you killed,

2418
02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:08.920
we would need to get a good look at it.
So he had been in,

2419
02:24:08.921 --> 02:24:12.700
we wanted to make sure it was a bor,
a big bore,
like we want to kill.

2420
02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:16.480
And so we had,
it had been in and been in and I said,

2421
02:24:16.481 --> 02:24:18.460
I go and you didn't shoot it.

2422
02:24:18.461 --> 02:24:21.160
But then once we got to look at it and we were like,
okay,

2423
02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:24.730
that is the bear we want to kill because it can take awhile to see if it's a

2424
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:29.200
board.
They're not alike,
doesn't have antlers.
So you have to look at,
you know,

2425
02:24:29.201 --> 02:24:33.520
basically it's the,
the hair off the penis sheath is what it is.
But,
uh,

2426
02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:36.370
and that is with binocular.
So once I said,

2427
02:24:36.371 --> 02:24:40.930
once we decide or once you decide that's going to be a bear,
you're gonna shoot,

2428
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:43.870
your emotions are probably going to get going.
Because it had been,

2429
02:24:43.930 --> 02:24:48.930
it had been from just being just kind of enjoying it being closed or just kind

2430
02:24:49.221 --> 02:24:54.100
of that moment to all of a sudden now I'm going to kill an animal that changes

2431
02:24:54.101 --> 02:24:57.910
everything it did to your body just is like,
okay,
this is,

2432
02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:02.170
this is a real deal now.
And so that's,
yeah,
just that type of thing.

2433
02:25:02.171 --> 02:25:07.050
Having somebody there or having that conversation allows people to,

2434
02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:10.000
to process it on their own.
And you know,
in my,

2435
02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:12.220
in my book back country bow hunting,
that was the,

2436
02:25:12.221 --> 02:25:15.970
one of the most popular chapters that have had,
as I wrote a chapter on fear,

2437
02:25:16.210 --> 02:25:19.570
no guy ever wants to talk about being afraid or being,
you know,

2438
02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.990
they're afraid of the dark or scared of being attacked by.

2439
02:25:23.770 --> 02:25:25.360
But so I talked about that and I said,
hey,

2440
02:25:25.361 --> 02:25:28.420
when I was first in the mountains by myself,
I was afraid.

2441
02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:32.110
And so when people read that and they're like,
they think about it.

2442
02:25:32.111 --> 02:25:34.600
And then they're in that position,
they're just like,
this is normal.

2443
02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:38.960
This is normal.
And so when,
when we can,
um,

2444
02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:41.980
talk about things like the experience of,
okay,
now I'm going to kill the,

2445
02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.760
kill the bear,
now it's time to get it done.
And you know what,

2446
02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:48.550
you can kind of anticipate what that's going to feel like.

2447
02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:52.160
You're just going to be that much more deadly,
more lethal.
And uh,

2448
02:25:53.550 --> 02:25:58.030
not to one thing is I was in the gym the other day and this,

2449
02:25:58.150 --> 02:26:00.070
this guy was telling me,
he's like,

2450
02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:04.810
he has one of my old Bose just from years ago and he's like,
he was calm.
He goes,

2451
02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:09.190
he goes,
I almost got a bull.
And I'm like,
what?
What happened buddy?

2452
02:26:09.191 --> 02:26:11.440
He's like 35 yards.
He come in,

2453
02:26:11.441 --> 02:26:14.520
he's bugling and I had your bow and I'm standing there watching me,

2454
02:26:14.521 --> 02:26:18.220
he's 35 yards and he's right there.
He goes,
and I was shaking so bad.
He goes,

2455
02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:22.210
I don't even know how I could have shot it.
And I'm like,
that's normal.

2456
02:26:23.390 --> 02:26:27.120
That's how everybody is.
But so that's where it is,

2457
02:26:27.121 --> 02:26:29.950
is in that moment shaking.
But still,
okay,

2458
02:26:29.951 --> 02:26:34.180
I need to be in control and I need to do everything that I practice and make

2459
02:26:34.181 --> 02:26:38.290
that that shot.
That's a lot of people get that shaking and,

2460
02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:43.030
and then they never get to the other part.
The precision part that's,

2461
02:26:43.090 --> 02:26:43.923
that's difficult.

2462
02:26:44.170 --> 02:26:47.770
<v 1>Well,
controlling emotions is very difficult and almost anything you do that's d,</v>

2463
02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:51.430
anything you do that's important to you is going to come with a surge of

2464
02:26:51.431 --> 02:26:52.510
adrenaline or sure.

2465
02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:57.540
Surge of nerves of anxiety and it's just about maintaining your breathing and

2466
02:26:57.761 --> 02:27:00.460
staying calm.
And there was a definitely for me,

2467
02:27:00.461 --> 02:27:04.600
a big difference between like that's the bear.
Like okay,
Ooh,

2468
02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:09.010
but it helped that you had already prepared me for that.
Right,
right.

2469
