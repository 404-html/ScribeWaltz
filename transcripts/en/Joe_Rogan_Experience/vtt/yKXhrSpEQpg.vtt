8
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Like if you brought that elk hunting,</v>

9
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>people would be upset with you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

16
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Pack really carefully as you can imagine.</v>

17
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Very petite shirts,</v>

18
00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>three pair of pants,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I could pretty much recite.</v>

24
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I never felt more liberated than when I got rid of all my stuff and I'm in a</v>

25
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:47.501
<v Speaker 1>different country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have a couple of weeks.</v>

27
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.211
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say,</v>

28
00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:49.511
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>why not the roller bags,</v>

30
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:51.534
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

31
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>if you travel in any kind of third world country down cobblestones.</v>

32
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I actually had a roller bag,</v>

34
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>but I ditched it my first trip to London,</v>

35
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>a change trains four times going up and down these damn stairs where the clunk,</v>

36
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:05.321
<v Speaker 1>clunk,</v>

37
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>clunk her back.</v>

38
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

39
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

40
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 1>This really sucks.</v>

41
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to carry it on my body.</v>

42
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:11.074
<v Speaker 1>So that's um,</v>

43
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't get any money from these guys,</v>

44
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:13.121
<v Speaker 1>but as a Tom,</v>

45
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:13.421
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

46
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:13.901
<v Speaker 1>Bi,</v>

47
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:14.211

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.410

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>so well configured,</v>

51
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't believe the stuff I get in there.</v>

52
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I even had my whole workout gym and that thing man really</v>

53
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff's in there that you carry around with you everywhere.</v>

54
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Now this Tom Ben,</v>

55
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 2>is this for hiking or is it just primarily a trap?</v>

56
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.973
<v Speaker 1>The travel ban.</v>

57
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I want to take a serious hike with it,</v>

58
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.401
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

59
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's pretty sturdy,</v>

61
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.123
<v Speaker 1>very sturdy.</v>

62
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I use packing cubes.</v>

63
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 1>There's different packing ways.</v>

64
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>A good resource for your listeners that travel full time.</v>

65
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Go to one bag.com.</v>

66
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>He has many recommendations for various bags and uh,</v>

67
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>where you can just basically one carry on bag and travel anywhere in the world</v>

68
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>for several weeks at a time if you want to smell one bag.</v>

69
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this stuff is high tech.</v>

70
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I just washed my tee shirts out in the sink.</v>

71
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

72
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:06.230

00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:07.331
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

75
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've found from hiking and camping for long periods of</v>

76
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the further you stretch it,</v>

113
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.230

176
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Right before he started losing a little.</v>

<v Speaker 3>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

186
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:02.401

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Have they actually copyrighted the word react.</v>

297
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.170
<v Speaker 2>So is this valid?</v>

298
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.093
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

299
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.521
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

300
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

301
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.260
<v Speaker 2>they retracted.</v>

302
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 2>What happened was the Internet lost its shit as you would expect.</v>

303
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.790
<v Speaker 2>And these guys,</v>

304
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 2>there were videos on youtube which were live streams.</v>

305
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 2>These were so funny when this was going on.</v>

306
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Essentially what they were is the subscriber count of their channel shortly</v>

307
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:54.880
<v Speaker 2>after the controversy had hit and it will just like fell off a cliff,</v>

308
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.740
<v Speaker 2>like it should go to zero.</v>

309
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.390
<v Speaker 2>He never went to 100 percent.</v>

310
00:07:58.391 --> 00:07:58.931
<v Speaker 2>Go to zero.</v>

311
00:07:58.931 --> 00:07:59.740
<v Speaker 2>It should go to zero.</v>

312
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 2>It never went to zero.</v>

313
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Don't deserve anything.</v>

314
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

315
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:03.490
<v Speaker 2>that's what they want to do.</v>

316
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 2>You really want to reach out to everyone using the word react in a video and you</v>

317
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:07.540
<v Speaker 2>want money from them.</v>

318
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.373
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

319
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.641
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

320
00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:12.940
<v Speaker 2>You're everything that's wrong with distributing content over the internet.</v>

321
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 2>That's everything that's wrong with it.</v>

322
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 2>You've taken one of the sneakiest most diabolical fucking tricks and all the</v>

323
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:24.010
<v Speaker 2>legal system and you've applied it to this open free world of the Internet and</v>

324
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:24.850
<v Speaker 2>you're a piece of shit.</v>

325
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a parasitic behavior.</v>

326
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you something.</v>

327
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.323
<v Speaker 2>That's cancer.</v>

328
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

329
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 2>They came back,</v>

330
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.660
<v Speaker 2>retracted it.</v>

331
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Apologize.</v>

332
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them.</v>

333
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them for even thinking that showed the,</v>

334
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.360
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

335
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>now you're going to give him a second chance.</v>

336
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Fucking chances.</v>

337
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.530
<v Speaker 2>You can't think like that.</v>

338
00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:42.430
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

339
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:42.881
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

340
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:43.840
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

341
00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:45.100
<v Speaker 2>You can't go after people.</v>

342
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:47.710
<v Speaker 2>For some it's not like it has anything to do.</v>

343
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Anything you create.</v>

344
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

345
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 2>you're just stealing their wares.</v>

346
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.250
<v Speaker 2>There were some stories going around that they had effectively shut down like</v>

347
00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:55.084
<v Speaker 2>these small time,</v>

348
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Walmart completely like people who had the hots for who they.</v>

349
00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.670
