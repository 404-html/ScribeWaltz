00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 2>If you go to rogan.ting.com you can find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what teaching is all about.</v>

71
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:17.941
<v Speaker 2>With Ting is is a cell phone company</v>
<v Speaker 2>that buys time on the sprint and the</v>

72
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>t-mobile backbone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

73
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two different types of signals</v>

74
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's cdma,</v>

75
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.830
<v Speaker 2>which is verizon and sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's GSM,</v>

76
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.140
<v Speaker 2>which is t mobile and at and T.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with Ting you don't have to become a</v>

77
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:41.521
<v Speaker 2>part of these big corporations companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use their backbone use ting.</v>

78
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 2>And by using ting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call Wah Wah,</v>

79
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're slogo makes mobile makes sense.</v>

80
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 2>It actually doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You save a shit load of money.</v>

81
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 2>If you go to ting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ill tell you exactly how much you would</v>

82
00:04:56.651 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 2>say save,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe I'll pull it up here but I</v>

83
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:05.491
<v Speaker 2>think they said the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bill is here,</v>

84
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>knows their average bill is $23 a month.</v>

85
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$440 is the average annual savings per</v>

86
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 2>device for a business with 11 to 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>employees.</v>

87
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.620
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using sprint,</v>

88
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>you're using t-mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using big companies.</v>

89
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>If you want to cancel you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you quit anytime you want.</v>

90
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 2>There's no contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only pay for what you use as another</v>

91
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 2>beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you use two minutes a month,</v>

92
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 2>that's what you pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You use a hundred,</v>

93
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 2>you pay for a hundred most of the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have plans.</v>

94
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're with a big company and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

95
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>you get a hundred minutes a month or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you get.</v>

96
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 2>If you go over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have big fees you pay.</v>

97
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 2>If you go under that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get any money back with ting,</v>

98
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>no early cancellation fees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no early termination fees.</v>

99
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Quit whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No ad alongs,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no fucking weirdness,</v>

101
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real simple,</v>

102
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>real easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to [inaudible] Dot Com and you can</v>

103
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>save 25 bucks off of any device or</v>
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

104
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.240
<v Speaker 1>That's rogan.ting.com and we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this episode is with just me.</v>

105
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone in a hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

106
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to do an episode with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>pal Duncan Trussell,</v>

107
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>but Duncan trussell caught what is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to as the nerd flu.</v>

108
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently when people go to comic con</v>

109
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>every year they get what they call the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerd flu.</v>

110
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>And with the nerd flu is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is people that are like,</v>

111
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess either they don't get out much</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they do get out,</v>

112
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>their immune systems are severely</v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised and these fucking bugs just</v>

113
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 1>run rampant through this sea of Dorks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

114
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

115
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just the factor of having so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people in a room together or so</v>

<v Speaker 1>Atlanta,</v>

126
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

127
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:36.620

<v Speaker 1>I almost didn't make it to Atlanta.</v>

128
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I almost accidentally went to Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been traveling so much lately.</v>

129
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I literally forgot where I was going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're supposed to say</v>

130
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>literally there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

131
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I actually forgot where I was going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the,</v>

132
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gate at American Airlines and,</v>

<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

144
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look up and the plane was going to</v>

145
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Chicago and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

146
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.883
<v Speaker 1>dummy.</v>

147
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.623
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>that was made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of those guys in a big rush</v>

149
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>to get on the plane that I'm not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be on.</v>

150
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I made it here.</v>

151
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I love Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta is a bad ass place.</v>

152
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

153
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I did a special here in 2012 and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>always enjoyed it here.</v>

154
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a good city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unusual city.</v>

155
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:38.354
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got its own thing,</v>

157
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of cities are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of cities have their own thing.</v>

158
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Sitting here in my hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do a podcast on the plane</v>

159
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it out on twitter.</v>

160
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>if you have any questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll answer them.</v>

162
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about doing it on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane because the plane had Wifi,</v>

163
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>but there was this lady behind me with</v>
<v Speaker 1>her kid.</v>

164
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just don't fucking pay</v>

165
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>attention to their kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

166
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't,</v>

167
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>they just don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her kid was going fucking crazy.</v>

168
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was kicking the back of my seat</v>

169
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kicking it and not like putting his</v>

170
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>feet up and resting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Som thump,</v>

171
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:24.984
<v Speaker 1>thump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thump.</v>

172
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 1>He's a cute little guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little tiny fellow.</v>

173
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 1>He's probably only maybe two or three at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most.</v>

174
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

175
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe I would have been irritated if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have kids.</v>

176
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was irritating was delayed.</v>

177
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>He was ignoring him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

178
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was lying there with her eyes</v>

179
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:49.400
<v Speaker 1>closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was big fat lady and her kids go on.</v>

180
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

181
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mama,</v>

182
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mama,</v>

183
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Mama.</v>

184
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I finally,</v>

185
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I sat up and I turned around and looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>at her and she looked at me like there</v>

186
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:02.190
<v Speaker 1>was something wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

187
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to your fucking kid.</v>

188
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.570
<v Speaker 1>He's screaming at you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring them.</v>

189
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Some people just decide that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to deal with the burden of</v>

190
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>taking care of a kid and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

191
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 1>they have a short attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want your attention when they want</v>

192
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to wait.</v>

193
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking babies.</v>

194
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

195
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to three year old baby and she just</v>

196
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 1>wasn't having it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thought she thought she should be</v>

197
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>able to just relax and that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

198
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess she just didn't take any</v>

199
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>consideration and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other people around her,</v>

200
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>while her kid is fucking screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just laying there with her hands</v>

201
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>folded in her belly and she didn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fat belly.</v>

202
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Her hands were laying on top of her fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly and it wasn't pregnant.</v>

203
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she had three kids there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might've been just really into deck.</v>

204
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 1>She might had another baby on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think she was just fat.</v>

205
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to guess she was fat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking kid was screaming in her</v>

206
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>face and she just kept her eyes closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

207
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to your fucking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lady.</v>

208
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was pretty evident right away.</v>

209
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>There was no way I was going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a podcast going and just talk</v>

210
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>into it without this kid screaming in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the background,</v>

211
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 1>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've been funny.</v>

212
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be more likely it would have been.</v>

213
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.261
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:11:33.261 --> 00:11:38.261
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm here in my hotel room right now</v>

215
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.310
<v Speaker 1>it's five 20 and I have a show tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>at eight o'clock,</v>

216
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.370
<v Speaker 1>so I've got a couple hours here to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

217
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 1>so I figured I'll do it here and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have my friend Ian Mccall Lawn</v>

218
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.560
<v Speaker 1>if you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

219
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Ian been on the podcast before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been on fight companions before and</v>

220
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the UFC is top flyway</v>
<v Speaker 1>contenders.</v>

221
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>He was scheduled to fight tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his opponent,</v>

222
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Justin scoggins did not make weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very unfortunate because a,</v>

223
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 1>justin is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very talented guy and I was looking</v>

224
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>forward to watching that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been a really interesting</v>

225
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

226
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the big fights on the card that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was looking forward to,</v>

227
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 1>but so ian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

228
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.640
<v Speaker 1>wound up training for six weeks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weighing in all for nothing.</v>

229
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>He decided to weigh in any way just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove a point.</v>

230
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fights at fly weight,</v>

231
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.350
<v Speaker 1>which is 125 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brutal cut.</v>

232
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably walks around</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around 150.</v>

233
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 1>If I had a guest and he's got a cut all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way down to one 25 and he just</v>

234
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:47.950
<v Speaker 1>decided to do it anyway just to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point because he's a professional.</v>

235
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.623
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

236
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we'll do a podcast later with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian.</v>

237
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I'm doing this,</v>

238
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this on my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>

239
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing this on my iphone and I realize</v>

240
00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:04.100
<v Speaker 1>why I'm doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I do not have airplane mode on now</v>

241
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people can't call me cause I think if</v>

242
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.860
<v Speaker 1>somebody calls you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recording just stops.</v>

243
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 1>So it's ongoing now folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's sitting here.</v>

244
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.320
<v Speaker 1>My mic stand is a diet coke can and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read some of this shit</v>

245
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

246
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:24.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions people asked on,</v>

247
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 1>on the twitter.</v>

248
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 1>So I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing the laughing skull and Atlanta</v>

249
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 1>tonight for two shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool little room,</v>

250
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>but when I say a little room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking tiny.</v>

251
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it seats 80 people and I was</v>

252
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 1>just here a couple months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 1>for the Tabernacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at the Tabernacle Theater,</v>

254
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 1>which is a big ass place and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided like I don't really have that</v>

255
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 1>much new material because really I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on,</v>

256
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just tightening down all the material</v>

257
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>that I had for my special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

258
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 1>once I recorded a special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm in sort of like a,</v>

259
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you would call it subject</v>

260
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:10.780
<v Speaker 1>acquisition mode where I sort of sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and try to figure out what I'm</v>

261
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm going to expand upon,</v>

262
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ideas I'm going to start planting</v>

263
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>and then try to make them grow on stage.</v>

264
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a scary part of doing standup.</v>

265
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say like obviously it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary,</v>

266
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.550
<v Speaker 1>but this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most uh,</v>

267
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.650
<v Speaker 1>troublesome or nerve wracking or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or exciting.</v>

268
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the most exciting time of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most exciting is certainly like the</v>

269
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>actual filming of a special that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting.</v>

270
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that it's done and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that material,</v>

271
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 1>the best justice I could do and now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to release it.</v>

272
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the most exciting part after</v>

273
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>that is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this period that I'm at right now where</v>

274
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't have shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any new material.</v>

275
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of ideas that I wrote</v>

276
00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>down on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of subjects that I talked</v>

277
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>about on stage a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never really became bits.</v>

278
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:11.231
<v Speaker 1>And I will eventually piece those out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll put those up on a corkboard</v>

279
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>with index cards to take index cards and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a right the subjects down.</v>

280
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And I slapped him up on a cork board so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can look at them in my office.</v>

281
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 1>And A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a few of those,</v>

282
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is about as fresh and embryotic a,</v>

283
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state as my standup is ever in.</v>

284
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

285
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a period that I've been over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last few years.</v>

286
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it every two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every two years seems to be like a good</v>

287
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 1>number for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess I could probably do a new</v>

288
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>hour every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it would be,</v>

289
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 1>it's at its best and some of those bits</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get better as time goes on.</v>

290
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have what I think is as</v>

291
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 1>close to the finished version as I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>before release it.</v>

292
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

293
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>so two years seems to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time that,</v>

294
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:03.670
<v Speaker 1>and so there's this period where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta slammed down the Samurai sword,</v>

295
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:08.440
<v Speaker 1>you hammer it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it to the,</v>

296
00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 1>the best edge that you can get it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then throw it all away and start</v>

297
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:14.174
<v Speaker 1>from scratch.</v>

298
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

299
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

300
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of podcasts probably help</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject matter,</v>

301
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

302
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just up in the air.</v>

303
00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna</v>

304
00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:28.850
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me get,</v>

305
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to some of these questions.</v>

306
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:32.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of rambling here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

307
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>let's see what we got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

308
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 1>how can we help governor Gary Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow on social media,</v>

309
00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:41.870
<v Speaker 1>etc. That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governor Gary Johnson.</v>

310
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you guys this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A former governor,</v>

311
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you always a God?</v>

312
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:47.421
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:50.420
<v Speaker 1>they say President Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jimmy Carter's obviously not the</v>

314
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:52.220
<v Speaker 1>president anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still call him president</v>

315
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Carter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

316
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I do know is that he will be on</v>

317
00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 1>the podcast next Thursday with Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope.</v>

318
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>So Gary Johnson and Doug Stam hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>together because Doug has an idea of a</v>

319
00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>great idea that we're going to announce</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast.</v>

320
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess I could kind of announce it now</v>
<v Speaker 1>or talk about it now with Doug's idea</v>

321
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to do a live podcast during election</v>

322
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 1>night and election night coverage</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and do a series of podcasts</v>

323
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:31.691
<v Speaker 1>actually live from the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is we get a bunch of</v>

324
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:35.310
<v Speaker 1>different guys who have podcasts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gals and you know,</v>

325
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 1>whoever signs up for whoever we decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have on it.</v>

326
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:38.601
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

327
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I believe bill burrs in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe Mark Marin's in Doug's in,</v>

328
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we're gonna do is we're going</v>

329
00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:50.101
<v Speaker 1>to do these podcasts live and either</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll all on stage at the comedy store</v>

330
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 1>at the same time or we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

331
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 1>we'll mix it up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll have like shifts or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or I think it's probably going to</v>

333
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 1>be as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as informal as possible.</v>

334
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's the deal.</v>

335
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm uncomfortable here cause I'm sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>down in this weird way where I'm trying</v>

336
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 1>to lean into this microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you get too close to these</v>

337
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>things and picks up a bunch of pops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me see if there's a better way</v>

338
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to change the volume of</v>

339
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

340
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.670
<v Speaker 1>here's another crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

341
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you help Gary Johnson?</v>

342
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of word of mouth,</v>

343
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just talking about tweeting,</v>

344
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.660
<v Speaker 1>tweeting about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

345
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 1>people read your tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's only a couple of people,</v>

346
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 1>they'll tweet it out and spreads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

347
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet anything that you find that's</v>

348
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interviews of his,</v>

349
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:45.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe my interview that a I did with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast.</v>

350
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff that you can find him on</v>

351
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the most reasonable guy,</v>

352
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.070
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running for president.</v>

353
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And people don't take him seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a libertarian and it's</v>

354
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 1>either Democrat or Republican or waste</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vote.</v>

355
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 1>That's like the mindset that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in this country.</v>

356
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that this election is probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to change a lot of that.</v>

357
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what,</v>

358
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 1>what we're looking at right now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the worst cases of,</v>

359
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say the lesser of two</v>

360
00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

361
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you like,</v>

362
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that what we're,</v>

363
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're being offered right now is</v>

364
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:31.050
<v Speaker 1>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best options available.</v>

365
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the only options because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think the job sucks.</v>

366
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I think nobody wants that job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Gary Johnson apparently wants it,</v>

367
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucked up job.</v>

368
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to sit here and dwell</v>
<v Speaker 1>on politics and talk politics,</v>

369
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.500
<v Speaker 1>their buddy.</v>

370
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.500
<v Speaker 1>But it just to me is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressing times ever for a picking a</v>

371
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

372
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 1>steven crowder from louder with crowder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been on my podcast before.</v>

373
00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.920
<v Speaker 1>He just put a video on youtube about all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why you shouldn't vote for</v>

374
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he details all the different times</v>

375
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:11.150
<v Speaker 1>she's been caught lying and not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying about little shit lying about big</v>

376
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the origin of her name.</v>

377
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>She said that it was named,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was named after someone who was like</v>

378
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 1>the first guy to climb Mount Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

379
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.160
<v Speaker 1>but something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some someone to climb mount.</v>

380
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

381
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.150
<v Speaker 1>not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was.</v>

382
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

383
00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:33.261
<v Speaker 1>it turns out the guy who she's claiming</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was named after did what she was</v>

384
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:38.931
<v Speaker 1>claiming he did when she was six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no fucking way that's true.</v>

385
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.110
<v Speaker 1>She lied about that.</v>

386
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.560
<v Speaker 1>She lied about a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

387
00:20:44.561 --> 00:20:48.610
<v Speaker 1>she lied about Benghazi being by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

388
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 1>a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you guys remembered</v>

389
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a video that someone put</v>

390
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:59.161
<v Speaker 1>on youtube that it was some video about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam and it was really bad.</v>

391
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:05.170
<v Speaker 1>It was like a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible movie.</v>

392
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Some like ridiculously bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like amateur shitbag movie.</v>

393
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 1>And the word was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word on the street for Awhile was at</v>

394
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:20.611
<v Speaker 1>that movie was the motivation behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks on Bengazi and it's total horse</v>

395
00:21:21.291 --> 00:21:24.760
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was what the narrative was though</v>

396
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.920
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

397
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean Baby Hillary Clinton didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>any better,</v>

398
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.260
<v Speaker 1>but either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

399
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:34.820
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting video to watch if</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

400
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you want to watch this video and decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you don't want to vote for Hillary.</v>

401
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's plenty of videos out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will let you know why you shouldn't</v>

402
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 1>vote for Donald Trump either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

403
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.870
<v Speaker 1>fuck am I rambling about here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

404
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm being political and we have a cup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee here.</v>

405
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

406
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson,</v>

407
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 1>tell people you enjoy is that he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking reasonable guy.</v>

409
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I got hung out with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot pool with him.</v>

410
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 1>He's very reasonable.</v>

411
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Could he survive the barrage of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump,</v>

412
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 1>the trump ads?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they call the trumpkins?</v>

413
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.910
<v Speaker 1>The guys who are really into trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know those,</v>

414
00:22:15.911 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 1>that's how that's a fucking weapon he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>

415
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like back when opie and Anthony had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pests,</v>

416
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 1>they would turn the pests on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then eventually the pest turned on</v>

417
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.330
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

418
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the Gary Johnson answer.</v>

419
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Who's fatter Thompson or Bert Kreischer</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question to very good</v>

420
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:36.520
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you realize this,</v>

421
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 1>but to my very good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Sigar and Bert Kreischer,</v>

422
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:45.510
<v Speaker 1>they're both hilarious guys and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have decided to do this thing where</v>

423
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.380
<v Speaker 1>they're calling each other fad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both,</v>

424
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I love them both to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they both lose a couple of pounds.</v>

425
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 1>They could both lose a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

426
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and they've just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

427
00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.680
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

428
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.550
<v Speaker 1>have this public thing where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag bird is fat.</v>

429
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Thomas Fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move my phone to this new</v>

430
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:10.570
<v Speaker 1>that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

432
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:16.140
<v Speaker 1>and so they sell t shirts like half</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Thomas fat and Hashtag birdies</v>

433
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:20.740
<v Speaker 1>fat tee shirts and all the proceeds for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sales of those go directly to them.</v>

434
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So you're not helping any fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>charities?</v>

435
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.490
<v Speaker 1>No starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids are getting fed.</v>

436
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to buy food and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatter.</v>

437
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 1>And Burt's case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably going to buy boxes of</v>

438
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 1>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burg drinks,</v>

439
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.860
<v Speaker 1>boxes of wine in an evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone's trying to explain to me</v>

440
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>how many bottles of wine that is and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really know.</v>

441
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I could google that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to google that right now.</v>

442
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to guess,</v>

443
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.400
<v Speaker 1>how many boxes of wine would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a quick,</v>

444
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess how many or how many bottles</v>

445
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:55.280
<v Speaker 1>rather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many bottles of wine or in a box?</v>

446
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.173
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haley.</v>

447
00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Bottles</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wine in a box.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

449
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I click on it,</v>

450
00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

451
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it was nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say nine.</v>

452
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a lot for bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

453
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

454
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.913
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six and two thirds bottles.</v>

456
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.870
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it goes.</v>

457
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 1>750 milliliter bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

458
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:25.121
<v Speaker 1>750 milliliter bottles are there in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>five liter box of wine.</v>

459
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:31.300
<v Speaker 1>It's six and two thirds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a three liter box of wine,</v>

460
00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 1>it's four bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

461
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I bet he's drinking the six and two</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirds in a night.</v>

462
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I think he's done more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what he said,</v>

463
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but he's definitely drank at least one</v>
<v Speaker 1>box in a night on a regular basis.</v>

464
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's four bottles of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be dead.</v>

465
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

466
00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:57.680
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely fat.</v>

467
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that helps it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also,</v>

468
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tolerance issue.</v>

469
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.290
<v Speaker 1>When you drink that much all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bought,</v>

470
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 1>your body just gets used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>

471
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's like,</v>

472
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:14.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this asshole is going to be porn</v>

473
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.350
<v Speaker 1>poisoned down the hole every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

474
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 1>time to get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why</v>

475
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 1>mythbusters mythbusters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many bottles of wine in a box?</v>

476
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been told a box of wine is</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to five bottles.</v>

477
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to see if it's truth or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>

478
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 1>We kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a myth.</v>

479
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a measurement is just somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wacky website.</v>

480
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what the Bert and Tom Acoust</v>

481
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 1>fat thing is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

482
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.210
<v Speaker 1>if you see Hashtag Bert is fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that's all about.</v>

483
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Hashtag Thomas Fat,</v>

484
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of a retaliation and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would call him Bert Chrysler.</v>

485
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

486
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Tom's podcasts with his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina Palicki.</v>

487
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:05.840
<v Speaker 1>They have this podcast called your mom's</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

488
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny and it's really,</v>

489
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.280
<v Speaker 1>it's really unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really their own kind of thing.</v>

490
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I only did it once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really fun.</v>

491
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 1>They have their own vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the,</v>

492
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:19.760
<v Speaker 1>they're the pound for pound funniest</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple,</v>

493
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Tom and Christina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's close.</v>

494
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like bonding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcfarland.</v>

495
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Rich Vos are right up there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>

497
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I think Tom and Christina might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>them buy a hair by hair.</v>

498
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll the doom podcast ever happened.</v>

501
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soprano pictures.</v>

502
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably will.</v>

503
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just been crazy busy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>relaxation time and yeah,</v>

506
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to do is it probably</v>

507
00:26:57.751 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 1>won't be like a regular podcast because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably won't be that interesting to</v>

508
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:02.760
<v Speaker 1>listen to or watch.</v>

509
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.630
<v Speaker 1>We'll have it just like as like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplemental thing or we'll do it on</v>

510
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 1>twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitch is this thing that uh,</v>

511
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.630
<v Speaker 1>these young kids are doing these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitches this.</v>

512
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sorry if this is popping,</v>

513
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:19.941
<v Speaker 1>I might be too close to this if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>popping my peas twitches.</v>

514
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:23.250
<v Speaker 1>His thing that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young kids are doing words.</v>

515
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 1>You're watching video games being played</v>
<v Speaker 1>by other people and it's really popular.</v>

516
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Hugely popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

517
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 1>they make money from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

518
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 1>they play video games and they make</v>
<v Speaker 1>money playing video games.</v>

519
00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Like who saw that coming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

520
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever thought that it would be</v>

521
00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 1>interesting to watch people play video</v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

522
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:45.810
<v Speaker 1>but when I used to play quake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people used to get into these things</v>

523
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:48.440
<v Speaker 1>called demos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you would watch guys like there's</v>

524
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid named thresh.</v>

525
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.100
<v Speaker 1>He was like the big game or back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

526
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big quake players like one of the</v>

527
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:57.240
<v Speaker 1>best in the world if not the best.</v>

528
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.510
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would watch his demos just cause he</v>

529
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:05.340
<v Speaker 1>could fuck black guys up playing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>game in a way that I could never do.</v>

530
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you can watch someone do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

531
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.930
<v Speaker 1>like what I was competing in taekwondo</v>
<v Speaker 1>tournament's one of the things that</v>

532
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 1>really helped me a lot was I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was coming up,</v>

533
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I would go and watch like big time</v>
<v Speaker 1>tournaments.</v>

534
00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:24.711
<v Speaker 1>Like I went to Colorado Springs to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World Cup and this was in like,</v>

535
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I would say like 1986 I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to Colorado Springs to wash</v>

536
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the World Cup because I knew that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best fighters in the world,</v>

537
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best taekwondo guys,</v>

538
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:41.520
<v Speaker 1>guys like herb Perez and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

539
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>

540
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this guy,</v>

541
00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.790
<v Speaker 1>not seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

542
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember his last name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was this bad motherfucker from</v>

543
00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 1>the Ivory Coast.</v>

544
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember it as soon as this podcast</v>

545
00:28:56.131 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 1>is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember his name.</v>

546
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 1>It's driving me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

547
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Patrice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrice remark,</v>

548
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.590
<v Speaker 1>that's his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrice remark was his name,</v>

549
00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 1>was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not seeing,</v>

550
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 1>not seen was another guy who is also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad motherfucker.</v>

551
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

552
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>these guys were like at a very high</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

553
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

554
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>much better than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember going and watching them</v>

555
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:20.880
<v Speaker 1>compete made me better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing that level of</v>

556
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 1>competition and then all of a sudden in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind,</v>

557
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had higher expectations of myself and</v>

558
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:29.540
<v Speaker 1>a higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

559
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher ceiling I guess of potential.</v>

560
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I looked at all these guys and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>good they were and I realized what was</v>

561
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:40.200
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

562
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:45.230
<v Speaker 1>it sort of ramped up in my mind what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to do to be at my best.</v>

563
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 1>And immediately afterwards I went on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>win one of the biggest tournaments over</v>

564
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was um,</v>

565
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 1>well one of the biggest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>

566
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the bay state games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was right after I got back it just</v>

567
00:29:58.301 --> 00:29:59.940
<v Speaker 1>from watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got better.</v>

568
00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed point is we would watch these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

569
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these uh,</v>

570
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:10.600
<v Speaker 1>demos in quake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you could do is there was a,</v>

571
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 1>you had hit the till Dickey until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>key is that key that's right below the</v>

572
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 1>escape button on your laptop or your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your keyboard rather.</v>

573
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And it would pull this dropdown menu</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

574
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 1>like a control panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a dropdown menu.</v>

575
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:25.900
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like code,</v>

576
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:29.740
<v Speaker 1>like dos and you'd have to type in</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>

577
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you would do it,</v>

578
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 1>but you had to learn like what little</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols to use and stuff.</v>

579
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Like it was almost like kind of coding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could,</v>

580
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you could type in demo and you could run</v>
<v Speaker 1>a demo and then later on,</v>

581
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I think they put it in the menu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual menu of the game.</v>

582
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 1>But in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like especially the quake one days used</v>

583
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:56.580
<v Speaker 1>to have to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to have to know what to write in</v>

584
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the code and then you can record demo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would record a demo.</v>

585
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And this way you'd be watching the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>play out from the person's eyes.</v>

586
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Like you would watch their screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what they're seeing when they're</v>

587
00:31:10.091 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 1>playing the game and it made you better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely did.</v>

588
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:17.890
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's exciting to watch too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting to see if someone could</v>

589
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:21.730
<v Speaker 1>pull something off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd watch this a thresh guy or um,</v>

590
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 1>there was another guy named a mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a bad motherfucker and uh,</v>

591
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.320
<v Speaker 1>he was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy who was like one of the best</v>

592
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:29.660
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

593
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.830
<v Speaker 1>You'd watch him play and you just go</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese us.</v>

594
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would hit guys like there'd be an in</v>

595
00:31:34.891 --> 00:31:36.880
<v Speaker 1>mid air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like jumping and he would shoot them in</v>

596
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:39.850
<v Speaker 1>the face of the rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just he was so good.</v>

597
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 1>He would rail guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a rail gun.</v>

598
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:47.611
<v Speaker 1>Is this this a super high powered thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shoots this?</v>

599
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I guess like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what a rail is,</v>

600
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.930
<v Speaker 1>a ball or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has this cool like tracer behind</v>

601
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:58.210
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this laser tracer like show and</v>

602
00:31:58.211 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

603
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed in it,</v>

604
00:32:02.101 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 1>it's faster than a rocket and you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to,</v>

605
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to time it just absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>

606
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 1>And these guys would be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with those rail guns that were</v>

607
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:14.470
<v Speaker 1>just so impressive to someone who's suck</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me.</v>

608
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.610
<v Speaker 1>You did watch it.</v>

609
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>You watch it through their eyes and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

610
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And it just made you realize how bad you</v>
<v Speaker 1>socked and how good they are and how</v>

611
00:32:21.941 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 1>much you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much more you had to work at it.</v>

612
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the weird things about those</v>

613
00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:29.320
<v Speaker 1>games is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

614
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:33.820
<v Speaker 1>how deep the rabbit hole goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guys who are like really good,</v>

615
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.300
<v Speaker 1>they were so much better than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than someone like me who was kind okay.</v>

616
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Like I was okay as long as I was playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who sucked or somebody who was</v>

617
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at my level,</v>

618
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 1>we just really didn't know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

619
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.750
<v Speaker 1>And I was fucking playing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing like eight hours a day at</v>

620
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:53.840
<v Speaker 1>one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes even more completely obsessed.</v>

621
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

622
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it would fuck up all sorts of aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

623
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:02.531
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't get anything done that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be constantly like just engrossed in</v>

624
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 1>improving my performance in this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy game.</v>

625
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And playing it online too was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting because you'd be playing</v>

626
00:33:10.971 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 1>against a bunch of people and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would be,</v>

627
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real time essentially.</v>

628
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 1>There was a little bit of lag in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you would shoot and when it would</v>

629
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:23.030
<v Speaker 1>show up on the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon how fast your connection</v>

630
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:24.770
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had a pretty decent</v>

631
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cable modem or something like that</v>

632
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person was near you,</v>

633
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 1>like fairly close in the same city or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

634
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 1>or at least in the same state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get like really commensurate pings</v>

635
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have these awesome matches</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you'd be basically playing in real</v>

636
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 1>time against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so exciting.</v>

637
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.610
<v Speaker 1>And these levels that you would play on</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've never played it.</v>

638
00:33:47.611 --> 00:33:52.540
<v Speaker 1>3D shooter like unreal or quake or doom</v>
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>

639
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:53.121
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

640
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:54.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of them now,</v>

641
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 1>but these games that you would play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the graphics would be so intense,</v>

642
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:01.190
<v Speaker 1>there'd be all these wild maps that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would play on.</v>

643
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 1>It was just really exciting and so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more exciting than any other game or any</v>

644
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:08.710
<v Speaker 1>other thing that I've ever done before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

645
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of fighting,</v>

646
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a competitive way,</v>

647
00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:13.820
<v Speaker 1>which just completely engrossing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

648
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really had a problem with it for a</v>

649
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to this podcast for any</v>

650
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 1>length of episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's come up more than once.</v>

651
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I know I talk about the same things over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again sometimes.</v>

652
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always feel like somebody's,</v>

653
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 1>somebody's listening doesn't know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

654
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 1>And if I don't tell that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to make sense.</v>

655
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 1>The people that are the hardcore people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have heard this podcast,</v>

656
00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to a hundred plus episodes.</v>

657
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:46.040
<v Speaker 1>You probably have heard that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

658
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real issue is how many people that</v>

659
00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Speaker 1>are new that are tuning in for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time haven't,</v>

660
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to leave it out just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm worried that someone's</v>

661
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:56.144
<v Speaker 1>already heard it.</v>

662
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.250
<v Speaker 1>So I always try to put that caveat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

663
00:34:58.251 --> 00:35:00.170
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who have heard this</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

664
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

665
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:08.411
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my video game career as far as a,</v>

666
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it a career obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

667
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:16.270
<v Speaker 1>my period of obsession lasted a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and I eventually had to quit cold</v>

668
00:35:17.151 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to walk away cause it was just</v>

669
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 1>really interfering with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

670
00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another story that I've told</v>

671
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:26.360
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell it again just because</v>

672
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.150
<v Speaker 1>people haven't heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who was a manager of the</v>

673
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:30.680
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really nice guy.</v>

674
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 1>His name was rob and rob was a in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the comedy store once and he</v>

675
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:38.520
<v Speaker 1>said he was addicted to everquest</v>

676
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.370
<v Speaker 2>and everquest was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

677
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 2>like world of warcraft was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

678
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.880
<v Speaker 2>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

679
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.520
<v Speaker 2>role playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those multiperson weird world games</v>

680
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:51.511
<v Speaker 2>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

681
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:56.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sorcerer and you have either cloak</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go get a bag of gold and was wacky</v>

682
00:35:56.851 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 2>fucking games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was super addicted to it.</v>

683
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

684
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:08.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm so good at making money in the game</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

685
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 2>but so bad at making money in the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

686
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.970
<v Speaker 2>And the way he said it was like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation,</v>

687
00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:19.620
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was really devastated and he was</v>

688
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:20.810
<v Speaker 2>sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Pale,</v>

689
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.420
<v Speaker 2>looked like he hadn't seen his son and</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks he looked like he hadn't sleeping</v>

690
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.170
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His eyes were all fucked up from staring</v>

691
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:33.171
<v Speaker 2>at a computer screen every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the moment I think where I</v>

692
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:36.030
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

693
00:36:36.031 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 2>like these fucking things will sap you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have your life.</v>

694
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Like it might be fun while it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

695
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's over,</v>

696
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the memories,</v>

697
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're weird memories.</v>

698
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you play a game,</v>

699
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.840
<v Speaker 2>like say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

700
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.920
<v Speaker 2>play a baseball game and you knock a</v>
<v Speaker 2>home run out of the park and everybody</v>

701
00:36:57.961 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 2>cheers and he run the bases and you high</v>
<v Speaker 2>five your teammates,</v>

702
00:37:00.931 --> 00:37:04.410
<v Speaker 2>you have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real memory.</v>

703
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.670
<v Speaker 2>But if you play a guy in a video game</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you play for eight hours and you</v>

704
00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:12.750
<v Speaker 2>beat him in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy match when it's over,</v>

705
00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 2>he don't feel like anything really</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

706
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone's playing in a major</v>

707
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Speaker 2>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was just me because I have the,</v>

708
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the,</v>

709
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 2>the thought in my head that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasting my time like that,</v>

710
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should be doing other things.</v>

711
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I have things that I need to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm fucking off and playing this</v>

712
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:36.690
<v Speaker 2>video game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I had like a negative attachment</v>

713
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 2>to the idea of playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if I was like one of those</v>

714
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 2>dudes are like one of those starcraft</v>
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

715
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're familiar at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>with video games,</v>

716
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:46.620
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

717
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 2>if you are familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that they have these crazy star</v>

718
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:54.921
<v Speaker 2>craft tournament's in Korea and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they have been America too and</v>

719
00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Europe as well.</v>

720
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in Korea I know they're huge and</v>

721
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:04.390
<v Speaker 2>they fill up arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking like,</v>

722
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.580
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking Coliseum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 25,000 people and they have these</v>

723
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:13.581
<v Speaker 2>giant screens and people watch these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys play video games in real time and</v>

724
00:38:15.691 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 2>they cheer and they know like the moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when someone's doing something good,</v>

725
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:22.990
<v Speaker 2>they get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when someone's making a mistake</v>

726
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.450
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

727
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.150
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to watch.</v>

728
00:38:27.151 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 2>And I believe there's real money in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know there's,</v>

729
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:34.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that do play in video games and</v>

730
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>tournaments and then professional</v>

731
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.530
<v Speaker 1>video game leagues that can actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>make real money.</v>

732
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And then they make that money on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitch thing as well.</v>

733
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

734
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's twitch.com I guess they somehow or</v>

735
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

736
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>it's been explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot.</v>

737
00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

738
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you get paid per how</v>

739
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 1>many people are watching you or people</v>
<v Speaker 1>donate or,</v>

740
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make money.</v>

741
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 1>They make money off of twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

742
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:03.280
<v Speaker 1>So maybe those people that are playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

743
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 1>these big time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starcraft tournament's maybe to them it</v>

744
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:11.461
<v Speaker 1>feels the same way as it would feel if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a major league chess player and</v>

745
00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:14.210
<v Speaker 1>you won a tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear.</v>

746
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Because some games are highly respected</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some games nobody gives a fuck about</v>

747
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:22.810
<v Speaker 1>like games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They carry their own sort of,</v>

748
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really prejudice,</v>

749
00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 1>but games have their own little thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're attached to them,</v>

750
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like chess.</v>

751
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Chess is a thinking person's game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you tell someone you played</v>

752
00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:34.840
<v Speaker 1>chess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

753
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be smart.</v>

754
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells me to play poker.</v>

755
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:38.951
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

756
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you degenerate gambler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

757
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's games that people don't</v>

758
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:45.040
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you tell someone,</v>

759
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:46.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>

760
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I played for professional pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

761
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:50.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing.</v>

762
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like something like someone</v>

763
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:54.490
<v Speaker 1>saying they're a professional chess</v>
<v Speaker 1>master.</v>

764
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean a grandmaster of chess.</v>

765
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

766
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.050
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like very respectable.</v>

767
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Grand Masters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very close to grand wizard though.</v>

768
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.600
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the hilarious things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the KKK.</v>

769
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:12.910
<v Speaker 1>They've wizards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grand wizard.</v>

770
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a grand wizard of the KKK.</v>

771
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a wizard.</v>

772
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You fucking child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a wizard.</v>

773
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a fuck that I get.</v>

774
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Their point is there's no point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no point.</v>

775
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

776
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.300
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

777
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.510
<v Speaker 1>they scared the shit out of me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd cost me a few years of my life.</v>

778
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

779
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I had a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had fun,</v>

780
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.720
<v Speaker 1>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned that I have a problem with games</v>

781
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:42.670
<v Speaker 1>along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I already knew that because of pool.</v>

782
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that because of martial arts too,</v>

783
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 1>because martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar in a lot of ways to</v>

784
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.010
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most recent podcast,</v>

785
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Brian Callan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

786
00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that with,</v>

787
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:57.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about Josh Waitzkin who is</v>

788
00:40:57.641 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 1>a famous chess prodigy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

789
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he was the inspiration</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the movie,</v>

790
00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 1>searching for Bobby Fischer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for Bobby Fischer or searching</v>

791
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:13.810
<v Speaker 1>for Bobby Fischer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie with the Little Kid who was a</v>

792
00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:14.540
<v Speaker 1>chess master.</v>

793
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure Josh waitzkin was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

794
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.190
<v Speaker 1>a big part of the motivation or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration for that movie.</v>

795
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And he went on to become a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by Jujitsu,</v>

796
00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:29.740
<v Speaker 1>was a student of Marcello Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he's a black belt now.</v>

797
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 1>He's a brown belt back when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with them on online,</v>

798
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 1>were sending emails back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my friend Nathan was training</v>

799
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:38.780
<v Speaker 1>with him and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

800
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 1>he connected the two of us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

801
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:46.031
<v Speaker 1>Josh is a fascinating guy and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>also responsible for Marcello Garcia</v>

802
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 1>putting a lot of content online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

803
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm not wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Marcello Mig and action was a really</v>

804
00:41:56.271 --> 00:42:01.271
<v Speaker 1>interesting website where Marcello was</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly rolling with people rolling</v>

805
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:04.370
<v Speaker 1>with new people in a school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

806
00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:05.131
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

807
00:42:05.131 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 1>like people would come in and train with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

808
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Like Eddie went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo went down there and he</v>

809
00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:10.870
<v Speaker 1>trained with them and they film it.</v>

810
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 1>They put the role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sparring session online.</v>

811
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 1>But they're all very friendly sparring</v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions,</v>

812
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:16.791
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

813
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 1>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know,</v>

814
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Marcello Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is a fascinating character himself.</v>

815
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:26.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant Jujitsu player who's a really</v>

816
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 1>nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look at him and he's like kind</v>

817
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 1>of baby faced and smiley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just one of the best in the</v>

818
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:32.430
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

819
00:42:32.431 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't compete anymore.</v>

820
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.590
<v Speaker 1>He's getting older and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stepped down.</v>

821
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:37.181
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

822
00:42:37.181 --> 00:42:39.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to watch him compete in</v>

823
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.680
<v Speaker 1>2003 and Brazil in Sao Paulo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil.</v>

824
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was back when,</v>

825
00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo,</v>

826
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choked out.</v>

827
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Hoya gracie are tapped out horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie with a triangle choke.</v>

828
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 1>He was the first American never top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie.</v>

829
00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And in that main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

830
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 1>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's this huge Abu Dhabi submission</v>

831
00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Speaker 1>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The star of the show was Marcella</v>

832
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was without a doubt the star of the</v>

833
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

834
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:08.263
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

835
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:11.360
<v Speaker 1>fought this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a match with the Sky Victor</v>

836
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Shaolin who barrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a very respected Jujitsu guy and</v>

837
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:20.350
<v Speaker 1>he choked him unconscious and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a wild scramble.</v>

838
00:43:20.351 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 1>He caught his back and Shaolin tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll out of it and marcel just sunk it</v>

839
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 1>in deeper and deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before Shalon could even tap,</v>

840
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:29.540
<v Speaker 1>he was out cold and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

841
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Marcella was just running through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

842
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I remember we were all watching him</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

843
00:43:33.261 --> 00:43:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is this guy just came out of nowhere</v>

844
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:43.780
<v Speaker 1>and was just so dominant and so dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had some really specific moves</v>

845
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:47.810
<v Speaker 1>that he liked to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

846
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.840
<v Speaker 1>and particularly the way he would take</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's backs.</v>

847
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 1>He was so good at chokes and he also had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really scientific approach,</v>

848
00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he wouldn't want,</v>

849
00:43:58.521 --> 00:44:00.430
<v Speaker 1>if you guys can hear that the fan just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked off,</v>

850
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.903
<v Speaker 1>do you care?</v>

851
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.133
<v Speaker 1>No one cares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

852
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Bitch off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Off.</v>

853
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes.</v>

854
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

855
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.900
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

856
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.740
<v Speaker 1>an interesting approach where he had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few techniques that he would do,</v>

857
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:20.950
<v Speaker 1>but he would do them extremely well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he didn't have this gigantic</v>

858
00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 1>arsenal that he would attack with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would attack with gay teens and you</v>

859
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 1>attack with rear naked chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a lot of things that he</v>

860
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.680
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a big guy.</v>

861
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.390
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a big muscular guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the more interesting</v>

862
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 1>things about him when you look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a scary guy.</v>

863
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain Jujitsu guys,</v>

864
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you look at them and you go Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who some are Pahar s is one of the</v>

865
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:46.090
<v Speaker 1>best examples of that cause he's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>built like a freak.</v>

866
00:44:46.091 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Like he's built like the comic book</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of Wolverine.</v>

867
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 1>He's a short guy with giant muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just thick fucking neck,</v>

868
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 1>just terrifying guy rips people's legs</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart too and doesn't necessarily let go</v>

869
00:44:57.781 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>when they tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of known for that,</v>

870
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 1>which makes them even scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's injured a lot of guys,</v>

871
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but he looks like a scary guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at Marcello Garcia,</v>

872
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:09.240
<v Speaker 1>he's like a really smiley guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

873
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that it wasn't a</v>

874
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:14.190
<v Speaker 1>very physically nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't physically strong,</v>

875
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.640
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just explosive,</v>

876
00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:19.860
<v Speaker 1>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just really muscular guy.</v>

877
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:25.250
<v Speaker 1>He developed just razor sharp technique</v>
<v Speaker 1>and leverage and that's how he won his</v>

878
00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:28.350
<v Speaker 1>matches with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I ones matches,</v>

879
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 1>which made it even more impressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

880
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his main techniques were chokes.</v>

881
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So most of the time it's putting guys to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep or,</v>

882
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.610
<v Speaker 1>or forcing them to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a lot of techniques that</v>

883
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:45.990
<v Speaker 1>were really common well-respected</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques that he just never used.</v>

884
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 1>And he would openly talk about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Camorra,</v>

885
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a famous technique is actually</v>

886
00:45:51.481 --> 00:45:55.200
<v Speaker 1>called the double wrist lock in catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

887
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>catch wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people think about pro wrestling,</v>

888
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:02.610
<v Speaker 1>we think about pro wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about like Hulk Hogan and the</v>

889
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Rock and the Seattle tricks and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre scripted events.</v>

890
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>But wrestling used to be at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

891
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:16.250
<v Speaker 1>it used to be an actual match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was actual professional</v>

892
00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:19.110
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

893
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.320
<v Speaker 1>a style of wrestling called catch or</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch as catch can think.</v>

894
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:27.660
<v Speaker 1>That's how they would say and catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

895
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:32.661
<v Speaker 1>There's like these guys like Karl gotch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and farmer Burns and a lot of guys who</v>

896
00:46:33.571 --> 00:46:35.470
<v Speaker 1>wound up teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

897
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:40.550
<v Speaker 1>some modern day MMA fighters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling competitors like Josh Barnett.</v>

898
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett is probably the most famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the most successful catch wrestling</v>

899
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:53.030
<v Speaker 1>enthusiast and practitioner like Josh</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barnett is tapped out some really famous</v>

900
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu competitors like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

901
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:02.790
<v Speaker 1>here on Gracie or a dean lister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dean lister being an incredibly</v>

902
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.990
<v Speaker 1>impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Dean hadn't tapped to anybody</v>

903
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say at least 10 years when</v>

904
00:47:10.021 --> 00:47:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Josh finished him in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

905
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 1>this competition called metamorris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

906
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what wrestling used to be.</v>

907
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And they had a bunch of submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of the submissions that we</v>

908
00:47:22.651 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 1>think of as Jujitsu submissions also</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed in catch wrestling.</v>

909
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 1>And I guess when people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

910
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 1>grappling,</v>

911
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people been grappling through at the</v>

912
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 2>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

913
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 2>when people first started fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably how they fought each</v>

914
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:39.460
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably grabbed each other and got</v>

915
00:47:39.461 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 2>close enough to bite or hang onto each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

916
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 2>And then slowly people started</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing,</v>

917
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:44.981
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 2>when I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to keep the guy away from me.</v>

919
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Or when I do this I can hold onto them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I used to hold them like this,</v>

920
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 2>but now I realize when I hold him like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

921
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:55.540
<v Speaker 2>it works even better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

922
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:56.351
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I do this,</v>

923
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:57.730
<v Speaker 2>it really hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I do this,</v>

924
00:47:57.731 --> 00:47:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>

925
00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

926
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 2>back in the days of the spartans and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romans,</v>

927
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 2>if you look at some of the statues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was in Italy recently and we</v>

928
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:09.370
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to Rome and we,</v>

929
00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:10.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at some of the,</v>

930
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 2>the artwork of the Vatican in</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

931
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.160
<v Speaker 2>There's just a lot of statues of guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>

932
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of looks like,</v>

933
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:19.480
<v Speaker 2>like grappling holds and grappling</v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

934
00:48:19.481 --> 00:48:24.481
<v Speaker 2>So it's been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what Brazilian Jujitsu really was,</v>

935
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:30.420
<v Speaker 2>is these guys who are not very big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elio and Carlos Gracie of there,</v>

936
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.040
<v Speaker 2>they weren't the biggest guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

937
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 2>There were small and they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically strong and they figured out</v>

938
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:40.930
<v Speaker 2>how to use technique and leverage to</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome physical strength.</v>

939
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 2>And one of the matches that Eylea got in</v>
<v Speaker 2>early in his career,</v>

940
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:48.520
<v Speaker 2>he would have these crazy matches with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

941
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.700
<v Speaker 2>He had a match with this guy named</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kimora and Kamora caught him in,</v>

942
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what catch wrestling would call a double</v>

943
00:48:58.691 --> 00:49:03.691
<v Speaker 2>wrist lock where you clamp down one hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the wrist and then you throw an over</v>

944
00:49:05.441 --> 00:49:10.441
<v Speaker 2>hook around the arm and clamp your other</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand down on your wrist.</v>

945
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.950
<v Speaker 2>So you have one hand on his wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one hand on your wrist and it creates</v>

946
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 2>this awesome fulcrum point and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate someone's arm.</v>

947
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:24.300
<v Speaker 2>But Marcello Garcia always felt like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that position required a lot of physical</v>

948
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:27.130
<v Speaker 2>strength and he wasn't a very strong</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

949
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 2>so he just abandoned that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just decided it wasn't an option and</v>

950
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 2>it was just going to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily on things that were sort of</v>

951
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.110
<v Speaker 2>just had ultimate technique to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And chokes pretty much have ultimate</v>

952
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:43.420
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why I chose an</v>

953
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:46.960
<v Speaker 2>ultimate technique is if someone lands</v>
<v Speaker 2>it perfectly,</v>

954
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:51.220
<v Speaker 2>they you go unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas an Armbar like guys have gotten</v>

955
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:56.221
<v Speaker 2>their arm broken before and come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fought and won and had their heart</v>

956
00:49:57.050 --> 00:50:01.270
<v Speaker 2>are awfully hyperextended and come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and won.</v>

957
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Like a perfect example in Jujitsu is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hodrick gracie versus joc arrays is a</v>

958
00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:11.590
<v Speaker 2>very famous match between two guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are competing in mma now.</v>

959
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.620
<v Speaker 2>But back when they were fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

960
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:18.630
<v Speaker 2>they were amongst the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Hydro Gracie caught jock Ra in an</v>

961
00:50:20.921 --> 00:50:25.210
<v Speaker 2>arm bar and snapped his arm and jockey</v>
<v Speaker 2>would not tap,</v>

962
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 2>he would not tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he fought out of it.</v>

963
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 1>And eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

964
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.820
<v Speaker 1>he was ahead on points when he got up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

965
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 1>when he got out of the arm bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his arm was just destroyed.</v>

966
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:40.610
<v Speaker 1>So if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might've even tucked his arm</v>

967
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:45.850
<v Speaker 1>inside his belt and just kept going</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the time limit ran out.</v>

968
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And then a raised his one good arm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>got all excited and you know,</v>

969
00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:56.150
<v Speaker 1>had one because he gutted it out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not tap when this guy snapped his</v>

970
00:50:56.151 --> 00:50:59.090
<v Speaker 1>fucking arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is by the way,</v>

971
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 1>professional Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even mma.</v>

972
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 1>This is not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

973
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:07.160
<v Speaker 1>a Rhonda Rousey match or a conor</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor fight where they're making</v>

974
00:51:07.161 --> 00:51:10.490
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much money this guy was</v>

975
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 1>getting paid for for this Jujitsu match</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his sponsors and how much it was</v>

976
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:17.780
<v Speaker 1>actually worth to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as his pride,</v>

977
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it was worth it to him to actually get</v>
<v Speaker 1>his arm broken instead of tapping,</v>

978
00:51:21.741 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking crazy.</v>

979
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so boy,</v>

980
00:51:27.771 --> 00:51:31.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a long and circuitous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lost my own train of thought.</v>

981
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:36.550
<v Speaker 1>My train of thought was that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain techniques that you could really</v>

982
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 1>hurt a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have to quit.</v>

983
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.640
<v Speaker 1>And Hydro Gracie landed the perfect arm</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar on Joc array,</v>

984
00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.510
<v Speaker 1>broke his arm and jock rates still won</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight on points at least.</v>

985
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had been fighting old school</v>

986
00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:52.790
<v Speaker 1>gracie way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your probably would have eventually got</v>

987
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:55.910
<v Speaker 1>him because Jacari really couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend himself correctly anymore.</v>

988
00:51:55.911 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would eventually,</v>

989
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.050
<v Speaker 1>since he's only got one arm to defend</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

990
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.810
<v Speaker 1>heidrick probably would have wound up</v>
<v Speaker 1>choking them or catching him in</v>

991
00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:04.340
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

992
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible he wouldn't,</v>

993
00:52:06.351 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's totally possible that Shakuri</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with a broken arm could have gotten</v>

994
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:12.530
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point being when you choke</v>

995
00:52:12.531 --> 00:52:15.050
<v Speaker 1>someone to sleep instead of break their</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>

996
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 1>they can't do anything.</v>

997
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:17.740
<v Speaker 1>They're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

998
00:52:17.741 --> 00:52:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you put them to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was Marcello Garcia,</v>

999
00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 1>his philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized that he could just put</v>

1000
00:52:24.231 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>someone to sleep and then they could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>no debate as to whether or not he was</v>

1001
00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:31.830
<v Speaker 1>going to win and no debate as to whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not the,</v>

1002
00:52:31.831 --> 00:52:34.730
<v Speaker 1>the move was actually efficient or</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective.</v>

1003
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It was obviously affected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was asleep.</v>

1004
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.941
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1005
00:52:37.941 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 1>that's what we saw in Brazil when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought a Shaolin and just put him to</v>

1006
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1007
00:52:42.621 --> 00:52:44.510
<v Speaker 1>seconds too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy,</v>

1008
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 1>crazy video that you could watch on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

1009
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Josh Waitzkin,</v>

1010
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 1>who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1011
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:57.100
<v Speaker 1>a student of Marcello's put all of 'em</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcello's moves and sort of just sort</v>

1012
00:52:58.641 --> 00:53:00.830
<v Speaker 1>of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as something that people can learn from</v>

1013
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:05.831
<v Speaker 1>and grow from and put it all online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Games doing podcast.</v>

1014
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.500
<v Speaker 1>So Josh who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously because of he's a chess</v>

1015
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:16.790
<v Speaker 1>prodigy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fascinated by games and chess being</v>

1016
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:21.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the most intellectually inspiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>games got really into Jujitsu as well.</v>

1017
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>So I just know because of the way I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>into martial arts and the way I got into</v>

1018
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:27.750
<v Speaker 1>video games and pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1019
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:32.640
<v Speaker 1>there's something about those weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges that can really,</v>

1020
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.900
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1021
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>really excite the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is I don't necessarily</v>

1022
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 1>know if they have the same kind of real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world benefits as getting really good at</v>

1023
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:47.070
<v Speaker 1>a sport or getting really good at an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual physical activity where you move</v>

1024
00:53:47.071 --> 00:53:49.980
<v Speaker 1>around and do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1025
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1026
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 1>but we will eventually do a doom podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will,</v>

1027
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:59.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will prepare myself where I make sure</v>

1028
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 1>that there's no fucking way I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely and totally addicted anymore.</v>

1029
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Cause I've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>

1030
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1031
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1032
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 1>other questions here who will do</v>
<v Speaker 1>international paper view instead of you?</v>

1033
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know what that question is</v>

1034
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:21.960
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

1035
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:25.680
<v Speaker 1>decided recently I was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time it was going to not</v>

1036
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:29.220
<v Speaker 1>work for the UFC anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to just do these fight</v>

1037
00:54:29.221 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 1>companion podcasts that I do with Eddie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bravo and Brendan Schaub and Brian</v>

1038
00:54:34.051 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 1>counts sometimes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people sometimes too,</v>

1039
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 1>when those guys were out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did one recently with Joey Diaz was</v>

1040
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:42.210
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ones ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what did it,</v>

1041
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.270
<v Speaker 1>what the fight companions are as we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit around and we'd watch the fights and</v>

1042
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 1>we talk some shit and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not working that way.</v>

1043
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just work a little bit too much,</v>

1044
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between standup comedy,</v>

1045
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.510
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy,</v>

1046
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.720
<v Speaker 1>doing podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching the guests,</v>

1047
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:05.430
<v Speaker 1>researching subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm researching potential guests.</v>

1048
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then life,</v>

1049
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other things that I have to do</v>

1050
00:55:11.111 --> 00:55:13.380
<v Speaker 1>was exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>

1051
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 1>forget about family time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that other stuff is,</v>

1052
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also there's a lot of time that is</v>

1053
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 1>already accounted for.</v>

1054
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a ufc and I had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what things I wasn't,</v>

1055
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what things I could cut back on.</v>

1056
00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to cut back on family</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1057
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to,</v>

1058
00:55:31.321 --> 00:55:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to cut back on my</v>

1059
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:36.780
<v Speaker 1>recreational activities because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me sane for,</v>

1060
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.950
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

1061
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I need a bunch of stuff that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

1062
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't just work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1063
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:45.620
<v Speaker 1>even though work is awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love doing stand up,</v>

1064
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

1065
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I even love doing the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1066
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1067
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a very exciting job and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>honor to be able to do,</v>

1068
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1069
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 1>it's work and it requires energy and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires focus.</v>

1070
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have so much energy and so much</v>

1071
00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:15.111
<v Speaker 1>focus and you could be in a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you almost are two fortunate and</v>

1072
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have too many things that you enjoy.</v>

1073
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I kind of found myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1074
00:56:21.601 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's</v>

1075
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>what I decided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sided decided what I'm going to do is</v>

1076
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I am going to only do North American</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper view.</v>

1077
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more fox shows,</v>

1078
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 2>no more long international flights</v>
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

1079
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:41.860
<v Speaker 2>those things fucking wreck your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're wreck me.</v>

1080
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I would do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for days like I just got back</v>

1081
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:47.050
<v Speaker 2>from Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me like a week,</v>

1082
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 2>like at least four or five days before I</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt it felt normal again.</v>

1083
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your buys all fucked up,</v>

1084
00:56:53.171 --> 00:56:55.060
<v Speaker 2>you're jet lagged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're confused,</v>

1085
00:56:55.061 --> 00:56:57.490
<v Speaker 2>you're exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just feel,</v>

1086
00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.580
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you're at 60% all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1087
00:57:00.581 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 2>You're always trying to push through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1088
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:08.101
<v Speaker 2>it's a drag enthusiasm and having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitality like physical vitality and</v>

1089
00:57:08.471 --> 00:57:13.471
<v Speaker 2>feeling good and feeling healthy is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big factor in life for me.</v>

1090
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1091
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like feeling good.</v>

1092
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I like being healthy when I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>something is going to make me feel</v>

1093
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:25.390
<v Speaker 2>physically bad and make me feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy.</v>

1094
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I try to avoid as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1095
00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sometimes I give in like,</v>

1096
00:57:30.851 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll have a couple of drinks with</v>

1097
00:57:32.591 --> 00:57:36.190
<v Speaker 2>some friends and we get a little crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the next day I'm like,</v>

1098
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you dummy.</v>

1099
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I've done that before obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even the,</v>

1100
00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:44.620
<v Speaker 2>like a hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel better in a day.</v>

1101
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking jet lags like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1102
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.920
<v Speaker 2>a flight from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oops,</v>

1103
00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 2>a flight from Sydney just knocked over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phone,</v>

1104
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.710
<v Speaker 2>a flight from Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

1105
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 2>That shit takes me a long time to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>better from a,</v>

1106
00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to become complaining here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point being,</v>

1107
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I try to avoid things that make me feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty physically.</v>

1108
00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:12.930
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately a lot of flying makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel shitty and especially flying</v>

1109
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:16.030
<v Speaker 2>along hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who's going to do the international</v>

1110
00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:18.100
<v Speaker 2>paper views?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with the way they're doing it</v>

1111
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:21.940
<v Speaker 2>now is Dan Hardee was a former fighter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1112
00:58:21.941 --> 00:58:23.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been a guest on his podcast.</v>

1113
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:26.620
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking awesome guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Smart Dude.</v>

1114
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Super tuned in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting and intelligent guy.</v>

1115
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.240
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan actually trained with Dan for years.</v>

1116
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Back in the day when Dan used to train</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu,</v>

1117
00:58:40.091 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 2>whenever he was in town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was getting ready for a fight.</v>

1118
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.310
<v Speaker 2>He would come to a Eddie bravos gym and</v>
<v Speaker 2>train.</v>

1119
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I trained with them multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Nice Guy.</v>

1120
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.820
<v Speaker 2>So Dan Hardee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll probably do a lot of them.</v>

1121
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.900
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Stann who is fantastic,</v>

1122
00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:59.290
<v Speaker 2>who was also been on his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll do a lot of them.</v>

1123
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's also,</v>

1124
00:59:01.961 --> 00:59:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Kenny Florian is also great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll do,</v>

1125
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they worked that out.</v>

1126
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Like who does what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are the ones that we're going</v>

1127
00:59:08.291 --> 00:59:09.580
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1128
00:59:09.581 --> 00:59:11.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the answer to that.</v>

1129
00:59:11.951 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 2>You fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1130
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know.</v>

1131
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what's gonna happen with this</v>

1132
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:23.960
<v Speaker 2>new ownership thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either there's a bunch of new people</v>

1133
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took over the UFC now that u of c is</v>

1134
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:30.740
<v Speaker 2>still going to be run by Dana White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why I</v>

1135
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:35.390
<v Speaker 2>decided to stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a,</v>

1136
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana and I are or close,</v>

1137
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:39.730
<v Speaker 2>we've been good friends for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1138
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous about was the idea that Dana was</v>

1139
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 2>going to leave and some suits are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take over and then I was going to</v>

1140
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 2>have to have meetings with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to tell me what I could or</v>

1141
00:59:50.781 --> 00:59:54.980
<v Speaker 2>couldn't say or give me advice on how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it or any of that stupid shit.</v>

1142
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:56.330
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

1143
00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was answering the question for me,</v>

1144
00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 2>like what am I going to cut back in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

1145
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.380
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I heard that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about selling,</v>

1146
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:04.214
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're,</v>

1147
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:08.030
<v Speaker 2>that answered it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as time went on and I really thought</v>

1148
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 2>more and more about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1149
01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I really thought that I would miss it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to.</v>

1150
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.390
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1151
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to sound Corny,</v>

1152
01:00:15.831 --> 01:00:18.110
<v Speaker 2>but all the love that I got from people</v>
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

1153
01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:22.040
<v Speaker 2>it influenced my be my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thinking too made me think that I</v>

1154
01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 2>probably should think about sticking it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1155
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:26.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1156
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.130
<v Speaker 2>that's the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I think about the Fermi paradox?</v>

1157
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:35.030
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know what the Fermi paradox</v>

1158
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual definition is you to here,</v>

1159
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 2>the actual definition is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about aliens.</v>

1160
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:45.050
<v Speaker 2>The question is where are okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>

1161
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Where is everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is if there is an is named</v>

1162
01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to the wikipedia.</v>

1163
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.620
<v Speaker 2>The fermi paradox is named after Enrico</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fermi,</v>

1164
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the apparent contradiction between</v>

1165
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:01.160
<v Speaker 2>the lack of evidence and the high</v>
<v Speaker 2>probability estimates,</v>

1166
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:06.340
<v Speaker 2>those given by the drake equation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the existence of extraterrestrial</v>

1167
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:11.350
<v Speaker 2>civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the drake equation is it's,</v>

1168
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an equation that's here.</v>

1169
01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to the wikipedia that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's used to arrive at an estimate of</v>

1170
01:01:20.181 --> 01:01:25.181
<v Speaker 2>the number of active communicative</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraterrestrial civilizations in the</v>

1171
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.613
<v Speaker 2>Milky Way Galaxy.</v>

1172
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:33.790
<v Speaker 2>And the Fermi paradox is if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the stars in our galaxy alone,</v>

1173
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:40.430
<v Speaker 2>billions of stars and billions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>galaxies,</v>

1174
01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.000
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of billions of stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of billions of galaxies,</v>

1175
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.370
<v Speaker 2>many of them which are many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1176
01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:50.450
<v Speaker 2>many years older than our galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years older than our planet.</v>

1177
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:56.590
<v Speaker 2>The question is why haven't these aliens</v>
<v Speaker 2>contacted us?</v>

1178
01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Where is everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the question.</v>

1179
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>The fermi paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about this a lot,</v>

1180
01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 2>so I'm actually happy about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

1181
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling that our ideas about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a society or what civilization does</v>

1182
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.320
<v Speaker 2>as it advances are based entirely on our</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that we are dependent upon the</v>

1183
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:27.531
<v Speaker 2>monkey body that were dependent upon the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical flesh and the idea of being</v>

1184
01:02:29.611 --> 01:02:34.611
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in a measurable way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way you can experience</v>

1185
01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:36.910
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1186
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

1187
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 2>that's an error on our part.</v>

1188
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that we are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to the physical body forever.</v>

1189
01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Does it sounds like hippie nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silly woo bullshit.</v>

1190
01:02:52.891 --> 01:02:57.891
<v Speaker 2>But this is my thought behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that first of all we are moving</v>

1191
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:04.641
<v Speaker 2>closer and closer every day to being</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated with technology and by</v>

1192
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>integrated with technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think initially it's going to happen</v>

1193
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:14.060
<v Speaker 2>where there's going to be some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>chip that we have in our body,</v>

1194
01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.300
<v Speaker 2>whether it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that we use that it helps us,</v>

1195
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>enhances our vision or enhances our</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental function or our ability to</v>

1196
01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 2>communicate with each other or our</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to access information.</v>

1197
01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:31.830
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that it might</v>
<v Speaker 2>start out as some sort of a helmet that</v>

1198
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:33.870
<v Speaker 2>we put on that lets us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1199
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like a ball cap with</v>
<v Speaker 2>electrodes on it and you put this thing</v>

1200
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:43.671
<v Speaker 2>on and it stimulates areas of your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>that allow you to see these images.</v>

1201
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 2>And maybe perhaps like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>screen like minority report,</v>

1202
01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:52.500
<v Speaker 2>like it'll be in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will,</v>

1203
01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:54.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to access data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

1204
01:03:54.571 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to ask it questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have is hey siri function.</v>

1205
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.120
<v Speaker 2>We have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri,</v>

1206
01:04:00.121 --> 01:04:01.350
<v Speaker 2>function on our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1207
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:05.340
<v Speaker 2>our phones that people get pissed off</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say it.</v>

1208
01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 2>When I say those words on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you have an android phone,</v>

1209
01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you have an iphone,</v>

1210
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you have that option on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone says those words,</v>

1211
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your phone goes buddy.</v>

1212
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Like you're asking it a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>

1213
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the fellow?</v>

1214
01:04:19.381 --> 01:04:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Get a blow job around here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

1215
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Ask it some questions and it'll actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer you.</v>

1216
01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:25.771
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

1217
01:04:25.771 --> 01:04:27.180
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Siri called Dunkin.</v>

1218
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.930
<v Speaker 2>It'll call Dunkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1219
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate to the Hollywood bowl.</v>

1220
01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:34.800
<v Speaker 2>It'll give you the directions to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hollywood bowl in real time.</v>

1221
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.800
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's science fiction.</v>

1222
01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 2>It's something that just a few years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>was completely outside of our</v>

1223
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.560
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really didn't think that they were</v>

1224
01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:46.560
<v Speaker 2>going to have something that sat on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>table next to you.</v>

1225
01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:51.561
<v Speaker 2>Some small little sliver of glass and</v>
<v Speaker 2>metal and whatever the fuck it's made of</v>

1226
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:53.490
<v Speaker 2>electrodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1227
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>it's in their silicone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you could talk to that thing and</v>

1228
01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:57.750
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri.</v>

1229
01:04:57.930 --> 01:04:58.763
<v Speaker 2>And it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1230
01:04:58.770 --> 01:04:59.491
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

1231
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Hey Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the Fermi paradox?</v>

1232
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:06.390
<v Speaker 2>And it would google it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all something that's going on</v>

1233
01:05:06.391 --> 01:05:11.391
<v Speaker 2>right now and this is just one step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one step in what is really as long</v>

1234
01:05:14.221 --> 01:05:19.221
<v Speaker 2>as human being stay alive as long we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get nuked as long as we don't murk</v>

1235
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as we don't get fucked up by a</v>

1236
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:27.661
<v Speaker 2>super volcano or an asteroid or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>polar shift or some natural disaster.</v>

1237
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>As long as that doesn't happen and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not,</v>

1238
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>we not obviously not me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people smarter than me who do this</v>

1239
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:39.040
<v Speaker 2>kind of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to continue to innovate</v>

1240
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.810
<v Speaker 2>and as they continue to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get technology that is</v>

1241
01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:48.811
<v Speaker 2>more and more powerful and I think more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more integrated in our,</v>

1242
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.630
<v Speaker 2>in our our lives and in our physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

1243
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:56.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to reach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a bottleneck where</v>

1244
01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 2>holding a device in your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't have the same effect or</v>

1245
01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:06.271
<v Speaker 2>do the same amount of things as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do if they actually put it in your</v>

1246
01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:10.600
<v Speaker 2>head and I think people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking volunteer for it.</v>

1247
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I think they're going to volunteer for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1248
01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Like they volunteer for braces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they get eyeglasses at the</v>

1249
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:21.031
<v Speaker 2>optometrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they get fake tits people got,</v>

1250
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.070
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get these things put in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies and it's going to be really</v>

1251
01:06:24.071 --> 01:06:26.770
<v Speaker 2>common and maybe won't even have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your brain.</v>

1252
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that'll be the the hold back</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like I don't want to my brain,</v>

1253
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:30.851
<v Speaker 2>and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1254
01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:32.500
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put on your wrist.</v>

1255
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>It'll communicate with your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the nervous system or through</v>

1256
01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:39.370
<v Speaker 2>electrical impulses through your tissue</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1257
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that along with some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hat that you put on that allows you to</v>

1258
01:06:45.191 --> 01:06:48.550
<v Speaker 2>interface with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be us step.</v>

1259
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:52.630
<v Speaker 2>But somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to guys like Ray Kurzweil</v>

1260
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:57.870
<v Speaker 2>who believe ray believes that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to eventually be able to download</v>

1261
01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:03.061
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness into a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course gets really fucking</v>

1262
01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 2>weird because what are you then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you still there?</v>

1263
01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you download your consciousness into</v>

1264
01:07:11.651 --> 01:07:13.480
<v Speaker 2>a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you still existing in the physical</v>

1265
01:07:13.481 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 2>sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you exist in the physical sense</v>

1266
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.230
<v Speaker 2>and your consciousness is downloaded</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a computer to do the,</v>

1267
01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:25.060
<v Speaker 2>to get to talk to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are you like,</v>

1268
01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:31.590
<v Speaker 2>do you end your life in the physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense and then begin one in a digital</v>

1269
01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:34.090
<v Speaker 2>sense and as it even a life.</v>

1270
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.320
<v Speaker 2>But if it exists and some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix like state,</v>

1271
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.600
<v Speaker 2>if they could figure out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1272
01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:42.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people today that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

1273
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:47.440
<v Speaker 2>they're not happy with the life that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been handed with the,</v>

1274
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the roll of the dice.</v>

1275
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have physical deformities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they have poor health.</v>

1276
01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1277
01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:00.430
<v Speaker 2>people that just got a shitty hand when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to life.</v>

1278
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Like a life is not even in the cards of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deals.</v>

1279
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all know this,</v>

1280
01:08:06.221 --> 01:08:10.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if someone came along like a,</v>

1281
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>what was that guy's name and the Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who a wound up selling,</v>

1282
01:08:14.801 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 2>everybody who just said he wanted it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be famous or rich or something like</v>

1283
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's eating a steak in the Matrix and</v>

1284
01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 2>decides to give in that that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

1285
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>If someone comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1286
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:33.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to live this life in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical sense anymore,</v>

1287
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:38.740
<v Speaker 2>instead of being dependent upon this</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey body and the tooth Fang and claw</v>

1288
01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:45.790
<v Speaker 2>of natural selection and evolution and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this just the struggle,</v>

1289
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 2>the struggle of being a fucking human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

1290
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Instead of that you can exist in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect state where you are constantly</v>

1291
01:08:56.511 --> 01:09:01.511
<v Speaker 2>in love and just filled with joy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a wonderful life filled with only</v>

1292
01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:09.341
<v Speaker 2>positive experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can enjoy this with,</v>

1293
01:09:10.461 --> 01:09:13.880
<v Speaker 2>with no negative repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just,</v>

1294
01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can become a part of the matrix,</v>

1295
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:19.460
<v Speaker 2>a part of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they're going to call it.</v>

1296
01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.760
<v Speaker 2>And from there you will be the architect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your existence.</v>

1297
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:25.380
<v Speaker 2>You will be able to decide this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that law.</v>

1298
01:09:25.381 --> 01:09:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad days,</v>

1299
01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.490
<v Speaker 2>they make you feel good about the good</v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

1300
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no sunshine without rain.</v>

1301
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to have good and evil.</v>

1302
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's here,</v>

1303
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>that's in this state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this physical state.</v>

1304
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have good and you have to</v>

1305
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:42.110
<v Speaker 2>have eagle as we know it right now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this life.</v>

1306
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.460
<v Speaker 2>We do appreciate our loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When something terrible happens,</v>

1307
01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:48.680
<v Speaker 2>when there's a tragedy happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1308
01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:49.610
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>

1309
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate the people that are alive.</v>

1310
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 2>When someone we care about dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are all,</v>

1311
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.350
<v Speaker 2>those are all true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that the only way that we can</v>

1312
01:09:57.351 --> 01:10:00.230
<v Speaker 2>appreciate each other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the only way we can enjoy life?</v>

1313
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Some people would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they'd really know.</v>

1314
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're basing that on what we have</v>

1315
01:10:07.071 --> 01:10:10.610
<v Speaker 2>experienced and what we would currently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data we're pulling from being a</v>

1316
01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 2>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living on earth.</v>

1317
01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:16.940
<v Speaker 2>If someone can engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not something that might</v>

1318
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.750
<v Speaker 2>happen in a year or in a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>

1319
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 2>we might be talking about something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens at a thousand years or 2000</v>

1320
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:25.640
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

1321
01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.560
<v Speaker 2>But around the same time where we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1322
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:33.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically based civilization would</v>

1323
01:10:33.861 --> 01:10:38.861
<v Speaker 2>develop the capability of star travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being able to travel not just into,</v>

1324
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another solar system,</v>

1325
01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:46.730
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps he'd do another galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe hundreds of galaxies away,</v>

1326
01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:51.500
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that kind of incredible ability to</v>

1327
01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:55.820
<v Speaker 2>control your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might not ever get there and we might</v>

1328
01:10:55.821 --> 01:11:00.821
<v Speaker 2>not ever get there because we realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that being there physically is not</v>

1329
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 2>nearly as important as the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like um,</v>

1330
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you know I've often said this about</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics that people say,</v>

1331
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:11.271
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1332
01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>you have a psychedelic drug experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1333
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:13.741
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1334
01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 2>you're imagining things are happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hallucinating.</v>

1335
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1336
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:19.500
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>

1337
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Like it might not actually be happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have this experience,</v>

1338
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:29.400
<v Speaker 2>we take a psychedelic drug and you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>transported to the center of the</v>

1339
01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>universe and you are communicating with</v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

1340
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.880
<v Speaker 2>with love in the form of beautifully lit</v>
<v Speaker 2>neon geometric patterns that are</v>

1341
01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:44.070
<v Speaker 2>constantly changing and morphing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're filling you up with a wisdom</v>

1342
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:48.060
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and joy and appreciation.</v>

1343
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:49.921
<v Speaker 2>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1344
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a hallucination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're taking a drug and you're having a</v>

1345
01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:57.381
<v Speaker 2>hallucination maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But either way the experience is still</v>

1346
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the experience of meeting God</v>

1347
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:07.790
<v Speaker 2>because you took mushrooms and and</v>
<v Speaker 2>having this incredible meeting with the,</v>

1348
01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.620
<v Speaker 2>the divine force of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1349
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:18.710
<v Speaker 2>if that happens in real life or if that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in a psychedelic drug trip,</v>

1350
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:22.620
<v Speaker 2>the feeling and the experience are still</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

1351
01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:27.750
<v Speaker 2>It might not be a real physical thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sense of you might not be able</v>

1352
01:12:27.751 --> 01:12:31.950
<v Speaker 2>to take it and put it in a pillowcase</v>
<v Speaker 2>and throw it on a scale and weigh it,</v>

1353
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 2>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's to say you could ever do that</v>

1354
01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:39.270
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's the exact same experience of</v>

1355
01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 2>meeting God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be just as good as my point.</v>

1356
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.570
<v Speaker 2>So this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I don't want to live in the matrix,</v>

1357
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:48.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1358
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I want to live in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>

1359
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:57.360
<v Speaker 2>What's the benefit of the real world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the only reason why we think</v>

1360
01:12:57.361 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 2>that the real world contains some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of benefit for us is because that's the</v>

1361
01:13:02.221 --> 01:13:07.200
<v Speaker 2>only model that we have to go on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the pattern that we've been</v>

1362
01:13:07.201 --> 01:13:10.830
<v Speaker 2>following our whole lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That this idea that you know you live</v>

1363
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:13.640
<v Speaker 2>and then you die and then you do your</v>
<v Speaker 2>best along the way.</v>

1364
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you got to push through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain and sometimes you got to fucking</v>

1365
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.420
<v Speaker 2>get up in the morning where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get up and you gotta.</v>

1366
01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 2>You gotta work hard and when you work</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard it pays off and you get a good life</v>

1367
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:26.190
<v Speaker 2>and you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your discipline equals your freedom and</v>

1368
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:27.840
<v Speaker 2>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of thoughts that we have</v>

1369
01:13:27.841 --> 01:13:32.700
<v Speaker 2>about living life that are applicable to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this physical knock on wood life.</v>

1370
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:35.700
<v Speaker 2>It's real life that you and I are</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing right now.</v>

1371
01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Everybody listening to this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a pug your phone and you had to</v>

1372
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.820
<v Speaker 2>listen to it on a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to touch some things and</v>

1373
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:45.970
<v Speaker 2>something had to happen for you to free</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experience something in a,</v>

1374
01:13:45.971 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a real sense.</v>

1375
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 2>But that's just because this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're used to.</v>

1376
01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:52.621
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1377
01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:56.400
<v Speaker 2>we're definitely not used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if she would talk about human</v>

1378
01:13:56.401 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you went back 200 years ago or</v>

1379
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>definitely not used to the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're definitely not used to movies.</v>

1380
01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 2>200 years ago we didn't even have</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking cars.</v>

1381
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.770
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted a picture of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to draw it.</v>

1382
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>We're used to all these things now we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to photograph.</v>

1383
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 2>The idea of not being able to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>photos on vacation is alien.</v>

1384
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 2>The idea of having to get in a boat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel across the country.</v>

1385
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Like I was talking about how I just got</v>
<v Speaker 2>back from Italy,</v>

1386
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:31.480
<v Speaker 2>if I lived in the 18 hundreds I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had to been on a boat for months.</v>

1387
01:14:31.481 --> 01:14:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I would have had to made it from</v>
<v Speaker 2>California all the way to New York and</v>

1388
01:14:35.741 --> 01:14:38.230
<v Speaker 2>then I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have had to been in a fucking boat</v>

1389
01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 2>and gone across the ocean the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandparents did when they were</v>

1390
01:14:43.001 --> 01:14:46.510
<v Speaker 2>little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandparents came over here from</v>

1391
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Italy when they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1392
01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I think my grandfather was like seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

1393
01:14:50.471 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I think he said I would've had to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>done all that stuff.</v>

1394
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1395
01:14:56.050 --> 01:15:01.050
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of no photos is alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of no movies,</v>

1396
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.710
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1397
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:04.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no cameras,</v>

1398
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.660
<v Speaker 2>no TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no radio.</v>

1399
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no radio back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1400
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:16.000
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't tune into a radio show in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1800 it didn't have them.</v>

1401
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:21.090
<v Speaker 2>They didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things that are now a normal</v>

1402
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:26.430
<v Speaker 2>everyday part of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're alien just a few hundred years</v>

1403
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:29.880
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in terms of human civilization and</v>

1404
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.070
<v Speaker 2>certainly in terms of the life of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

1405
01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:36.700
<v Speaker 2>the existence of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even a blink of an eye.</v>

1406
01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:40.450
<v Speaker 2>This is all new and we couldn't imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>life without it.</v>

1407
01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I think if time keeps going or if rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>a civilization keeps going over time,</v>

1408
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:50.560
<v Speaker 2>if we don't do something incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid or get fucked up in some sort of</v>

1409
01:15:50.561 --> 01:15:54.550
<v Speaker 2>a natural catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to come up with an ability</v>

1410
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.490
<v Speaker 2>to manipulate our environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our world,</v>

1411
01:15:57.491 --> 01:16:02.020
<v Speaker 2>our perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mind to create an artificial world</v>

1412
01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 2>and artificial universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's impossible for our little fucking</v>

1413
01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:10.390
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee brains to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to imagine.</v>

1414
01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we have the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1415
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:16.210
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to connect all the dots.</v>

1416
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I think with each new invention it opens</v>
<v Speaker 2>up a new complete realm of possibility.</v>

1417
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you couldn't say to someone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,801 day you're going to have google.</v>

1418
01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Cause they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1419
01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Well one day you're gonna be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to your phone.</v>

1420
01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:35.380
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is a phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one day you're going to be able to</v>

1421
01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>talk to your electronic device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's electronics?</v>

1422
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.090
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does the fuck are you saying?</v>

1423
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:43.750
<v Speaker 2>What are you a wizard that you would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying something to them that didn't</v>

1424
01:16:43.751 --> 01:16:48.751
<v Speaker 2>make any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that I think is how we have to look</v>

1425
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:54.070
<v Speaker 2>at the possibility for two or 300 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>from now.</v>

1426
01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be new things that get</v>
<v Speaker 2>invented along the way.</v>

1427
01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.820
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old West who's electricity that</v>

1428
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.360
<v Speaker 2>metals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new ways of connecting things and then</v>

1429
01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.600
<v Speaker 2>teletype and Morse code and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things got invented before</v>

1430
01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 2>they invented computers.</v>

1431
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 2>The Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world where we're dealing with right</v>

1432
01:17:14.511 --> 01:17:16.040
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1433
01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 2>when you look at two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 years from now,</v>

1434
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas that we have about what the</v>

1435
01:17:25.131 --> 01:17:27.890
<v Speaker 2>future is going to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

1436
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:32.900
<v Speaker 2>there's big chunks missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's chunks missing from a thought</v>

1437
01:17:32.901 --> 01:17:37.901
<v Speaker 2>process and it's because these paradigm</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifting revelations,</v>

1438
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:43.970
<v Speaker 2>inventions and innovations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't occurred yet.</v>

1439
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:48.350
<v Speaker 2>And when those things do occur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to forever change</v>

1440
01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 2>what the future will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as these things occur,</v>

1441
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:56.150
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the ability to download</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness or whether it's the</v>

1442
01:17:56.151 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 2>ability to record thoughts in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your own mind,</v>

1443
01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.360
<v Speaker 2>record memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams,</v>

1444
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a real possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What their thinking is.</v>

1445
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a time where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to have a hard drive,</v>

1446
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:14.090
<v Speaker 2>like a virtual hard drive or a physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard drive,</v>

1447
01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:17.090
<v Speaker 2>rather like someone's going to put an SD</v>
<v Speaker 2>card slot in your head,</v>

1448
01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 2>not an SD card slot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something probably much smaller.</v>

1449
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:25.180
<v Speaker 2>It might even be as small as like Ray</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kurzweil has said as a cell,</v>

1450
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:29.900
<v Speaker 2>like a blood cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one red blood cell in your body</v>

1451
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:35.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a machine or a computer or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera or some sort of recording device.</v>

1452
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.060
<v Speaker 2>This thing may be able to record your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>

1453
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 2>record how it feels to be you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you,</v>

1454
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:46.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1455
01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:47.720
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're A,</v>

1456
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I dunno who Ashton Kutcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's pretend you're asked in coacher.</v>

1457
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.800
<v Speaker 2>If Ashton Kutcher decides to record his</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and his life and his day and to</v>

1458
01:18:58.521 --> 01:19:03.521
<v Speaker 2>take it and uploaded to the web and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could feel what it feels like to be him,</v>

1459
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:07.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe someone who you would always</v>

1460
01:19:07.311 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 2>love to find out how they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1461
01:19:10.161 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 2>like maybe Chris Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a great comedian.</v>

1462
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Like how does Chris Rock look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

1463
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Where's he coming up with material?</v>

1464
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Has This guy think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

1465
01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.220
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does he feel about himself?</v>

1466

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 2>a guy like Louis C K who say I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 2>self deprecating guy.</v>

1468
01:19:24.081 --> 01:19:25.910
<v Speaker 2>How's he feel about himself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1469
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:29.570

<v Speaker 2>so great fighter or Demetrius Mighty</v>

1470
01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Mouse Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does he feel about himself?</v>

1471
01:19:31.911 --> 01:19:33.250

<v Speaker 2>what does it feel like to be him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it feel like to be mighty</v>

1473
01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:38.690
<v Speaker 2>mouse for a day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it feel like to go through a</v>

1474
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:41.120
<v Speaker 2>workout?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could actually feel it.</v>

1475
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.660
<v Speaker 2>You get experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could beat him for a short period of</v>

1476
01:19:44.661 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is inevitable.</v>

1477
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that has as inevitable as</v>

1478
01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:52.790
<v Speaker 2>recording,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1479
01:19:52.791 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 2>a picture of your kid blowing out their</v>
<v Speaker 2>birthday cake and you watching a video</v>

1480
01:19:57.381 --> 01:20:01.160
<v Speaker 2>on your iphone when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're videotaping someone's</v>

1481
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:03.260
<v Speaker 2>wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're videotaping a sporting</v>

1482
01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:04.640
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're holding your camera up at</v>

1483
01:20:04.641 --> 01:20:09.000
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and you're watching the fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're capturing time.</v>

1484
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.591
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>

1485
01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:15.591
<v Speaker 2>you are capturing an image of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so used to it.</v>

1486
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.840
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even understand how fucking</v>

1487
01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:22.620
<v Speaker 2>insane it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so insane that you could take</v>

1488
01:20:22.621 --> 01:20:26.220
<v Speaker 2>something that's so small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even as thick as a deck of</v>

1489
01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:29.970
<v Speaker 2>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take it out of your pocket and it</v>

1490
01:20:29.971 --> 01:20:34.971
<v Speaker 2>could film hours of shit hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can capture hours of images and then</v>

1491
01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 2>you show it to me and you could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been on the other side of the world.</v>

1492
01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:46.250
<v Speaker 2>You could be in New Zealand and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be filming some insane mountain</v>

1493
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 2>view that was in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hobbit,</v>

1494
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:54.420
<v Speaker 2>and it could be you and your friends and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your backpack in there and you're</v>

1495
01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:59.280
<v Speaker 2>laughing and joking and you make a video</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can send it to me through</v>

1496
01:20:59.281 --> 01:21:04.281
<v Speaker 2>the fucking air and it could reach my</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone on the other side of the planet in</v>

1497
01:21:05.281 --> 01:21:06.330
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1498
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 2>This is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>

1499
01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:15.820
<v Speaker 2>It is completely fucking bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're really used to it and it</v>

1500
01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:22.011
<v Speaker 2>stands to reason to me that this ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>is only going to accelerate.</v>

1501
01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Their only going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to get more,</v>

1502
01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 2>more in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to get,</v>

1503
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 2>the experience is not just going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual right now it's visual and it's</v>

1504
01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:38.760
<v Speaker 2>two dimensional is going to be virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to turn into a virtual</v>

1505
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.040
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's going to be something that</v>

1506
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:45.420
<v Speaker 2>involves much more than just the simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>senses of sound and sight.</v>

1507
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:46.650
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to,</v>

1508
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:49.890
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be neurological</v>

1509
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 2>responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be memory,</v>

1510
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:55.530
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's going to be emotional.</v>

1511
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.920
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna be able to feel emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to be able to record</v>

1512
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:00.360
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and ideas.</v>

1513
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:05.360
<v Speaker 2>And the same way we're able to encode</v>
<v Speaker 2>and record visual images like</v>

1514
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:09.780
<v Speaker 2>photographs or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or audio like this podcast.</v>

1515
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1516
01:22:10.771 --> 01:22:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What time is it?</v>

1517
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Six 30 for Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>July 29th in Atlanta.</v>

1518
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:20.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm recording this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be listening to this a hundred</v>

1519
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:22.650
<v Speaker 2>years from now in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might be saying,</v>

1520
01:22:22.651 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was listening to this Alan Watts,</v>

1521
01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:28.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recording the other day that was on</v>

1522
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.770
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

1523
01:22:31.771 --> 01:22:33.300
<v Speaker 2>a constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1524
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:36.350
<v Speaker 2>subject right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been going on around the idea of a</v>

1525
01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:39.540
<v Speaker 2>is you actually just gave people money</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that they could live.</v>

1526
01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.030
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't have to worry about making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

1527
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:45.570
<v Speaker 2>It would open them up to a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and at this idea that</v>

1528
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:49.230
<v Speaker 2>putting people on welfare or the Dole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just makes them lazy,</v>

1529
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:50.910
<v Speaker 2>might not necessarily be true.</v>

1530
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.030
<v Speaker 2>And that it actually might be better if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't look at it that way.</v>

1531
01:22:54.031 --> 01:22:58.440
<v Speaker 2>If we just looked at it the way of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once your basic needs are covered,</v>

1532
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.770
<v Speaker 2>then you're free to express yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a much more natural way without</v>

1533
01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:05.710
<v Speaker 2>desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that desperation doesn't always mean</v>

1534
01:23:05.711 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make the best decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it really would cost us less if we</v>

1535
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:11.260
<v Speaker 2>gave people money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1536
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point being this is an Alan Watts,</v>

1537
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:19.950
<v Speaker 2>a discussion where Alan Watts was making</v>
<v Speaker 2>this speech about this from the 1960s so</v>

1538
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 2>it was more than 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1539
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I think somewhere around 50 point being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1540
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:35.430
<v Speaker 2>it's entirely possible that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>recording that I'm making right now,</v>

1541
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:39.970
<v Speaker 2>someday somebody might listen to 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>

1542
01:23:39.971 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 2>a hundred years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 years from now,</v>

1543
01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.250
<v Speaker 2>and they'll laugh the laugh at how wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

1544
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they'll laugh at how I called</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and we will be living in some sort of</v>

1545
01:23:50.801 --> 01:23:55.801
<v Speaker 2>a strange world where reality is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you measure.</v>

1546
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't like take a ruler to it or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1547
01:23:59.891 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 2>and measure the temperature of it or put</v>
<v Speaker 2>it on a scale.</v>

1548
01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:09.360
<v Speaker 2>It might be something that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a quasi reality setting,</v>

1549
01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's,</v>

1550
01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 2>it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing it,</v>

1551
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.440
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't exist in a physical form</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's entirely possible that that's our</v>

1552
01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:26.230
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that we through</v>

1553
01:24:26.231 --> 01:24:31.231
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to create not just an</v>

1554
01:24:31.781 --> 01:24:36.781
<v Speaker 2>alternative dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but infinite alternative dimensions,</v>

1555
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:41.610
<v Speaker 2>infinite alternative existences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea that we're just going to</v>

1556
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:44.940
<v Speaker 2>get to a certain point where we realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a,</v>

1557
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 2>we could build a spaceship the size of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the empire state building and fucking</v>

1558
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:52.810
<v Speaker 2>shoot off to Alpha Centauri and set up</v>
<v Speaker 2>shop there and,</v>

1559
01:24:52.811 --> 01:24:53.321
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1560
01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:56.140
<v Speaker 2>find some snails and turn them into</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1561
01:24:56.650 --> 01:24:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're going to be</v>

1562
01:24:59.321 --> 01:25:00.154
<v Speaker 2>traveling.</v>

1563
01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the future.</v>

1564
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1565
01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I think we may for the next foreseeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

1566
01:25:07.871 --> 01:25:11.710
<v Speaker 2>for the foreseeable future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might be sending robots to Mars like</v>

1567
01:25:11.711 --> 01:25:15.010
<v Speaker 2>we're doing now and might send them off</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Pluto on to these other planets.</v>

1568
01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:17.820
<v Speaker 2>And we might get invaluable data about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1569
01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:19.810
<v Speaker 2>the nature of our solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1570
01:25:19.811 --> 01:25:24.811
<v Speaker 2>there's this planet that they think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of Pluto's orbit it past the</v>

1571
01:25:25.181 --> 01:25:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Kuyper belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're calling planted acts and</v>

1572
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:30.580
<v Speaker 2>people have talked about this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some Chai and asked planted out</v>

1573
01:25:30.581 --> 01:25:31.414
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1574
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more than four times larger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than earth and they're pretty sure it</v>

1575
01:25:35.951 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 2>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 90 something percent.</v>

1576
01:25:37.571 --> 01:25:38.404
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:41.350
<v Speaker 2>That's all awesome and fascinating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing and beautiful.</v>

1578
01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:44.980
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling that our future doesn't</v>

1579
01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 2>exist in a physical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we think it does.</v>

1580
01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I think we're married to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's all we've ever known,</v>

1581
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.680
<v Speaker 2>but I don't necessarily think it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're capable of.</v>

1582
01:25:56.710 --> 01:26:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's entirely possible that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>day we might create a whole new world.</v>

1583
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.380
<v Speaker 2>And this also might be possible with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>advent of artificial intelligence.</v>

1584
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Artificial intelligence is another</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking rabbit hole because if you want</v>

1585
01:26:14.501 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to get your mind blown.</v>

1586
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1587
01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:22.841
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Sam Harris and I have talked</v>

1588
01:26:22.971 --> 01:26:24.640
<v Speaker 2>about it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1589
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:29.720
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it on a think the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and maybe even more in depth the</v>

1590
01:26:29.721 --> 01:26:32.720
<v Speaker 2>podcast before it might be both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to go back.</v>

1591
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done more than 800 fucking podcast</v>

1592
01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:37.730
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though my memory is pretty</v>

1593
01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:40.370
<v Speaker 2>decent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really lose track of which one was</v>

1594
01:26:40.371 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 2>what and what was happening when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1595
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:45.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point being,</v>

1596
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.320
<v Speaker 2>the conversation that I had with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>about artificial intelligence was a mind</v>

1597
01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:55.850
<v Speaker 2>blower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real mind blower where it's in my,</v>

1598
01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:56.810
<v Speaker 2>in my eyes.</v>

1599
01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.300
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like we're talking about</v>

1600
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:05.030
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone would say everyone.</v>

1601
01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean just it conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are dreamers.</v>

1602
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.500
<v Speaker 2>If we start talking about the potential</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the future,</v>

1603
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:13.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1604
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 2>is there going to be innovation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1605
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone.</v>

1606
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people don't blow themselves up,</v>

1607
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:26.300
<v Speaker 2>if we don't get hit by an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if yellow stone doesn't explode and wipe</v>

1608
01:27:26.301 --> 01:27:31.160
<v Speaker 2>out everyone in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will we continue to make better</v>

1609
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 2>electronics where we continue to</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovate,</v>

1610
01:27:33.231 --> 01:27:36.320
<v Speaker 2>where we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we continue to make new inventions?</v>

1611
01:27:36.321 --> 01:27:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

1612
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

1613
01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:43.820
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence is almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable.</v>

1614
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.460
<v Speaker 2>If it's a hundred years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's 200 years from now,</v>

1615
01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day,</v>

1616
01:27:48.531 --> 01:27:53.240
<v Speaker 2>eventually they're going to figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to make something that can think for</v>

1617
01:27:53.241 --> 01:27:56.780
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Tesla has fucking cars that drive</v>

1618
01:27:56.781 --> 01:27:57.230
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1619
01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Now you can press auto drive or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>the button is.</v>

1620
01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.890
<v Speaker 2>He depressed and these fucking things</v>
<v Speaker 2>will drive.</v>

1621
01:28:03.891 --> 01:28:05.750
<v Speaker 2>They hit the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make turns.</v>

1622
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:09.920
<v Speaker 2>They follow the navigation system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have sensors that detect cars.</v>

1623
01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:11.780
<v Speaker 2>They break at traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1624
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:15.740
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking nuts and it's just crept up</v>
<v Speaker 2>on us.</v>

1625
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Nobody saw this coming 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody thought in 10 years,</v>

1626
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:21.500
<v Speaker 2>nobody thought in 2006 10 years from</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1627
01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.770
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have drivable driverless</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

1628
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.990
<v Speaker 2>cars that you take your hand off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel.</v>

1629
01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 2>There's a hilarious photo of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They snapped pictures of him on the</v>

1630
01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:32.720
<v Speaker 2>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was outside of San Francisco</v>

1631
01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.530
<v Speaker 2>where he was asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep at the wheel going to work and</v>

1632
01:28:36.531 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 2>his car was driving down the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1633
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.930
<v Speaker 2>this is all new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1634
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:45.050
<v Speaker 2>and what is it going to be like 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>from now?</v>

1635
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we know.</v>

1636
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I think we could guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we could have beautiful ideas,</v>

1637
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:54.850
<v Speaker 2>but I think when every new invention</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets created and every new door that</v>

1638
01:28:55.851 --> 01:28:59.660
<v Speaker 2>gets opened up by new technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1639
01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 2>it creates the potential for a gang of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other new exponentially increasing new</v>

1640
01:29:06.631 --> 01:29:11.370
<v Speaker 2>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with artificial intelligence,</v>

1641
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's entirely possible that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can literally create something that</v>

1642
01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:23.850
<v Speaker 2>creates universes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that creates universes that</v>

1643
01:29:23.851 --> 01:29:27.540
<v Speaker 2>don't exist in a physical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you go to the Moon,</v>

1644
01:29:27.690 --> 01:29:29.850
<v Speaker 2>you pick up moon rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it come back to earth,</v>

1645
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:35.180
<v Speaker 2>but rather something that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 2>another dimension that we find portals</v>

1646
01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:41.361
<v Speaker 2>or gateways or that we find frequencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought that it's,</v>

1647
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:47.030
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that planets themselves or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a rather reality itself is like a</v>

1648
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:53.181
<v Speaker 2>station on the dial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've read that scientists believe</v>

1649
01:29:53.311 --> 01:29:58.311
<v Speaker 2>that there are at least 11 dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they understand this.</v>

1650
01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1651
01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.350
<v Speaker 2>that's when they get to those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those yellow legal notepads</v>

1652
01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:06.200
<v Speaker 2>where those guys scribble shit down on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1653
01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Your little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>

1654
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:12.120
<v Speaker 2>But you have to be a theoretical</v>
<v Speaker 2>physicist to in order to understand what</v>

1655
01:30:12.121 --> 01:30:17.121
<v Speaker 2>the fuck they're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those guys have come up with</v>

1656
01:30:17.641 --> 01:30:22.641
<v Speaker 2>some equation that they all agree upon</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they believe that it is entirely</v>

1657
01:30:23.191 --> 01:30:27.660
<v Speaker 2>possible that there are 11 dimensions at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>

1658
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is today in 2016 right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ask scientists in 1955 they</v>

1659
01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:34.321
<v Speaker 2>probably look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1660
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:37.260
<v Speaker 2>you have fucking three heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a blink of an eye.</v>

1661
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:42.330
<v Speaker 2>1955 compared to 2016 it is a blink of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an eye.</v>

1662
01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:47.690
<v Speaker 2>It seems like 60 plus years for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it ain't shit in terms of the world</v>

1663
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:51.630
<v Speaker 2>in terms of human history and in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

1664
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1665
01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.920
<v Speaker 2>the evolution of this bizarre talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey.</v>

1666
01:30:57.210 --> 01:30:58.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing.</v>

1667
01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And in that time things have changed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular ways.</v>

1668
01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:08.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 2>through especially the invention and</v>

1669
01:31:09.211 --> 01:31:13.290
<v Speaker 2>innovation of artificial intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>and its ability to innovate,</v>

1670
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:18.470
<v Speaker 2>it's ability to improve upon ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings have created.</v>

1671
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Cause that was one of the most mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>blowing parts about the Sam Harris'</v>

1672
01:31:21.091 --> 01:31:26.091
<v Speaker 2>podcast was he said that within weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will be able to do 10,000 plus</v>

1673
01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:31.710
<v Speaker 2>years of what would take us as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>

1674
01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:37.010
<v Speaker 2>So the world will change so fast once</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence is,</v>

1675
01:31:37.401 --> 01:31:41.130
<v Speaker 2>is when once it goes alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when skynet goes live,</v>

1676
01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:46.290
<v Speaker 2>the world's going to change so much that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible for us to</v>

1677
01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:50.310
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible for us to guess I'm</v>

1678
01:31:50.311 --> 01:31:52.830
<v Speaker 2>standing up here now cause I'm Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking myself out</v>

1679
01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:57.840
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my throat is getting a little scratchy.</v>

1680
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:03.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think about the Fermi</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradox.</v>

1681
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we're going to outgrow this</v>

1682
01:32:09.221 --> 01:32:11.320
<v Speaker 2>idea of being somewhere in a physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1683
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if there are aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to contact us through our</v>

1684
01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:19.150
<v Speaker 2>own minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to contact us through</v>

1685
01:32:19.151 --> 01:32:20.650
<v Speaker 2>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1686
01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean aliens might exist in the form of</v>

1687
01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:28.591
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagination itself might be like a kind</v>

1688
01:32:29.501 --> 01:32:31.140
<v Speaker 2>of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a kind,</v>

1689
01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 2>almost like a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look around at the world,</v>

1690
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:38.130
<v Speaker 2>obviously you imagination is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

1691
01:32:38.150 --> 01:32:41.950
<v Speaker 2>it comes out of the brain and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>create things and it's just,</v>

1692
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.290
<v Speaker 2>you know the idea that it's a light</v>
<v Speaker 2>farms ridiculous.</v>

1693
01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:45.071
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1694
01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:49.210
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the imagination is responsible for</v>

1695
01:32:49.211 --> 01:32:52.270
<v Speaker 2>every single physical thing that human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings have ever created.</v>

1696
01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:56.320
<v Speaker 2>This building that I'm in right now came</v>
<v Speaker 2>about because of the imagination.</v>

1697
01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:01.840
<v Speaker 2>The phone that I'm talking on came about</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the imagination without the</v>

1698
01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:04.960
<v Speaker 2>thought of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without someone saying,</v>

1699
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would happen if we took this mud</v>

1700
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:10.450
<v Speaker 2>and turned it into a square and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>dried it out?</v>

1701
01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Can we make a brick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1702
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:14.020
<v Speaker 2>and then if I stack a brick on top of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>break,</v>

1703
01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:15.190
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a wall.</v>

1704
01:33:15.610 --> 01:33:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And that all came out of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It came out of an idea.</v>

1705
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:26.820
<v Speaker 2>How amazing would it be if we found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those ideas themselves were alive,</v>

1706
01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:34.750
<v Speaker 2>that that is the way these lifeforms</v>
<v Speaker 2>express themselves much.</v>

1707
01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:39.751
<v Speaker 2>What much like the way disease expresses</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself inside your body.</v>

1708
01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Like when you catch a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1709
01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.630
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a life form that's growing and</v>

1710
01:33:46.631 --> 01:33:50.770
<v Speaker 2>feeding off of you and your body's out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of balance.</v>

1711
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Your immune system is battling this</v>
<v Speaker 2>virus,</v>

1712
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:57.760
<v Speaker 2>this dizzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could look at it on a microscope.</v>

1713
01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1714
01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:02.440
<v Speaker 2>it's the staff virus or it's the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1715
01:34:02.441 --> 01:34:03.910
<v Speaker 2>it's malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1716
01:34:03.911 --> 01:34:05.620
<v Speaker 2>he's got the malaria virus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1717
01:34:05.621 --> 01:34:07.600
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1718
01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:11.650
<v Speaker 2>that thing is a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some sort of an existing living</v>

1719
01:34:11.651 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 2>thing that's trying to multiply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiply,</v>

1720
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 2>and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately it would like to keep,</v>

1721
01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 2>it would like to kill your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would like to take your body over and</v>

1722
01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:24.550
<v Speaker 2>it would love to spread itself to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other people and,</v>

1723
01:34:24.551 --> 01:34:26.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take out a bunch of folks.</v>

1724
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:30.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens every year with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flu or every year with malaria.</v>

1725
01:34:30.421 --> 01:34:33.520
<v Speaker 2>And if you want a harrowing tale of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like to that malaria,</v>

1726
01:34:33.521 --> 01:34:37.150
<v Speaker 2>listen to my friend Justin Wren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's been on the podcast many times,</v>

1727
01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was just on the last episode,</v>

1728
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:44.221
<v Speaker 2>who goes to the Congo regularly to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build wells for the pygmy.</v>

1729
01:34:44.641 --> 01:34:49.641
<v Speaker 2>It's just an amazing guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just beautiful person who is doing this</v>

1730
01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.480
<v Speaker 2>incredible thing and helping these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1731
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.360
<v Speaker 2>But some motherfuckers caught malaria</v>
<v Speaker 2>three times now.</v>

1732
01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.640
<v Speaker 2>It's scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's malaria is some sort of a weird</v>

1733
01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.200
<v Speaker 2>life form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1734
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:05.480
<v Speaker 2>What if ideas where lifeforms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just life forms that exist in a</v>

1735
01:35:05.481 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 2>nonphysical way and you can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself more accessible.</v>

1736
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:14.150
<v Speaker 2>You can catch these ideas better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You catch these life forms,</v>

1737
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.920
<v Speaker 2>you can catch these things that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately lead to the transformation of</v>

1738
01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:22.940
<v Speaker 2>the very world around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've developed air conditioning.</v>

1739
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:26.570
<v Speaker 2>These ideas have made heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to harness fire.</v>

1740
01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to take rubber</v>
<v Speaker 2>tires and put them around metal wheels,</v>

1741
01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 2>attach it to a frame and allow you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall asleep and side of as it takes you</v>

1742
01:35:34.881 --> 01:35:38.300
<v Speaker 2>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all because of imagination.</v>

1743
01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Knows that that imagination is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't measure.</v>

1744
01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:46.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not a physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

1745
01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you can't show it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1746
01:35:48.371 --> 01:35:50.030
<v Speaker 2>you don't take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go a litmus test.</v>

1747
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:53.720
<v Speaker 2>You can't go to the store and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tested positive for imagination.</v>

1748
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1749
01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.070
<v Speaker 2>it's just there and you access it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1750
01:35:57.071 --> 01:36:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sit around your daydream and you lay</v>

1751
01:36:00.021 --> 01:36:02.480
<v Speaker 2>on your back in the grass and you come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with an idea.</v>

1752
01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.020
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

1753
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:08.510
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We totally take it for granted.</v>

1754
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:13.670
<v Speaker 2>But if you look around this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular world that you see in front</v>

1755
01:36:13.671 --> 01:36:15.650
<v Speaker 2>of you when you step outside of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

1756
01:36:15.651 --> 01:36:19.340
<v Speaker 2>this bizarre world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you lived in a,</v>

1757
01:36:19.341 --> 01:36:23.150
<v Speaker 2>in a natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lived in a jungle or if you lived</v>

1758
01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:25.580
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a mountain setting and you had never</v>

1759
01:36:25.581 --> 01:36:28.310
<v Speaker 2>seen human civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were confronted with it for the</v>

1760
01:36:28.311 --> 01:36:31.430
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would freak the fuck out.</v>

1761
01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:36.630
<v Speaker 2>You will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of bizarre thing is creating</v>

1762
01:36:37.671 --> 01:36:42.671
<v Speaker 2>these enormous structures with a glass</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stone and on a scale that is,</v>

1763
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:49.870
<v Speaker 2>it is impossible to comprehend a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being creating a skyscraper one person.</v>

1764
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.911
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1765
01:36:52.911 --> 01:36:53.870
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to work together.</v>

1766
01:36:53.871 --> 01:36:55.460
<v Speaker 2>How many people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds.</v>

1767
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd they do it?</v>

1768
01:36:56.481 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 2>They have metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use machines.</v>

1769
01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.050
<v Speaker 2>What machines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1770
01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1771
01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.810
<v Speaker 2>They have combustion engines with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1772
01:37:02.811 --> 01:37:07.550
<v Speaker 2>they're explosions controlled explosions</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of a metal structure that that</v>

1773
01:37:07.551 --> 01:37:12.551
<v Speaker 2>powers these gears and these gears can</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift up things thousands of pounds and</v>

1774
01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:14.850
<v Speaker 2>carry them through the air and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1775
01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:18.080
<v Speaker 2>they put these glass walls on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these buildings.</v>

1776
01:37:18.081 --> 01:37:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all because of the imagination</v>

1777
01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1778
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:28.520
<v Speaker 2>this idea that the imagination is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of like,</v>

1779
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:30.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's imagining things old,</v>

1780
01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:31.940
<v Speaker 2>silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a dreamer,</v>

1781
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:34.220
<v Speaker 2>has been kind of putting our heads since</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were young,</v>

1782
01:37:34.221 --> 01:37:37.040
<v Speaker 2>because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're taught to be pragmatic or we</v>

1783
01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:39.410
<v Speaker 2>talked to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be disciplined and taught to,</v>

1784
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:40.371
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1785
01:37:40.371 --> 01:37:44.480
<v Speaker 2>to go out there and get things done and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</v>

1786
01:37:44.481 --> 01:37:48.500
<v Speaker 2>And all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hardcore sort of a,</v>

1787
01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:53.810
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what the word I'm looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic ways of looking at productivity</v>

1788
01:37:53.811 --> 01:37:58.490
<v Speaker 2>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately this imagination is going</v>

1789
01:37:58.491 --> 01:38:03.491
<v Speaker 2>to lead us to create something that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the very nature of what life is.</v>

1790
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 2>So if that made any sense at all to</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody but me,</v>

1791
01:38:11.521 --> 01:38:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd be fucking shocked.</v>

1792
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:17.220
<v Speaker 2>But that's my answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

1793
01:38:17.221 --> 01:38:19.890
<v Speaker 2>that was a long ass fucking answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1794
01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.130
<v Speaker 2>is almost seven o'clock here and I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to leave soon.</v>

1795
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:28.160
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I'll answer one more</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts on the Putin,</v>

1796
01:38:29.221 --> 01:38:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump implications around the democratic</v>

1797
01:38:31.771 --> 01:38:32.880
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wiki leaks,</v>

1798
01:38:32.881 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 2>email reveals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they were saying that</v>

1799
01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:38.880
<v Speaker 2>people were saying that trump was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get in trouble because he told the</v>

1800
01:38:38.881 --> 01:38:43.881
<v Speaker 2>Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hack the democratic,</v>

1801
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>party wikileak emails.</v>

1802
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:52.290
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is really ridiculous.</v>

1803
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that is one of the dumbest</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1804
01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.660
<v Speaker 2>This idea that trump should somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another be accountable and held</v>

1805
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:05.040
<v Speaker 2>accountable for espionage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about the fact that that the</v>

1806
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Democrats were plotting against one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own?</v>

1807
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:13.170
<v Speaker 2>How about the fact that we're working</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards getting Hillary Clinton to be</v>

1808
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:17.760
<v Speaker 2>the the nominee for the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're working towards that like</v>

1809
01:39:17.761 --> 01:39:18.960
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to be impartial.</v>

1810
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.400
<v Speaker 2>He's a Democrat too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were actively trying to make</v>

1811
01:39:23.401 --> 01:39:26.770
<v Speaker 2>her</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the,</v>

1812
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:31.810
<v Speaker 2>the representative for the Party and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then when the woman who has to step down</v>

1813
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:36.750
<v Speaker 2>because the emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has to step down because it's</v>

1814
01:39:36.751 --> 01:39:40.530
<v Speaker 2>revealed that they were actively</v>
<v Speaker 2>plotting to get Bernie sanders in his,</v>

1815
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:43.320
<v Speaker 2>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders.</v>

1816
01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.600
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after she steps down,</v>

1817
01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:49.500
<v Speaker 2>immediately gets hired by Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton like immediately.</v>

1818
01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:51.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so transparent.</v>

1819
01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:56.070
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I was saying earlier that</v>

1820
01:39:56.130 --> 01:39:59.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the good things about a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson is we're realizing how</v>

1821
01:39:59.791 --> 01:40:03.750
<v Speaker 2>stupid this fucking two party system is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're being hosed.</v>

1822
01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Whether you're a hillary supporter or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a trump supporter,</v>

1823
01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.290
<v Speaker 2>you have to admit that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal.</v>

1824
01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of those people is ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see all those people that are at the</v>

1825
01:40:13.801 --> 01:40:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Democratic convention and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>smiling and laughing and they don't</v>

1826
01:40:18.391 --> 01:40:21.690
<v Speaker 2>really believe she's ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe this is all we have right</v>

1827
01:40:21.691 --> 01:40:25.890
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton was giving a speech and</v>

1828
01:40:25.891 --> 01:40:30.690
<v Speaker 2>her fucking husband bill fell asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fell asleep.</v>

1829
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently he's not in good health right</v>

1830
01:40:34.141 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not doing so hot.</v>

1831
01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 2>But he's sitting there in the audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he,</v>

1832
01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 2>if he's in such bad shape that he can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay awake,</v>

1833
01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.990
<v Speaker 2>he should be in bed somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1834
01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:53.130
<v Speaker 2>he fell asleep in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how fucking boring and stupid</v>

1835
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.093
<v Speaker 2>these things are.</v>

1836
01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's a hose job and it's a hose job</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is just going to be here</v>

1837
01:41:00.671 --> 01:41:03.850
<v Speaker 1>for a little while longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like powdered wigs.</v>

1838
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1839
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:09.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a nonsense way to run a nation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 million informed people.</v>

1840
01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:15.730
<v Speaker 1>There's too many of us now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many of us and people know</v>

1841
01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:20.650
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not 18 hundreds where you needed</v>

1842
01:41:20.651 --> 01:41:24.220
<v Speaker 1>this sort of representative government</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you couldn't get to those people</v>

1843
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.740
<v Speaker 1>and they couldn't get their into their</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion to you.</v>

1844
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.690
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the case anymore.</v>

1845
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:32.890
<v Speaker 1>We live in a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1846
01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:34.570
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to end,</v>

1847
01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna end this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1848
01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to get Ian Mccall on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and either I'll attach it to this</v>

1849
01:41:40.001 --> 01:41:45.001
<v Speaker 1>podcast or put it on a second one</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how much Ian and I talk,</v>

1850
01:41:47.141 --> 01:41:52.141
<v Speaker 1>but this one has gone for an hour and 34</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

1851
01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:55.060
<v Speaker 1>which is I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I going to talk about?</v>

1852
01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't shut the fuck up.</v>

1853
01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird when I'm doing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because you're trying to not be</v>

1854
01:42:00.611 --> 01:42:04.120
<v Speaker 1>conscious of the fact that you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>why sayings started.</v>

1855
01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to like let the thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow.</v>

1856
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:10.240
<v Speaker 1>But in the meantime it's like you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to resist the urge to think about the</v>

1857
01:42:10.241 --> 01:42:15.241
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're talking and that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking into a phone and that you're</v>

1858
01:42:15.341 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 1>trying not to fuck it up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be as honest and transparent</v>

1859
01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:22.360
<v Speaker 1>about your thoughts as possible while</v>
<v Speaker 1>still make an entertaining.</v>

1860
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't say too many ums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ramble too much.</v>

1861
01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done these before in the past,</v>

1862
01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't done one like this a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1863
01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.590
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you how talented bill burr</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1864
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause that fucking guy does one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Monday and every Thursday.</v>

1865
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Bill Burr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't heard his podcast,</v>

1866
01:42:40.661 --> 01:42:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

1867
01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the bill burr Monday morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

1868
01:42:43.751 --> 01:42:45.850
<v Speaker 1>but he also does a Thursday version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1869
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.450
<v Speaker 1>which I think he calls the Thursday</v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon and Monday morning podcast.</v>

1870
01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.450
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honestly,</v>

1871
01:42:52.451 --> 01:42:53.770
<v Speaker 1>bill is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1872
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.180
<v Speaker 1>he's a good friend of mine and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant comedian and he's also a guy</v>

1873
01:42:58.190 --> 01:43:01.100
<v Speaker 1>who's singular in his focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

1874
01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I really admire him as a comic and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I was thinking about</v>

1875
01:43:04.151 --> 01:43:07.030
<v Speaker 1>when I was thinking that maybe I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop doing commentary.</v>

1876
01:43:07.031 --> 01:43:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking guy just does stand up.</v>

1877
01:43:09.731 --> 01:43:10.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he does.</v>

1878
01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:13.000
<v Speaker 1>He just does a stand up and look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

1879
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:15.340
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always got new shit.</v>

1880
01:43:15.341 --> 01:43:18.310
<v Speaker 1>He's always killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching his act.</v>

1881
01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 1>He's Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently funny,</v>

1882
01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.840
<v Speaker 1>but he's very singular in its focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1883
01:43:22.841 --> 01:43:24.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1884
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm rambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1885
01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Bill Burr,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

1887

<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>

1888
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:33.790
<v Speaker 1>he's not just one of the best alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

1889
01:43:33.791 --> 01:43:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the best average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my all time favorite standup</v>

1890
01:43:36.551 --> 01:43:40.120
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with that,</v>

1891
01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:42.550
<v Speaker 1>let's end this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>completely fucking burnt out or I might</v>

1895
01:43:48.971 --> 01:43:53.960
<v Speaker 1>freak myself out about how God damn I</v>
