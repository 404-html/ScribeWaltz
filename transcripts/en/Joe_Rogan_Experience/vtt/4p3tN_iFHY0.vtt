00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.061
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

2
00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:02.701
<v Speaker 1>doing it this way.</v>

3
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>We should do it this way more often where we get the commercials out of the way</v>

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>before the guests arrives.</v>

5
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's annoying.</v>

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Something about if you really enjoy for creative types is a great book called</v>

39
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.411
<v Speaker 1>the war of art.</v>

40
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And then someone else brought it up too.</v>

41
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.471

<v Speaker 1>You've liked set an avalanche of creativity loose with your book.</v>

64
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

65
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:31.861
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>

66
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I brought you a half a dozen in the days,</v>

67
00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:33.721
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

68
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>so you can give them out to a deserving a worthy recipient.</v>

69
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

70
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I was one of those recipients from Europe from the early days.</v>

71
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I gave up on it.</v>

73
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

74
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>it was before on it.</v>

75
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I gave Arby's that coincidence.</v>

76
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno man.</v>

77
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

78
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably know.</v>

79
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that how's it been?</v>

80
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>About three years ago,</v>

81
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

82
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I gave it to every comedian.</v>

85
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I know that doesn't write new jokes and I'm one that I know I bought it for my</v>

86
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>family for Christmas after you gave it to me last Christmas.</v>

87
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.411
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what,</v>

88
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>it's applicable even like to non artists.</v>

89
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of lessons in that about what you talk about though.</v>

90
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:09.501
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

91
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>the term resistance is a great way of describing it because it's sort of names</v>

92
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>this fog that a lot of people have gone through this,</v>

93
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>this weird thing that people have where sometimes I'll wake up in the morning</v>

94
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>and I'll just,</v>

95
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll get online and I'll say,</v>

96
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>well what do I have to do today?</v>

97
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I got to work out eventually.</v>

98
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>So from between now and when I work out,</v>

99
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.031
<v Speaker 1>what should I do?</v>

100
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Should I go watch TV?</v>

101
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I know the remote is right there and I know,</v>

102
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I know I really should get something done.</v>

103
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I should just sit in my fucking office,</v>

104
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>close the door and start writing.</v>

105
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>But there's this weird thing that happens where all these other options come up</v>

106
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's just so easy to just fuck off and ask you Joe,</v>

107
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't really know about how comedians work.</v>

108
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>What is the thing that you,</v>

109
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that resistance stops you from doing writing jokes,</v>

110
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>sitting down and writing jokes.</v>

111
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I would say writing materials,</v>

112
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>the big one because it stop you from performing.</v>

113
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Performing is really fun,</v>

114
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>performing as a standard,</v>

116
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>but something that we all look forward to and it's,</v>

117
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a great exchange with the audience.</v>

118
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>This is a great time.</v>

119
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's not something that anybody resists,</v>

120
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>but they do resist the righting,</v>

121
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>the solid Terry sitting by yourself with your thoughts.</v>

122
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

123
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:17.721
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

124
00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>the going over the ideas and trying to make them work and trying to restructure</v>

125
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>stuff to make it quicker or have more impact.</v>

126
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

127
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you,</v>

128
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to,</v>

129
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you go over a bit and you'll practice it on stage and you'll try to</v>

130
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>work it out on stage and you'll eventually get there.</v>

131
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>But really what you need to do is do the real work.</v>

132
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Sit by yourself in front of a computer or a notepad,</v>

133
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever you prefer.</v>

134
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.791
<v Speaker 1>And actually,</v>

135
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

136
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

137
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:47.540
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting to me as just an audience member because when you watch a comic</v>

138
00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 3>that's really rolling,</v>

139
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 3>you figure they're just winging it.</v>

140
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 3>It's just coming out of them,</v>

141
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.564
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

142
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.081
<v Speaker 3>the moment.</v>

143
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 3>But it's not true is it?</v>

144
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's really hard work behind the scenes doing it.</v>

145
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.680
<v Speaker 1>There's actually both.</v>

146
00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.311
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

147
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a lot of hard work behind the scenes,</v>

148
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a lot of winging it and the w the,</v>

149
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

150
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.120
<v Speaker 1>when you get good at winging it,</v>

151
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:11.121
<v Speaker 1>it sort of comes from already having put in the work and also having your mind</v>

152
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 1>free if your mind is troubled.</v>

153
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Like that's another thing I found,</v>

154
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.361
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

156
00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 1>as I matured as a man,</v>

157
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.800
<v Speaker 1>especially over the last like 10,</v>

158
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:23.634
<v Speaker 1>15 years,</v>

159
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I realize the less clutter I have in my life,</v>

160
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>the better my mind works.</v>

161
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:33.261
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a very valuable thing to keep your mind free of bullshit.</v>

162
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 1>So whether it's people or things you do that you don't like that you do,</v>

163
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.450
<v Speaker 1>or habits that you can't break.</v>

164
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>If you can get rid of those,</v>

165
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>your whole thing will work better.</v>

166
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Like your mind will actually function better.</v>

167
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.310
<v Speaker 1>It will function without the,</v>

168
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

169
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.300
<v Speaker 1>the regret of not being able to take care of whatever it is.</v>

170
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a gambling issue or,</v>

171
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you describe too,</v>

172
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the zone and doing your best comedy,</v>

173
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like the comedy goes through you.</v>

174
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>You're just a passenger and that's very much how you described the muse and many</v>

176
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:02.990
<v Speaker 1>of your books.</v>

177
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important thing outside of the getting out of the way.</v>

179
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:07.410
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

180
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 1>that's a very important thing that you brought up in that book and you set it</v>

181
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:10.850
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

182
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

183
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of a matter of fact way about what's this ethereal sort of whimsical topic,</v>

184
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:18.920
<v Speaker 1>the topic of amuse like,</v>

185
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.790
<v Speaker 1>but my best stuff,</v>

186
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea where it came from.</v>

187
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Everything that I've ever written,</v>

188
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>every time I've ever been on stage.</v>

189
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I've been at my,</v>

190
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:27.151
<v Speaker 1>at my best,</v>

191
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a passenger.</v>

192
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like the muse takes you over when you're actually on stage.</v>

193
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you</v>

194
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.211
<v Speaker 3>five Joe,</v>

195
00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:34.170
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>

196
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.900
<v Speaker 3>when you look back on what you did,</v>

197
00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:41.901
<v Speaker 3>a set here are set a year ago that you're discovering who you are as you</v>

198
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.230
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

199
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:44.071
<v Speaker 1>Sorta,</v>

201
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:44.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:45.151
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes like,</v>

203
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:45.391
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

204
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:46.224
<v Speaker 1>fuck is that even,</v>

205
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a weird,</v>

207
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:50.210
<v Speaker 1>did that come from element that can,</v>

208
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.210
<v Speaker 1>that can creep in.</v>

209
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.021
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

210
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention.</v>

211
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of comedians don't like to listen to themselves.</v>

212
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:56.724
<v Speaker 1>Me included.</v>

213
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.733
<v Speaker 1>Don't like to,</v>

214
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but that's an also a blog</v>

215
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.040
<v Speaker 3>if feel embarrassed when you see your stuff</v>

216
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

217
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.411
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

218
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>you're weird if you like it,</v>

219
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>you're some that like listening to yourself,</v>

220
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>some guy that gets off on hearing his own voice,</v>

222
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm awesome.</v>

223
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also,</v>

224
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you're self critical,</v>

225
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>which I'm very self critical,</v>

226
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it can be agonizing.</v>

227
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

228
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of it that you don't like that you just like drive you fucking</v>

229
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

230
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

231
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>But it's a good way to,</v>

232
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

233
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

234
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>creative,</v>

235
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.324
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

236
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 1>for like structuring acts.</v>

237
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good way to realize what my bits are working and what bits aren't</v>

238
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

239
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It's to listen to them without having to do them so you can actually hear them</v>

240
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>and hear them take place in front of an audience.</v>

241
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an invaluable resource that a lot of comedians don't take</v>

242
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>advantage of for just the reasons I stayed.</v>

243
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>And they get embarrassed or they get weirded out.</v>

244
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>But there's that thing that you talked about in your book.</v>

245
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It's the Muse and the music exists on stage and the music exists in front of</v>

246
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>your keyboard or a notepad or whatever.</v>

247
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>The music with some real shit,</v>

248
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:00.524
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

249
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.801
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

250
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm from the school of it being,</v>

251
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 3>of trying to keep it,</v>

252
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 3>trying to demystify it,</v>

253
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

254
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 3>and because it's,</v>

255
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 3>it is as every day as where do you get an idea from,</v>

256
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

257
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 3>we're nearing the shower,</v>

258
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.480
<v Speaker 3>you drive around the free,</v>

259
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 3>where does it come from?</v>

260
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 3>And the point is,</v>

261
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

262
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 3>to just get out of the way and let those things come and not forget them when</v>

263
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.214
<v Speaker 3>they do come.</v>

264
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

265
00:07:22.411 --> 00:07:25.770
<v Speaker 1>what was interesting about the way you wrote about it as well as it was a very</v>

266
00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:30.210
<v Speaker 1>easily digestible to people because there's some people that talk about the muse</v>

267
00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:32.130
<v Speaker 1>and I just want to smack them.</v>

268
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I just want to throw them off cliffs.</v>

269
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Just shut up like you're killing me with your nonsense talk this.</v>

270
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's people that,</v>

271
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.940
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm joking,</v>

272
00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:46.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's people that go so far into the whimsical that it becomes this self</v>

273
00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:47.454
<v Speaker 1>indulgent,</v>

274
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.310
<v Speaker 1>a artistic expression dance.</v>

275
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You know it's like this,</v>

276
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.181
<v Speaker 1>you know their,</v>

277
00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:52.451
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

278
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:54.660
<v Speaker 1>their whole thing about the muse.</v>

279
00:07:54.661 --> 00:07:59.661
<v Speaker 1>She comes to me the night I leave the window Shaoshan shall she goes with her</v>

280
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:02.700
<v Speaker 1>presence in front of my keyboard.</v>

281
00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I await her arrival.</v>

282
00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up,</v>

283
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.300
<v Speaker 1>you know Jesus Christ.</v>

284
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>But what you were being honest about is I believe a psychological or a mental</v>

285
00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:15.420
<v Speaker 1>state that you're in when creativity,</v>

286
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

287
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.910
<v Speaker 1>works at its best.</v>

288
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>And by putting it in your no nonsense terms and putting in in this really very,</v>

289
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.410
<v Speaker 1>very honest term,</v>

290
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:25.981
<v Speaker 1>like the way you,</v>

291
00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>the way you are honest description,</v>

292
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>the way you describe it as that's what it is.</v>

293
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Like he nailed it and I think that's what John Mayer,</v>

294
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.220
<v Speaker 1>that's what he said,</v>

295
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

296
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what John Mayer saw and all the sudden one of John's Roxburgh</v>

297
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.270
<v Speaker 1>well you like him are dreaming so you might as well be o shot.</v>

298
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

299
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.900
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

300
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that creative people,</v>

301
00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>when they read your book,</v>

302
00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

303
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.281
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

304
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:51.120
<v Speaker 1>This guy nailed it.</v>

305
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.350
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>

306
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>that's very important.</v>

307
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:54.600
<v Speaker 1>What you did is very,</v>

308
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.463
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

309
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I haven't even</v>

310
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.701
<v Speaker 4>read your fiction.</v>

311
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:59.660
<v Speaker 4>I've been privileged to watch some of your movies that people would turn into</v>

312
00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:00.151
<v Speaker 4>your fiction,</v>

313
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just a big fan of your nonfiction.</v>

314
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to start reading a fiction now.</v>

315
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:03.851
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

316
00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I brought a couple here that I got there.</v>

317
00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that you'll like these one is gates of fire and the is tied to</v>

318
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 4>or that sounds like some manly shit.</v>

319
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

320
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 4>red tides of war.</v>

321
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.130
<v Speaker 4>Dawn,</v>

322
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.153
<v Speaker 4>what is it about,</v>

323
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.993
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

324
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.923
<v Speaker 3>what is it about?</v>

325
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

326
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 3>gates of fire is about the battle of Thermopylae.</v>

327
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not 300 and not that movie,</v>

328
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

329
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 3>But it's like a good version of that.</v>

330
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 3>And tides of war is also said in that era.</v>

331
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:31.794
<v Speaker 3>It's a different,</v>

332
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>a different story about,</v>

333
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

334
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 4>by 80 Socrates.</v>

335
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.090
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

336
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:37.421
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

337
00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Powerful figures from history.</v>

338
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.360
<v Speaker 4>It sounds daunting job,</v>

339
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.213
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>

340
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.220
<v Speaker 4>it sounds awesome.</v>

341
00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge fan of history over the last few years especially,</v>

342
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a big fan of a history podcasts now and we had Greg Proops here</v>

343
00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:51.101
<v Speaker 4>yesterday,</v>

344
00:09:51.101 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 4>that school this on Columbus proofs is a huge like history buff,</v>

345
00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.860
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to Columbus.</v>

346
00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:57.640
<v Speaker 4>And he just,</v>

347
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.540
<v Speaker 4>he's a brilliant guy.</v>

348
00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.350
<v Speaker 4>So he's rattling off this the history of what an asshole Columbus,</v>

349
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.630
<v Speaker 4>it's really embarrassing that there's still a Columbus Day who knew?</v>

350
00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:10.120
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what a bad guy,</v>

351
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.130
<v Speaker 4>he was really a bad guy.</v>

352
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:12.791
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

353
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:13.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

354
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.751
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge,</v>

355
00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:14.660
<v Speaker 4>huge fan of that,</v>

356
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.880
<v Speaker 4>that stuff of just,</v>

357
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.391
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

358
00:10:16.391 --> 00:10:19.660
<v Speaker 4>it's so fascinating to me that there was only a few hundred years ago that</v>

359
00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:22.120
<v Speaker 4>people were living this outrageously.</v>

360
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.453
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

361
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.570
<v Speaker 4>And you got to read some more of his nonfiction too.</v>

362
00:10:25.571 --> 00:10:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I just finished the authentic swing.</v>

363
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Really cool books,</v>

364
00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:29.350
<v Speaker 4>especially for writers,</v>

365
00:10:29.351 --> 00:10:29.860
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

366
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

367
00:10:30.101 --> 00:10:33.760
<v Speaker 4>cause it really goes through his process of writing the legend of Bagger Vance</v>

368
00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:34.130
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

369
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.140
<v Speaker 4>and talking about that.</v>

370
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Really cool to see you kind of refined some of those same concepts.</v>

371
00:10:39.641 --> 00:10:43.750
<v Speaker 4>And for me as you were talking about the Muse and getting really a therial for</v>

372
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:43.961
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

373
00:10:43.961 --> 00:10:47.980
<v Speaker 4>one thing that you kind of drove home here is that the muse can be that higher</v>

374
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.050
<v Speaker 4>part of ourselves that we're just tapping into.</v>

375
00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:54.400
<v Speaker 4>And for me that's been one of the key things in my life is finding the ways to</v>

376
00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:55.180
<v Speaker 4>tap into that.</v>

377
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:55.421
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

378
00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.730
<v Speaker 4>and I have a bunch of tricks and tools like,</v>

379
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

380
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.150
<v Speaker 4>crazy psychedelic medicine in the jungles of South America,</v>

381
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.860
<v Speaker 4>things like that that helped me get there.</v>

382
00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:04.750
<v Speaker 4>But really the muse can be,</v>

383
00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:04.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

384
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.270
<v Speaker 4>finding that highest part of yourself,</v>

385
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:09.880
<v Speaker 4>that part of yourself that's tapped into everything else around you.</v>

386
00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:12.160
<v Speaker 4>And that kind of quantum soup,</v>

387
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:12.641
<v Speaker 4>as you call it,</v>

388
00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:13.211
<v Speaker 4>the magic,</v>

389
00:11:13.211 --> 00:11:14.950
<v Speaker 4>the source of the universe itself.</v>

390
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.710
<v Speaker 4>And I thought that was a really kind of cool way to draw that in.</v>

391
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe we'll get you to read that little still.</v>

392
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.751
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it was.</v>

393
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:20.901
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

394
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:21.734
<v Speaker 4>I would love to.</v>

395
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

396
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:22.681
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

397
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.340
<v Speaker 4>the idea of getting out of your own way.</v>

398
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.233
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one.</v>

399
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.380
<v Speaker 4>How'd you figure that out?</v>

400
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

401
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.260
<v Speaker 3>probably the same way you did.</v>

402
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:29.651
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

403
00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the,</v>

404
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 3>it's anybody that's trying to do anything in art or filmmaking,</v>

405
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.721
<v Speaker 3>painting,</v>

406
00:11:37.721 --> 00:11:40.420
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is you find or,</v>

407
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.850
<v Speaker 3>or sports or golf particularly,</v>

408
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 3>you find that the tendency is to try too hard.</v>

409
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

410
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.790
<v Speaker 3>You're so you want it so bad,</v>

411
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:49.990
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to screw up.</v>

412
00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:51.040
<v Speaker 3>You want to get it right.</v>

413
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:51.490
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>

414
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:51.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

415
00:11:51.851 --> 00:11:53.050
<v Speaker 3>not embarrass yourself.</v>

416
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.381
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

417
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 3>And so you wind up trying,</v>

418
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:55.991
<v Speaker 3>trying,</v>

419
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 3>trying so hard that nothing comes,</v>

420
00:11:58.391 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

421
00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 3>And finally,</v>

422
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 3>like over,</v>

423
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>

424
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure this is the same for everybody.</v>

425
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.310
<v Speaker 3>You kind of say to yourself,</v>

426
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.541
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

427
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I just have to lighten up a little bit.</v>

428
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Cause when,</v>

429
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 3>when good things happen is what I'm not trying so hard.</v>

430
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 3>And in many ways,</v>

431
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the hardest thing of all.</v>

432
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:12.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

433
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Aubrey,</v>

434
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying about being in the jungle,</v>

435
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:14.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

436
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic juggle,</v>

437
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 3>what that's really all about is not trying.</v>

438
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.721
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

439
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 3>it's like the hardest thing in the world is to say somebody says to you,</v>

440
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.613
<v Speaker 3>relax.</v>

441
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

442
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Or be yourself.</v>

443
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 3>It just be yourself,</v>

444
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

445
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

446
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

447
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

448
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Speaker 3>and yet I think as we become more professional and better at what we're doing,</v>

449
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>when somebody says to you,</v>

450
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 3>be yourself,</v>

451
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.773
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

452
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

453
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

454
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 3>you're not burdened by these false selves and these things that,</v>

455
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

456
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 3>that you think you ought to be or when you want to say,</v>

457
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 3>or how you want to look or what you ought to be.</v>

458
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 3>You've kind of gotten rid of those,</v>

459
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:51.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

460
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>

461
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 3>deliberately,</v>

462
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 3>very deliberately.</v>

463
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 3>And I certainly have,</v>

464
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

465
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:56.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

466
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:58.690
<v Speaker 3>I very deliberately tried,</v>

467
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

468
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 3>when I feel myself going that way to pull back and let go.</v>

469
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.830
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

470
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 3>and I think in many ways that's what any artist does.</v>

471
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 3>As they become a professional at what they do,</v>

472
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 3>they learn to kind of get out of their own way,</v>

473
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 3>and it's the hardest thing of all,</v>

474
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:14.584
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

475
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 3>and the people we talk about resistance or the way people screw themselves up,</v>

476
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:19.774
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

477
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 3>That's how they screw themselves up is they're in,</v>

478
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 3>they're getting in their own way,</v>

479
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

480
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 3>They're listening to their own bullshit.</v>

481
00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:27.900
<v Speaker 3>They're believing it and,</v>

482
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

483
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 3>and they're blocked from whatever they're trying to do.</v>

484
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's what the comics,</v>

485
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:34.091
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

486
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 3>when they get on stage and they bomb,</v>

487
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:35.951
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

488
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:36.784
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening.</v>

489
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

490
00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:39.120
<v Speaker 1>That definitely is a big part of it.</v>

491
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.541
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

492
00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

493
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the what,</v>

494
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>what I think you're doing that I think is really cool is that by living your</v>

495
00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>life and figuring things out and then documenting and sharing them,</v>

496
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:49.891
<v Speaker 1>sharing them,</v>

497
00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:50.970
<v Speaker 1>like in a really honest way,</v>

498
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.950
<v Speaker 1>we are all providing together what's basically a direction,</v>

499
00:13:55.951 --> 00:13:56.071
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

500
00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:59.730
<v Speaker 1>you on how to live your life and avoid a lot of bullshit that most people get</v>

501
00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 1>involved with.</v>

502
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.260
<v Speaker 1>This is right.</v>

503
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.030
<v Speaker 1>This is the stuff they don't teach you in school.</v>

504
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.571
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

505
00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That's because they don't know we're trying to do.</v>

506
00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:10.281
<v Speaker 1>Now the real problem is the human body and the human mind is probably the most</v>

507
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:15.390
<v Speaker 1>complicated vehicle that the world has ever seen.</v>

508
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Forget about all the rocket ships and all the,</v>

509
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.200
<v Speaker 1>the different things that you have to go through years and years of school</v>

510
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 1>before they let you fuck with whether it's FAA,</v>

511
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>18 fighter jets or helicopters,</v>

512
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:27.720
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

513
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.041
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

514
00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I watched a friend get his pilot's license.</v>

515
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Just studying all aerodynamics and all these different things you have to know</v>

516
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:38.040
<v Speaker 1>to take the test and wins and you'd have to do shit to be a person.</v>

517
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.180
<v Speaker 1>You just a person.</v>

518
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's way crazier to operate this thing.</v>

519
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it has emotions attached to it.</v>

520
00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 1>It can make other people with its penis which likes rubbing.</v>

521
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.320
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

522
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous animal and it's a ridiculous</v>

523
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 4>sort of a thing to try to manage with no help.</v>

524
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.510
<v Speaker 4>And by you writing this book and people sharing their,</v>

525
00:14:58.511 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 4>their own personal experiences.</v>

526
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

527
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that young men appreciate the most about old men is an old man</v>

528
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 4>who will tell you what he did wrong.</v>

529
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 4>Like when I meet young kids and was like,</v>

530
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

531
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:10.783
<v Speaker 4>listen to me.</v>

532
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 4>Not going to bullshit you,</v>

533
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 4>but don't do that.</v>

534
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:13.994
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you do,</v>

535
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 4>don't do this one.</v>

536
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:16.991
<v Speaker 5>That one's stupid.</v>

537
00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:18.160
<v Speaker 5>Of course nobody listens.</v>

538
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.413
<v Speaker 5>People do.</v>

539
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:24.160
<v Speaker 5>But if there's that old expression that a wise man learns from the mistakes of</v>

540
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:24.994
<v Speaker 5>others,</v>

541
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.360
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

542
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.070
<v Speaker 5>A full Nynex zone zone.</v>

543
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

544
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.290
<v Speaker 4>I thought one of the concepts that you brought up that I really like as well as</v>

545
00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:31.950
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

546
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

547
00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:34.170
<v Speaker 4>it's not so much learning new things,</v>

548
00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:37.620
<v Speaker 4>it's remembering what we've decided to forget upon,</v>

549
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:37.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

550
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.813
<v Speaker 4>upon birth,</v>

551
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

552
00:15:39.031 --> 00:15:39.751
<v Speaker 4>you come from,</v>

553
00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:41.460
<v Speaker 4>if you have that kind of paradigm of belief,</v>

554
00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:42.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think you need it though.</v>

555
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.460
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you come from source,</v>

556
00:15:44.461 --> 00:15:48.180
<v Speaker 4>some kind of near perfect knowledge and then you're born and through whatever</v>

557
00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:49.230
<v Speaker 4>reason you decide,</v>

558
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.681
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

559
00:15:49.681 --> 00:15:51.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to forget the rules of this game.</v>

560
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.180
<v Speaker 4>And Alan Watts talks about it in a really interesting way of,</v>

561
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:54.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

562
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.610
<v Speaker 4>if you did have omnipotence,</v>

563
00:15:56.611 --> 00:15:57.750
<v Speaker 4>what would become interesting,</v>

564
00:15:57.751 --> 00:16:01.560
<v Speaker 4>well interesting would be to figure it out all over again because any known</v>

565
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:03.030
<v Speaker 4>future is a past,</v>

566
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

567
00:16:03.301 --> 00:16:04.740
<v Speaker 4>if it's perfectly known future,</v>

568
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.701
<v Speaker 4>it's already happened.</v>

569
00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:06.630
<v Speaker 4>It's happened in your mind,</v>

570
00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:07.464
<v Speaker 4>it's happened there.</v>

571
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.030
<v Speaker 4>So you make this pack to forget.</v>

572
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.810
<v Speaker 4>Then you forget everything upon birth and then as you go through life,</v>

573
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:17.490
<v Speaker 4>you try to remember again as much as you can by tapping in to that eternal part</v>

574
00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:18.061
<v Speaker 4>of ourselves.</v>

575
00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.260
<v Speaker 4>And that's a little bit,</v>

576
00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:22.320
<v Speaker 4>I might have gone a little a little astray with what you're saying,</v>

577
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:25.570
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of that that you're talking about it at all with uh,</v>

578
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.490
<v Speaker 4>w with the authentic,</v>

579
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:26.820
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

580
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.420
<v Speaker 5>Let me just add,</v>

581
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.300
<v Speaker 5>so you have your fairy,</v>

582
00:16:28.301 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 5>but it isn't right.</v>

583
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's the,</v>

584
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.720
<v Speaker 5>the various Smith's,</v>

585
00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:31.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

586
00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:33.190
<v Speaker 5>this thing on her upper lip,</v>

587
00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:34.450
<v Speaker 5>just a little indentation.</v>

588
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:35.710
<v Speaker 5>Where does that come from?</v>

589
00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 5>The myth is that before birth,</v>

590
00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:38.650
<v Speaker 5>we knew everything.</v>

591
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.100
<v Speaker 5>And an angel just before we were born,</v>

592
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.230
<v Speaker 5>touched us right there and nothing came out again or the other.</v>

593
00:16:44.231 --> 00:16:45.250
<v Speaker 5>Another makes sense.</v>

594
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.960
<v Speaker 5>That's what we call an angel in the,</v>

595
00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:47.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

596
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.121
<v Speaker 5>we're a bunch of self,</v>

597
00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:48.954
<v Speaker 5>eight Nass halls.</v>

598
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.710
<v Speaker 5>In the Greek world,</v>

599
00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:52.240
<v Speaker 5>there's a thing that when you were,</v>

600
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:53.440
<v Speaker 5>you had to cross the,</v>

601
00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:54.274
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

602
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.731
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

603
00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:55.630
<v Speaker 5>into the underworld.</v>

604
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:58.480
<v Speaker 5>He had to cross the river that the ferryman Tokyo across.</v>

605
00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.980
<v Speaker 5>And when you were born again,</v>

606
00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:01.210
<v Speaker 5>you had a drink of the river,</v>

607
00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:02.050
<v Speaker 5>the river Liffey,</v>

608
00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:02.291
<v Speaker 5>l,</v>

609
00:17:02.291 --> 00:17:02.381
<v Speaker 5>e,</v>

610
00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:02.651
<v Speaker 5>t,</v>

611
00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:02.891
<v Speaker 5>h,</v>

612
00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:03.550
<v Speaker 5>e.</v>

613
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 5>And from that four lethargy,</v>

614
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:09.040
<v Speaker 5>the word comes from as soon as you drank or that you forgot everything.</v>

615
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.190
<v Speaker 5>It was like men in black when they flashed a little thing in front of your eyes,</v>

616
00:17:12.191 --> 00:17:12.640
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

617
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.080
<v Speaker 5>Well that's probably analogous,</v>

618
00:17:14.081 --> 00:17:17.880
<v Speaker 5>the psychedelic experiences because a certain psychedelics,</v>

619
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.390
<v Speaker 5>especially DMT,</v>

620
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.111
<v Speaker 5>there's one of the,</v>

621
00:17:20.111 --> 00:17:24.490
<v Speaker 5>one of the aspects of it is that your memory of it goes away almost instantly.</v>

622
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.990
<v Speaker 5>Like you have this incredible trip.</v>

623
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.780
<v Speaker 5>And then trying to remember it is like really difficult.</v>

624
00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.400
<v Speaker 5>And one of the ways you remember it is actually,</v>

625
00:17:30.401 --> 00:17:32.200
<v Speaker 5>you remember the way he described it before.</v>

626
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.540
<v Speaker 5>You don't necessarily remember the experience itself,</v>

627
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:37.390
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the most incredible experiences of your life,</v>

628
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.060
<v Speaker 5>but there's some mechanism that's a racing,</v>

629
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.390
<v Speaker 5>that memory in the human mind and it's the same one.</v>

630
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.500
<v Speaker 5>Interesting Joe and everyone that works on dreams,</v>

631
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.281
<v Speaker 5>dreams,</v>

632
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:46.600
<v Speaker 5>you forget dreams like that.</v>

633
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:46.901
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

634
00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 5>so and there's a way to help retain some of that.</v>

635
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.250
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we sell is a supplement called Alpha brain.</v>

636
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a nootropic.</v>

637
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Nootropics are essentially vitamins and nutrients that have been shown to have a</v>

638
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 1>positive benefit on cognitive function and this Alpha brain stuff.</v>

639
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that it works great on is lucid dreaming.</v>

640
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.210
<v Speaker 1>They found that people that are practitioners of lucid dreaming this,</v>

641
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 1>this interesting combination of Nutria could control your dream as apparently</v>

642
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:16.980
<v Speaker 1>they say that what they can do that lucid dreamers say that what they can do is</v>

643
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 1>when they get in a dream,</v>

644
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:21.240
<v Speaker 1>then it's like they're the people that are really good at it.</v>

645
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:21.900
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

646
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>they're basically in a movie,</v>

647
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.440
<v Speaker 1>they can fly there.</v>

648
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 1>One of the Avengers,</v>

649
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting off aliens.</v>

650
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 1>They control the entire show.</v>

651
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It sounds amazing.</v>

652
00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It seems like something I should probably look into,</v>

653
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.023
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

654
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason I was drawn to it.</v>

655
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

656
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely resistance on that because it's a really fascinating idea.</v>

657
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I've had lucid dreams and the ones that I had once I started fucking around with</v>

658
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:45.834
<v Speaker 1>nootropics,</v>

659
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.130
<v Speaker 1>they got a lot stronger.</v>

660
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

661
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 1>of Coleen,</v>

662
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:49.461
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

663
00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:53.810
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the ingredients and a Alpha brand in one,</v>

664
00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:54.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

665
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 1>one of the big,</v>

666
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

667
00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.560
<v Speaker 1>nootropics that seems to have a of an effect as does a prasad,</v>

668
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Tim and sandy saying it,</v>

669
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.933
<v Speaker 1>pressing him.</v>

670
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of those are still working on the acetylcholine mechanism,</v>

671
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of controls the rem state and that's your dream state.</v>

672
00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:09.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

673
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:09.920
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

674
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.810
<v Speaker 1>you guys tried to,</v>

675
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

676
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.150
<v Speaker 1>it has an FBI.</v>

677
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.350
<v Speaker 1>We like messing with our mind in a healthy way.</v>

678
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 1>You find out that there's stuff that actually allows you to think a little</v>

679
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>crisper.</v>

680
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

681
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I started looking into it many years back cause um,</v>

682
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I read about Bill Roman Halsey who was a football player who's getting a lot of</v>

683
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 1>concussions obviously when he's playing football and he was having issues</v>

684
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:34.380
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and he developed this supplement called neuro one and that's his</v>

685
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>

686
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 1>It's know added to water and it's,</v>

687
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

688
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>this interesting mixture of thing.</v>

689
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:39.271
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

690
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:39.761
<v Speaker 1>I took it,</v>

691
00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

692
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.380
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

693
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of crazy.</v>

694
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Like this is really having some sort of an effect.</v>

695
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.510
<v Speaker 1>But the point being that that's the only thing that I've ever found that can</v>

696
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.540
<v Speaker 1>counteract that sort of legendary thing of erasing the memory of the fantastic</v>

697
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 1>event because that's a theme.</v>

698
00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>The erasing the memory of the fantastic event,</v>

699
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 1>the erasing the memory of the brilliant knowledge by the angels.</v>

700
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:03.271
<v Speaker 1>You knew everything.</v>

701
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:03.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what we,</v>

702
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.471
<v Speaker 1>you're on Dmt,</v>

703
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.304
<v Speaker 1>you know everything.</v>

704
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.390
<v Speaker 1>You figured it all out.</v>

705
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

706
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.201
<v Speaker 1>you've got it.</v>

707
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:07.711
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

708
00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:08.041
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

709
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

710
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.211
<v Speaker 1>You sure he got it.</v>

711
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:09.991
<v Speaker 1>I got it dude.</v>

712
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:10.824
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

713
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

714
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Let me back down to earth.</v>

715
00:20:12.241 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God I'm a different person.</v>

716
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

717
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.410
<v Speaker 1>But that that goes into,</v>

718
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it goes away and it seems like this touch of the lip and the drinking of the</v>

719
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

720
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:28.550
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they're trying to put mythologize this chemical process of the</v>

721
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

722
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I think how this Huxley did a really good job explaining what's going on.</v>

723
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:36.960
<v Speaker 1>We have this cognitive filter that decides what is useful to not get eaten by</v>

724
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:39.330
<v Speaker 1>tigers and to procreate the species.</v>

725
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's like this gate,</v>

726
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>he calls it the doors of perception or cognitive filter and it's this gate and</v>

728
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>it only lets in what is for the animal to</v>

729
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 6>survive.</v>

730
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 6>And so anything else outside of that,</v>

731
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

732
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:51.660
<v Speaker 6>the brain says,</v>

733
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:51.821
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

734
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:52.421
<v Speaker 6>we don't need this.</v>

735
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:52.991
<v Speaker 6>Get rid of this,</v>

736
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:53.270
<v Speaker 6>get,</v>

737
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

738
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.101
<v Speaker 6>De,</v>

739
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 6>prioritize this because this is an important,</v>

740
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.330
<v Speaker 6>and so what psychedelics do,</v>

741
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 6>what dreams do is they open up the walls of this filter.</v>

742
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.301
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

743
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:01.610
<v Speaker 6>you tell,</v>

744
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 6>look at the mechanism of action as something like,</v>

745
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:04.294
<v Speaker 6>so assignment,</v>

746
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.950
<v Speaker 6>it's not adding something to your brain.</v>

747
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 6>It's actually shutting down certain parts,</v>

748
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 6>shutting down the default mode network it's called,</v>

749
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 6>which is one of the filtering devices in the brain.</v>

750
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 6>So just more comes in and if you let more in more of that stuff from the,</v>

751
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 6>beyond the quantum soup,</v>

752
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:20.500
<v Speaker 6>as you say,</v>

753
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.240
<v Speaker 6>you let more of that in while you can get a little bit closer</v>

754
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>

755
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.500
<v Speaker 1>cause you guys just shutting off your brain like a bunch of fucking morons.</v>

756
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Well you're doing is you should listen to you over there.</v>

757
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.160
<v Speaker 1>You're taking this fucking mushroom and a shut your brain off and you think</v>

758
00:21:34.161 --> 00:21:34.994
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

759
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.290
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a good thing?</v>

760
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

761
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 6>that's what the science is saying.</v>

762
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.200
<v Speaker 3>What do you think Aubrey,</v>

763
00:21:39.201 --> 00:21:39.650
<v Speaker 3>about that?</v>

764
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.250
<v Speaker 3>The idea that door to the theory that when we're children,</v>

765
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.330
<v Speaker 3>when we're infants,</v>

766
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.920
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing all that.</v>

767
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like an asset.</v>

768
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.170
<v Speaker 3>If you look at a kid's eyes,</v>

769
00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:48.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

770
00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.720
<v Speaker 3>They're not the same as our eyes,</v>

771
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.410
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

772
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:51.571
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

773
00:21:51.571 --> 00:21:52.640
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at the room.</v>

774
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.020
<v Speaker 3>God knows what they're seeing,</v>

775
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.580
<v Speaker 3>but it's not what we're seeing.</v>

776
00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:57.260
<v Speaker 3>And that the process of,</v>

777
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.343
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

778
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 3>growing a little bit older is a kind of a throttling of that aperture right</v>

779
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.550
<v Speaker 3>below that aperture walls.</v>

780
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.061
<v Speaker 6>Every,</v>

781
00:22:05.061 --> 00:22:06.050
<v Speaker 6>every year that we live,</v>

782
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.910
<v Speaker 6>we build more and more filters more.</v>

783
00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:08.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

784
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.220
<v Speaker 1>And we accelerate whatever we do.</v>

785
00:22:10.221 --> 00:22:10.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

786
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:12.260
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to push for a promotion at work,</v>

787
00:22:12.261 --> 00:22:15.530
<v Speaker 1>so we're putting in extra hours and I've got to bring home some of my projects</v>

788
00:22:15.531 --> 00:22:15.981
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

789
00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:17.840
<v Speaker 1>your kids are growing older and you know,</v>

790
00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:19.670
<v Speaker 1>they're in daycare and you don't see him,</v>

791
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.381
<v Speaker 1>but you got to,</v>

792
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:20.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

793
00:22:20.571 --> 00:22:22.880
<v Speaker 1>eventually we're going to get that vacation house and then everything's going to</v>

794
00:22:22.881 --> 00:22:27.080
<v Speaker 1>come together and went and we complicate our lives deeper and deeper and deeper</v>

795
00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:27.920
<v Speaker 1>as we get older,</v>

796
00:22:27.921 --> 00:22:29.470
<v Speaker 1>almost as if to avoid</v>

797
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.623
<v Speaker 6>silence.</v>

798
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.200
<v Speaker 6>Mm.</v>

799
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.501
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

800
00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:33.000
<v Speaker 6>we claimed all be looking for it,</v>

801
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.190
<v Speaker 6>but we just fucking avoiding it at all costs so much lighter after like a</v>

802
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:39.720
<v Speaker 6>flotation tank experience.</v>

803
00:22:39.721 --> 00:22:40.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

804
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.310
<v Speaker 6>It's just like you can peel off some of these layers and recover just a fragment</v>

805
00:22:44.311 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 6>of those child's eyes that kind of lighthearted.</v>

806
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:47.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

807
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:47.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

808
00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:50.160
<v Speaker 3>it's all a way to me this just short of what,</v>

809
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.043
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

810
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.460
<v Speaker 3>the PR producing art is about,</v>

811
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

812
00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:55.044
<v Speaker 3>you should,</v>

813
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.501
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

814
00:22:55.501 --> 00:22:56.161
<v Speaker 3>like for instance,</v>

815
00:22:56.161 --> 00:22:57.770
<v Speaker 3>these two books that I have been talking about here,</v>

816
00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.410
<v Speaker 3>gates of fire and tides of war at some point I,</v>

817
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

818
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.240
<v Speaker 3>it's a long story,</v>

819
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.991
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

820
00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:04.824
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

821
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I had to come up with an idea for a book and so I brought gates of fire,</v>

822
00:23:08.881 --> 00:23:12.990
<v Speaker 3>which was at ancient Greece and next thing I knew I had done five books about</v>

823
00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:13.561
<v Speaker 3>ancient Greece.</v>

824
00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I had never in my life thought about that.</v>

825
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.230
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

826
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.280
<v Speaker 3>I had no,</v>

827
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.620
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like I was obsessed with it or anything.</v>

828
00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:20.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything about it.</v>

829
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.630
<v Speaker 3>But some things sort of pulled me into it and kept me going.</v>

830
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.860
<v Speaker 3>So I think in a way that's the,</v>

831
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.330
<v Speaker 3>if you're painting or you're making a film,</v>

832
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.110
<v Speaker 3>you're discovering what you already know.</v>

833
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.423
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

834
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.660
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

835
00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:38.130
<v Speaker 3>it's like it was in you,</v>

836
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.520
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't know it was in you and you don't know it's a new until you see it</v>

837
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.950
<v Speaker 3>on the page or it's on a song or something like that.</v>

838
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 3>And what's,</v>

839
00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:46.170
<v Speaker 3>what's</v>

840
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.090
<v Speaker 5>kind of weird to me here,</v>

841
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:47.290
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

842
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 5>I've written like whatever,</v>

843
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 5>five or six books about ancient Greece,</v>

844
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.390
<v Speaker 5>but yet I'm not remotely interested in ancient Rome.</v>

845
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.253
<v Speaker 5>I just don't give a shit.</v>

846
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:54.441
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

847
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:58.430
<v Speaker 5>It's so why is it a previous life?</v>

848
00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.661
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

849
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 5>Some people love the civil war.</v>

850
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:02.121
<v Speaker 5>They love,</v>

851
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:02.631
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

852
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 5>ancient Ireland,</v>

853
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 5>whatever was all,</v>

854
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.940
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants to play the north in the civil war arena.</v>

855
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 5>They're always playing the south,</v>

856
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:10.604
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>

857
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 5>why are we drawn to whatever it is we're drawing?</v>

858
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.931
<v Speaker 5>There's a reason.</v>

859
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:16.310
<v Speaker 5>It's not just nothing.</v>

860
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

861
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>

862
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.620
<v Speaker 5>It might be a con the,</v>

863
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 5>an incredible combination of your genetics,</v>

864
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 5>your life experiences,</v>

865
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 5>your atmosphere,</v>

866
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 5>your personal experiences that you've sort of developed a personality around.</v>

867
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 5>There's so many different variables that could lead you to be really like,</v>

868
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 5>I love werewolves.</v>

869
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

870
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 5>I've got a four foot tall werewolf in my lobby,</v>

871
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:43.550
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't make any sense.</v>

872
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:43.731
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

873
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong with me?</v>

874
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

875
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit about the mummy.</v>

876
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:47.853
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

877
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm not scared of Frankenstein.</v>

878
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

879
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:49.681
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

880
00:24:49.681 --> 00:24:50.514
<v Speaker 5>it's not really,</v>

881
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.000
<v Speaker 5>it's just a guy or a about that Joe,</v>

882
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 5>is that there is no such thing as a werewolf.</v>

883
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:55.211
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

884
00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:55.380
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

885
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:55.911
<v Speaker 5>So stupid.</v>

886
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.890
<v Speaker 5>It's not like I could see being obsessed with wolves,</v>

887
00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.000
<v Speaker 5>but werewolf sold there.</v>

888
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.240
<v Speaker 5>So that tells me that on some level there is such a thing as a Werewolf really</v>

889
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:05.800
<v Speaker 5>tells me I'm a retard,</v>

890
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.593
<v Speaker 5>but you're not,</v>

891
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 5>you're not alone because there are a lot of people watching Werewolf,</v>

892
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.770
<v Speaker 5>at least some archetype that's represented by the,</v>

893
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:14.380
<v Speaker 5>where right now some itch that,</v>

894
00:25:14.381 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 5>that scratching,</v>

895
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 5>it's a deeper,</v>

896
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

897
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.830
<v Speaker 5>very well is also,</v>

898
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 5>we know that humans very with a very radically,</v>

899
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:22.634
<v Speaker 5>we very</v>

900
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 1>in our own lives,</v>

901
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.460
<v Speaker 1>we were not like Beatles.</v>

902
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 1>What we essentially move the same way I do it.</v>

903
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:28.880
<v Speaker 1>And there's no explosive,</v>

904
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:29.930
<v Speaker 1>weird actions.</v>

905
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:30.471
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

906
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:32.300
<v Speaker 1>humans are constantly varying,</v>

907
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 1>varying.</v>

908
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you're enjoying the,</v>

909
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.690
<v Speaker 1>your interactions with other people or in,</v>

910
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 1>in pain because of them varying.</v>

911
00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you're an ecstasy because of your movements are just terribly</v>

912
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 1>like stressed out and stuck in traffic and good coming from a job that sucks to</v>

913
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:46.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

914
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

915
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:47.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

916
00:25:47.441 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 1>a marriage that's fucking poisoning you.</v>

917
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.820
<v Speaker 1>There's this of the variations are massive.</v>

918
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.050
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>

919
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:58.310
<v Speaker 1>the possibilities of each individual interaction that you have with people is</v>

920
00:25:58.311 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

921
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So you could run into someone that feels like a wild animal and you know that</v>

922
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a part of people and you know that you very,</v>

923
00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>and then if someone threatens your children something,</v>

924
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.710
<v Speaker 1>this shit does come out of you.</v>

925
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>That's so primal that it doesn't even have a language attached to it.</v>

926
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 1>The movements have nothing to do with morality or ethics or law.</v>

927
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.870
<v Speaker 1>They have to do with primal DNA seeking to stay around seeking.</v>

928
00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:22.704
<v Speaker 1>You stay alive.</v>

929
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's a wolf.</v>

930
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.633
<v Speaker 1>That's a wolf.</v>

931
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what a wolf is.</v>

932
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:27.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

933
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:28.460
<v Speaker 1>a wolf is prime.</v>

934
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever had an interaction with an animal,</v>

935
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>a real interaction,</v>

936
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a fucking squirrel that wants to kick your ass,</v>

937
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.900
<v Speaker 1>scary as shit.</v>

938
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Because like we were talking yesterday about baboons and about how evil baboons</v>

939
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:42.900
<v Speaker 1>are and Greg Proops of saying that they,</v>

940
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.590
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

941
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.500
<v Speaker 1>they will rush women in Africa where you know,</v>

942
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:46.760
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

943
00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.660
<v Speaker 1>they're local and they'll rush women at the grocery store and just fucking steal</v>

944
00:26:50.661 --> 00:26:55.661
<v Speaker 1>their shit and look at him and like you were looking at a monster and just</v>

945
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:57.780
<v Speaker 1>because it hasn't decided to kill you and eat you,</v>

946
00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it's because it can,</v>

947
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 1>it certainly can.</v>

948
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It's much stronger than you.</v>

949
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It has a face of a dog.</v>

950
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It's got a brain of a monkey and it's stealing your groceries.</v>

951
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 1>You mean that's a werewolf,</v>

952
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.291
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

953
00:27:09.291 --> 00:27:09.781
<v Speaker 1>that's this,</v>

954
00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:14.781
<v Speaker 1>this thing of having this interaction with something that has no law to it and</v>

955
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:16.021
<v Speaker 1>then it,</v>

956
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 1>it comes out of a person.</v>

957
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that sort of the anthropomorphic side of a thing.</v>

958
00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

959
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.100
<v Speaker 1>we have this idea that the wolves are clever,</v>

960
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:26.910
<v Speaker 1>like a person as well because wolves are really fucking smart and they do a lot</v>

961
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:27.744
<v Speaker 1>of creepy shit.</v>

962
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Like they set up people like one wolf will come out and actually walk with the</v>

963
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>fake limp so they can like get,</v>

964
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

965
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:34.861
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

966
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

967
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 1>other people are predators close to it.</v>

968
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

969
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:38.761
<v Speaker 1>they're creepers,</v>

970
00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:39.031
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

971
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 1>They're really smart.</v>

972
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.460
<v Speaker 1>So you're a student of this stuff.</v>

973
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.443
<v Speaker 1>Wolves.</v>

974
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Wolves.</v>

975
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

976
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by anything that can kill me perhaps or done any vivid dreaming</v>

977
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:48.740
<v Speaker 1>on the subject of Wolf's?</v>

978
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

979
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I've had some nightmares.</v>

980
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

981
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I have one really weird dream that wasn't a nightmare.</v>

982
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Gorilla,</v>

983
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

984
00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

985
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Well the Werewolf and grill,</v>

986
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:01.170
<v Speaker 1>we're having sex and I was trying to get out of the room for anybody noticed and</v>

987
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I was like creeping like around the edge of the,</v>

988
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.681
<v Speaker 1>the walls,</v>

989
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 1>like really slowly.</v>

990
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And then someone actually sent me a,</v>

991
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.900
<v Speaker 1>a wolf and a gorilla having sex.</v>

992
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.831
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

993
00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

994
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.760
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

995
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 1>they put it together and like this structure,</v>

996
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 1>but the weirdest dream that I ever had,</v>

997
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

998
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.211
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

999
00:28:18.211 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1000
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I was a wolf or some sort of an animal,</v>

1001
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>but there was some sort of another animal next to me.</v>

1002
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:24.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1003
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 1>it's weird to try to remember exactly what it looked like.</v>

1004
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:27.690
<v Speaker 1>It was like something canine,</v>

1005
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 1>something like canine,</v>

1006
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:34.161
<v Speaker 1>not a cap and we're walking through this rain forest and water's dripping</v>

1007
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and water's like hitting my nose and I can smell shit that I have</v>

1008
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:41.550
<v Speaker 1>never smelled before and I can smell fear.</v>

1009
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I could smell this deer and the deer hears like game of Thrones.</v>

1010
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.740
<v Speaker 1>The deer hears a stick snap and the deers fear comes out like a,</v>

1011
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.150
<v Speaker 1>like a puff of mist and then I wake up.</v>

1012
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.733
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>

1013
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird dream.</v>

1014
00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:02.090
<v Speaker 1>It happened a couple of times where I had this like this glimpse of like an</v>

1015
00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:04.980
<v Speaker 1>animal stalking things and smelling things,</v>

1016
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's most likely just my imagination with all the things that I've read</v>

1017
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 1>about like dogs and stark.</v>

1018
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

1019
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's a like a part of us that's kind of repressed in the society</v>

1020
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>we live in now.</v>

1021
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:16.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1022
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.800
<v Speaker 1>like we have to apart keep,</v>

1023
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1024
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.220
<v Speaker 1>good amount.</v>

1025
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a huge part of us,</v>

1026
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:21.001
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>

1027
00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:22.680
<v Speaker 1>that we're keeping under wraps and saying,</v>

1028
00:29:22.681 --> 00:29:22.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1029
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:22.951
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1030
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:23.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1031
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you can't come out and play.</v>

1032
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:27.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't come out and play that kind of savage beast to the animal that's</v>

1033
00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:32.721
<v Speaker 1>inside of us that not many of us get to explore at all or release it all,</v>

1034
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.010
<v Speaker 1>back many years ago is,</v>

1036
00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:35.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1037
00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:36.144
<v Speaker 1>and these tails,</v>

1038
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:40.410
<v Speaker 1>there was opportunity for almost every adult male to enter this hand to hand</v>

1039
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>combat where could unleash</v>

1040
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 6>this whatever beast was inside of you,</v>

1041
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 6>you got to let it out.</v>

1042
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.540
<v Speaker 6>And perhaps they didn't really care that much about werewolves at that point</v>

1043
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 6>because they got to itch that scratch directly a sword.</v>

1044
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 6>So do you think that there's something,</v>

1045
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1046
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.790
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to diagnose the,</v>

1047
00:29:56.791 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 6>the male species been particular and then probably another one for the female</v>

1048
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.443
<v Speaker 6>that's kind of,</v>

1049
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.290
<v Speaker 6>we're struggling with because we don't have that outlet in our society where</v>

1050
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:06.124
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

1051
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1052
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:06.981
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1053
00:30:06.981 --> 00:30:07.581
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

1054
00:30:07.581 --> 00:30:08.414
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1055
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.351
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

1056
00:30:09.351 --> 00:30:11.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm just reading a book about the Comanche's,</v>

1057
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:12.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1058
00:30:12.891 --> 00:30:17.891
<v Speaker 3>and whatever it would allege 1860 in Texas and the incredible horror that these</v>

1059
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.750
<v Speaker 3>cruelty and,</v>

1060
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.590
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1061
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.560
<v Speaker 3>and also incredible endurance cleverness,</v>

1062
00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:26.900
<v Speaker 3>cunningness rapaciousness,</v>

1063
00:30:26.901 --> 00:30:27.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1064
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.430
<v Speaker 3>that they exhibited and that's like 150 years ago.</v>

1065
00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:32.870
<v Speaker 3>It is so far gone.</v>

1066
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.960
<v Speaker 3>The world that we live to drive in a Santa Monica,</v>

1067
00:30:35.961 --> 00:30:37.760
<v Speaker 3>get a Carmel Macchiato,</v>

1068
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:38.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1069
00:30:38.451 --> 00:30:40.490
<v Speaker 3>come back whatever you do.</v>

1070
00:30:40.491 --> 00:30:41.324
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1071
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.470
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

1072
00:30:42.471 --> 00:30:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I can see just sitting here in this room with the four guys,</v>

1073
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.710
<v Speaker 3>there's tremendous testosterone hanging around in this room.</v>

1074
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.920
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I want to put an m four and everybody's hand and tell you,</v>

1075
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.120
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1076
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:52.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1077
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.890
<v Speaker 3>start killing people and you'll be not here.</v>

1078
00:30:54.891 --> 00:30:55.724
<v Speaker 3>I'd be of course,</v>

1079
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.560
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's an,</v>

1080
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I really think you see this dark side to me everywhere in marriages,</v>

1081
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1082
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1083
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.760
<v Speaker 3>kids to parents in the dysfunction of the governor.</v>

1084
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Look at the government now with the shutdown and all this stuff.</v>

1085
00:31:11.421 --> 00:31:12.800
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell me that,</v>

1086
00:31:12.801 --> 00:31:16.640
<v Speaker 3>that's not some kind of forced that</v>

1087
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 3>found expression a few hundred years ago and doesn't find expression in anymore.</v>

1088
00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.103
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1089
00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:24.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1090
00:31:24.831 --> 00:31:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Norman mailer had this idea years ago that to help stop crime,</v>

1091
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.120
<v Speaker 3>he had this idea of an adventurer core.</v>

1092
00:31:32.121 --> 00:31:33.170
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard about this?</v>

1093
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.910
<v Speaker 3>One of his deals was,</v>

1094
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:35.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1095
00:31:35.541 --> 00:31:36.081
<v Speaker 3>the old,</v>

1096
00:31:36.081 --> 00:31:36.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1097
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.500
<v Speaker 3>wind jammer ships that like a would require a crew of 150 to go up in the sales</v>

1098
00:31:42.621 --> 00:31:44.330
<v Speaker 3>and sail around Cape Horn.</v>

1099
00:31:44.331 --> 00:31:45.164
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>

1100
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:45.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1101
00:31:45.471 --> 00:31:50.150
<v Speaker 3>adventure wild if he had an idea to have like a hundred of these ships and just</v>

1102
00:31:50.151 --> 00:31:55.151
<v Speaker 3>get young testosterone crazed kids out of the bad environments that they were in</v>

1103
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.930
<v Speaker 3>and get them,</v>

1104
00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:57.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1105
00:31:57.351 --> 00:31:59.780
<v Speaker 3>facing real shit out there in the real world.</v>

1106
00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:00.883
<v Speaker 3>And he thought that,</v>

1107
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1108
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.070
<v Speaker 3>that would be very interesting for them and for everybody.</v>

1109
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.300
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's a lot to that.</v>

1110
00:32:05.301 --> 00:32:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Why do people join the army now?</v>

1111
00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Why do they want to volunteer for Afghanistan?</v>

1112
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Because they care about bringing peace or the American way.</v>

1113
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1114
00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:17.600
<v Speaker 3>there's also people don't know what the fuck to do is also that it's a job that</v>

1115
00:32:17.601 --> 00:32:19.760
<v Speaker 3>people can get in places where there's no jobs.</v>

1116
00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:20.960
<v Speaker 3>The guaranteed living,</v>

1117
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.000
<v Speaker 3>you have family that's been in the military.</v>

1118
00:32:23.001 --> 00:32:25.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the pivot that people that I know that join the military,</v>

1119
00:32:25.821 --> 00:32:26.930
<v Speaker 3>it's usually those things.</v>

1120
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1121
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:28.271
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1122
00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:33.271
<v Speaker 3>it's a social substitute for writers passage to another as I have a lot of</v>

1123
00:32:33.981 --> 00:32:36.620
<v Speaker 3>people that read my books are in the military.</v>

1124
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.420
<v Speaker 3>You know what I may write to me and that da a,</v>

1125
00:32:38.421 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 3>and I can you that,</v>

1126
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:40.484
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1127
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.490
<v Speaker 3>they respond to the concept of a code of honor,</v>

1128
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 3>the concept of the warrior ethos.</v>

1129
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.801
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

1130
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 3>what's frustrating to them about the military unless they're in really elite</v>

1131
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:52.970
<v Speaker 3>units,</v>

1132
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 3>is that they don't get that.</v>

1133
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just the bullshit of,</v>

1134
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1135
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1136
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.760
<v Speaker 3>and they're not called on to really perform at the high,</v>

1137
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 3>high level that they know they wish they could.</v>

1138
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And you guys are into that with your supplementation and the stuff that you do,</v>

1139
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get to some level that's,</v>

1140
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:10.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1141
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.063
<v Speaker 3>beyond,</v>

1142
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.263
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1143
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I think to summarize what we're saying here is that the problem with the world</v>

1144
00:33:16.051 --> 00:33:20.710
<v Speaker 1>is weak bitches [inaudible] dudes out there that a week pitches and we all could</v>

1145
00:33:20.711 --> 00:33:24.420
<v Speaker 1>have been a weak bitch or could have been at one point in our lives a week</v>

1146
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:25.110
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1147
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's that the lack of discipline,</v>

1148
00:33:28.201 --> 00:33:30.480
<v Speaker 1>the lack of a quality character.</v>

1149
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing that we find like most distasteful and other people,</v>

1150
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.180
<v Speaker 1>when you see some weasley God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what's the worst thing that's going to happen to you?</v>

1175
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Dummy.</v>

1176
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.910
<v Speaker 1>The FBI comes and they,</v>

1177
00:34:08.911 --> 00:34:09.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they tell you they're their,</v>

1179
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:10.600

1182
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I've got to talk to my lawyer.</v>

1183
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck you're saying right now.</v>

1184
00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to my lawyer like I'm done.</v>

1185
00:34:15.961 --> 00:34:16.890
<v Speaker 1>We're done talking.</v>

1186
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.530
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you say you were the FBI and you're breaking up a card game,</v>

1187
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:20.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1188
00:34:20.221 --> 00:34:20.850
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1189
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:34:21.211 --> 00:34:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1191
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Take care.</v>

1192
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with that.</v>

1193
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

1194
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give up my fucking friends like a bitch.</v>

1195
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Speaker 1>But those people that do do that,</v>

1196
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.610
<v Speaker 1>there's scary.</v>

1197
00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:30.450
<v Speaker 1>They're creepers.</v>

1198
00:34:30.451 --> 00:34:31.740
<v Speaker 1>They're around us all the time.</v>

1199
00:34:31.741 --> 00:34:32.574
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1200
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.130
<v Speaker 1>that comes from a lack of doing the work.</v>

1201
00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It comes from a lack of self,</v>

1202
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.583
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1203
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 1>self analysis of objective thinking comes from a lack of a meditation comes from</v>

1204
00:34:45.091 --> 00:34:47.410
<v Speaker 1>a lack of being actually aware of the,</v>

1205
00:34:47.411 --> 00:34:49.200
<v Speaker 1>the true nature of your actions,</v>

1206
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.940
<v Speaker 1>the true nature of your behavior.</v>

1207
00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Let me change the subject slightly,</v>

1208
00:34:52.571 --> 00:34:54.430
<v Speaker 3>although it's not really changing the subject,</v>

1209
00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:55.510
<v Speaker 3>but to ask you a question,</v>

1210
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1211
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:56.290
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1212
00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.820
<v Speaker 3>why did you start this podcast and what is your intention,</v>

1213
00:35:00.821 --> 00:35:02.680
<v Speaker 3>your longterm intention here?</v>

1214
00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Does zero,</v>

1215
00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.690
<v Speaker 1>zero longterm,</v>

1216
00:35:04.691 --> 00:35:05.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1217
00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.360
<v Speaker 1>this is one of those things that sort of made itself.</v>

1218
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1219
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:12.640
<v Speaker 1>we knew of a few friends that had a podcast that they did.</v>

1220
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.271
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1221
00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:15.550
<v Speaker 1>my friend Anthony [inaudible] who's on the show,</v>

1222
00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:16.384
<v Speaker 1>opie and Anthony,</v>

1223
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 1>he has a basement in his house where he set up a full studio with HD</v>

1224
00:35:21.041 --> 00:35:23.980
<v Speaker 1>professional cameras and a green screen and he like,</v>

1225
00:35:23.981 --> 00:35:26.770
<v Speaker 1>he'll put like space behind him or New York City behind them.</v>

1226
00:35:26.771 --> 00:35:27.604
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1227
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.301
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.</v>

1228
00:35:28.301 --> 00:35:28.841
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way,</v>

1229
00:35:28.841 --> 00:35:29.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get one of those things.</v>

1230
00:35:29.831 --> 00:35:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It's called a tri caster.</v>

1231
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And my friend Justin,</v>

1232
00:35:32.261 --> 00:35:33.190
<v Speaker 1>who was in the other day,</v>

1233
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.290
<v Speaker 1>he uses him for is the actual report,</v>

1234
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.790
<v Speaker 1>but he did it and it looked cool.</v>

1235
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:39.451
<v Speaker 1>It looked like fun.</v>

1236
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 1>He would just have a couple of drinks with his buddies and do Karaoke while</v>

1237
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 1>holding a machine gun and he's,</v>

1238
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.873
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking crazy.</v>

1239
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1240
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.280
<v Speaker 1>so Brian and I started it.</v>

1241
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1242
00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 1>it'll be four years ago,</v>

1243
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:49.494
<v Speaker 1>December.</v>

1244
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.091
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1245
00:35:50.091 --> 00:35:50.451
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1246
00:35:50.451 --> 00:35:51.590
<v Speaker 7>It was just no Christmas.</v>

1247
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.483
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

1248
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:58.230
<v Speaker 7>I just did you sit down and say we want to do this or you now Brian's been,</v>

1250
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.730
<v Speaker 7>we were looking for something to do like two to four Joe's fans because Joey had</v>

1251
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.550
<v Speaker 7>so many fans and we would make these videos and they were nice but it was so</v>

1252
00:36:07.551 --> 00:36:09.890
<v Speaker 7>hard to edit all of this video and only came out once a month.</v>

1253
00:36:09.891 --> 00:36:12.800
<v Speaker 7>So we were kind of looking for something that said Joe can interact with his</v>

1254
00:36:12.801 --> 00:36:16.280
<v Speaker 7>fans faster for someone who's on the outside looking at the podcast cause you</v>

1255
00:36:16.281 --> 00:36:17.530
<v Speaker 7>guys are right in it and I've,</v>

1256
00:36:17.531 --> 00:36:18.830
<v Speaker 7>I've obviously been a part of it.</v>

1257
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:19.970
<v Speaker 7>I think what,</v>

1258
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:25.010
<v Speaker 7>what has happened there is Joe is one of the best examples I've ever seen.</v>

1259
00:36:25.011 --> 00:36:26.990
<v Speaker 7>If somebody's living his authentic self,</v>

1260
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.590
<v Speaker 7>I have in all of my travels and journeys everywhere.</v>

1261
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:35.830
<v Speaker 7>Have I ever met a person who I could count on to be 100% Joe fucking Robin,</v>

1262
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.630
<v Speaker 7>you know himself always at,</v>

1263
00:36:38.631 --> 00:36:38.901
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1264
00:36:38.901 --> 00:36:40.130
<v Speaker 7>at any point in time.</v>

1265
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.590
<v Speaker 7>And so I think even without a plan,</v>

1266
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.120
<v Speaker 7>his authentic self,</v>

1267
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:45.470
<v Speaker 7>what he was bringing,</v>

1268
00:36:45.471 --> 00:36:49.580
<v Speaker 7>what's inside his heart and his spirit was going to play out on this stage</v>

1269
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.241
<v Speaker 7>regardless.</v>

1270
00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.080
<v Speaker 7>He couldn't help it,</v>

1271
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:51.560
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1272
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.260
<v Speaker 7>he couldn't strategize or plan what was going to be,</v>

1273
00:36:54.261 --> 00:36:59.000
<v Speaker 7>he could just be himself and do the podcast and then here you go.</v>

1274
00:36:59.001 --> 00:36:59.511
<v Speaker 7>Here it is,</v>

1275
00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:00.620
<v Speaker 7>here's the manifestation.</v>

1276
00:37:00.621 --> 00:37:03.580
<v Speaker 7>And that in itself was in lieu of a plan.</v>

1277
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:04.603
<v Speaker 7>I mean I she,</v>

1278
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.150
<v Speaker 7>I could tell the sort of embarrassed as you Joe for me to ask you this stuff,</v>

1279
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.650
<v Speaker 7>but bear with me because it certainly seems I'm from the outside coming here.</v>

1280
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.980
<v Speaker 7>It certainly seems like in a way you or your teacher as this environment here</v>

1281
00:37:18.501 --> 00:37:21.070
<v Speaker 7>hedge definitely has to do with maleness,</v>

1282
00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.180
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1283
00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.100
<v Speaker 7>Short seems to me like asking the question,</v>

1284
00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.073
<v Speaker 7>he was on your,</v>

1285
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.961
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1286
00:37:26.961 --> 00:37:27.560
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

1287
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.720
<v Speaker 7>you're joking about that but you are,</v>

1288
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.243
<v Speaker 7>you need it.</v>

1289
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.720
<v Speaker 7>A bunch of weak bitches up there.</v>

1290
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.671
<v Speaker 7>Well there it is.</v>

1291
00:37:33.671 --> 00:37:36.620
<v Speaker 7>It's an uptime like chopper would say.</v>

1292
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.310
<v Speaker 7>So you might not have known that when,</v>

1293
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.080
<v Speaker 7>when you and Brian started this,</v>

1294
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.200
<v Speaker 7>but I think it was kind of oozing out of your pores,</v>

1295
00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:48.710
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1296
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 7>it could be why,</v>

1297
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.930
<v Speaker 7>let me ask you this,</v>

1298
00:37:50.931 --> 00:37:51.111
<v Speaker 7>let me,</v>

1299
00:37:51.111 --> 00:37:52.070
<v Speaker 7>let's put her in a different way.</v>

1300
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.440
<v Speaker 7>What characteristics do you look for in guests that you invite onto the show?</v>

1301
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:58.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1302
00:37:58.101 --> 00:37:59.090
<v Speaker 1>they're so varied.</v>

1303
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1304
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.690
<v Speaker 1>fun either Joey Diaz type dudes are just funny.</v>

1305
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1306
00:38:03.051 --> 00:38:03.261
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1307
00:38:03.261 --> 00:38:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I've friends that are just funny,</v>

1308
00:38:04.851 --> 00:38:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I just want them to be funny.</v>

1309
00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:06.231
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1310
00:38:06.231 --> 00:38:07.730
<v Speaker 1>we have just laughs.</v>

1311
00:38:07.731 --> 00:38:10.130
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other people who were very philosophical,</v>

1312
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.320
<v Speaker 1>these people that I don't necessarily even agree with,</v>

1313
00:38:12.321 --> 00:38:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but they have a very well thought out opinion and I like to explore other</v>

1314
00:38:16.101 --> 00:38:16.790
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

1315
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.140
<v Speaker 1>What I think happened is,</v>

1316
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1317
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.800
<v Speaker 1>because of what I do,</v>

1318
00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:23.810
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a professional comedian,</v>

1319
00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking at things,</v>

1320
00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:26.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's also that,</v>

1321
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.520
<v Speaker 1>that's who I was anyway.</v>

1322
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:29.241
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

1323
00:38:29.241 --> 00:38:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I found a good job for trying to analyze when I was a young boy.</v>

1324
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 1>My parents split up when I was five years old and,</v>

1325
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1326
00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:38.660
<v Speaker 1>it was a really bad breakup.</v>

1327
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of domestic violence and if I had to pinpoint a moment that like that</v>

1328
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 1>part of my life made me go,</v>

1329
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:48.454
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1330
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that I just been shit out into this world that no one knows how</v>

1331
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 1>the fuck anything works and everybody's just bumping into walls.</v>

1332
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And as a five year old I remember looking around cause I just,</v>

1333
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I just started going to Catholic school,</v>

1334
00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:04.270
<v Speaker 1>which I realized was utter Horse Shit.</v>

1335
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like oh great is not really there.</v>

1336
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And then my,</v>

1337
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.590
<v Speaker 1>my family's not real.</v>

1338
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Like religion is not real.</v>

1339
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:10.421
<v Speaker 1>So being like five,</v>

1340
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:11.254
<v Speaker 1>six years old,</v>

1341
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it made me just start thinking about things constantly.</v>

1342
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Like my brain is never rest.</v>

1343
00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that I can just chill out.</v>

1344
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Even when I'm watching something,</v>

1345
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:22.810
<v Speaker 1>like I'll have two things going on in the background.</v>

1346
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll,</v>

1347
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll start playing games with myself in the back of my mind it's like it's,</v>

1348
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing like I have,</v>

1349
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:32.980
<v Speaker 1>there's too many things going on in my head at all the time.</v>

1350
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:34.270
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>

1351
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:39.271
<v Speaker 1>like the best way to exercise that is like to find something like a podcast</v>

1352
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:44.380
<v Speaker 1>where you can have a conversation with people for three hours and just sit down</v>

1353
00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:48.010
<v Speaker 1>and shoot the shit about things and then explore subjects and no one looks at</v>

1354
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:48.790
<v Speaker 1>their phone,</v>

1355
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:49.271
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>

1356
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:49.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 1>no one takes any emails.</v>

1358
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a rare thing in this society today.</v>

1359
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And to be able to do that and to have that sort of a,</v>

1360
00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.620
<v Speaker 1>an environment,</v>

1361
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:00.521
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1362
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:01.354
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect.</v>

1363
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's it,</v>

1364
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 1>it's being a student as well as being a teacher in a way.</v>

1365
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:05.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1366
00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:05.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1367
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:06.640
<v Speaker 1>you're learning,</v>

1368
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 1>being constantly fascinated and I think if you're paying attention,</v>

1369
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:10.960
<v Speaker 1>how can you not be constantly fascinating?</v>

1370
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 1>The world is just,</v>

1371
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.320
<v Speaker 1>every day there's a river of slippery salmon of knowledge and it's,</v>

1372
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:18.790
<v Speaker 1>you can't even hold onto it all.</v>

1373
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:19.451
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much.</v>

1374
00:40:19.451 --> 00:40:20.270
<v Speaker 1>It's common,</v>

1375
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:22.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just too much going on right now.</v>

1376
00:40:22.031 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And you look at like the scientific,</v>

1377
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.940
<v Speaker 1>just just on the side of just a astronomy,</v>

1378
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.210
<v Speaker 1>just the new discoveries that they're showing every day where they just found a</v>

1379
00:40:31.211 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 1>new planets floating in the middle of nowhere with no galaxy.</v>

1380
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just floating around.</v>

1381
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.101
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1382
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:36.431
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1383
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 1>this planet doesn't even to have a solar system.</v>

1384
00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking flying through the universe.</v>

1385
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:44.470
<v Speaker 1>There's all kinds of stuff that could fill your day every day with information</v>

1386
00:40:44.471 --> 00:40:47.320
<v Speaker 1>and so more than a teacher.</v>

1387
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:49.180
<v Speaker 1>What I'm as is like a portal.</v>

1388
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm a portal like,</v>

1389
00:40:50.561 --> 00:40:51.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1390
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm out there looking for it,</v>

1391
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:53.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's not me.</v>

1392
00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:54.640
<v Speaker 1>It's me going,</v>

1393
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:54.911
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1394
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:55.131
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1395
00:40:55.131 --> 00:40:56.320
<v Speaker 1>did you see that whole it's shit.</v>

1396
00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody else goes,</v>

1397
00:40:57.191 --> 00:40:57.701
<v Speaker 1>do you see that?</v>

1398
00:40:57.701 --> 00:40:57.971
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1399
00:40:57.971 --> 00:40:58.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1400
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1401
00:40:59.021 --> 00:40:59.890
<v Speaker 1>it's theirs.</v>

1402
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a portal thing.</v>

1403
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1404
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.420
<v Speaker 1>and having a voice like having a podcast,</v>

1405
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:09.220
<v Speaker 1>it allows people to all like sink in and your fascination with what you</v>

1406
00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 1>described is key because that enthusiasm that you bring to this is really</v>

1407
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:13.360
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1408
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people who are no longer enthusiastic about anything in the</v>

1409
00:41:16.661 --> 00:41:16.991
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1410
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:20.080
<v Speaker 1>does no longer hold wonder and awe and fascination.</v>

1411
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.980
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible?</v>

1412
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Where are their socks?</v>

1413
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.103
<v Speaker 1>One sock on,</v>

1414
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.430
<v Speaker 1>they just get numb.</v>

1415
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:27.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1416
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:28.840
<v Speaker 1>you get numb by the world.</v>

1417
00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:30.370
<v Speaker 1>You could look at the world as this dark,</v>

1418
00:41:30.371 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>great place and it kind of beats on him and he just him down until</v>

1419
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 6>they can't see that anymore.</v>

1420
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:36.380
<v Speaker 6>And then you know,</v>

1421
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 6>seeing that in someone that they,</v>

1422
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.200
<v Speaker 6>that they look up to like,</v>

1423
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:39.770
<v Speaker 6>whoa,</v>

1424
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.300
<v Speaker 6>Joe is really fascinated by this.</v>

1425
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I think you can kind of inspire that back in there and you keep that going</v>

1426
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.760
<v Speaker 6>just from your natural self.</v>

1427
00:41:46.761 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 6>But you also work,</v>

1428
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.171
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1429
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 6>you work at it too.</v>

1430
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 6>If your meditation,</v>

1431
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 6>your flotation,</v>

1432
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 6>different things to kind of peel off the weights that can kind of hold you down</v>

1433
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:56.080
<v Speaker 6>and keep those perceptions there.</v>

1434
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:57.620
<v Speaker 6>Keep that fascination alive.</v>

1435
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:58.970
<v Speaker 6>Now you never win.</v>

1436
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.073
<v Speaker 6>You never win.</v>

1437
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 6>It's a swim.</v>

1438
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:01.911
<v Speaker 6>It's not a,</v>

1439
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:02.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1440
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.183
<v Speaker 6>it's not a climb.</v>

1441
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 6>You don't get to the top of the mountain and plant the flag.</v>

1442
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.030
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1443
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 6>you keep your head above water and you keep moving bitch.</v>

1444
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.201
<v Speaker 6>And you have to,</v>

1445
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:09.981
<v Speaker 6>because if you stop,</v>

1446
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna drown.</v>

1447
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 6>And that's just a fact.</v>

1448
00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:12.421
<v Speaker 6>No matter who you are.</v>

1449
00:42:12.421 --> 00:42:13.340
<v Speaker 6>And no matter what you do,</v>

1450
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.470
<v Speaker 6>if you stop work,</v>

1451
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.201
<v Speaker 1>not everything,</v>

1452
00:42:15.201 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 1>if you stop being aware that you stopped being like present,</v>

1453
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 1>it'll all go away and you'll be a shithead.</v>

1454
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:22.064
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

1455
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1456
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I think we all,</v>

1457
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:26.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1458
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 1>we all battle with,</v>

1459
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:27.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1460
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1461
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 1>finding our optimum self.</v>

1462
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:30.711
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1463
00:42:30.711 --> 00:42:30.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1464
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>

1465
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1466
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 1>having things like the podcast,</v>

1467
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:37.040
<v Speaker 1>having things like stand up comedy heavy things like martial arts,</v>

1468
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:42.220
<v Speaker 1>they've all been these avenues where I can figure out how to channel my energy</v>

1469
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 1>to be my optimum self.</v>

1470
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.291
<v Speaker 1>If there's a,</v>

1471
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1472
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.440
<v Speaker 1>a quote that I read when I was a young boy,</v>

1473
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:49.670
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing taekwondo,</v>

1474
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 1>cause they had like a little pamphlet they gave out the school.</v>

1475
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I got really lucky and I went to this,</v>

1476
00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:54.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1477
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Jay Kim Taekwondo Institute in Boston,</v>

1478
00:42:56.481 --> 00:42:59.990
<v Speaker 1>which is like one of the best taekwondo schools nationwide ever.</v>

1479
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a really amazing school cause this one guy who was,</v>

1480
00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:04.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1481
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1482
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.690
<v Speaker 1>the main instructor,</v>

1483
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 1>he was this brilliant guy,</v>

1484
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:08.511
<v Speaker 1>Jay Hahn,</v>

1485
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Kim.</v>

1486
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1487
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.300
<v Speaker 1>that's where I got my black belt from.</v>

1488
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:11.991
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

1489
00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1490
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.930
<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>

1491
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:18.830
<v Speaker 1>he was a brilliant guy at several degrees outside of being a martial arts</v>

1492
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:19.131
<v Speaker 1>instructor.</v>

1493
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 1>He went to Harvard and graduated from Harvard Business School was like super</v>

1494
00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:22.874
<v Speaker 1>smart dude,</v>

1495
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 1>incredible hard worker,</v>

1496
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 1>but he broke down martial arts in this,</v>

1497
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 1>this pamphlet that they would hand out.</v>

1498
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget reading it.</v>

1499
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It said that martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential.</v>

1500
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.220
<v Speaker 1>And that stuck in my head when I was like 14 or 15 whenever I was.</v>

1501
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And I've carried that with me my whole life,</v>

1502
00:43:42.741 --> 00:43:43.574
<v Speaker 1>that quote,</v>

1503
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.780
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it is.</v>

1504
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.460
<v Speaker 1>It's something you can plug yourself into to find out what you're capable of and</v>

1505
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>to find out how to optimally be yourself</v>

1506
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:57.150
<v Speaker 6>and to do battle with your own resistance on a microcosmic level,</v>

1507
00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:57.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1508
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.440
<v Speaker 6>and this small,</v>

1509
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.710
<v Speaker 6>you're going to have so many things weighing on you that the day before a match,</v>

1510
00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:05.880
<v Speaker 6>all these different voices and doubts and superstitions and fears and things</v>

1511
00:44:05.881 --> 00:44:08.580
<v Speaker 6>that you can battle and try to overcome so that when,</v>

1512
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.230
<v Speaker 6>when it really matters in life,</v>

1513
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:12.120
<v Speaker 6>you get these bigger challenges ahead.</v>

1514
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.350
<v Speaker 6>You got practice,</v>

1515
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:13.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1516
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:14.890
<v Speaker 6>you know how to defeat it.</v>

1517
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.180
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

1518
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:15.331
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1519
00:44:15.331 --> 00:44:18.840
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that old photo and I slayed him a hundred times.</v>

1520
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:20.990
<v Speaker 3>What's great about something like that,</v>

1521
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 3>I think like martial arts is,</v>

1522
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1523
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 3>it's a structure.</v>

1524
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 3>It's an entire culture that has a rules,</v>

1525
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 3>rituals,</v>

1526
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.243
<v Speaker 3>orders,</v>

1527
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:36.410
<v Speaker 3>and a young man or a boy comes into that with just this amorphous energy</v>

1528
00:44:37.381 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 3>exploding out of is a year,</v>

1529
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 3>his eyeballs and everything and suddenly he's given a structure.</v>

1530
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 3>This is how you learn.</v>

1531
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.540
<v Speaker 3>You start here,</v>

1532
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 3>learn to do this one move,</v>

1533
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 3>and then when,</v>

1534
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.750
<v Speaker 3>when you've learned that I'll teach you the next move and it kind of channels</v>

1535
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:52.321
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1536
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 3>And I think we don't get that in society these days.</v>

1537
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Certainly young men don't get that.</v>

1538
00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1539
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.431
<v Speaker 3>you go to school,</v>

1540
00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 3>it's basically a kind of a feminized environment,</v>

1541
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1542
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Other than the football team or whatever that is,</v>

1543
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:06.090
<v Speaker 3>which is again,</v>

1544
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 3>a structure and that's again,</v>

1545
00:45:09.481 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 3>that's why people join the army.</v>

1546
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I think because they're young guys because they're desperate for some kind of a,</v>

1547
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 3>some kind of a way to channel that into something that means something that kind</v>

1548
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1549
00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:20.723
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1550
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Speaker 3>provide significance to something.</v>

1551
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think like it or not.</v>

1552
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And most people,</v>

1553
00:45:26.631 --> 00:45:27.464
<v Speaker 1>I would say not,</v>

1554
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.090
<v Speaker 1>we have caveman DNA.</v>

1555
00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:29.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1556
00:45:29.601 --> 00:45:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it's just in our system period.</v>

1557
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1558
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.030
<v Speaker 1>You either accept that and manage it or you deny it and go fucking crazy and</v>

1559
00:45:37.041 --> 00:45:40.340
<v Speaker 1>traffic and wonder why you're screaming and sticking your finger at somebody</v>

1560
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.110
<v Speaker 1>because their car got in front of your car.</v>

1561
00:45:42.111 --> 00:45:42.621
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

1562
00:45:42.621 --> 00:45:46.580
<v Speaker 1>you find yourself loft lost in the wave of rage.</v>

1563
00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:47.960
<v Speaker 1>That's possible too.</v>

1564
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.913
<v Speaker 1>I've seen ice,</v>

1565
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I saw this woman screaming at some woman or some sort of a traffic thing,</v>

1566
00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:54.560
<v Speaker 1>just going,</v>

1567
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget her face going to fuck it.</v>

1568
00:45:58.421 --> 00:45:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1569
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:59.743
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno what,</v>

1570
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

1571
00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1572
00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:06.820
<v Speaker 1>we've all see that usually can blind when you're just zero and you see that</v>

1573
00:46:07.101 --> 00:46:07.970
<v Speaker 1>blind rage.</v>

1574
00:46:07.971 --> 00:46:08.804
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1575
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 3>here's the other side of that,</v>

1576
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:10.990
<v Speaker 3>at least what I was,</v>

1577
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I was just saying about,</v>

1578
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:12.893
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1579
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.580
<v Speaker 3>a structured thing like learning martial arts is something that an individual</v>

1580
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:18.570
<v Speaker 3>can join.</v>

1581
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:23.130
<v Speaker 3>And there are others who are also students and there's a teacher who's teaching</v>

1582
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:24.180
<v Speaker 3>them and telling them what to do.</v>

1583
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:29.540
<v Speaker 3>But the other side of that is art is trying to produce whatever it is you're</v>

1584
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:31.800
<v Speaker 3>trying to produce.</v>

1585
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.640
<v Speaker 3>A movie,</v>

1586
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 3>a painting,</v>

1587
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.850
<v Speaker 3>a book or something like that.</v>

1588
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.410
<v Speaker 3>This is where,</v>

1589
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 3>at least in my opinion,</v>

1590
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.300
<v Speaker 3>you go as an individual and where there are no rules and where or there are</v>

1591
00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:45.661
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>

1592
00:46:45.661 --> 00:46:46.960
<v Speaker 3>but you have to discover them,</v>

1593
00:46:46.961 --> 00:46:47.940
<v Speaker 3>them yourself.</v>

1594
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:52.500
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what we're talking about before about entering into another</v>

1595
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:55.740
<v Speaker 3>dimension of reality or tapping into another dimension of reality,</v>

1596
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:56.843
<v Speaker 3>which is not,</v>

1597
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.970
<v Speaker 3>which is the dimension of potentiality.</v>

1598
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like this podcast existed before you and Brian put it together.</v>

1599
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.360
<v Speaker 3>It just existed on another level and potentiality and on it.</v>

1600
00:47:09.361 --> 00:47:12.630
<v Speaker 3>And the stuff that you guys do that also existed and,</v>

1601
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.990
<v Speaker 3>or a book that I might write or a movie that somebody might do.</v>

1602
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that is a kind of a,</v>

1603
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:22.590
<v Speaker 3>without trying to sound too phony baloney here,</v>

1604
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a warrior pursuit.</v>

1605
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.020
<v Speaker 3>It's something that taps into that wolf energy or that pure testosterone energy</v>

1606
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:33.041
<v Speaker 3>only.</v>

1607
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:38.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not channeled in a path that already exists.</v>

1608
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:38.891
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1609
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:41.290
<v Speaker 3>the artist or the comedian or whatever,</v>

1610
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:46.770
<v Speaker 3>discover that path one footstep at a time and you sort of put your foot out and</v>

1611
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 3>you go wrong.</v>

1612
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 3>You go into a puddle or you step on a pungy stakers and then you go,</v>

1613
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.541
<v Speaker 3>well shit,</v>

1614
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:53.710
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute over here.</v>

1615
00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:55.860
<v Speaker 3>This is solid ground and you,</v>

1616
00:47:55.861 --> 00:47:56.694
<v Speaker 3>you know this guy,</v>

1617
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 3>this got a laugh.</v>

1618
00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.460
<v Speaker 3>This made people I killed when I did this.</v>

1619
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.293
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1620
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 3>And so you are kind of in the dark,</v>

1621
00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 3>like somebody's moving through the dark,</v>

1622
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 3>trusting your instincts,</v>

1623
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 3>trusting whatever little star light you can see.</v>

1624
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 3>And when you finally get to the,</v>

1625
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.360
<v Speaker 3>to the end of that far,</v>

1626
00:48:14.361 --> 00:48:15.110
<v Speaker 3>so you turn around,</v>

1627
00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.790
<v Speaker 3>you look back at the path you took for a writer that's a book.</v>

1628
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.170
<v Speaker 3>And you look down and you say,</v>

1629
00:48:20.171 --> 00:48:21.460
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck did that come from?</v>

1630
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:22.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1631
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:23.103
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1632
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 3>and you realize that that was you all along,</v>

1633
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:32.710
<v Speaker 3>but you had no idea when you started to discover reading that Jackson Brown says</v>

1634
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 3>that he writes a song to figure out what he thinks about something.</v>

1635
00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:37.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1636
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:40.760
<v Speaker 4>but he had sex with Linda Ronstadt right back in the day.</v>

1637
00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:41.930
<v Speaker 4>He was a stud.</v>

1638
00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:42.501
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>

1639
00:48:42.501 --> 00:48:42.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1640
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.690
<v Speaker 4>only at John Merrill.</v>

1641
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.391
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with it?</v>

1642
00:48:44.391 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 4>That's very studly thing to do very stuff.</v>

1643
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.240
<v Speaker 4>Find out what you want to do is have regular dude singing those beautiful songs</v>

1644
00:48:50.241 --> 00:48:51.320
<v Speaker 4>up there on that stage.</v>

1645
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.330
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

1646
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:54.440
<v Speaker 4>that's the way by magic.</v>

1647
00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:55.883
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1648
00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1649
00:48:58.701 --> 00:48:59.240
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1650
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.690
<v Speaker 4>I think what you're saying is also like what Michelangelo said about creating</v>

1651
00:49:02.691 --> 00:49:05.600
<v Speaker 4>sculpture is that he removes the,</v>

1652
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:07.520
<v Speaker 4>he finds the sculpture in the thing.</v>

1653
00:49:07.521 --> 00:49:08.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not like he makes it,</v>

1654
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.120
<v Speaker 4>he removes all the stuff that's hiding the sculpture.</v>

1655
00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.100
<v Speaker 4>That's how he looked at it.</v>

1656
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:13.521
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1657
00:49:13.521 --> 00:49:17.270
<v Speaker 4>I think so many people that I get questions that they don't know what to do,</v>

1658
00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:17.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1659
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:18.890
<v Speaker 4>they're just trying to figure it out.</v>

1660
00:49:18.891 --> 00:49:20.600
<v Speaker 4>And then I always give him the same advice.</v>

1661
00:49:20.601 --> 00:49:21.240
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>

1662
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:21.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1663
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.990
<v Speaker 4>practice being excellent at something you love.</v>

1664
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:25.070
<v Speaker 4>It could be trivial,</v>

1665
00:49:25.071 --> 00:49:26.210
<v Speaker 4>it could be darts.</v>

1666
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:26.931
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

1667
00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:27.860
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

1668
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.260
<v Speaker 4>just be excellent at it puts yourself into,</v>

1669
00:49:30.261 --> 00:49:31.190
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

1670
00:49:31.191 --> 00:49:33.890
<v Speaker 4>On time you'll discover you'll discover something about yourself,</v>

1671
00:49:33.891 --> 00:49:34.491
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

1672
00:49:34.491 --> 00:49:34.671
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1673
00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:35.504
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people were,</v>

1674
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1675
00:49:35.811 --> 00:49:38.420
<v Speaker 4>we'll look to me to see if they can get a job.</v>

1676
00:49:38.421 --> 00:49:39.800
<v Speaker 4>And my question is always the same.</v>

1677
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.450
<v Speaker 4>What are you excellent at?</v>

1678
00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Because if they can show me two random things that they are incredible at,</v>

1679
00:49:44.751 --> 00:49:45.584
<v Speaker 4>they're excellent at,</v>

1680
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:49.250
<v Speaker 4>I know that they've learned to apply their authentic self because you can't</v>

1681
00:49:49.251 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 4>truly be excellent at anything without tapping into that or</v>

1682
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.920
<v Speaker 3>did that adolescent just what do you love?</v>

1683
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:56.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1684
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:57.810
<v Speaker 4>What makes you happy?</v>

1685
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:58.893
<v Speaker 4>What's Fund?</v>

1686
00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.101
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1687
00:49:59.101 --> 00:50:00.960
<v Speaker 4>that's the Great William Moulton Musashi quote.</v>

1688
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.730
<v Speaker 4>Once you understand the way broadly,</v>

1689
00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:03.840
<v Speaker 4>you can see it in all things.</v>

1690
00:50:03.841 --> 00:50:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1691
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.620
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1692
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.210
<v Speaker 4>that idea that there's something that you tap into and it manifests itself in a</v>

1693
00:50:09.211 --> 00:50:11.550
<v Speaker 4>number of different ways and athletics and artistic,</v>

1694
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:12.990
<v Speaker 4>but whatever it is,</v>

1695
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.990
<v Speaker 4>but what you're doing is you're tapping into the same thing.</v>

1696
00:50:15.991 --> 00:50:17.010
<v Speaker 4>And that is excellent.</v>

1697
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.230
<v Speaker 4>You're tapping into the real thing the way,</v>

1698
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 4>and then when you're on the path,</v>

1699
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.353
<v Speaker 4>it's going to give you,</v>

1700
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1701
00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.890
<v Speaker 4>the fruits of your destiny,</v>

1702
00:50:22.891 --> 00:50:23.491
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

1703
00:50:23.491 --> 00:50:24.121
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

1704
00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:27.030
<v Speaker 4>that's that channel that's going to bring you to the ultimate higher.</v>

1705
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 4>You already have practice being excellent,</v>

1706
00:50:29.181 --> 00:50:29.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1707
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 4>you know how to do the work.</v>

1708
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 4>And that's another key thing that I love about,</v>

1709
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:34.550
<v Speaker 4>that you always go back to is just,</v>

1710
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1711
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:35.781
<v Speaker 4>how to do the work.</v>

1712
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 4>You knew how to take the initial steps that one foot in front of the other to</v>

1713
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 4>get there and to see progress and to apply yourself in that way.</v>

1714
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:43.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1715
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely a believer in just doing the mundane thing,</v>

1716
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:48.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1717
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 3>walk into the room,</v>

1718
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.900
<v Speaker 3>sit down at the keyboard or walk into the Dojo,</v>

1719
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.420
<v Speaker 3>start to do whatever the first thing is.</v>

1720
00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1721
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>

1722
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1723
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:02.503
<v Speaker 3>But I would,</v>

1724
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:02.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1725
00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:05.210
<v Speaker 3>just something is occurring to me as we're talking here.</v>

1726
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.283
<v Speaker 3>I might be,</v>

1727
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I haven't even thought about this in a million years,</v>

1728
00:51:08.091 --> 00:51:09.740
<v Speaker 3>but you were talking about Aubrey,</v>

1729
00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:13.660
<v Speaker 3>about people that don't seem to care or don't have,</v>

1730
00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:14.523
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1731
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:14.931
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1732
00:51:14.931 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1733
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.050
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasm for Sunday and all in one.</v>

1734
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1735
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:18.680
<v Speaker 3>I can remember that.</v>

1736
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:19.461
<v Speaker 3>I used to be,</v>

1737
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:20.001
<v Speaker 3>for years,</v>

1738
00:51:20.001 --> 00:51:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I struggled like that where I was bored with things.</v>

1739
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 3>I was bored with myself.</v>

1740
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 3>I was beating my brains out saying,</v>

1741
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 3>why don't I love something?</v>

1742
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:29.931
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1743
00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:30.171
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

1744
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:31.004
<v Speaker 3>what is missing?</v>

1745
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.790
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1746
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:32.511
<v Speaker 3>my sort of,</v>

1747
00:51:32.511 --> 00:51:37.511
<v Speaker 3>my conclusion was that I really did have tremendous ambition and tremendous</v>

1748
00:51:40.371 --> 00:51:41.270
<v Speaker 3>aspiration,</v>

1749
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 3>but I had buried it under layers of fear.</v>

1750
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:45.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1751
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:46.111
<v Speaker 3>as if,</v>

1752
00:51:46.111 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 3>if I would ever admit to myself that I wanted to be excellent at something,</v>

1753
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 3>that that would be more than I could,</v>

1754
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I could take failure would be more than I could take.</v>

1755
00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:00.020
<v Speaker 3>And so when I finally sort of admitted to myself,</v>

1756
00:52:00.021 --> 00:52:01.420
<v Speaker 3>and actually it's in the authentic swing,</v>

1757
00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:01.761
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1758
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:02.594
<v Speaker 3>or maybe some,</v>

1759
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 3>but when I admitted to myself that I did have ambition,</v>

1760
00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I did want to do something,</v>

1761
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.700
<v Speaker 3>suddenly everything changed.</v>

1762
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.280
<v Speaker 3>And then enthusiasm did come.</v>

1763
00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:14.510
<v Speaker 3>But it was fear.</v>

1764
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.340
<v Speaker 3>So I th I think when we,</v>

1765
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 3>when we're running into people that are not,</v>

1766
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 3>don't have enthusiasm,</v>

1767
00:52:20.901 --> 00:52:21.860
<v Speaker 3>don't have that fire,</v>

1768
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it's not there.</v>

1769
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's buried under fear.</v>

1770
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.901
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1771
00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:27.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1772
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why great teachers,</v>

1773
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:34.690
<v Speaker 3>coaches will put a young person in a position where they can,</v>

1774
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.450
<v Speaker 3>they can exceed their expectations or their belief about themselves where they</v>

1775
00:52:38.451 --> 00:52:41.720
<v Speaker 3>thought they couldn't do it and then the guy kicks him in the ass enough time,</v>

1776
00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:42.860
<v Speaker 3>they actually do it and they go,</v>

1777
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:43.341
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1778
00:52:43.341 --> 00:52:44.151
<v Speaker 3>how did that happen?</v>

1779
00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:44.720
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1780
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.720
<v Speaker 3>And then that's the spark that can then burst into flame if it's,</v>

1781
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.200
<v Speaker 3>if it's guided properly.</v>

1782
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:52.550
<v Speaker 3>And I see,</v>

1783
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:53.450
<v Speaker 3>I see that everywhere.</v>

1784
00:52:53.451 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to say,</v>

1785
00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:54.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1786
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:55.760
<v Speaker 3>in this country it's everywhere.</v>

1787
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:56.101
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1788
00:52:56.101 --> 00:53:00.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad that you brought up that it was you at one point and you,</v>

1789
00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.080
<v Speaker 4>you passed it because one of the really important things about your book I think</v>

1790
00:53:04.081 --> 00:53:04.740
<v Speaker 4>is that you,</v>

1791
00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.200
<v Speaker 4>you're really objective assessment,</v>

1792
00:53:07.201 --> 00:53:08.580
<v Speaker 4>assessment of your own life.</v>

1793
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.400
<v Speaker 4>At one point in time when you were like 40 years old,</v>

1794
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:12.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1795
00:53:12.001 --> 00:53:14.400
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about this was a long time ago.</v>

1796
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1797
00:53:14.641 --> 00:53:17.700
<v Speaker 4>This script that wasn't working and you know,</v>

1798
00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:18.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1799
00:53:18.121 --> 00:53:18.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1800
00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:18.781
<v Speaker 4>you were like,</v>

1801
00:53:18.781 --> 00:53:19.800
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

1802
00:53:19.801 --> 00:53:24.660
<v Speaker 4>And then how did you go from that to completely getting it together enough to</v>

1803
00:53:24.661 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 4>write books about</v>

1804
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 1>getting it together?</v>

1805
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 1>How did you get over that fear?</v>

1806
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1807
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I think at that time you'd be the fear that I was just talking about.</v>

1808
00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1809
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.631
<v Speaker 3>Well the same thing.</v>

1810
00:53:35.631 --> 00:53:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Same question.</v>

1811
00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:36.973
<v Speaker 3>How did you,</v>

1812
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:38.120
<v Speaker 3>how did you figure it out?</v>

1813
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:42.920
<v Speaker 3>I think once I realized that I,</v>

1814
00:53:42.921 --> 00:53:45.920
<v Speaker 3>that there was something I wanted that I wanted to be a writer,</v>

1815
00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:50.750
<v Speaker 3>which I had refused to admit to myself cause I was so afraid of failing.</v>

1816
00:53:50.751 --> 00:53:53.150
<v Speaker 3>And then I just sort of said,</v>

1817
00:53:53.151 --> 00:53:53.984
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1818
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1819
00:53:54.201 --> 00:53:54.951
<v Speaker 3>there was a moment,</v>

1820
00:53:54.951 --> 00:53:59.951
<v Speaker 3>it's actually in the war of art where I just sort of realized the way you get</v>

1821
00:54:00.021 --> 00:54:02.120
<v Speaker 3>there is one step at a time.</v>

1822
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:03.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1823
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:04.640
<v Speaker 3>like an alcoholic,</v>

1824
00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:05.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1825
00:54:05.481 --> 00:54:05.781
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1826
00:54:05.781 --> 00:54:08.600
<v Speaker 3>one day at a time and that it was a,</v>

1827
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:09.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1828
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:13.220
<v Speaker 3>a process that could be demystified.</v>

1829
00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.430
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't airy fairy waiting for inspiration.</v>

1830
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.320
<v Speaker 3>It was just sit the fuck down,</v>

1831
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.470
<v Speaker 3>put a piece of paper and a typewriter and start,</v>

1832
00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1833
00:54:22.101 --> 00:54:24.440
<v Speaker 3>and then do that the next day and do it the next day.</v>

1834
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.240
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

1835
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:31.390
<v Speaker 3>and the other aspect for me was I had no choice that anytime I would try to stop</v>

1836
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.210
<v Speaker 3>and try to sell out,</v>

1837
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.940
<v Speaker 3>I was like so depressed that I that.</v>

1838
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:40.190
<v Speaker 3>So I just had no choice to just keep going,</v>

1839
00:54:40.191 --> 00:54:40.551
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

1840
00:54:40.551 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

1841
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.940
<v Speaker 3>But it was before I wrote the war of art I probably been in,</v>

1842
00:54:43.941 --> 00:54:47.420
<v Speaker 3>had been writing for at least 30 years or at least trying to do that.</v>

1843
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:52.750
<v Speaker 3>That book came out in about two months just because it was so clear in my mind</v>

1844
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 3>that that's what I had been fighting all,</v>

1845
00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:57.470
<v Speaker 3>all these years.</v>

1846
00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Did you find that putting it down on paper helped you?</v>

1847
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Very much because it became very clear to me like a law most,</v>

1848
00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:05.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1849
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean for me,</v>

1850
00:55:06.731 --> 00:55:07.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1851
00:55:07.001 --> 00:55:11.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like the way the war of art kind of started for me was that a,</v>

1852
00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:13.150
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure you guys get this too,</v>

1853
00:55:13.151 --> 00:55:17.080
<v Speaker 3>it's like friends will come to you and they see that you're getting it to get,</v>

1854
00:55:17.081 --> 00:55:17.920
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something,</v>

1855
00:55:17.921 --> 00:55:18.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1856
00:55:18.071 --> 00:55:18.640
<v Speaker 3>and they'll say,</v>

1857
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:18.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1858
00:55:18.911 --> 00:55:19.744
<v Speaker 3>I've got a,</v>

1859
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.800
<v Speaker 3>I've got a business in me or a book in me or a movie in me.</v>

1860
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.250
<v Speaker 3>And I found myself sitting up with friends,</v>

1861
00:55:27.251 --> 00:55:28.300
<v Speaker 3>you don't till two in the morning,</v>

1862
00:55:28.301 --> 00:55:30.750
<v Speaker 3>kind of psyching them up saying,</v>

1863
00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:30.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1864
00:55:30.881 --> 00:55:31.571
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>

1865
00:55:31.571 --> 00:55:32.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1866
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.250
<v Speaker 3>and explaining what the negative force was of resistance and how it was all</v>

1867
00:55:36.251 --> 00:55:36.731
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

1868
00:55:36.731 --> 00:55:37.750
<v Speaker 3>It was all in your mind,</v>

1869
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.801
<v Speaker 3>you could overcome it,</v>

1870
00:55:38.801 --> 00:55:38.941
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1871
00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:39.151
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1872
00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:39.341
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1873
00:55:39.341 --> 00:55:39.521
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

1874
00:55:39.521 --> 00:55:41.230
<v Speaker 3>And after doing that about 10 times,</v>

1875
00:55:41.231 --> 00:55:42.850
<v Speaker 3>and of course nobody listens to you.</v>

1876
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Finally I just said I had like a two month break and I just said,</v>

1877
00:55:46.721 --> 00:55:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna write this down on paper.</v>

1878
00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.870
<v Speaker 3>And then when somebody comes to me,</v>

1879
00:55:49.871 --> 00:55:50.231
<v Speaker 3>I'll just say,</v>

1880
00:55:50.231 --> 00:55:50.471
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1881
00:55:50.471 --> 00:55:52.090
<v Speaker 3>read this and you know,</v>

1882
00:55:52.091 --> 00:55:52.690
<v Speaker 3>shut up.</v>

1883
00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:53.440
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1884
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.440
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of how that came out.</v>

1885
00:55:56.441 --> 00:56:01.441
<v Speaker 3>But it was very clear in my mind from experiencing it and talking about it for</v>

1886
00:56:01.751 --> 00:56:02.584
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1887
00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that answers your</v>

1888
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.481
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1889
00:56:04.481 --> 00:56:05.261
<v Speaker 1>I think you're,</v>

1890
00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:08.380
<v Speaker 1>I think you're honest with yourself and anyone who's honest with themselves,</v>

1891
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.810
<v Speaker 1>after enough information comes in,</v>

1892
00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.430
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the conclusion they all draw.</v>

1893
00:56:12.431 --> 00:56:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm kind of fucking myself here.</v>

1894
00:56:13.961 --> 00:56:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sabotaging myself.</v>

1895
00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1896
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.990
<v Speaker 1>why don't I know what I need to do?</v>

1897
00:56:16.991 --> 00:56:18.310
<v Speaker 1>If I had to give myself advice,</v>

1898
00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:19.270
<v Speaker 1>what advice would I give?</v>

1899
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:20.201
<v Speaker 1>Just do it.</v>

1900
00:56:20.201 --> 00:56:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Bitch gets get working,</v>

1901
00:56:21.401 --> 00:56:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1902
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.660
<v Speaker 1>do what you gotta do.</v>

1903
00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I lose the last 10 cows.</v>

1904
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Will you please shut the fuck?</v>

1905
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's not true.</v>

1906
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 1>If you were in a wheelchair from the neck down,</v>

1907
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:30.101
<v Speaker 1>paralyzed,</v>

1908
00:56:30.101 --> 00:56:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

1909
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't lose that and you,</v>

1910
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:32.411
<v Speaker 1>you're okay,</v>

1911
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 1>that's out of your control.</v>

1912
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.900
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what's going on here.</v>

1913
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 1>This is weird.</v>

1914
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Like with this thing is a weird little struggle you've got going on because</v>

1915
00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 1>people out there that are struggling for real.</v>

1916
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think in the absence of that,</v>

1917
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:44.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1918
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:45.580
<v Speaker 1>there's something to be said about these,</v>

1919
00:56:45.581 --> 00:56:46.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1920
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherer cultures and the happiness and the hunter hunter gatherer</v>

1921
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:50.280
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>

1922
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>

1923
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost devoid of insanity.</v>

1924
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Almost a,</v>

1925
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.440
<v Speaker 1>we just almost completely cured of,</v>

1926
00:56:59.441 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1927
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 1>mental health issues.</v>

1928
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

1929
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 1>They have alcoholism if alcohol is introduced into their environments.</v>

1930
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

1931
00:57:07.151 --> 00:57:08.200
<v Speaker 1>when they don't have that,</v>

1932
00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:10.460
<v Speaker 1>like happy people life in the taiga.</v>

1933
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that documentary?</v>

1934
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a Werner Herzog's documentary on these people that live in Siberia and all</v>

1935
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:18.760
<v Speaker 1>these guys do is live off the land.</v>

1936
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.640
<v Speaker 1>All they do is hunt and fish and trap and you know,</v>

1937
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:27.550
<v Speaker 1>they trapping furs and that's how they buy like snowmobiles and hatchets and</v>

1938
00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:28.241
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>

1939
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:28.620
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1940
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the majority of their time is just shooting animals,</v>

1941
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:31.661
<v Speaker 1>eating them,</v>

1942
00:57:31.661 --> 00:57:34.480
<v Speaker 1>fishing and everybody's happy as fuck.</v>

1943
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole village of people that are so happy.</v>

1944
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 1>They're just smiling and laughing.</v>

1945
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:40.900
<v Speaker 1>There's like no disputes.</v>

1946
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's working together to try to get meat.</v>

1947
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1948
00:57:43.451 --> 00:57:44.350
<v Speaker 1>they're showing how to like,</v>

1949
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.881
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1950
00:57:44.881 --> 00:57:49.120
<v Speaker 1>the craftsmanship involved in making these snow shoes and sleds,</v>

1951
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 1>they make their own skis.</v>

1952
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:51.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1953
00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1954
00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:57.241
<v Speaker 1>really interesting because in the absence of that real day to day struggle that</v>

1955
00:57:58.151 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 1>these people have,</v>

1956
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.910
<v Speaker 1>we're almost like,</v>

1957
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.360
<v Speaker 1>we were like waiting for something to come along and kick us in the ass.</v>

1958
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we only react by nature instead of act in some way.</v>

1959
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1960
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1961
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually fascinated by that stuff to joy.</v>

1962
00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:15.540
<v Speaker 3>I've been fascinated by tribal cultures and uh,</v>

1963
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.100
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1964
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.020
<v Speaker 3>there's no going back to that.</v>

1965
00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:19.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1966
00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:20.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1967
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:20.251
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1968
00:58:20.251 --> 00:58:23.640
<v Speaker 3>At some point there was an invention happened in the invention was the</v>

1969
00:58:23.641 --> 00:58:26.790
<v Speaker 3>individual and once that was invented,</v>

1970
00:58:26.791 --> 00:58:31.140
<v Speaker 3>I think the ancient Greeks invented it somewhere around the time of Socrates.</v>

1971
00:58:31.141 --> 00:58:31.974
<v Speaker 3>And before that,</v>

1972
00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:37.460
<v Speaker 3>and at that point we no longer had the tribe.</v>

1973
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:38.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1974
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.830
<v Speaker 3>we no longer had that wonderful,</v>

1975
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1976
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.720
<v Speaker 3>thing enveloping us.</v>

1977
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:43.590
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1978
00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:44.423
<v Speaker 3>but the other,</v>

1979
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:45.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1980
00:58:45.151 --> 00:58:45.721
<v Speaker 3>if you also,</v>

1981
00:58:45.721 --> 00:58:46.340
<v Speaker 3>if you look about,</v>

1982
00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.460
<v Speaker 3>you look at Afghanistan,</v>

1983
00:58:47.461 --> 00:58:47.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1984
00:58:47.641 --> 00:58:51.810
<v Speaker 3>which is a great place for us to study because we see it in the news that we've</v>

1985
00:58:51.811 --> 00:58:52.644
<v Speaker 3>had seen it,</v>

1986
00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:57.650
<v Speaker 3>which is like in Pashtunistan you get kind of pretty much tribal culture the way</v>

1987
00:58:58.231 --> 00:58:58.921
<v Speaker 3>it was way,</v>

1988
00:58:58.921 --> 00:58:59.101
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1989
00:58:59.101 --> 00:58:59.761
<v Speaker 3>way back when.</v>

1990
00:58:59.761 --> 00:59:02.490
<v Speaker 3>And I'm also like when I was talking about reading math of command,</v>

1991
00:59:02.491 --> 00:59:03.324
<v Speaker 3>she's a little while ago.</v>

1992
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.381
<v Speaker 3>The other thing,</v>

1993
00:59:04.381 --> 00:59:09.381
<v Speaker 3>one of the things about tribes is they are unbelievably cruel to whoever if they</v>

1994
00:59:10.261 --> 00:59:14.970
<v Speaker 3>capture anybody else or if there's anyone who violates the tribe,</v>

1995
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1996
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:16.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1997
00:59:16.081 --> 00:59:19.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not such an idyllic world when you get into that side.</v>

1998
00:59:19.501 --> 00:59:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1999
00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.031
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2000
00:59:20.031 --> 00:59:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You mean it's not like avatar</v>

2001
00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:25.710
<v Speaker 6>decide they left out of course.</v>

2002
00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:26.600
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

2003
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:27.860
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like that's a,</v>

2004
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:29.840
<v Speaker 6>it's almost a cheat code to happiness.</v>

2005
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.111
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2006
00:59:30.111 --> 00:59:31.910
<v Speaker 6>that kind of simple life where you're doing,</v>

2007
00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:34.440
<v Speaker 6>you're constantly out there doing this world where it's,</v>

2008
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:38.060
<v Speaker 6>it's just we don't know what the hell to do and we don't have action as this</v>

2009
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:40.010
<v Speaker 6>kind of through line in our life of,</v>

2010
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:40.461
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2011
00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 6>got to go to achieve that next goal,</v>

2012
00:59:42.261 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 6>which is meet that next goal,</v>

2013
00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.301
<v Speaker 6>which is Fitch.</v>

2014
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:44.931
<v Speaker 6>That next goal,</v>

2015
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:45.764
<v Speaker 6>which is shelter.</v>

2016
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 6>It's just this amorphous world.</v>

2017
00:59:47.601 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 6>And we got to figure it out.</v>

2018
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.730
<v Speaker 6>And I think one of the things you said is it was really important is you've got</v>

2019
00:59:52.731 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 6>to just do the work and then,</v>

2020
00:59:54.651 --> 00:59:56.450
<v Speaker 6>but at the start it's always a leap of faith,</v>

2021
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 6>whatever that is.</v>

2022
00:59:57.441 --> 01:00:00.110
<v Speaker 6>Like you don't know exactly how it's gonna turn out,</v>

2023
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:00.741
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

2024
01:00:00.741 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 6>you take that first,</v>

2025
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.050
<v Speaker 6>that first step,</v>

2026
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2027
01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:07.670
<v Speaker 6>and then just trust that if you stay and you show up and you do that every time,</v>

2028
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2029
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 6>then some momentum going to start going.</v>

2030
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.120
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2031
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2032
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 3>it's this kind of a cliche,</v>

2033
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:14.810
<v Speaker 3>it's that old Maslow pyramid,</v>

2034
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:15.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:16.114
<v Speaker 3>of where the,</v>

2036
01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.860
<v Speaker 3>the basic needs of hunger or you know,</v>

2037
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:19.721
<v Speaker 3>clothing got data dot.</v>

2038
01:00:19.721 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 3>And then when you get to the top,</v>

2039
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:21.710
<v Speaker 3>which is where we are,</v>

2040
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.360
<v Speaker 3>the needs become,</v>

2041
01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:23.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2042
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:25.100
<v Speaker 3>cause we have grocery stores,</v>

2043
01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:25.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2044
01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:26.930
<v Speaker 3>there's no bombs going off in the street.</v>

2045
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.520
<v Speaker 3>So now it becomes self actualization or asking the question,</v>

2046
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:31.701
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2047
01:00:31.701 --> 01:00:32.301
<v Speaker 3>who am I?</v>

2048
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Why am I here?</v>

2049
01:00:33.141 --> 01:00:33.510
<v Speaker 3>That at,</v>

2050
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:34.580
<v Speaker 3>at all those tough questions,</v>

2051
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:35.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2052
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:38.300
<v Speaker 3>That the tribesmen don't have to ask because they're too busy fighting off</v>

2053
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:38.591
<v Speaker 3>grizzly.</v>

2054
01:00:38.591 --> 01:00:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2055
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:44.240
<v Speaker 3>And to me this is where something like martial arts or any kind of a discipline</v>

2056
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:45.570
<v Speaker 3>or art period,</v>

2057
01:00:45.571 --> 01:00:46.670
<v Speaker 3>the production of art,</v>

2058
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:47.860
<v Speaker 3>this podcast,</v>

2059
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 3>your comedy,</v>

2060
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:50.270
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

2061
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.523
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2062
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.130
<v Speaker 3>and I don't,</v>

2063
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.840
<v Speaker 3>I can't really put my finger on why,</v>

2064
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's an,</v>

2065
01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:00.970
<v Speaker 3>it's an answer to this thing of being alone,</v>

2066
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.690
<v Speaker 3>being an individual,</v>

2067
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:07.610
<v Speaker 3>being unfettered from the tribal structure or from any structure where we're</v>

2068
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:09.170
<v Speaker 3>kind of floating in space.</v>

2069
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.801
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2070
01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:12.190
<v Speaker 3>like a George Clooney and w,</v>

2071
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:12.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2072
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:14.360
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out who,</v>

2073
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2074
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:15.771
<v Speaker 3>who am I,</v>

2075
01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:16.910
<v Speaker 3>why am I here?</v>

2076
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 3>What do I want?</v>

2077
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Tough,</v>

2078
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.540
<v Speaker 3>tough questions,</v>

2079
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2080
01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2081
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>very tough questions.</v>

2082
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting questions.</v>

2083
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that what you said is really important.</v>

2084
01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>That thing of cheat code,</v>

2085
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>that it's almost like a cheat code to life.</v>

2086
01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I think what's going on is that's how we're designed.</v>

2087
01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:37.790
<v Speaker 1>We're designed to live that and that the variables that we encounter on a day to</v>

2088
01:01:37.791 --> 01:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>day basis are so beyond our genetic capabilities.</v>

2089
01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>The idea of keeping track of 7 billion people's lives,</v>

2090
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

2091
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>But that's where we're headed and I feel like in the industrial age from from</v>

2092
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:51.951
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2093
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:52.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2094
01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the creation of the machines to today,</v>

2095
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>we're essentially entering into slowly but surely into a completely new</v>

2096
01:01:58.641 --> 01:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>dimension of reality.</v>

2097
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like what we've created in just the short amount of time that we've had</v>

2098
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>electricity is staggeringly crazy.</v>

2099
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.200
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the Internet,</v>

2100
01:02:09.201 --> 01:02:10.340
<v Speaker 1>the idea of computers,</v>

2101
01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>big screen TVs,</v>

2102
01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>projections,</v>

2103
01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>the things that we can do today,</v>

2104
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>why find a plain,</v>

2105
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>insane,</v>

2106
01:02:16.701 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>insane stuff and it's just begun.</v>

2107
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what we're facing and what we're going to face over the next</v>

2108
01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:24.301
<v Speaker 1>hundred years,</v>

2109
01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:24.731
<v Speaker 1>200 years,</v>

2110
01:02:24.731 --> 01:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>this is essentially going to be like a new dimension,</v>

2111
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of a virtual reality where we exist symbiotically with computers</v>

2112
01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>and the Internet and with each other.</v>

2113
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think that our puny brains,</v>

2114
01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>you know the three or four or five of us in this room,</v>

2115
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>we're not designed for this new world.</v>

2116
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:41.161
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

2117
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:44.510
<v Speaker 1>our brains are going to have to catch up just much like the apes who spoken</v>

2118
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>grunts had to catch up with these clever motherfuckers over figured out how to</v>

2119
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>talk with a slippery Tang and actually say names and you know the,</v>

2120
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all a part of growth.</v>

2121
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It's all per,</v>

2122
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.431
<v Speaker 1>we're not done.</v>

2123
01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>The human race is not,</v>

2124
01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>this is not the finished product.</v>

2125
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.220
<v Speaker 1>This is like one step on a long road.</v>

2126
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Probably an infinite road and our creations are apart of what's enhancing or</v>

2127
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:10.890
<v Speaker 1>changing or altering the world itself.</v>

2128
01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:11.781
<v Speaker 3>Well you were saying,</v>

2129
01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I think you're absolutely right Joe.</v>

2130
01:03:12.921 --> 01:03:14.590
<v Speaker 3>You were saying before that we're cavemen.</v>

2131
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
<v Speaker 3>And it's true because if you think about the history of human beings from the</v>

2132
01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:21.950
<v Speaker 3>time we were homage to today,</v>

2133
01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.750
<v Speaker 3>you do that long line right?</v>

2134
01:03:23.751 --> 01:03:27.380
<v Speaker 3>And He's find that like the law only the last one 10th of an inch is when we</v>

2135
01:03:27.381 --> 01:03:29.060
<v Speaker 3>were civilized and it's like,</v>

2136
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:29.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2137
01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.960
<v Speaker 3>a thousand miles the rest of it when we were tribal people.</v>

2138
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.060
<v Speaker 3>So we come into this world,</v>

2139
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:38.810
<v Speaker 3>I believe with this tribal template in our mind,</v>

2140
01:03:38.811 --> 01:03:39.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2141
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.120
<v Speaker 3>where it's important to us,</v>

2142
01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:43.160
<v Speaker 3>what our friends think of us,</v>

2143
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:44.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2144
01:03:44.031 --> 01:03:47.660
<v Speaker 3>we act to please others like in high school where you know,</v>

2145
01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:49.760
<v Speaker 3>you have to be in the right clique and where this and that.</v>

2146
01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:50.893
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2147
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.250
<v Speaker 3>it's only in this,</v>

2148
01:03:52.251 --> 01:03:57.251
<v Speaker 3>these last few seconds before midnight that we discover that we're individuals</v>

2149
01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:00.530
<v Speaker 3>and we're not wired to be individuals.</v>

2150
01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:01.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's where,</v>

2151
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.990
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

2152
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:05.060
<v Speaker 3>resistance and stuff like that comes in.</v>

2153
01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:09.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what sort of would push us back to being the in in the tribe,</v>

2154
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.310
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

2155
01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:15.310
<v Speaker 3>in the mass mind in that kind of thing as opposed to going forward each morning</v>

2156
01:04:15.801 --> 01:04:20.450
<v Speaker 3>one step at a time and it's in that dark forest finding out,</v>

2157
01:04:20.451 --> 01:04:20.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2158
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:21.703
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2159
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:22.581
<v Speaker 3>where we are,</v>

2160
01:04:22.581 --> 01:04:23.271
<v Speaker 3>what we think,</v>

2161
01:04:23.271 --> 01:04:24.104
<v Speaker 3>what we believe.</v>

2162
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very important point you said about people not being designed to</v>

2163
01:04:27.881 --> 01:04:32.881
<v Speaker 1>be individuals and it's very ironic that the people that live in cities are way</v>

2164
01:04:33.101 --> 01:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>lonely or when there's 20 million people around and the people that live in a</v>

2165
01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:37.720
<v Speaker 1>tribe where there's 20 people around.</v>

2166
01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>That's so ironic and so strange though.</v>

2167
01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>The loss of community,</v>

2168
01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>like I keep saying with my friends like why don't we just buy houses in the same</v>

2169
01:04:45.431 --> 01:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>street?</v>

2170
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:46.991
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we doing?</v>

2171
01:04:46.991 --> 01:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Like why do we live so far from each other?</v>

2172
01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be cool if you were right there and I could just knock on your door?</v>

2173
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Like why don't we figure that out?</v>

2174
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>But we were so used to this idea of cars driving to homes that no one lives next</v>

2175
01:04:58.271 --> 01:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>to their friends anymore.</v>

2176
01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And our sense of community depending upon where you live can get like really</v>

2177
01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:04.901
<v Speaker 1>sketchy.</v>

2178
01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking to my friend Jim Norton who lives in a giant apartment</v>

2179
01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>building in New York City.</v>

2180
01:05:09.491 --> 01:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking huge.</v>

2181
01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>And he doesn't know anybody.</v>

2182
01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>There were all these compartments in this giant cement box and shares with</v>

2183
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.671
<v Speaker 4>all these people.</v>

2184
01:05:18.671 --> 01:05:21.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally if he could walk through a wall,</v>

2185
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.450
<v Speaker 4>he could catch,</v>

2186
01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 4>you could touch someone while they're peeing.</v>

2187
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're right next to his head,</v>

2188
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.910
<v Speaker 4>but yet he doesn't know that guy at all.</v>

2189
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:31.330
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird thing that we've created and I don't think we're designed for it.</v>

2190
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:32.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we're designed for it.</v>

2191
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.960
<v Speaker 4>But I think there's hope and the hope is that we're,</v>

2192
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:35.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2193
01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 4>we're kind of like this meet vehicle with the computer,</v>

2194
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2195
01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 4>Amit vehicle with a computer and then out there somewhere is new source code,</v>

2196
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2197
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:45.610
<v Speaker 4>and just like a new life by Iphone,</v>

2198
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:49.330
<v Speaker 4>we'll just plug in new software and new operating system.</v>

2199
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.100
<v Speaker 4>You know when you plug it back in,</v>

2200
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what's going to help us navigate this pass is we got to plug back</v>

2201
01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 4>into the mother code,</v>

2202
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:57.454
<v Speaker 4>the source code,</v>

2203
01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:01.660
<v Speaker 4>and then download new instructions for this meet vehicle that we're all walking</v>

2204
01:06:01.661 --> 01:06:02.360
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>

2205
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.540
<v Speaker 4>I think you're only way that the only way to do it.</v>

2206
01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:07.870
<v Speaker 4>And so in doing so you'll have all kinds of ancillary benefits,</v>

2207
01:06:07.871 --> 01:06:09.790
<v Speaker 4>not only of how to fit into society,</v>

2208
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:10.541
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2209
01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:11.141
<v Speaker 4>as you said,</v>

2210
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.370
<v Speaker 4>define your authentic swing,</v>

2211
01:06:12.371 --> 01:06:13.390
<v Speaker 4>your authentic self.</v>

2212
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:13.881
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2213
01:06:13.881 --> 01:06:15.490
<v Speaker 4>cause that's there in that code to,</v>

2214
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.830
<v Speaker 4>and you've just got to find the ways to plug back in</v>

2215
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:19.800
<v Speaker 3>the flip side to what you were saying,</v>

2216
01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:20.061
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2217
01:06:20.061 --> 01:06:21.750
<v Speaker 3>is like you were saying that,</v>

2218
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:24.390
<v Speaker 3>isn't it a shame that we're all isolated.</v>

2219
01:06:24.391 --> 01:06:25.580
<v Speaker 3>We can't live with our friends,</v>

2220
01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:26.970
<v Speaker 3>we can't have kind of the tribe.</v>

2221
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:28.860
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2222
01:06:28.861 --> 01:06:31.470
<v Speaker 3>there's a big element of truth in that in our heart.</v>

2223
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:32.430
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>

2224
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:33.690
<v Speaker 3>the flip side of that is,</v>

2225
01:06:33.691 --> 01:06:36.480
<v Speaker 3>and I feel this a lot is I want to be alone.</v>

2226
01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:37.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2227
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.370
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2228
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:42.780
<v Speaker 3>when I'm in a group and I got to do shit that other people want to do or I have</v>

2229
01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:45.720
<v Speaker 3>to conform to what their expectations of me are.</v>

2230
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.531
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

2231
01:06:46.531 --> 01:06:46.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2232
01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:47.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that at all.</v>

2233
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.820
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is,</v>

2234
01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.540
<v Speaker 3>and I'll,</v>

2235
01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll just blow it up if I have to,</v>

2236
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2237
01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:54.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2238
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.640
<v Speaker 3>and the other thing that's really a mystery,</v>

2239
01:06:56.641 --> 01:06:57.840
<v Speaker 3>kind of what you were saying Aubrey,</v>

2240
01:06:57.841 --> 01:07:01.380
<v Speaker 3>is nobody's ever figured out why we had this big brain.</v>

2241
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2242
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.593
<v Speaker 3>We never,</v>

2243
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:07.950
<v Speaker 3>it's not like we incrementally evolved it cause we had to learn to throw a stone</v>

2244
01:07:07.951 --> 01:07:10.800
<v Speaker 3>and then we had to learn to shoot a bow and Arrow and it's like all of a sudden</v>

2245
01:07:10.801 --> 01:07:13.290
<v Speaker 3>this is why they have all these crazy scifi movies,</v>

2246
01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:13.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2247
01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:14.940
<v Speaker 3>the talk about and we whatever.</v>

2248
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.130
<v Speaker 3>But where did it come from?</v>

2249
01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:17.941
<v Speaker 3>And I know,</v>

2250
01:07:17.941 --> 01:07:22.941
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can feel it in my own head right now I'm using like one 0.0 of what's</v>

2251
01:07:23.551 --> 01:07:24.330
<v Speaker 3>up there.</v>

2252
01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:25.440
<v Speaker 3>And I know we all are.</v>

2253
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.260
<v Speaker 3>So who knows what's up.</v>

2254
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.020
<v Speaker 4>We got that.</v>

2255
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:29.371
<v Speaker 4>We got a,</v>

2256
01:07:29.371 --> 01:07:30.070
<v Speaker 4>the hardware,</v>

2257
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 4>we just don't have the software but the software and we don't,</v>

2258
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:34.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2259
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:37.240
<v Speaker 4>it's obvious too that there's ways to maximize this hardware.</v>

2260
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:37.751
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2261
01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:40.960
<v Speaker 4>And some of us have grasped certain areas of it.</v>

2262
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Some of us have a grasp it athletically.</v>

2263
01:07:43.181 --> 01:07:44.014
<v Speaker 4>Some of them has.</v>

2264
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.580
<v Speaker 4>Some of them was like yourself.</v>

2265
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 4>I've done it creatively.</v>

2266
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:47.041
<v Speaker 4>Would,</v>

2267
01:07:47.041 --> 01:07:48.670
<v Speaker 4>there's all like these weird little,</v>

2268
01:07:48.671 --> 01:07:50.350
<v Speaker 4>like this guys figured out this thing.</v>

2269
01:07:50.351 --> 01:07:51.550
<v Speaker 4>You now you know how to work your,</v>

2270
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:51.911
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2271
01:07:51.911 --> 01:07:52.744
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2272
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.030
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is so complicated,</v>

2273
01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:55.630
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>

2274
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:56.590
<v Speaker 4>the body itself,</v>

2275
01:07:56.591 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 4>it's such a weird vehicle.</v>

2276
01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.440
<v Speaker 4>It's so complicated.</v>

2277
01:07:59.441 --> 01:08:02.350
<v Speaker 4>It's almost impossible in this day and age to get it right.</v>

2278
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 4>But back in the happy,</v>

2279
01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 4>the ty got days,</v>

2280
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:05.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2281
01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:07.570
<v Speaker 4>if you were one of those crazy guys living in Siberia,</v>

2282
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.610
<v Speaker 4>you mean there's some shit you got to learn.</v>

2283
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:10.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Don't go in the river when it's frozen,</v>

2285
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2286
01:08:13.151 --> 01:08:13.571
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

2287
01:08:13.571 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2288
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.860
<v Speaker 4>don't fall through the ice.</v>

2289
01:08:14.861 --> 01:08:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>

2290
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 4>When a moose</v>

2291
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.790
<v Speaker 6>comes run.</v>

2292
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:17.031
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2293
01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:17.864
<v Speaker 6>what else?</v>

2294
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2295
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.640
<v Speaker 6>this is how saw works.</v>

2296
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2297
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:21.660
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of shit you don't have to,</v>

2298
01:08:21.661 --> 01:08:22.221
<v Speaker 6>are there Joe?</v>

2299
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 6>They would kick you out of the tribe and if they don't kick you out,</v>

2300
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:26.060
<v Speaker 6>you'd leave yourself.</v>

2301
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.361
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2302
01:08:26.361 --> 01:08:27.081
<v Speaker 6>you know what I would do?</v>

2303
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:28.370
<v Speaker 6>I would just manipulate those schools.</v>

2304
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.840
<v Speaker 6>I figured out a way to start my own call to and I just make up a bunch of shit</v>

2305
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:33.674
<v Speaker 6>and see who's with me.</v>

2306
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:35.870
<v Speaker 6>Speaking at tribes is a little off topic,</v>

2307
01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:36.710
<v Speaker 6>but one of the most,</v>

2308
01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 6>the coolest collections of photographs I've ever seen.</v>

2309
01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 6>It's from this artist called,</v>

2310
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.720
<v Speaker 6>it's that before they.com and check it out.</v>

2311
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:47.180
<v Speaker 6>It's like all the tribes and the ideas before they,</v>

2312
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:48.250
<v Speaker 6>before they die,</v>

2313
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:49.041
<v Speaker 6>before they met,</v>

2314
01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:50.300
<v Speaker 6>before they pass away,</v>

2315
01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 6>before they get assimilated.</v>

2316
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 6>And the photographs are stunning.</v>

2317
01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:55.041
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2318
01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 6>they have the eagle hunters in Mongolia and the different tribes from Africa.</v>

2319
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 6>So if you want to kind of take a look,</v>

2320
01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:01.730
<v Speaker 6>I think the book is about to go on.</v>

2321
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Here's another kind of fascinating part about tribalism that if,</v>

2322
01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:11.290
<v Speaker 3>if we were to really insert ourselves into that world,</v>

2323
01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:15.010
<v Speaker 3>they live in dimensions beyond reality.</v>

2324
01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:18.100
<v Speaker 3>We like to think of these primitive tribes has just these guys,</v>

2325
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2326
01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.220
<v Speaker 3>pounding stones on to Acorns,</v>

2327
01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.430
<v Speaker 3>but in fact they're things like will,</v>

2328
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:24.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2329
01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.080
<v Speaker 3>whatever tribe it is,</v>

2330
01:09:26.081 --> 01:09:29.050
<v Speaker 3>where you need to know where the deer are.</v>

2331
01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:34.260
<v Speaker 3>So you dream and in the dream you're told where the deer are or Combo.</v>

2332
01:09:35.051 --> 01:09:36.070
<v Speaker 3>That's frog medicine.</v>

2333
01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:39.250
<v Speaker 3>When they burn themselves and take this poison and put it on there,</v>

2334
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.930
<v Speaker 6>scan it says frog toxin,</v>

2335
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:43.900
<v Speaker 6>and then apparently they can see all the animals in the forest.</v>

2336
01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:44.790
<v Speaker 6>That's what they,</v>

2337
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:45.401
<v Speaker 6>I believe it.</v>

2338
01:09:45.401 --> 01:09:46.390
<v Speaker 6>It's the same sort of thing.</v>

2339
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:53.350
<v Speaker 6>There's one two days away if I run this way and then they find it should be an</v>

2340
01:09:53.351 --> 01:09:54.550
<v Speaker 6>episode of Joe Rogan questions,</v>

2341
01:09:54.551 --> 01:09:54.941
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

2342
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.360
<v Speaker 6>We should take that frog toxin.</v>

2343
01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:57.250
<v Speaker 6>See what you find that,</v>

2344
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:58.630
<v Speaker 6>how dangerous is it?</v>

2345
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.670
<v Speaker 6>Not Saying I need to know him.</v>

2346
01:10:00.671 --> 01:10:02.530
<v Speaker 6>And you go to Suriname and it's uh,</v>

2347
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:03.850
<v Speaker 6>it's dangerous to the frog.</v>

2348
01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.590
<v Speaker 6>It's the only to the frog.</v>

2349
01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.190
<v Speaker 6>The frog.</v>

2350
01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:07.840
<v Speaker 6>The frog does not have a good go of it,</v>

2351
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.130
<v Speaker 6>just harvesting and toxin.</v>

2352
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.990
<v Speaker 6>But as far as the humans,</v>

2353
01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.660
<v Speaker 6>it's perfectly safe so that,</v>

2354
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:13.181
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2355
01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:14.680
<v Speaker 6>when the native American,</v>

2356
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:16.600
<v Speaker 3>I just would look at the white man.</v>

2357
01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.740
<v Speaker 3>They thought we were just a bunch of idiots because we</v>

2358
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:23.090
<v Speaker 6>not tapped into that other dimension at all.</v>

2359
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:25.160
<v Speaker 6>How'd that work out for ya?</v>

2360
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:26.421
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:28.730
<v Speaker 6>That's because the invention of the Winchester rifle.</v>

2362
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 6>But other than that,</v>

2363
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:30.201
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2364
01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:30.831
<v Speaker 6>And Polio,</v>

2365
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:31.664
<v Speaker 6>smallpox,</v>

2366
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.593
<v Speaker 6>smallpox,</v>

2367
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:34.670
<v Speaker 6>which goes to show you,</v>

2368
01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:37.560
<v Speaker 6>there's no justice in the world because they would have won if the,</v>

2369
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:38.331
<v Speaker 6>if there had been any,</v>

2370
01:10:38.331 --> 01:10:39.620
<v Speaker 6>just I learned that from ice cube.</v>

2371
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:41.361
<v Speaker 6>No justice,</v>

2372
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:41.870
<v Speaker 6>no peace.</v>

2373
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.111
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2374
01:10:42.111 --> 01:10:42.531
<v Speaker 6>I was in,</v>

2375
01:10:42.531 --> 01:10:44.030
<v Speaker 6>I was in Peru and they still,</v>

2376
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:44.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2377
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:46.350
<v Speaker 6>some of the old shamanistic tradition,</v>

2378
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:50.540
<v Speaker 6>those cultures still exist and they still have the words for the Spaniards and</v>

2379
01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 6>the people that came and in their mind,</v>

2380
01:10:53.151 --> 01:10:53.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2381
01:10:53.301 --> 01:10:56.640
<v Speaker 6>part of the reason for the rainbow flag is that's the colors of the shockers</v>

2382
01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:57.440
<v Speaker 6>that they see.</v>

2383
01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.440
<v Speaker 6>Like visually see inside a person who's connected.</v>

2384
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 6>And then these other people came in and invaded their culture and they called</v>

2385
01:11:03.921 --> 01:11:06.560
<v Speaker 6>him the gray ones because they didn't see that shit.</v>

2386
01:11:06.561 --> 01:11:06.980
<v Speaker 6>There was like,</v>

2387
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:07.813
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

2388
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 6>what is this human walking around that has no color for them?</v>

2389
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 6>It just because all of that was blocked</v>

2390
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.470
<v Speaker 1>up and they weren't kind of tapped in and connected.</v>

2391
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.690
<v Speaker 1>So for them it's a very visual thing,</v>

2392
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:18.931
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2393
01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:19.764
<v Speaker 1>And you ask them,</v>

2394
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2395
01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:20.551
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2396
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:21.331
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

2397
01:11:21.331 --> 01:11:22.164
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2398
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:23.220
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

2399
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.053
<v Speaker 1>Because I see it.</v>

2400
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 1>What kind of psychedelics would they fucking around with?</v>

2401
01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2402
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I see there's a different reality when you're consistently altering your</v>

2403
01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistry with psychedelic drugs.</v>

2404
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:34.591
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

2405
01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a diff,</v>

2406
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I've had moments.</v>

2407
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:37.071
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>

2408
01:11:37.071 --> 01:11:42.071
<v Speaker 1>the last moment that I did DMT where I said time to take a break where reality</v>

2409
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:46.050
<v Speaker 1>got super slippery for about two weeks.</v>

2410
01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>And when I say buy slippery,</v>

2411
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:48.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2412
01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelic experience was so profound and it was changing my regular</v>

2413
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:57.891
<v Speaker 1>everyday mind so much that I felt like a different person who I had to relearn</v>

2414
01:11:58.321 --> 01:11:58.741
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2415
01:11:58.741 --> 01:12:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I was thrown into this life with a manual of this is what you've done so</v>

2416
01:12:03.241 --> 01:12:03.480
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

2417
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 1>What are the fuck did I do that?</v>

2418
01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.251
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2419
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:09.990
<v Speaker 1>This is what you did and this is who you are now and ready go like it felt so</v>

2420
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.240
<v Speaker 1>unreal for a while that I'm,</v>

2421
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that there was some sort of a permanent change in the structure of</v>

2422
01:12:16.681 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 1>my brain or the way my brain accepts certain chemicals are produced.</v>

2423
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.260
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a producer's one's in a different way now and I think that if</v>

2424
01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that on a regular basis every day,</v>

2425
01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:29.730
<v Speaker 1>day in day out,</v>

2426
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:32.490
<v Speaker 1>these people were almost unrecognizable.</v>

2427
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

2428
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:33.631
<v Speaker 1>they're all there.</v>

2429
01:12:33.631 --> 01:12:36.710
<v Speaker 1>They're reality is they probably seeing flow like D,</v>

2430
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:37.950
<v Speaker 1>we had David Show in here,</v>

2431
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:40.980
<v Speaker 1>David show recently did IOWASCA and now he says he trips every day.</v>

2432
01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:41.731
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2433
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have to do anything.</v>

2434
01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:43.560
<v Speaker 1>They were all in front of me right now.</v>

2435
01:12:43.561 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I see a dragon in front of you.</v>

2436
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:48.090
<v Speaker 1>It's flying through the air like he sees flying snakes and he goes,</v>

2437
01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:48.601
<v Speaker 1>I can just,</v>

2438
01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:49.381
<v Speaker 1>I could just see them.</v>

2439
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:50.610
<v Speaker 1>They're around us all the time.</v>

2440
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:51.993
<v Speaker 1>You remember the,</v>

2442
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:55.290
<v Speaker 1>that you're normally used to seeing one layer of the onion and then all of a</v>

2443
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:58.740
<v Speaker 1>sudden you get to here's through all the layers and see all these layers.</v>

2444
01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.060
<v Speaker 1>And David's not an idiot.</v>

2445
01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant guy and he's cool as shit and he's not a liar.</v>

2446
01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:04.710
<v Speaker 1>So if he tells me he seeing those things,</v>

2447
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I believe him 100%.</v>

2448
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.280
<v Speaker 1>So what happened to him?</v>

2449
01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2450
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.980
<v Speaker 1>what changed his mind?</v>

2451
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:13.080
<v Speaker 1>What did that to his mind and fried?</v>

2452
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2453
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:13.621
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

2454
01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2455
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not fried because you're only putting something in that org already exists.</v>

2456
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 1>You through the real issue with psychedelic drugs or you know,</v>

2457
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.980
<v Speaker 1>anything that's uh,</v>

2458
01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:25.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2459
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.680
<v Speaker 1>a non native chemical that you're introducing into your body.</v>

2460
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.570
<v Speaker 1>You have LD 50 rates,</v>

2461
01:13:30.571 --> 01:13:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you have low rates of toxicity where it becomes deadly to 50% of the people that</v>

2462
01:13:34.021 --> 01:13:34.854
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

2463
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.270
<v Speaker 1>What is it for DMT?</v>

2464
01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.200
<v Speaker 1>No one even knows because it's a human neurotransmitter.</v>

2465
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of your natural human brain chemistry.</v>

2466
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing when they're doing IOWASCA.</v>

2467
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.290
<v Speaker 1>They're doing an orally active version of this DMT.</v>

2468
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.124
<v Speaker 1>So if this is,</v>

2469
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>if he seen fucking floating snakes,</v>

2470
01:13:49.261 --> 01:13:50.071
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're there.</v>

2471
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>We're just not seeing them.</v>

2472
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're not getting enough DMT on a regular basis.</v>

2473
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.471
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2474
01:13:54.471 --> 01:13:54.860
<v Speaker 7>but if you,</v>

2475
01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:55.693
<v Speaker 7>if you take,</v>

2476
01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.580
<v Speaker 7>if you drink blood or if you take put stuff in your body,</v>

2477
01:13:58.581 --> 01:13:59.690
<v Speaker 7>that really bad analogy.</v>

2478
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:01.071
<v Speaker 7>I mean like,</v>

2479
01:14:01.071 --> 01:14:01.641
<v Speaker 7>like you're saying,</v>

2480
01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:02.720
<v Speaker 7>because it's from your body.</v>

2481
01:14:02.721 --> 01:14:03.770
<v Speaker 7>It's not bad because it's,</v>

2482
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:06.290
<v Speaker 7>you're putting it in something that's already been in your body back in your</v>

2483
01:14:06.291 --> 01:14:06.621
<v Speaker 7>body.</v>

2484
01:14:06.621 --> 01:14:06.821
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

2485
01:14:06.821 --> 01:14:09.890
<v Speaker 7>That's you know more than you had before.</v>

2486
01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.753
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

2487
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:11.860
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2488
01:14:11.861 --> 01:14:12.110
<v Speaker 7>if you</v>

2489
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.943
<v Speaker 1>know what you're saying,</v>

2490
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not taking estrogen.</v>

2491
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:17.320
<v Speaker 1>If he too many soybeans,</v>

2492
01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

2493
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2494
01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 1>You're not taking out something and putting more in your,</v>

2495
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you're adding more to it that you're supposed to have.</v>

2496
01:14:23.201 --> 01:14:25.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you have too much blood in your body,</v>

2497
01:14:25.031 --> 01:14:25.864
<v Speaker 1>it's probably bad.</v>

2498
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Or if you have too much,</v>

2499
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2500
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>

2501
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.230
<v Speaker 1>anything that's in your bodies,</v>

2502
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it's healthy.</v>

2503
01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:32.890
<v Speaker 1>If you put it back in and that's a good point,</v>

2504
01:14:32.891 --> 01:14:33.491
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2505
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not like blood and it's also the most transient thing ever observed in the</v>

2506
01:14:38.201 --> 01:14:38.830
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

2507
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Your body brings it back to baseline.</v>

2508
01:14:40.571 --> 01:14:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm like 15 minutes from a full blown trip into another dimension to back to</v>

2509
01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 1>completely sober 15 minutes.</v>

2510
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 1>It's because your brain knows how to handle it.</v>

2511
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Your brain knows what it is.</v>

2512
01:14:50.051 --> 01:14:50.261
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2513
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:51.370
<v Speaker 1>it's there all the time.</v>

2514
01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Another,</v>

2515
01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2516
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:52.281
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2517
01:14:52.281 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 1>but you've got a good point though.</v>

2518
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:55.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good point.</v>

2519
01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 1>As far as hormones go,</v>

2520
01:14:56.231 --> 01:14:58.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a very big point with what happens with guys when they,</v>

2521
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.740
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

2522
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.700
<v Speaker 1>do steroids.</v>

2523
01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.310
<v Speaker 1>If you see like bodybuilders,</v>

2524
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.820
<v Speaker 1>after they stopped doing steroids,</v>

2525
01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 1>they usually have to take a bunch of different drugs to try to boost back up</v>

2526
01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:12.460
<v Speaker 1>their body's production of testosterone because they just shoot themselves up</v>

2527
01:15:12.461 --> 01:15:15.160
<v Speaker 1>with so much and they become the hulk.</v>

2528
01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2529
01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:18.610
<v Speaker 1>they're taking like hyper human levels,</v>

2530
01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:21.220
<v Speaker 1>10 15 times what a person would be,</v>

2531
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:22.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2532
01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>putting into there are just having their body grow.</v>

2533
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.860
<v Speaker 1>They're just pumping the shit in their body all the time.</v>

2534
01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:27.640
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of different.</v>

2535
01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 1>So the balls just go,</v>

2536
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:29.374
<v Speaker 1>you don't need us.</v>

2537
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.150
<v Speaker 1>And I had the balls just check out.</v>

2538
01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.690
<v Speaker 1>So obviously putting too much testosterone into your body,</v>

2539
01:15:34.691 --> 01:15:35.620
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous.</v>

2540
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Putting too much estrogen has consequences as well.</v>

2541
01:15:38.111 --> 01:15:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So in that sense you've got to go,</v>

2542
01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:39.490
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2543
01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:39.741
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2544
01:15:39.741 --> 01:15:40.040
<v Speaker 6>I might,</v>

2545
01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:40.681
<v Speaker 6>I think we,</v>

2546
01:15:40.681 --> 01:15:42.820
<v Speaker 6>we've talked a lot about the drug way to do it,</v>

2547
01:15:42.821 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 6>but there's so many non drug ways to do it.</v>

2548
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:45.431
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2549
01:15:45.431 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 6>I've had visions as intense as,</v>

2550
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:47.831
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2551
01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:51.640
<v Speaker 6>some of the visions on psychedelics in deep meditation.</v>

2552
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:51.911
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2553
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:52.900
<v Speaker 6>when I went and floated,</v>

2554
01:15:52.901 --> 01:15:56.890
<v Speaker 6>I had a really deep visions when I do a breathwork ceremony where you do this</v>

2555
01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:57.790
<v Speaker 6>shamonic breathing,</v>

2556
01:15:57.791 --> 01:16:02.410
<v Speaker 6>where you hyper kind of hyperventilate yourself and get to a state of heightened</v>

2557
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 6>awareness,</v>

2558
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.960
<v Speaker 6>you start to see some of the similar things.</v>

2559
01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:06.070
<v Speaker 6>So for me,</v>

2560
01:16:06.071 --> 01:16:06.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2561
01:16:06.281 --> 01:16:09.910
<v Speaker 6>I hear David chose story and he's already taken care of all of his needs.</v>

2562
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 6>That guy has no Maslow,</v>

2563
01:16:12.011 --> 01:16:12.341
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>

2564
01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:12.571
<v Speaker 6>two,</v>

2565
01:16:12.571 --> 01:16:12.970
<v Speaker 6>three,</v>

2566
01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:14.650
<v Speaker 6>four are taken care of.</v>

2567
01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.380
<v Speaker 6>And he's a visionary artists already.</v>

2568
01:16:17.381 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 6>And then he takes something that pries open his doors of perception temporarily,</v>

2569
01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:21.971
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2570
01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:26.500
<v Speaker 6>turns the Venetian blinds sideways for a while and then all of a sudden maybe</v>

2571
01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 6>his brain decides,</v>

2572
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

2573
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't really need to turn them back closed again.</v>

2574
01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:31.400
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2575
01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.420
<v Speaker 6>I can give him open just a little bit cause I'm going to be fine.</v>

2576
01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 6>And there's a lot of cool information and visions and things out there.</v>

2577
01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.160
<v Speaker 6>So I think that,</v>

2578
01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:39.491
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>

2579
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:40.690
<v Speaker 6>that's the alternate explanation.</v>

2580
01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a possible explanation.</v>

2581
01:16:41.951 --> 01:16:42.820
<v Speaker 1>But he might be right too.</v>

2582
01:16:42.821 --> 01:16:43.870
<v Speaker 1>He might have fried his brain,</v>

2583
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 1>he might,</v>

2584
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.570
<v Speaker 1>he might have gone too far in.</v>

2585
01:16:46.571 --> 01:16:47.440
<v Speaker 1>The brain's just not,</v>

2586
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:52.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just the reason why other aspect of this,</v>

2587
01:16:52.181 --> 01:16:53.014
<v Speaker 1>as if we're,</v>

2588
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:55.900
<v Speaker 1>if we're trying to imagine our shelter to tribal cultures that are,</v>

2589
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:56.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2590
01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.150
<v Speaker 1>she visions on a regular basis.</v>

2591
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Like if it happens to you,</v>

2592
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2593
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:03.820
<v Speaker 1>you're just an individual without any structure around you.</v>

2594
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no teacher,</v>

2595
01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:07.090
<v Speaker 1>there's no sham and there's nobody who can guide you.</v>

2596
01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 1>But how do we know that in these tribal cultures,</v>

2597
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean for hundreds and hundreds,</v>

2598
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:13.363
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years,</v>

2599
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:13.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2600
01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:14.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2601
01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 3>the elders have known how to navigate it.</v>

2602
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Here's how you do it.</v>

2603
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.040
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2604
01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:19.460
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2605
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.080
<v Speaker 3>when you enter that crazy space,</v>

2606
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2607
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:22.341
<v Speaker 3>if there are,</v>

2608
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:26.030
<v Speaker 3>if your uncle is there and he can teach you and show you how to do this and your</v>

2609
01:17:26.031 --> 01:17:27.100
<v Speaker 3>brother and then Nada,</v>

2610
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the way it goes.</v>

2611
01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 3>And maybe they are living in that world all the time and seeing the dragons and</v>

2612
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 3>seeing all that stuff.</v>

2613
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2614
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.630
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't surprise me.</v>

2615
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.051
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2616
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.000
<v Speaker 3>I know my Iowa</v>

2617
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Shama,</v>

2618
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty well my store Orlando too and off down from Peru and he,</v>

2619
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:44.310
<v Speaker 1>he drinks Iowasca in ceremony probably five,</v>

2620
01:17:44.311 --> 01:17:45.144
<v Speaker 1>six nights a week.</v>

2621
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Tell me what is Iowasca I don't know what that is.</v>

2622
01:17:47.241 --> 01:17:47.750
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2623
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:48.261
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2624
01:17:48.261 --> 01:17:49.680
<v Speaker 3>it's a psychoactive,</v>

2625
01:17:49.681 --> 01:17:49.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2626
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Oral,</v>

2627
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.690
<v Speaker 1>oral t that they brew from Dmt,</v>

2628
01:17:52.691 --> 01:17:54.370
<v Speaker 1>which comes from the [inaudible],</v>

2629
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.760
<v Speaker 1>which is like 0.27% DMT or whatever.</v>

2630
01:17:57.761 --> 01:17:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And they brew that with an Maoi,</v>

2631
01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:02.680
<v Speaker 1>which is a vine that allows it to be orally active.</v>

2632
01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:08.050
<v Speaker 1>And so they drink this brew and you have a DMT experience that lasts for four to</v>

2633
01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:08.884
<v Speaker 1>six hours.</v>

2634
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:12.700
<v Speaker 1>T is killed in the gut by monoamine oxidase.</v>

2635
01:18:12.701 --> 01:18:13.540
<v Speaker 1>So when you take,</v>

2636
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:16.390
<v Speaker 1>like if you're eating grass like flares glass,</v>

2637
01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:17.740
<v Speaker 1>it has DMT in it.</v>

2638
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:19.690
<v Speaker 1>And if you were eating that grass,</v>

2639
01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:19.960
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2640
01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you would just start tripping your balls off if your stomach didn't produce this</v>

2641
01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:24.551
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

2642
01:18:24.551 --> 01:18:28.970
<v Speaker 1>this mono aiming that it keeps monoamine oxidase the,</v>

2643
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.790
<v Speaker 1>keeps the DMT from being orally active.</v>

2644
01:18:30.791 --> 01:18:31.990
<v Speaker 1>So when they combine the two of them,</v>

2645
01:18:31.991 --> 01:18:33.520
<v Speaker 1>when the combine the harming and the,</v>

2646
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2647
01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.300
<v Speaker 1>the headbutt or of that compound that breaks it down an Aoi,</v>

2648
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:38.700
<v Speaker 3>you guys are deep into this shit.</v>

2649
01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.880
<v Speaker 3>I tools that I use the tap.</v>

2650
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:44.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2651
01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:45.470
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

2652
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2653
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's to me,</v>

2654
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2655
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:48.140
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2656
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:53.140
<v Speaker 1>it's almost makes me sad when someone does know about it because it's so crazy</v>

2657
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's so real and so vivid and so memorable.</v>

2658
01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 1>And so life changing.</v>

2659
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:59.091
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2660
01:18:59.091 --> 01:18:59.901
<v Speaker 1>Amber Lyon,</v>

2661
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.040
<v Speaker 1>who was our friend from,</v>

2662
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.090
<v Speaker 1>she used to work for CNN and a,</v>

2663
01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.950
<v Speaker 1>now she's become a crazy psychedelic adventure from the podcast.</v>

2664
01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:09.020
<v Speaker 1>We were on the podcast and she asked me,</v>

2665
01:19:09.021 --> 01:19:09.261
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2666
01:19:09.261 --> 01:19:10.880
<v Speaker 1>about ways to change the world.</v>

2667
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:11.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2668
01:19:11.061 --> 01:19:16.061
<v Speaker 1>she's seen a lot of shit and she's been all over the world and been involved in,</v>

2669
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:16.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2670
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.370
<v Speaker 1>like covering like some intense conflicts.</v>

2671
01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 1>And I said Psychedelics,</v>

2672
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that psychedelic drugs,</v>

2673
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.633
<v Speaker 1>he'd change the world.</v>

2674
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.823
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2675
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:25.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2676
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:26.960
<v Speaker 1>for some people it doesn't,</v>

2677
01:19:26.961 --> 01:19:28.280
<v Speaker 1>for some people just get some high.</v>

2678
01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 1>For some people they don't want to change,</v>

2679
01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:31.490
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to explore.</v>

2680
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:32.240
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

2681
01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.860
<v Speaker 1>if you want to really see some shit that you didn't even think could be possible</v>

2682
01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:37.694
<v Speaker 1>in a movie,</v>

2683
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:38.841
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2684
01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:40.100
<v Speaker 1>there's some ways out there.</v>

2685
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:41.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some methods you can,</v>

2686
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you could find those methods.</v>

2687
01:19:42.501 --> 01:19:43.251
<v Speaker 1>And like Aubrey said,</v>

2688
01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:43.641
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them,</v>

2689
01:19:43.641 --> 01:19:45.380
<v Speaker 1>they aren't even a drug related.</v>

2690
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:48.710
<v Speaker 1>You can have a naturally occurring psychedelic trip and an isolation tank.</v>

2691
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Mckenna it,</v>

2692
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna believe,</v>

2693
01:19:51.991 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and we were talking about the growth of the human brain,</v>

2694
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:57.200
<v Speaker 1>the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years,</v>

2695
01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Trans Mckenna had a whole theory about that being,</v>

2696
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.050
<v Speaker 1>having to do with climate change.</v>

2697
01:20:03.051 --> 01:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And primates experimenting with Psychedelic mushrooms that the rain forests</v>

2698
01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:12.390
<v Speaker 1>receded into grasslands and that these chimps started following around or you</v>

2699
01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:12.541
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2700
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:17.541
<v Speaker 1>are ancient hominid ancestors started following around these cows and that wild</v>

2701
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>cows and eating the mushrooms that grow on their shit and they were prevalent in</v>

2702
01:20:22.321 --> 01:20:23.154
<v Speaker 1>that area.</v>

2703
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.040
<v Speaker 1>And he has it like he had it broken down,</v>

2704
01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:26.700
<v Speaker 1>he died,</v>

2705
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.370
<v Speaker 1>but he had it broken down in terms of the,</v>

2706
01:20:29.371 --> 01:20:29.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2707
01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the time of the,</v>

2708
01:20:30.561 --> 01:20:31.740
<v Speaker 1>the climate change,</v>

2709
01:20:31.741 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>and it was very controversial theory,</v>

2710
01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but one of the best ones,</v>

2711
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's poopooed because it involves psychedelic mushrooms,</v>

2712
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is anybody who poo poos psychedelic mushrooms has simply not</v>

2713
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:45.240
<v Speaker 1>done psychedelic mushrooms.</v>

2714
01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Because if you've done them and you blow your mind out and have this in crazy,</v>

2715
01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian icons dancing or in front of your eyes and fluorescent colors and</v>

2716
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 1>explain to you the nature of life through a voice that you can understand,</v>

2717
01:20:58.471 --> 01:20:58.801
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2718
01:20:58.801 --> 01:20:59.634
<v Speaker 1>as an English,</v>

2719
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:02.100
<v Speaker 1>once that that experience has happened,</v>

2720
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:02.371
<v Speaker 1>you'd go,</v>

2721
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:02.641
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2722
01:21:02.641 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 1>that exists.</v>

2723
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.823
<v Speaker 1>That exists.</v>

2724
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:06.390
<v Speaker 1>How many people have experienced this?</v>

2725
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 1>How many people have this?</v>

2726
01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:08.370
<v Speaker 1>If you gave that to monkeys,</v>

2727
01:21:08.371 --> 01:21:09.204
<v Speaker 1>what would happen?</v>

2728
01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think that without a doubt,</v>

2729
01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 1>that's the most likely candidate.</v>

2730
01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just seems ridiculous because we've demonized all drugs.</v>

2731
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.980
<v Speaker 1>We put them all into this big stupid blanket.</v>

2732
01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:22.200
<v Speaker 1>And so things like psychedelics,</v>

2733
01:21:22.201 --> 01:21:25.440
<v Speaker 1>which may very well be vehicles for evolution.</v>

2734
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be there looking like a big dinner plate sitting in the middle</v>

2735
01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:33.150
<v Speaker 1>of a field because it wants you to eat it so he can tell you things.</v>

2736
01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And it visual acuity increased in visual acuity.</v>

2737
01:21:36.211 --> 01:21:36.481
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

2738
01:21:36.481 --> 01:21:36.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2739
01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.320
<v Speaker 1>he had a whole bunch of points that,</v>

2740
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2741
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:40.350
<v Speaker 1>that led to this idea.</v>

2742
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 1>May the um,</v>

2743
01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2744
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:44.760
<v Speaker 1>stimulation of male genitalia,</v>

2745
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:48.330
<v Speaker 1>increased erections when they're eating a psilocybin mushrooms,</v>

2746
01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Speaker 1>the a in small doses,</v>

2747
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.830
<v Speaker 1>a measurable increase in visual acuity,</v>

2748
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:54.540
<v Speaker 1>which would lead them to be better hunters,</v>

2749
01:21:54.541 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 1>which lead them to survive better.</v>

2750
01:21:56.130 --> 01:22:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Like all these different points besides the psychedelic experience.</v>

2751
01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:04.800
<v Speaker 1>All these different points lead to this idea that the animals that embrace that</v>

2752
01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:06.750
<v Speaker 1>into their diet would have a better chance of surviving.</v>

2753
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:07.601
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2754
01:22:07.601 --> 01:22:10.240
<v Speaker 6>to bring this kind of back to some of the stuff that you wrote.</v>

2755
01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.970
<v Speaker 6>I know from myself and the psychedelic experience for me,</v>

2756
01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:13.690
<v Speaker 6>you wrote,</v>

2757
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.460
<v Speaker 6>wrote in your book the authentic swing.</v>

2758
01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.030
<v Speaker 6>If we find ourselves lost or tormented or in pain,</v>

2759
01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:22.930
<v Speaker 6>the reason is that we have somehow become estranged from who we really are,</v>

2760
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:26.050
<v Speaker 6>from the ground of our individual being and for me,</v>

2761
01:22:26.051 --> 01:22:26.681
<v Speaker 6>when you know,</v>

2762
01:22:26.681 --> 01:22:30.370
<v Speaker 6>when I find myself in those kinds of states where I'm a little sad or a little</v>

2763
01:22:30.371 --> 01:22:31.570
<v Speaker 6>lost or a little depressed,</v>

2764
01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:32.261
<v Speaker 6>for me,</v>

2765
01:22:32.261 --> 01:22:33.400
<v Speaker 6>the psychedelic experience,</v>

2766
01:22:33.401 --> 01:22:33.881
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

2767
01:22:33.881 --> 01:22:36.100
<v Speaker 6>with or without drugs could be a deep meditation,</v>

2768
01:22:36.101 --> 01:22:36.934
<v Speaker 6>could be anything.</v>

2769
01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:42.300
<v Speaker 6>It shows me back to my true self and then it can allow me to be happy again and</v>

2770
01:22:43.241 --> 01:22:45.190
<v Speaker 6>it's just filled and full of life again.</v>

2771
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.140
<v Speaker 6>Can you define Aubrey,</v>

2772
01:22:47.141 --> 01:22:49.510
<v Speaker 6>your true shelf as we can?</v>

2773
01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:52.301
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2774
01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.910
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it and I've felt it and I've been at,</v>

2775
01:22:55.090 --> 01:22:55.451
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2776
01:22:55.451 --> 01:22:56.470
<v Speaker 6>I know when it's,</v>

2777
01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:56.981
<v Speaker 6>when it's there,</v>

2778
01:22:56.981 --> 01:22:58.510
<v Speaker 6>I know when it's operating the ship.</v>

2779
01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:02.230
<v Speaker 6>I had a long experience that actually allowed me to see the differentiating</v>

2780
01:23:02.231 --> 01:23:02.981
<v Speaker 6>parts of myself,</v>

2781
01:23:02.981 --> 01:23:03.970
<v Speaker 6>the highest self.</v>

2782
01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.013
<v Speaker 6>Then the,</v>

2783
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:09.010
<v Speaker 6>which I called mine boy because it was very juvenile in the way that it kind of,</v>

2784
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 6>it loved puzzles,</v>

2785
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.410
<v Speaker 6>love to figure things out,</v>

2786
01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:12.010
<v Speaker 6>love.</v>

2787
01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:13.630
<v Speaker 6>And then there was the monkey part of me,</v>

2788
01:23:13.631 --> 01:23:13.901
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2789
01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2790
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 6>the flesh and blood and testosterone and all of those things were all kind of</v>

2791
01:23:18.971 --> 01:23:20.200
<v Speaker 6>coalescing together.</v>

2792
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:20.770
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2793
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:22.900
<v Speaker 6>but the highest self that part of me,</v>

2794
01:23:22.901 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 6>which you know,</v>

2795
01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:26.830
<v Speaker 6>is my authentic self is very clear to me.</v>

2796
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:27.783
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

2797
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:29.350
<v Speaker 6>it's something that I try to,</v>

2798
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.760
<v Speaker 6>I try to get it to run the ship as often as possible and push the mind out of</v>

2799
01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:33.971
<v Speaker 6>the way.</v>

2800
01:23:33.971 --> 01:23:35.710
<v Speaker 6>Cause the mind constantly wants to take over.</v>

2801
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

2802
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:36.783
<v Speaker 6>I got this shit,</v>

2803
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:37.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2804
01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:38.130
<v Speaker 6>leave it to me buddy,</v>

2805
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:38.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2806
01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 6>I can solve all these puzzles.</v>

2807
01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:40.511
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2808
01:23:40.511 --> 01:23:42.400
<v Speaker 6>but then when the highest self is in charge,</v>

2809
01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:43.960
<v Speaker 6>that's when you're doing your best work more,</v>

2810
01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:46.760
<v Speaker 6>but the highest shelf as you experienced it yourself.</v>

2811
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:47.740
<v Speaker 6>I feel like you in therapy.</v>

2812
01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:49.133
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2813
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:52.030
<v Speaker 6>I feel like you'd be an analyst,</v>

2814
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:53.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2815
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:53.883
<v Speaker 6>the highest,</v>

2816
01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.630
<v Speaker 6>the highest self for me is,</v>

2817
01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 6>is very,</v>

2818
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:59.830
<v Speaker 6>it's very happy and it's very,</v>

2819
01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:00.690
<v Speaker 6>it's very contented.</v>

2820
01:24:00.691 --> 01:24:01.524
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>

2821
01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 6>it loves the creation that it's in,</v>

2822
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:04.240
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

2823
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.550
<v Speaker 6>and it loves the people of this creation.</v>

2824
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:10.400
<v Speaker 6>And part of what it's here for is to,</v>

2825
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:11.061
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying it,</v>

2826
01:24:11.061 --> 01:24:13.810
<v Speaker 6>it's me and it's kind of weird to separate it like that,</v>

2827
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.240
<v Speaker 6>but part of what it's here for is to,</v>

2828
01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:16.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2829
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.021
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2830
01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:17.291
<v Speaker 6>I had,</v>

2831
01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:18.740
<v Speaker 6>I had a vision of it being a,</v>

2832
01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.760
<v Speaker 6>a nutcracker of sorts to just kind of go through and roll along and spread ideas</v>

2833
01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:29.110
<v Speaker 6>and tools and different tactics and things that people can kind of open their</v>

2834
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:30.130
<v Speaker 6>shells a little bit too.</v>

2835
01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.210
<v Speaker 6>So I saw myself,</v>

2836
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:32.740
<v Speaker 6>my highest self cast,</v>

2837
01:24:32.741 --> 01:24:36.700
<v Speaker 6>like a bowling ball that just a bowling ball of light that just kind of rolls</v>

2838
01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.050
<v Speaker 6>around through the earth.</v>

2839
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2840
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 6>and that to me,</v>

2841
01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:41.170
<v Speaker 6>I know when I'm in that mode,</v>

2842
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.430
<v Speaker 6>and not only can I feel it,</v>

2843
01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:43.570
<v Speaker 6>not only can I see it,</v>

2844
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:44.081
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2845
01:24:44.081 --> 01:24:45.160
<v Speaker 6>visually my mind's eye,</v>

2846
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 6>but I know that that's what I'm here for.</v>

2847
01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:47.711
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2848
01:24:47.711 --> 01:24:48.820
<v Speaker 6>that's my highest calling.</v>

2849
01:24:48.821 --> 01:24:52.480
<v Speaker 6>That's my authentic swing is when I'm that bowling ball that rolls through and</v>

2850
01:24:52.481 --> 01:24:52.930
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>

2851
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:53.531
<v Speaker 6>hey guys,</v>

2852
01:24:53.531 --> 01:24:55.690
<v Speaker 6>have you heard about this thing called Iowasca hey guys,</v>

2853
01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:59.290
<v Speaker 6>we tried working out with a Kettlebell or whatever it is.</v>

2854
01:24:59.291 --> 01:24:59.650
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2855
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:02.070
<v Speaker 6>part of that opening up the horizons to,</v>

2856
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:03.143
<v Speaker 6>to other people,</v>

2857
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:08.410
<v Speaker 6>this is your highest shelf content with the way the world is or does it want to</v>

2858
01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.980
<v Speaker 6>help it evolve to something and know it wants to fight like hell to help it</v>

2859
01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:15.814
<v Speaker 6>evolve.</v>

2860
01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.440
<v Speaker 6>It feels that it's,</v>

2861
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.440
<v Speaker 6>it's off track a little bit and,</v>

2862
01:25:19.441 --> 01:25:21.300
<v Speaker 6>and there's some beautiful things and you know,</v>

2863
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:22.900
<v Speaker 6>I'm not disparaging the world,</v>

2864
01:25:22.901 --> 01:25:26.790
<v Speaker 6>but we've taken a veer to the wrong way and uh,</v>

2865
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.380
<v Speaker 6>it's ready to the healing grace shimmy the human race.</v>

2866
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:29.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2867
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:30.390
<v Speaker 6>Red.</v>

2868
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:31.001
<v Speaker 6>Cause you know,</v>

2869
01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:33.160
<v Speaker 6>the earth itself is in natural harmony,</v>

2870
01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:36.790
<v Speaker 6>but the human race puts the earth's harmony out of balance as well as the</v>

2871
01:25:36.791 --> 01:25:37.601
<v Speaker 6>harmony amongst it.</v>

2872
01:25:37.601 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 6>So to bring it back into balance,</v>

2873
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:41.470
<v Speaker 6>it wants to fight like hell.</v>

2874
01:25:41.471 --> 01:25:43.930
<v Speaker 6>And it's only happy when it's fighting like hell,</v>

2875
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:44.291
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2876
01:25:44.291 --> 01:25:45.460
<v Speaker 6>And when it doesn't want to fight,</v>

2877
01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.121
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

2878
01:25:46.121 --> 01:25:47.000
<v Speaker 6>what the hell am I doing?</v>

2879
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 6>I think we're in the middle of it so we can't see it.</v>

2880
01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.610
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a giant mathematical equation.</v>

2881
01:25:51.611 --> 01:25:52.151
<v Speaker 6>The pros,</v>

2882
01:25:52.151 --> 01:25:52.751
<v Speaker 6>the cons,</v>

2883
01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:53.141
<v Speaker 6>the good,</v>

2884
01:25:53.141 --> 01:25:53.980
<v Speaker 6>the bad,</v>

2885
01:25:54.330 --> 01:25:55.151
<v Speaker 6>the sucky,</v>

2886
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:55.984
<v Speaker 6>the awesome.</v>

2887
01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.100
<v Speaker 6>It's all together.</v>

2888
01:25:57.101 --> 01:26:02.050
<v Speaker 6>And the resistance almost battles you to make you appreciate when you accomplish</v>

2889
01:26:02.051 --> 01:26:03.370
<v Speaker 6>something even more so,</v>

2890
01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 6>almost</v>

2891
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.020
<v Speaker 1>motivates more movement.</v>

2892
01:26:06.021 --> 01:26:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Then the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you win.</v>

2893
01:26:08.661 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 1>The lottery does win the lottery at 21.</v>

2894
01:26:12.351 --> 01:26:12.891
<v Speaker 1>He good luck.</v>

2895
01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Fuck face.</v>

2896
01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2897
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Never going to figure out shit.</v>

2898
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:17.510
<v Speaker 1>You have $500 million and you're 21,</v>

2899
01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a dummy for the rest of your life and you have no opposing</v>

2900
01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:22.280
<v Speaker 1>force to apply your strength against.</v>

2901
01:26:22.281 --> 01:26:24.200
<v Speaker 1>There was something I've read a yesterday or today,</v>

2902
01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:24.650
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

2903
01:26:24.650 --> 01:26:24.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2904
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:25.520
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2905
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2906
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the Prince of,</v>

2907
01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2908
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.831
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>

2909
01:26:27.831 --> 01:26:28.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2910
01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Brunei or something like that who pissed away $18 billion,</v>

2911
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:38.030
<v Speaker 1>a teen billion dollars.</v>

2912
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens when you're born with all that cash.</v>

2913
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:44.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't figure that shit out for yourself.</v>

2914
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.020
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

2915
01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:46.040
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to,</v>

2916
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to,</v>

2917
01:26:47.211 --> 01:26:47.511
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2918
01:26:47.511 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 1>they said you're at a disadvantage.</v>

2919
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2920
01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2921
01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:53.000
<v Speaker 1>it's life.</v>

2922
01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.590
<v Speaker 1>You need struggle.</v>

2923
01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2924
01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you need all of it and I think that we as human race,</v>

2925
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:59.030
<v Speaker 1>if the in the,</v>

2926
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2927
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.190
<v Speaker 1>the macro,</v>

2928
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:04.700
<v Speaker 1>you know from the microcosm of the individual to the human race itself,</v>

2929
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it almost seems like all that stuff is necessary.</v>

2930
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.420
<v Speaker 1>It almost,</v>

2931
01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:09.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

2932
01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it in myself.</v>

2933
01:27:10.341 --> 01:27:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it in other people,</v>

2934
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but it exists.</v>

2935
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It's always existed.</v>

2936
01:27:14.311 --> 01:27:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It never been a day on this planet without war.</v>

2937
01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2938
01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.360
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

2939
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.560
<v Speaker 1>What is it and what's going on.</v>

2940
01:27:18.561 --> 01:27:18.951
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2941
01:27:18.951 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 1>if you were objective and you weren't attached to the life and death of the</v>

2942
01:27:22.311 --> 01:27:24.800
<v Speaker 1>individuals that were a part of this race would call humans.</v>

2943
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:27.290
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't a part of that and you were looking at it objectively,</v>

2944
01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 1>if you were an alien from another planet that wasn't even made of flesh,</v>

2945
01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:31.280
<v Speaker 1>you might be going,</v>

2946
01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:31.461
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2947
01:27:31.461 --> 01:27:32.121
<v Speaker 1>I see what they're doing.</v>

2948
01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:33.530
<v Speaker 1>They're forcing themselves to move.</v>

2949
01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:35.810
<v Speaker 1>They're forcing themselves to do things.</v>

2950
01:27:35.811 --> 01:27:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They're battling over the fucking blood of the earth.</v>

2951
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 1>They're forcing themselves to accomplish more and more,</v>

2952
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 1>a amazing technological feat so they can kill each other quicker.</v>

2953
01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 1>They do with these crazy flux and the whole while they're shitting out kids and</v>

2954
01:27:49.911 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 1>an alarming rate,</v>

2955
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:51.981
<v Speaker 1>doubling,</v>

2956
01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:54.500
<v Speaker 1>tripling the population like rats on a sinking ship,</v>

2957
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:56.930
<v Speaker 1>hanging on to every Pete of piece of floating wood.</v>

2958
01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:57.890
<v Speaker 1>They're nuts.</v>

2959
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:59.990
<v Speaker 1>They're sucking all the fish out of the ocean,</v>

2960
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:01.670
<v Speaker 1>throwing all their shit into it.</v>

2961
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.780
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking crazy.</v>

2962
01:28:02.781 --> 01:28:03.614
<v Speaker 1>What out of balance,</v>

2963
01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:07.680
<v Speaker 7>18 foot or fish has found Alpha Catalina island today.</v>

2964
01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.521
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

2965
01:28:08.521 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 7>It's dead.</v>

2966
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.760
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2967
01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.100
<v Speaker 7>Died of natural causes.</v>

2968
01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:13.620
<v Speaker 7>The three that the previous one,</v>

2969
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.050
<v Speaker 7>longest one that the Aa have found was I think three foot and says,</v>

2970
01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:19.050
<v Speaker 7>oh my God.</v>

2971
01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:20.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2972
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Does it radioactive?</v>

2973
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Did they check it for Fukushima?</v>

2974
01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.513
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2975
01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2976
01:28:24.651 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

2977
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2978
01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 1>they say there's a lot of fish that just grow until something meets.</v>

2979
01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2980
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:30.501
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

2981
01:28:30.501 --> 01:28:32.320
<v Speaker 1>they don't really necessarily have a lifespan.</v>

2982
01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.680
<v Speaker 1>They just keep going there.</v>

2983
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:35.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not built in there because you ain't got no chance.</v>

2984
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Like good luck.</v>

2985
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:36.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2986
01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:39.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a leopard seals out there that are looking for your ass seven days a</v>

2987
01:28:39.561 --> 01:28:40.250
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

2988
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make it so here live forever.</v>

2989
01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And some of them live forever.</v>

2990
01:28:44.961 --> 01:28:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess that guy did,</v>

2991
01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:46.963
<v Speaker 1>that guy's bad,</v>

2992
01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.710
<v Speaker 1>bad ass fish or fish</v>

2993
01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:49.540
<v Speaker 7>more fish.</v>

2994
01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.630
<v Speaker 7>Are you writing right now or are you I never stopped.</v>

2995
01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't take a day off after you complete a book or</v>

2996
01:28:56.110 --> 01:28:56.621
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2997
01:28:56.621 --> 01:28:58.000
<v Speaker 7>I take days off but not,</v>

2998
01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 7>I have a theory about finishing a book and that is that you should start the</v>

2999
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.843
<v Speaker 3>next one.</v>

3000
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.850
<v Speaker 3>You should already have the next one or the next two going.</v>

3001
01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you fall into the abyss.</v>

3002
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:09.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3003
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 3>he nothing to talk about a bis.</v>

3004
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:12.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3005
01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3006
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean what I mean by that is you resistance and negativity will come up and</v>

3007
01:29:17.881 --> 01:29:19.830
<v Speaker 3>you'll get over to your worst side.</v>

3008
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3009
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 3>So to me,</v>

3010
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 3>I've always got something going and only when I've kind of established a</v>

3011
01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:29.040
<v Speaker 3>beachhead in a new project when I kind of know him.</v>

3012
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3013
01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.200
<v Speaker 3>then I'll take a little time off.</v>

3014
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.470
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the same with standup comedy.</v>

3015
01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>

3016
01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:34.550
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

3017
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:38.870
<v Speaker 1>When you produce a CD or a DVD or a new special is what we call it.</v>

3018
01:29:38.871 --> 01:29:41.450
<v Speaker 1>We call it specials because of the way they used to be like an HBO comedy,</v>

3019
01:29:41.451 --> 01:29:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Special News Call Your once it's over,</v>

3020
01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you throw that out.</v>

3021
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't do any of that material anymore.</v>

3022
01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I might do a one or two bits on a request or if,</v>

3023
01:29:50.181 --> 01:29:51.600
<v Speaker 1>if it's poignant appointed,</v>

3024
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3025
01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:53.750
<v Speaker 1>but I'll even pointed out that it's an old bit,</v>

3026
01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.550
<v Speaker 1>but from then on it's all new stuff.</v>

3027
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So when I go into a new hour,</v>

3028
01:29:59.000 --> 01:29:59.833
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

3029
01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I have to scrounge up all the shit that I'm ready to,</v>

3030
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:03.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3031
01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:05.510
<v Speaker 1>to really ready to piece together.</v>

3032
01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I have to have something already.</v>

3033
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3034
01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:11.780
<v Speaker 1>so I have to have something that at least I've attempted on stage or worked out</v>

3035
01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:12.614
<v Speaker 1>on paper.</v>

3036
01:30:12.710 --> 01:30:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't just go up raw and clean and then finished,</v>

3037
01:30:16.251 --> 01:30:17.840
<v Speaker 1>finished my hour special and then go,</v>

3038
01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:18.081
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3039
01:30:18.081 --> 01:30:19.370
<v Speaker 1>now all that material's done.</v>

3040
01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.181
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

3041
01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.200
<v Speaker 1>What am I talking about next?</v>

3042
01:30:21.201 --> 01:30:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Like I always have a few things ready.</v>

3043
01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

3044
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3045
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:25.110
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying.</v>

3046
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3047
01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:27.201
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

3048
01:30:27.201 --> 01:30:27.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3049
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:31.460
<v Speaker 1>how do you ration your time off when you're,</v>

3050
01:30:31.461 --> 01:30:32.181
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing?</v>

3051
01:30:32.181 --> 01:30:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you just write until you feel like you don't want to do it anymore?</v>

3052
01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:36.021
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3053
01:30:36.021 --> 01:30:36.231
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

3054
01:30:36.231 --> 01:30:37.850
<v Speaker 1>do you have like a specific amount of time?</v>

3055
01:30:37.851 --> 01:30:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you make yourself work every day?</v>

3056
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.180
<v Speaker 3>I do work every day,</v>

3057
01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:41.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3058
01:30:41.991 --> 01:30:42.741
<v Speaker 3>within reason.</v>

3059
01:30:42.741 --> 01:30:42.951
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3060
01:30:42.951 --> 01:30:45.260
<v Speaker 3>maybe I will work one day a week or something like that,</v>

3061
01:30:45.261 --> 01:30:45.530
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3062
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:47.510
<v Speaker 3>so six days a week I've found,</v>

3063
01:30:47.511 --> 01:30:47.691
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3064
01:30:47.691 --> 01:30:47.901
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

3065
01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:48.930
<v Speaker 3>if I could do seven,</v>

3066
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I would do seven.</v>

3067
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.720
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I can do maybe 25 in a row or something like that.</v>

3068
01:30:53.721 --> 01:30:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Even if I only do a little bit one day.</v>

3069
01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:57.350
<v Speaker 3>But I always try to look at something,</v>

3070
01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.060
<v Speaker 3>what's a little an hour or something like that.</v>

3071
01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:02.060
<v Speaker 3>But I max out at about four hours at that point.</v>

3072
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:03.980
<v Speaker 3>When I start making mistakes,</v>

3073
01:31:03.981 --> 01:31:05.300
<v Speaker 3>when I start making typos,</v>

3074
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:06.920
<v Speaker 3>then I know it's time to stop.</v>

3075
01:31:06.970 --> 01:31:09.080
<v Speaker 3>And then it's kind of like working out at the gym.</v>

3076
01:31:09.081 --> 01:31:11.000
<v Speaker 3>You can push it too far and then you just,</v>

3077
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:11.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3078
01:31:11.571 --> 01:31:12.620
<v Speaker 3>diminishing returns,</v>

3079
01:31:12.621 --> 01:31:13.454
<v Speaker 3>starting to kick in.</v>

3080
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:14.803
<v Speaker 3>But I do think,</v>

3081
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3082
01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:19.550
<v Speaker 3>physical fitness I think is a real parallel to that to my experience of how I</v>

3083
01:31:19.551 --> 01:31:20.360
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

3084
01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.320
<v Speaker 3>You know that you,</v>

3085
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:25.940
<v Speaker 3>you can get out of shape and you can work yourself back into shape.</v>

3086
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:27.380
<v Speaker 3>And when I've been,</v>

3087
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.860
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

3088
01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.050
<v Speaker 3>when I'm working steadily on something,</v>

3089
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:32.120
<v Speaker 3>I can work longer each day,</v>

3090
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:33.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3091
01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:34.580
<v Speaker 3>and when I haven't,</v>

3092
01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.240
<v Speaker 3>when I've,</v>

3093
01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.410
<v Speaker 3>when I haven't been working,</v>

3094
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:40.880
<v Speaker 3>it's just like going to the gym or trying to run or something you poop out,</v>

3095
01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:41.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3096
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:42.200
<v Speaker 3>you just don't have enough.</v>

3097
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:47.530
<v Speaker 3>But I'm definitely a believer that the muse comes around every day and she wants</v>

3098
01:31:48.351 --> 01:31:50.270
<v Speaker 3>to see you ready to go,</v>

3099
01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:51.350
<v Speaker 3>ready to rock and roll.</v>

3100
01:31:51.370 --> 01:31:52.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3101
01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.720
<v Speaker 3>even if it's only for an hour,</v>

3102
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3103
01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.093
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

3104
01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.950
<v Speaker 1>saint parallels comedy in so many ways because you,</v>

3105
01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you get in comedy shape as well,</v>

3106
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 1>like standup,</v>

3107
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy shape is real.</v>

3108
01:32:02.171 --> 01:32:03.610
<v Speaker 1>It's really critical to get to,</v>

3109
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3110
01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.380
<v Speaker 1>you can get along without it.</v>

3111
01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:08.690
<v Speaker 1>But I've had periods where I've gotten that out of comic shade.</v>

3112
01:32:08.691 --> 01:32:11.530
<v Speaker 1>But even though I'm capable of killing still,</v>

3113
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 1>there can be a moment where it just,</v>

3114
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3115
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.560
<v Speaker 1>this is a little off and it's because I'm not in comedy shape cause I'm not</v>

3116
01:32:17.561 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>doing comedy for five shows a week.</v>

3117
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not doing for,</v>

3118
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do too much because if you get too much it gets boring and you</v>

3119
01:32:24.881 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 1>don't want to ever get to that part.</v>

3120
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So you want to keep the fun alive with it,</v>

3121
01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:32.260
<v Speaker 1>but you definitely want to keep it sharp and when you want to keep it when it's</v>

3122
01:32:32.261 --> 01:32:33.010
<v Speaker 1>sharp,</v>

3123
01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:35.950
<v Speaker 1>then it's like a part of your natural consciousness.</v>

3124
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you plug right into it.</v>

3125
01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.261
<v Speaker 1>You don't go,</v>

3126
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:40.030
<v Speaker 1>oh this is that thing that I used to do.</v>

3127
01:32:40.031 --> 01:32:40.960
<v Speaker 1>How's this go again?</v>

3128
01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just zip your,</v>

3129
01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:43.990
<v Speaker 1>your mind is firing.</v>

3130
01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think that applies to writing as well.</v>

3131
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that that getting into that mindset and,</v>

3132
01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:49.960
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

3133
01:32:49.961 --> 01:32:51.700
<v Speaker 1>when you're there on a regular basis,</v>

3134
01:32:51.701 --> 01:32:52.930
<v Speaker 1>you get in writing shape,</v>

3135
01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:53.591
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3136
01:32:53.591 --> 01:32:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that applies to Jujitsu.</v>

3137
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:56.801
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3138
01:32:56.801 --> 01:32:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I know it does to Jujitsu.</v>

3139
01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:58.871
<v Speaker 1>When I train,</v>

3140
01:32:58.871 --> 01:33:01.000
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not training on a regular basis and I go train,</v>

3141
01:33:01.001 --> 01:33:02.500
<v Speaker 1>even if I'm physically in shape,</v>

3142
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 1>all that extra thinking that I'm starting that I have to do.</v>

3143
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:07.780
<v Speaker 1>If it's not coming completely natural,</v>

3144
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:08.950
<v Speaker 1>it might.</v>

3145
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It might look natural,</v>

3146
01:33:09.971 --> 01:33:11.230
<v Speaker 1>someone who's watching it,</v>

3147
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.350
<v Speaker 1>but to me I'm thinking like an extra one,</v>

3148
01:33:14.351 --> 01:33:16.330
<v Speaker 1>eighth of a second more than I should be.</v>

3149
01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I was in shape I would be thinking at all,</v>

3150
01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:19.541
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

3151
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:20.740
<v Speaker 1>When you're in doing Jujitsu,</v>

3152
01:33:20.741 --> 01:33:22.060
<v Speaker 1>it's just like doing comedy.</v>

3153
01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Just like writing where when you're in it,</v>

3154
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you're in it,</v>

3155
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you just flow,</v>

3156
01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>everything moves together and you're a passenger.</v>

3157
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.100
<v Speaker 1>You're just letting it all happen.</v>

3158
01:33:30.101 --> 01:33:34.750
<v Speaker 1>All your training sort of a manifest itself in the the experience of rolling.</v>

3159
01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

3160
01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:36.780
<v Speaker 6>Back to what you are saying,</v>

3161
01:33:36.781 --> 01:33:37.010
<v Speaker 6>Aubrey,</v>

3162
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:40.470
<v Speaker 6>worry about seeing your higher self and then your mind boy.</v>

3163
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:43.380
<v Speaker 6>How would you apply that to what Joe just said?</v>

3164
01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:43.891
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3165
01:33:43.891 --> 01:33:45.690
<v Speaker 6>the mind boy wants to think about everything.</v>

3166
01:33:45.691 --> 01:33:45.991
<v Speaker 6>Once the,</v>

3167
01:33:45.991 --> 01:33:47.060
<v Speaker 6>think about the moves,</v>

3168
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.910
<v Speaker 6>plan it out,</v>

3169
01:33:47.911 --> 01:33:51.270
<v Speaker 6>think about your opponent or just be distracted and think about what you're</v>

3170
01:33:51.271 --> 01:33:54.600
<v Speaker 6>going to do when you're finished rolling or what you're going to do the next day</v>

3171
01:33:54.601 --> 01:33:59.220
<v Speaker 6>or about some old injury or something like that and you need a kick that guy out</v>

3172
01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.750
<v Speaker 6>and roll with that.</v>

3173
01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:01.733
<v Speaker 6>That presence.</v>

3174
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I play songs in my head when I'm rolling.</v>

3175
01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll sing the entire song.</v>

3176
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3177
01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:06.351
<v Speaker 1>distract,</v>

3178
01:34:06.351 --> 01:34:07.280
<v Speaker 1>distract the mind.</v>

3179
01:34:07.281 --> 01:34:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

3180
01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know what I'm,</v>

3181
01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:09.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's random.</v>

3182
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're ridiculously silly songs,</v>

3183
01:34:14.150 --> 01:34:14.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3184
01:34:14.630 --> 01:34:18.110
<v Speaker 1>and they'll just start playing in my head and I'm going over it while I'm</v>

3185
01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:20.660
<v Speaker 1>rolling cause I won't allow anything else in there.</v>

3186
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like need Dee Dee,</v>

3187
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Dee Dee Dee Dee is.</v>

3188
01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's not a life or death struggle.</v>

3189
01:34:26.271 --> 01:34:26.811
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

3190
01:34:26.811 --> 01:34:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you mount some money and you got them pretty much,</v>

3191
01:34:28.621 --> 01:34:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you just got to cook them and you got to wait until you can tap them.</v>

3192
01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.770
<v Speaker 1>When you're in that sort of a situation like you can,</v>

3193
01:34:33.771 --> 01:34:34.451
<v Speaker 1>you can force it,</v>

3194
01:34:34.451 --> 01:34:34.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3195
01:34:34.701 --> 01:34:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you could lose lose track.</v>

3196
01:34:36.021 --> 01:34:40.670
<v Speaker 1>So I fill up the part of my brain is not required with a song.</v>

3197
01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3198
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:42.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3199
01:34:42.111 --> 01:34:42.440
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

3200
01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.230
<v Speaker 6>Mark Tactic.</v>

3201
01:34:43.230 --> 01:34:44.330
<v Speaker 6>That's a constant battle.</v>

3202
01:34:44.331 --> 01:34:44.541
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3203
01:34:44.541 --> 01:34:45.350
<v Speaker 6>and to me that,</v>

3204
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.561
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3205
01:34:45.561 --> 01:34:47.900
<v Speaker 6>I'm a big proponent of the warrior kind of code,</v>

3206
01:34:47.901 --> 01:34:49.850
<v Speaker 6>the warrior philosophy and you know,</v>

3207
01:34:49.851 --> 01:34:51.890
<v Speaker 6>people think about that in an external sense.</v>

3208
01:34:51.891 --> 01:34:52.041
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3209
01:34:52.041 --> 01:34:53.210
<v Speaker 6>oh well what are you fighting?</v>

3210
01:34:53.211 --> 01:34:53.931
<v Speaker 6>Who are you fighting?</v>

3211
01:34:53.931 --> 01:34:54.764
<v Speaker 6>Who's your enemies?</v>

3212
01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.660
<v Speaker 6>Well that used to maybe make some sense,</v>

3213
01:34:56.661 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 6>but to me the warrior</v>

3214
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:58.610
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

3215
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Speaker 4>it's a constant battle with your own mind,</v>

3216
01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.670
<v Speaker 4>with the parasite of that part of your mind that constantly wants to be active</v>

3217
01:35:04.671 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3218
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:06.900
<v Speaker 4>and that's why you're a wine boy.</v>

3219
01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:07.611
<v Speaker 4>You know the mind.</v>

3220
01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:07.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3221
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.481
<v Speaker 4>The mind boy,</v>

3222
01:35:08.481 --> 01:35:11.240
<v Speaker 4>the parasite is what the total techs call it or there's a lot of different</v>

3223
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.840
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

3224
01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.130
<v Speaker 4>The inauthentic self,</v>

3225
01:35:13.131 --> 01:35:13.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3226
01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:15.140
<v Speaker 4>you could put a lot of different names on that,</v>

3227
01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.170
<v Speaker 4>but a warrior is someone who fights against that resistance,</v>

3228
01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 4>which is another aspect of your mind.</v>

3229
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.210
<v Speaker 4>We know that was the original term for jihad.</v>

3230
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.373
<v Speaker 4>The real g,</v>

3231
01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:29.380
<v Speaker 4>the jihad originally was a fight against your own vices and there was a fight</v>

3232
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:32.270
<v Speaker 4>against your own weaknesses.</v>

3233
01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.800
<v Speaker 4>It became a holy war.</v>

3234
01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:35.990
<v Speaker 4>It was somewhere around the hijacked,</v>

3235
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 4>the Mujahideen and the Soviet Union and the CIA somewhere around that area.</v>

3236
01:35:41.331 --> 01:35:43.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who caused it to change,</v>

3237
01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:46.580
<v Speaker 4>but then it became a term for a holy war.</v>

3238
01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.400
<v Speaker 4>But before it was a holy war was a war against your,</v>

3239
01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:51.800
<v Speaker 4>your own self inadequacies.</v>

3240
01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.440
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a war that we wage every day.</v>

3241
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.861
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3242
01:35:54.861 --> 01:35:55.131
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3243
01:35:55.131 --> 01:35:56.060
<v Speaker 4>and that's the key.</v>

3244
01:35:56.061 --> 01:35:57.380
<v Speaker 4>The key is deciding that,</v>

3245
01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.070
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3246
01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:02.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a warrior and I'm not going to accept that part of myself.</v>

3247
01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:03.561
<v Speaker 4>That is deficient.</v>

3248
01:36:03.561 --> 01:36:04.394
<v Speaker 4>That is lacking,</v>

3249
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:04.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3250
01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:05.564
<v Speaker 4>but still,</v>

3251
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:09.590
<v Speaker 4>and another concept that I think is important is to have what I called ruthless</v>

3252
01:36:09.591 --> 01:36:10.424
<v Speaker 4>self love.</v>

3253
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:14.450
<v Speaker 4>And that's just not this coddling self love of a spoiling grandmother.</v>

3254
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:14.991
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3255
01:36:14.991 --> 01:36:16.070
<v Speaker 4>he eat the candy love.</v>

3256
01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.660
<v Speaker 4>It's that ruthless self love.</v>

3257
01:36:17.661 --> 01:36:19.010
<v Speaker 4>Like this is what's best for you.</v>

3258
01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:20.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking out for you long term.</v>

3259
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:25.040
<v Speaker 4>I want you to thrive in your life and I'm going to give you what you need to</v>

3260
01:36:25.041 --> 01:36:26.660
<v Speaker 4>thrive and nothing else.</v>

3261
01:36:26.661 --> 01:36:27.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3262
01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:28.190
<v Speaker 4>love does not talk.</v>

3263
01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.510
<v Speaker 4>That nice self love is to get up pussy shit.</v>

3264
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:34.270
<v Speaker 4>It makes it a lot of noises.</v>

3265
01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.113
<v Speaker 4>Come on bitch.</v>

3266
01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3267
01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.010
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's,</v>

3268
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:38.210
<v Speaker 4>that's why it's ruthless,</v>

3269
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:38.780
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3270
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.770
<v Speaker 4>But it's not cruel.</v>

3271
01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:40.880
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to be that.</v>

3272
01:36:40.881 --> 01:36:41.601
<v Speaker 4>It's not cruel.</v>

3273
01:36:41.601 --> 01:36:43.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to punish you unnecessarily.</v>

3274
01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:43.701
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3275
01:36:43.701 --> 01:36:45.230

<v Speaker 4>It can happen and then,</v>

3278
01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.281
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

3279
01:36:49.281 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 4>and that's what you got to watch.</v>

3280
01:36:50.481 --> 01:36:51.500
<v Speaker 4>You've got to have that.</v>

3281
01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:52.910
<v Speaker 4>That's the self love part of it.</v>

3282
01:36:52.911 --> 01:36:53.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3283
01:36:53.061 --> 01:36:54.890
<v Speaker 4>the ruthless is that intense.</v>

3284
01:36:54.891 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 4>Like come on,</v>

3285
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:56.340
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>

3286
01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:56.600

01:36:58.130 --> 01:36:59.180
<v Speaker 4>This is what's best for you.</v>

3290
01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:03.630
<v Speaker 4>And then the self love part is not to unnecessarily antagonize yourself because</v>

3291
01:37:03.631 --> 01:37:05.210
<v Speaker 4>we can be brutal to ourselves.</v>

3292
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.631
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3293
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:06.200
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

3294
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.370
<v Speaker 4>who would we allow?</v>

3295
01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Talk as much shit to ourselves as,</v>

3296
01:37:09.731 --> 01:37:10.670
<v Speaker 4>as ourselves.</v>

3297
01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:11.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3298
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:12.230
<v Speaker 4>nobody,</v>

3299
01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3300
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I think this the um,</v>

3301
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.291
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3302
01:37:14.291 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 4>the term self love is a funny one because people do you love yourself?</v>

3303
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:18.583
<v Speaker 4>Don't you?</v>

3304
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.940
<v Speaker 4>You always knew you loved yourself.</v>

3305
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:20.961
<v Speaker 4>You know people.</v>

3306
01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:21.890
<v Speaker 4>There's a weird thing about,</v>

3307
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.191
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3308
01:37:22.191 --> 01:37:23.120
<v Speaker 4>if you don't love yourself,</v>

3309
01:37:23.121 --> 01:37:24.590
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck would anybody else love you?</v>

3310
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 4>You know you should be a a person worthy of your own love.</v>

3311
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.690
<v Speaker 4>And if you're not,</v>

3312
01:37:29.691 --> 01:37:30.524
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it wrong.</v>

3313
01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.491
<v Speaker 4>It's really that simple.</v>

3314
01:37:31.491 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean worship yourself doesn't mean a pretend the or something</v>

3315
01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:35.031
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

3316
01:37:35.031 --> 01:37:35.571
<v Speaker 4>If you're not,</v>

3317
01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:37.820
<v Speaker 4>it means let yourself know when you're not awesome.</v>

3318
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Let yourself know everything you're doing wrong and be completely honest with</v>

3319
01:37:41.301 --> 01:37:41.930
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

3320
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:42.920
<v Speaker 4>And until you do that,</v>

3321
01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:43.850
<v Speaker 4>you're doomed.</v>

3322
01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.000
<v Speaker 4>You're doomed,</v>

3323
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:45.761
<v Speaker 4>you're doomed.</v>

3324
01:37:45.761 --> 01:37:46.670
<v Speaker 4>You know how to get it right.</v>

3325
01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.960
<v Speaker 4>You'd never going to get it right.</v>

3326
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:50.540
<v Speaker 4>If you don't look at yourself the way other people look at you,</v>

3327
01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:51.950
<v Speaker 4>or even more harshly,</v>

3328
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:52.933
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

3329
01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:53.690
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3330
01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 4>and then the other component is forgive yourself for</v>

3331
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.903
<v Speaker 1>these past,</v>

3332
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll rehash these old things that we've done.</v>

3333
01:37:59.341 --> 01:38:03.420
<v Speaker 1>So many are past that becomes new resistance,</v>

3334
01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:07.650
<v Speaker 1>these old past deeds that we're constantly lashing ourselves like way to look at</v>

3335
01:38:07.651 --> 01:38:07.771
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3336
01:38:07.771 --> 01:38:08.604
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>

3337
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:12.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just let yourself know you are not the past.</v>

3338
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.290
<v Speaker 1>You are who you are right now and you could have fucked up your entire life,</v>

3339
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but right now you wake up and the way I always describe it to people,</v>

3340
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 1>pretend that you are a hero in your own movie and the movie just started.</v>

3341
01:38:23.791 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Now your life is in shambles.</v>

3342
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:26.870
<v Speaker 1>What would the hero in the movie do?</v>

3343
01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.440
<v Speaker 1>A movie that you would want to go see?</v>

3344
01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:29.363
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>

3345
01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>How would you get your shit together?</v>

3346
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:32.340
<v Speaker 1>How would the music start picking up?</v>

3347
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 1>How would it sounds?</v>

3348
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.170
<v Speaker 1>It starts sounding like you know the morning and waving at people smiling.</v>

3349
01:38:37.171 --> 01:38:37.681
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>

3350
01:38:37.681 --> 01:38:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you know you're at the gym,</v>

3351
01:38:38.581 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 1>sweating it out.</v>

3352
01:38:39.150 --> 01:38:41.940
<v Speaker 1>You go through this whole montage of scenes with this guy gets his shit</v>

3353
01:38:41.941 --> 01:38:42.480
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3354
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Do all that dummy.</v>

3355
01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:44.881
<v Speaker 1>Do all that.</v>

3356
01:38:44.881 --> 01:38:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Be The hero in your own movie and it starts now.</v>

3357
01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:49.440
<v Speaker 1>You can be a total Lou.</v>

3358
01:38:49.441 --> 01:38:50.274
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

3359
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:53.250
<v Speaker 1>That made the movie will be even better when you turn it all around.</v>

3360
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3361
01:38:53.551 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you used to be a total fucking loser and a liar and a piece of shit.</v>

3362
01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.590
<v Speaker 1>You were fat and lying about it.</v>

3363
01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.870
<v Speaker 1>He had a fucking belly sucker on.</v>

3364
01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:04.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason they like Jared from subway cause he was skinny as whole lot.</v>

3365
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:05.623
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

3366
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:07.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not Michael Phelps,</v>

3367
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3368
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Jared from subway used to be a fat.</v>

3369
01:39:09.621 --> 01:39:10.800
<v Speaker 1>So that's the whole thing.</v>

3370
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think going back to you and your books,</v>

3371
01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:16.920
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that I found really refreshing about your book is that</v>

3372
01:39:16.921 --> 01:39:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you were really honest about how you felt about yourself at that time and that</v>

3373
01:39:20.761 --> 01:39:22.350
<v Speaker 1>you knew you needed to make changes.</v>

3374
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:26.730
<v Speaker 1>And when people read that it inspires people to get things moving.</v>

3375
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Did you know you're going to do that?</v>

3376
01:39:28.351 --> 01:39:28.591
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

3377
01:39:28.591 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 1>when you made that book,</v>

3378
01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:32.220
<v Speaker 1>did you have any idea it was going to have the kind of impact that it's had?</v>

3379
01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3380
01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:33.850
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

3381
01:39:33.850 --> 01:39:34.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3382
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:35.170
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

3383
01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:36.003
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3384
01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:40.240
<v Speaker 3>those little anecdotes that are sort of storage on my shelf of like,</v>

3385
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:40.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3386
01:39:40.511 --> 01:39:42.850
<v Speaker 3>the most excruciating moments that it,</v>

3387
01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:46.450
<v Speaker 3>those are the things that people respond to the most.</v>

3388
01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3389
01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:50.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like the worst shit that you could tell on yourself.</v>

3390
01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:53.290
<v Speaker 3>The more people can relate to it because they've all,</v>

3391
01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:56.050
<v Speaker 3>we've all experienced that same thing ourselves.</v>

3392
01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:57.213
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3393
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.001
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

3394
01:39:58.001 --> 01:39:58.280
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3395
01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.051
<v Speaker 3>I didn't show,</v>

3396
01:39:59.051 --> 01:39:59.741
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have any,</v>

3397
01:39:59.741 --> 01:40:04.741
<v Speaker 3>but this thing has been out since 2002 and it's just slowly one book at a time</v>

3398
01:40:06.041 --> 01:40:07.840
<v Speaker 3>found its way into the,</v>

3399
01:40:07.841 --> 01:40:08.490
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

3400
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:10.230
<v Speaker 1>well now that you were just on Oprah,</v>

3401
01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:12.600
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be on a lot of other people very well.</v>

3402
01:40:12.601 --> 01:40:14.760
<v Speaker 1>That helps a little bit young to Oprah and the mail.</v>

3403
01:40:14.761 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3404
01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:21.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3405
01:40:21.001 --> 01:40:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that what you've done is so important and it's,</v>

3406
01:40:23.461 --> 01:40:24.900
<v Speaker 1>it's helped me tremendously.</v>

3407
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:27.990
<v Speaker 1>It's helped a lot of people that I've put in contact with it.</v>

3408
01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And Aubrey for sure it probably had something to do with him.</v>

3409
01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3410
01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:32.340
<v Speaker 1>starting up on it.</v>

3411
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:33.461
<v Speaker 6>Many of these,</v>

3412
01:40:33.461 --> 01:40:34.750
<v Speaker 6>I mean even turning pro,</v>

3413
01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:35.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3414
01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:36.910
<v Speaker 6>which is very analogous to the war of art.</v>

3415
01:40:36.911 --> 01:40:38.950
<v Speaker 6>And I actually wanted to ask you,</v>

3416
01:40:38.951 --> 01:40:39.191
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3417
01:40:39.191 --> 01:40:40.300
<v Speaker 6>when recommending,</v>

3418
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:41.140
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3419
01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:42.670
<v Speaker 6>between war of art and turning pro,</v>

3420
01:40:42.671 --> 01:40:43.690
<v Speaker 6>what are the distinctions?</v>

3421
01:40:43.691 --> 01:40:47.710
<v Speaker 6>But for me that that turning pro concept was something that I bring with me,</v>

3422
01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:48.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3423
01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.210
<v Speaker 6>every day,</v>

3424
01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:49.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3425
01:40:49.481 --> 01:40:50.230
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

3426
01:40:50.230 --> 01:40:50.800
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

3427
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.420
<v Speaker 6>what is the pro dude today?</v>

3428
01:40:52.450 --> 01:40:52.661
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3429
01:40:52.661 --> 01:40:53.530
<v Speaker 6>the pro in,</v>

3430
01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:57.220
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't screw around his check his emails and look at his Facebook likes.</v>

3431
01:40:57.221 --> 01:40:59.470
<v Speaker 6>The pro goes in to the meat of the problem,</v>

3432
01:40:59.500 --> 01:40:59.861
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3433
01:40:59.861 --> 01:41:03.490
<v Speaker 6>And that helps me kind of prioritize my day as you know,</v>

3434
01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:04.540
<v Speaker 6>CEO of the company.</v>

3435
01:41:04.541 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 6>And the other endeavors that I have to do is like,</v>

3436
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 6>what is the pro do right now?</v>

3437
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:09.160
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3438
01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:09.300
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>

3439
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.080
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like your warrior contracts as well,</v>

3440
01:41:12.081 --> 01:41:12.914
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3441
01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:13.813
<v Speaker 3>What would he do?</v>

3442
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3443
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Do it right.</v>

3444
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:15.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3445
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:16.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do it wrong.</v>

3446
01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:20.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that we see in involved in politics.</v>

3447
01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:22.510
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that we see in,</v>

3448
01:41:22.511 --> 01:41:25.900
<v Speaker 1>in the corporate world and the impact on the environment.</v>

3449
01:41:25.901 --> 01:41:30.010
<v Speaker 1>The corporations are having the impact on societies that they're having by going</v>

3450
01:41:30.011 --> 01:41:31.870
<v Speaker 1>into third world countries and setting up shop.</v>

3451
01:41:31.871 --> 01:41:34.840
<v Speaker 1>And you know what's going on in China were where they're making iPhones and a</v>

3452
01:41:34.841 --> 01:41:37.900
<v Speaker 1>factor that has nets around it to keep people from jumping off the fucking roof.</v>

3453
01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Like there's gotta be a way to do this better.</v>

3454
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:41.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3455
01:41:41.171 --> 01:41:45.280
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line someone put humanity out of the picture,</v>

3456
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:46.690
<v Speaker 1>put morals out of the picture,</v>

3457
01:41:46.691 --> 01:41:50.290
<v Speaker 1>and took advantage of the diffusion of responsibility that comes from people</v>

3458
01:41:50.291 --> 01:41:53.920
<v Speaker 1>acting in gigantic groups where they don't feel responsible for their actions.</v>

3459
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Each individual feels like they're a part of something much bigger than them.</v>

3460
01:41:57.730 --> 01:41:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It's why people don't mind throwing cigarettes out the window.</v>

3461
01:41:59.921 --> 01:42:01.240
<v Speaker 1>They don't even feel responsible.</v>

3462
01:42:01.241 --> 01:42:02.890
<v Speaker 1>They're not throwing a cigarette in their own house.</v>

3463
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:03.641
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

3464
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:05.350
<v Speaker 1>They're not throwing it on the floor of their living room.</v>

3465
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:07.480
<v Speaker 1>They're throwing a cigarette and then someone else is going to deal with.</v>

3466
01:42:07.481 --> 01:42:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Those are plenty of people out there that do that.</v>

3467
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a diffusion of responses.</v>

3468
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Billing.</v>

3469
01:42:10.730 --> 01:42:11.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3470
01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:12.540
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3471
01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Too many fucking people.</v>

3472
01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.900
<v Speaker 1>It all goes back to that.</v>

3473
01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:17.370
<v Speaker 1>We're not designed for this shit.</v>

3474
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.880
<v Speaker 6>So what do you think between the war of art and turning pro?</v>

3475
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:21.121
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3476
01:42:21.121 --> 01:42:22.470
<v Speaker 6>when I'm recommending these books,</v>

3477
01:42:22.471 --> 01:42:25.240
<v Speaker 6>do you still recommend the war of art or what are the distinctions for,</v>

3478
01:42:25.241 --> 01:42:27.390
<v Speaker 6>for different people who want to read one of these books?</v>

3479
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3480
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I think the war of art is probably the one to read first because it was,</v>

3481
01:42:32.831 --> 01:42:34.270
<v Speaker 3>was written first for one thing,</v>

3482
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:39.510
<v Speaker 3>but also it really sort of explains the basic kind of principles of this theory,</v>

3483
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:40.660
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

3484
01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:41.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3485
01:42:41.261 --> 01:42:42.520
<v Speaker 3>what is resistance?</v>

3486
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:43.690
<v Speaker 3>What is an,</v>

3487
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:48.750
<v Speaker 3>and turning pro is sort of the answer my answer to how you deal with this</v>

3488
01:42:48.911 --> 01:42:50.320
<v Speaker 3>negative force in your life.</v>

3489
01:42:50.321 --> 01:42:51.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3490
01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:54.010
<v Speaker 3>rather than blaming yourself or you know,</v>

3491
01:42:54.190 --> 01:42:55.570
<v Speaker 3>passing judgment on yourself,</v>

3492
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:59.110
<v Speaker 3>switch from being an amateur to being a pro,</v>

3493
01:42:59.111 --> 01:43:02.350
<v Speaker 3>which sort of takes the judgment out of it all the self-condemnation out of it</v>

3494
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:03.623
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

3495
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:04.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3496
01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.670
<v Speaker 3>turning pro would be kind of the second one to read.</v>

3497
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:07.390
<v Speaker 3>If God,</v>

3498
01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:10.630
<v Speaker 3>if anybody were asking me why awesome or what order,</v>

3499
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:11.870
<v Speaker 1>what about these books that you gave me?</v>

3500
01:43:11.871 --> 01:43:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Which one of those should I read?</v>

3501
01:43:12.741 --> 01:43:13.061
<v Speaker 1>For us.</v>

3502
01:43:13.061 --> 01:43:13.761
<v Speaker 1>Gates of fire,</v>

3503
01:43:13.761 --> 01:43:14.500
<v Speaker 1>tides of war,</v>

3504
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:15.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3505
01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:16.083
<v Speaker 3>gates of fire,</v>

3506
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:17.580
<v Speaker 3>tides of war is very,</v>

3507
01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:18.550
<v Speaker 3>very difficult.</v>

3508
01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Read.</v>

3509
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.711
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>

3510
01:43:19.711 --> 01:43:20.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm stupid.</v>

3511
01:43:20.161 --> 01:43:21.010
<v Speaker 1>My favorite book.</v>

3512
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:22.200
<v Speaker 1>How dare you it,</v>

3513
01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's a</v>

3514
01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:25.943
<v Speaker 3>Fergal read.</v>

3515
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3516
01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:28.020
<v Speaker 3>I'll open it up and you'll see,</v>

3517
01:43:28.050 --> 01:43:28.410
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3518
01:43:28.410 --> 01:43:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Is it just because of the period of covers or the don't tell me period that it</v>

3519
01:43:33.721 --> 01:43:36.030
<v Speaker 3>covers is a really complex period.</v>

3520
01:43:36.031 --> 01:43:37.050
<v Speaker 3>And also it's a period,</v>

3521
01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:38.213
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3522
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.271
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3523
01:43:39.271 --> 01:43:40.950
<v Speaker 3>it feels sort of like a blowing,</v>

3524
01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3525
01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:43.450
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3526
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:46.870
<v Speaker 3>gates of fire is a really simple story with a good,</v>

3527
01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:47.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3528
01:43:47.311 --> 01:43:51.290
<v Speaker 3>good and evil and it's the kind of story that Sykes people up and you're,</v>

3529
01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:51.831
<v Speaker 3>when you're done,</v>

3530
01:43:51.831 --> 01:43:53.030
<v Speaker 3>you're ready to go out and kill somebody.</v>

3531
01:43:53.031 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3532
01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.650
<v Speaker 3>And it's very,</v>

3533
01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.230
<v Speaker 3>it's a very popular book with a,</v>

3534
01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:00.800
<v Speaker 3>the Marine Corps and with elite military units cause it's about kind of the</v>

3535
01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:01.634
<v Speaker 3>warrior ethos.</v>

3536
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Whereas tides of war is a story that's full of ambiguity and a characters are</v>

3537
01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 3>not right and wrong.</v>

3538
01:44:08.811 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are very flawed.</v>

3539
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of bad stuff goes on.</v>

3540
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:14.180
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard to kind of find,</v>

3541
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:15.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3542
01:44:15.381 --> 01:44:15.831
<v Speaker 3>a character.</v>

3543
01:44:15.831 --> 01:44:17.030
<v Speaker 3>You can really root for that.</v>

3544
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:21.650
<v Speaker 3>But it's much more interesting to me because it really gets into the ambiguity's</v>

3545
01:44:21.651 --> 01:44:22.484
<v Speaker 3>of things,</v>

3546
01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.800
<v Speaker 3>which is the way the world really is.</v>

3547
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:26.143
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3548
01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.130
<v Speaker 3>so read gates of fire first,</v>

3549
01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:29.260
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this then.</v>

3550
01:44:29.261 --> 01:44:29.681
<v Speaker 1>As a,</v>

3551
01:44:29.681 --> 01:44:32.620
<v Speaker 1>as an author and as a creative writer,</v>

3552
01:44:32.650 --> 01:44:33.130
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

3553
01:44:33.130 --> 01:44:36.970
<v Speaker 1>what is it about people that want that good guy,</v>

3554
01:44:37.090 --> 01:44:38.020
<v Speaker 1>bad guy?</v>

3555
01:44:38.021 --> 01:44:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Although the Joseph Campbell stuff,</v>

3556
01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3557
01:44:40.330 --> 01:44:40.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3558
01:44:40.571 --> 01:44:40.801
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3559
01:44:40.801 --> 01:44:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the ancient archetype or the ancient,</v>

3560
01:44:43.361 --> 01:44:44.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3561
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:44.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3562
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:45.360
<v Speaker 1>structure of the,</v>

3563
01:44:45.361 --> 01:44:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the hero tail.</v>

3564
01:44:46.450 --> 01:44:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3565
01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.400
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly Itchio because we're,</v>

3566
01:44:49.670 --> 01:44:53.780
<v Speaker 3>each of us is in a battle with that internal monster,</v>

3567
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:55.610
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is or in our,</v>

3568
01:44:55.611 --> 01:44:56.391
<v Speaker 3>in our real life.</v>

3569
01:44:56.391 --> 01:44:58.790
<v Speaker 3>And we're usually being overwhelmed by that battle.</v>

3570
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.391
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3571
01:44:59.391 --> 01:45:03.950
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand what's going on or where we're flagging in our passion for</v>

3572
01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:04.340
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3573
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.080
<v Speaker 3>So if we can see a great movie,</v>

3574
01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:06.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3575
01:45:06.891 --> 01:45:08.090
<v Speaker 3>where rocky comes out,</v>

3576
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:08.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3577
01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:10.650
<v Speaker 3>hangs in there against Apollo creed or you know,</v>

3578
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:11.563
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

3579
01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.390
<v Speaker 3>we kind of come out of it and it's kind of encouraged us and we say to</v>

3580
01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:14.721
<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>

3581
01:45:14.721 --> 01:45:14.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3582
01:45:14.961 --> 01:45:15.711
<v Speaker 3>it is possible,</v>

3583
01:45:15.711 --> 01:45:16.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3584
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:17.210
<v Speaker 3>if I could suck it up,</v>

3585
01:45:17.211 --> 01:45:17.601
<v Speaker 3>if I could,</v>

3586
01:45:17.601 --> 01:45:17.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3587
01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:18.644
<v Speaker 3>be like a,</v>

3588
01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:19.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3589
01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:20.090
<v Speaker 3>like you were just saying,</v>

3590
01:45:20.091 --> 01:45:21.830
<v Speaker 3>be the hero of the movie of my life,</v>

3591
01:45:21.831 --> 01:45:22.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3592
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:23.120
<v Speaker 3>starting right now.</v>

3593
01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:28.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's why it's a harder sell to do something that's more ambiguous and uh,</v>

3594
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 1>we like our fiction,</v>

3595
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:32.600
<v Speaker 1>like with tidy endings.</v>

3596
01:45:32.601 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Like no country for your off for old man pissed me off.</v>

3597
01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:37.733
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3598
01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:38.611
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight,</v>

3599
01:45:38.611 --> 01:45:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I loved the performances.</v>

3600
01:45:39.901 --> 01:45:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I love the story.</v>

3601
01:45:40.861 --> 01:45:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I love Tommy Lee Jones and w who's the,</v>

3602
01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.431
<v Speaker 1>the guy's name,</v>

3603
01:45:43.431 --> 01:45:44.850
<v Speaker 1>he played the psycho that,</v>

3604
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:46.320
<v Speaker 1>that a Spanish gentleman.</v>

3605
01:45:46.321 --> 01:45:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3606
01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:47.341
<v Speaker 1>whoever he is,</v>

3607
01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:47.430
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3608
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.580
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3609
01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:48.390
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>

3610
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:49.030
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

3611
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:50.580
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing movie.</v>

3612
01:45:50.581 --> 01:45:51.181
<v Speaker 1>And then the end,</v>

3613
01:45:51.181 --> 01:45:51.481
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3614
01:45:51.481 --> 01:45:52.291
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

3615
01:45:52.291 --> 01:45:53.124
<v Speaker 1>Where's the,</v>

3616
01:45:53.190 --> 01:45:54.420
<v Speaker 1>why isn't the bad guy dead?</v>

3617
01:45:54.421 --> 01:45:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't the ending wrapped up that why isn't the good guy walk off with the</v>

3618
01:45:57.361 --> 01:45:57.930
<v Speaker 1>girl?</v>

3619
01:45:57.930 --> 01:45:59.190
<v Speaker 1>What are you selling me?</v>

3620
01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3621
01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I need to see happiness at the end.</v>

3622
01:46:02.881 --> 01:46:03.714
<v Speaker 1>I needed it to be.</v>

3623
01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:07.390
<v Speaker 6>I think that's one of the reasons we liked the spartan so much is because you</v>

3624
01:46:07.391 --> 01:46:09.790
<v Speaker 6>know what the spartan does it every choice.</v>

3625
01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:15.040
<v Speaker 6>There's this bracelet's WWJD which is very ambiguous and confusing.</v>

3626
01:46:15.191 --> 01:46:17.410
<v Speaker 6>If you actually read the Bible like who the hell knows?</v>

3627
01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:17.891
<v Speaker 6>But he does.</v>

3628
01:46:17.891 --> 01:46:19.090
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes he brings his sword.</v>

3629
01:46:19.091 --> 01:46:19.960
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes he doesn't.</v>

3630
01:46:19.961 --> 01:46:20.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3631
01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:22.930
<v Speaker 6>But you know if you said what would a spartan do?</v>

3632
01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.160
<v Speaker 6>The answer is simple.</v>

3633
01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:25.230
<v Speaker 6>You know the guy,</v>

3634
01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:26.373
<v Speaker 6>that's what they do.</v>

3635
01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:27.693
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3636
01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:29.380
<v Speaker 6>but you know the answer.</v>

3637
01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:31.210
<v Speaker 6>Say that a real Sparta.</v>

3638
01:46:32.050 --> 01:46:32.201
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

3639
01:46:32.201 --> 01:46:32.800
<v Speaker 6>What happens?</v>

3640
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.460
<v Speaker 6>They get mad at you.</v>

3641
01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:33.671
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3642
01:46:33.671 --> 01:46:34.121
<v Speaker 6>They don't like,</v>

3643
01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:36.460
<v Speaker 6>they don't like to live in the reality of all that.</v>

3644
01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:37.451
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

3645
01:46:37.451 --> 01:46:39.640
<v Speaker 6>for someone like you who knows the Spartan Code,</v>

3646
01:46:39.641 --> 01:46:41.020
<v Speaker 6>you know the answer is pretty simple.</v>

3647
01:46:41.021 --> 01:46:42.730
<v Speaker 6>You could say what a spartan would do.</v>

3648
01:46:42.731 --> 01:46:45.010
<v Speaker 6>And each one of these situations,</v>

3649
01:46:45.011 --> 01:46:49.060
<v Speaker 6>and that some part of us is admires that because we have such an ambiguous kind</v>

3650
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:49.770
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>

3651
01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

3652
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.800
<v Speaker 1>strict adherence to a code is,</v>

3653
01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:56.140
<v Speaker 3>well we do respond in stories to archetypes,</v>

3654
01:46:56.141 --> 01:46:56.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3655
01:46:56.370 --> 01:47:00.730
<v Speaker 3>Right to the night or the Merlin like character or something like that.</v>

3656
01:47:01.150 --> 01:47:01.983
<v Speaker 3>But of course,</v>

3657
01:47:02.230 --> 01:47:02.891
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we love.</v>

3658
01:47:02.891 --> 01:47:04.870
<v Speaker 3>That's why we love them and stories that gun slinger,</v>

3659
01:47:04.871 --> 01:47:05.351
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

3660
01:47:05.351 --> 01:47:06.520
<v Speaker 3>But of course in real life,</v>

3661
01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:07.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3662
01:47:07.361 --> 01:47:08.290
<v Speaker 3>we're a little bit of this,</v>

3663
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:09.101
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of that.</v>

3664
01:47:09.101 --> 01:47:09.791
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3665
01:47:09.791 --> 01:47:10.624
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite so</v>

3666
01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:11.051
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3667
01:47:11.051 --> 01:47:13.090
<v Speaker 1>we respond to the Samurai when we,</v>

3668
01:47:13.091 --> 01:47:15.580
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that everybody loves.</v>

3669
01:47:15.670 --> 01:47:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to martial arts though,</v>

3670
01:47:17.951 --> 01:47:18.784
<v Speaker 1>the Ronan,</v>

3671
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:19.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3672
01:47:19.181 --> 01:47:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the one lone person who lives by a very strict code and we like to watch them</v>

3673
01:47:23.711 --> 01:47:26.410
<v Speaker 1>practice because we like the watch their discipline and you know,</v>

3674
01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:28.120
<v Speaker 1>like in every Steven Seagal movie,</v>

3675
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:30.310
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a scene where he was practicing.</v>

3676
01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Like there's one where he's in a coma for seven years and it gets out all</v>

3677
01:47:33.451 --> 01:47:33.621
<v Speaker 1>sudden.</v>

3678
01:47:33.621 --> 01:47:36.730
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking running up hills and throwing punches in the Yang.</v>

3679
01:47:36.731 --> 01:47:37.271
<v Speaker 1>Like damn,</v>

3680
01:47:37.271 --> 01:47:38.700
<v Speaker 1>he's back practicing.</v>

3681
01:47:38.710 --> 01:47:42.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like leaving cigarettes out that burn more time underwater.</v>

3682
01:47:42.490 --> 01:47:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Like Dude catching</v>

3683
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:50.780
<v Speaker 1>that Samurai mindset that we know that the Samurai will hold up in combat.</v>

3684
01:47:51.461 --> 01:47:52.294
<v Speaker 1>We know that they won't,</v>

3685
01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.021
<v Speaker 1>that their,</v>

3686
01:47:53.021 --> 01:47:54.970
<v Speaker 1>their character will be bulletproof.</v>

3687
01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.530
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to crumble.</v>

3688
01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3689
01:47:57.150 --> 01:47:57.690
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

3690
01:47:57.690 --> 01:48:02.160
<v Speaker 3>it's an inspiration to us and I think why we like that Samurai,</v>

3691
01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you on that Joe.</v>

3692
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:08.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a Samurai's an individual as opposed to the spark and set or a group or</v>

3693
01:48:08.461 --> 01:48:08.791
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

3694
01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:09.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3695
01:48:09.121 --> 01:48:10.020
<v Speaker 3>other kinds of things.</v>

3696
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:13.470
<v Speaker 3>And because we know that we're alone in the world,</v>

3697
01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:15.360
<v Speaker 3>at least that's how I experience the world.</v>

3698
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:20.580
<v Speaker 3>And so when we can see the Samurai train and have that discipline,</v>

3699
01:48:20.581 --> 01:48:22.950
<v Speaker 3>when there's nobody cracking a whip over his head,</v>

3700
01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:23.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3701
01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.840
<v Speaker 3>nobody's paying him.</v>

3702
01:48:24.841 --> 01:48:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's patting him on the back.</v>

3703
01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:28.440
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's encouraging and he's doing it all entirely.</v>

3704
01:48:28.670 --> 01:48:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Self discipline,</v>

3705
01:48:29.641 --> 01:48:30.570
<v Speaker 3>self generated,</v>

3706
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:31.500
<v Speaker 3>self reinforce,</v>

3707
01:48:31.501 --> 01:48:32.600
<v Speaker 3>self validating.</v>

3708
01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.920
<v Speaker 3>That's very inspiring to us because we say,</v>

3709
01:48:34.921 --> 01:48:35.430
<v Speaker 3>well shit,</v>

3710
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3711
01:48:35.671 --> 01:48:36.504
<v Speaker 3>maybe I can,</v>

3712
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:37.051
<v Speaker 3>I can do it.</v>

3713
01:48:37.051 --> 01:48:38.730
<v Speaker 3>And I can tell from talking to you guys,</v>

3714
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 3>that's how you live your lives.</v>

3715
01:48:40.501 --> 01:48:41.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3716
01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.530
<v Speaker 3>we try to fight that internal battle from the morning.</v>

3717
01:48:43.531 --> 01:48:46.140
<v Speaker 3>You wake up in the minute you wake up through the whole day.</v>

3718
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.490
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I like to,</v>

3719
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I like to train myself,</v>

3720
01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3721
01:48:50.110 --> 01:48:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I write down like,</v>

3722
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:55.230
<v Speaker 1>oh I have a workout routine or write down all the things that have to get done.</v>

3723
01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:55.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3724
01:48:55.711 --> 01:48:57.120
<v Speaker 1>this is all that's going to get done today,</v>

3725
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:57.870
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

3726
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:58.710
<v Speaker 1>This is going to get done.</v>

3727
01:48:58.711 --> 01:48:59.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3728
01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 1>x amount of kettle bell swings,</v>

3729
01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.100
<v Speaker 1>x amount of Chin ups,</v>

3730
01:49:02.101 --> 01:49:04.380
<v Speaker 1>x amount of squats and you're going to do all that.</v>

3731
01:49:04.410 --> 01:49:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to,</v>

3732
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.070
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to say enough already.</v>

3733
01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't allow myself,</v>

3734
01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 1>so I trained myself so I'll write all that stuff down and then I do it.</v>

3735
01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:14.790
<v Speaker 1>But I love that I can motivate myself,</v>

3736
01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.790
<v Speaker 1>that I don't need anybody yelling at me to get all this stuff done.</v>

3737
01:49:17.970 --> 01:49:18.391
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

3738
01:49:18.391 --> 01:49:21.150
<v Speaker 1>that's very important and I think when you could do that,</v>

3739
01:49:21.151 --> 01:49:22.380
<v Speaker 1>like it's so daunting.</v>

3740
01:49:22.410 --> 01:49:26.110
<v Speaker 1>The beginning is so daunting looking at that piece of paper.</v>

3741
01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Do all that shit.</v>

3742
01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Like right now I'm comfortable.</v>

3743
01:49:29.641 --> 01:49:30.474
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

3744
01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:32.340
<v Speaker 1>And then when you just say ready,</v>

3745
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:34.260
<v Speaker 1>go and then force yourself,</v>

3746
01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:34.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3747
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:36.660
<v Speaker 1>it's the ability to create movement,</v>

3748
01:49:36.661 --> 01:49:37.650
<v Speaker 1>the ability to create,</v>

3749
01:49:37.651 --> 01:49:37.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3750
01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:38.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3751
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:39.600
<v Speaker 1>to accomplish goals.</v>

3752
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a,</v>

3753
01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.000
<v Speaker 1>that's an exercise that's uh,</v>

3754
01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 1>something that you exercise.</v>

3755
01:49:43.230 --> 01:49:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Just like creativity,</v>

3756
01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:45.390
<v Speaker 1>just like your ability to write.</v>

3757
01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:47.010
<v Speaker 1>And if the stakes are high too,</v>

3758
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>when you actually</v>

3759
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.180
<v Speaker 6>succeed and you do it,</v>

3760
01:49:49.181 --> 01:49:52.780
<v Speaker 6>you start to build that personal power in that knowing that you can put</v>

3761
01:49:52.781 --> 01:49:54.070
<v Speaker 6>something down and you will do it.</v>

3762
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:56.830
<v Speaker 6>But then if you pull up short or you cheat yourself a little bit,</v>

3763
01:49:56.831 --> 01:49:59.260
<v Speaker 6>you start to build the other ad didn't quite make ah,</v>

3764
01:49:59.261 --> 01:49:59.831
<v Speaker 6>it's okay.</v>

3765
01:49:59.831 --> 01:50:00.101
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3766
01:50:00.101 --> 01:50:00.934
<v Speaker 6>you start to get that,</v>

3767
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:06.030
<v Speaker 6>that weasely Nis about your easily and then so the stakes are higher than just</v>

3768
01:50:06.341 --> 01:50:06.911
<v Speaker 6>that workout.</v>

3769
01:50:06.911 --> 01:50:08.740
<v Speaker 6>If you go out and set out to do something,</v>

3770
01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3771
01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:10.000
<v Speaker 6>you better,</v>

3772
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.170
<v Speaker 6>you better damn do it.</v>

3773
01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:11.561
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3774
01:50:11.561 --> 01:50:12.010
<v Speaker 6>at the end.</v>

3775
01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:14.890
<v Speaker 6>I actually had an experience today and I'd like to play these games with myself</v>

3776
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:15.011
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

3777
01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes it's a full workout.</v>

3778
01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:17.770
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes it's just a set.</v>

3779
01:50:17.771 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 6>And I know,</v>

3780
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 6>cause we were doing this podcast,</v>

3781
01:50:19.601 --> 01:50:22.510
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking back to the warrior ethos and I know one of the things the</v>

3782
01:50:22.511 --> 01:50:24.800
<v Speaker 6>Spartans had to do was they had to run a marathon with a,</v>

3783
01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3784
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:29.350
<v Speaker 6>a mouthful of water and then they had to spit the water back out at the end of</v>

3785
01:50:29.351 --> 01:50:30.184
<v Speaker 6>the marathon.</v>

3786
01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:30.581
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3787
01:50:30.581 --> 01:50:32.080
<v Speaker 6>And that was hard training thing.</v>

3788
01:50:32.081 --> 01:50:32.770
<v Speaker 6>So I was like,</v>

3789
01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:33.760
<v Speaker 6>I've never tried that.</v>

3790
01:50:33.761 --> 01:50:35.950
<v Speaker 6>That seems like it'd be really hard to do.</v>

3791
01:50:35.951 --> 01:50:37.320
<v Speaker 6>So I set up the treadmill,</v>

3792
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3793
01:50:37.930 --> 01:50:41.890
<v Speaker 6>aid and aid and I was doing it to Bata Protocol and which is 20 seconds of</v>

3794
01:50:41.891 --> 01:50:43.480
<v Speaker 6>sprinting and then 10 seconds.</v>

3795
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.790
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3796
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:44.920
<v Speaker 5>Do that with a mouth.</v>

3797
01:50:44.921 --> 01:50:45.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3798
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:47.860
<v Speaker 5>That's on a marathon marathon thing.</v>

3799
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:48.950
<v Speaker 5>I can have a marathon,</v>

3800
01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:49.861
<v Speaker 5>the way hards,</v>

3801
01:50:49.861 --> 01:50:51.050
<v Speaker 5>we're running a full marathon.</v>

3802
01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:52.240
<v Speaker 5>It was that,</v>

3803
01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.560
<v Speaker 5>I would think it'd be way harder to do what you're doing.</v>

3804
01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3805
01:50:55.261 --> 01:50:56.080
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

3806
01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:56.913
<v Speaker 6>well it was,</v>

3807
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.611
<v Speaker 6>and it was,</v>

3808
01:50:57.611 --> 01:50:59.410
<v Speaker 6>and it was a real mentally,</v>

3809
01:50:59.411 --> 01:51:00.690
<v Speaker 6>it was hard to celebrate.</v>

3810
01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:01.331
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3811
01:51:01.331 --> 01:51:01.481
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3812
01:51:01.481 --> 01:51:03.990
<v Speaker 6>I said I was going to do around if I was going to do five Ah,</v>

3813
01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:05.860
<v Speaker 6>and at three I was like,</v>

3814
01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:06.340
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

3815
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:09.850
<v Speaker 6>if I just drank a little bit of this water more comfortable,</v>

3816
01:51:09.851 --> 01:51:10.151
<v Speaker 6>and I said,</v>

3817
01:51:10.151 --> 01:51:10.481
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3818
01:51:10.481 --> 01:51:11.314
<v Speaker 6>like you can't.</v>

3819
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:12.310
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>

3820
01:51:12.311 --> 01:51:13.600
<v Speaker 6>And then at the very end though,</v>

3821
01:51:13.630 --> 01:51:17.710
<v Speaker 6>so I finished my five and the idea was to spit the water back out and then I</v>

3822
01:51:17.711 --> 01:51:18.470
<v Speaker 6>thought to myself,</v>

3823
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

3824
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.061
<v Speaker 6>fuck it.</v>

3825
01:51:19.061 --> 01:51:20.020
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to spit the water back.</v>

3826
01:51:20.021 --> 01:51:20.500
<v Speaker 6>I'll just,</v>

3827
01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:21.221
<v Speaker 6>I'll just drink it.</v>

3828
01:51:21.221 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as I drunk it,</v>

3829
01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:23.163
<v Speaker 6>I knew like</v>

3830
01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:26.590
<v Speaker 5>I missed that little bit of my regimen,</v>

3831
01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:26.880
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3832
01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.240
<v Speaker 5>So I cheated myself.</v>

3833
01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.370
<v Speaker 5>Have a little bit of what that goal was,</v>

3834
01:51:30.371 --> 01:51:34.050
<v Speaker 5>was to run the five and spit the water back out this water that you're just,</v>

3835
01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:35.890
<v Speaker 5>let me help you out here.</v>

3836
01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:36.790
<v Speaker 5>That's silly shit.</v>

3837
01:51:36.930 --> 01:51:38.320
<v Speaker 5>You did what you're supposed to do.</v>

3838
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:39.580
<v Speaker 5>The drinking the water at the end,</v>

3839
01:51:39.581 --> 01:51:40.480
<v Speaker 5>you deserve that water.</v>

3840
01:51:42.730 --> 01:51:44.020
<v Speaker 5>You're absolutely right.</v>

3841
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:46.870
<v Speaker 5>You get a drink water eventually anyway.</v>

3842
01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:49.570
<v Speaker 5>You're not depriving yourself of water.</v>

3843
01:51:49.810 --> 01:51:53.980
<v Speaker 5>The exercise is to get through the exercise with my mouth full of water.</v>

3844
01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:55.180
<v Speaker 5>They're drinking the water,</v>

3845
01:51:55.730 --> 01:51:56.471
<v Speaker 5>the other side,</v>

3846
01:51:56.471 --> 01:51:57.110
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

3847
01:51:57.110 --> 01:52:00.520
<v Speaker 5>your shed to spit the water out the next time when you do split the water out,</v>

3848
01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:02.740
<v Speaker 5>you'll feel and then you're going to get another drink of water.</v>

3849
01:52:02.741 --> 01:52:03.574
<v Speaker 5>There's a fucking drought.</v>

3850
01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:05.410
<v Speaker 5>Why would you do that as a drought going on?</v>

3851
01:52:05.411 --> 01:52:05.800
<v Speaker 5>It's a drink.</v>

3852
01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:06.633
<v Speaker 5>The fucking water.</v>

3853
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.661
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

3854
01:52:07.661 --> 01:52:08.710
<v Speaker 5>Unless you spit into the glass,</v>

3855
01:52:08.711 --> 01:52:10.180
<v Speaker 5>then just drink it and then you're an idiot.</v>

3856
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:11.510
<v Speaker 5>Why don't I just drink it straight?</v>

3857
01:52:11.511 --> 01:52:12.380
<v Speaker 5>He cut out the middleman.</v>

3858
01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:13.263
<v Speaker 5>It's in your mouth or rhythm.</v>

3859
01:52:14.210 --> 01:52:16.720
<v Speaker 5>Long as you get silly argument</v>

3860
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.870
<v Speaker 5>for awhile,</v>

3861
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:22.690
<v Speaker 5>but isn't it funny though that you recognize that there is,</v>

3862
01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:23.200
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3863
01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.410
<v Speaker 5>there's a thing about cutting corners that's really dangerous.</v>

3864
01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:27.670
<v Speaker 5>Cutting corners in life,</v>

3865
01:52:27.671 --> 01:52:30.250
<v Speaker 5>settling in life is fucking dangerous.</v>

3866
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:31.780
<v Speaker 5>It'll lead to the,</v>

3867
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:33.310
<v Speaker 5>it's the road to mediocrity.</v>

3868
01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:34.690
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you guys both here.</v>

3869
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:37.660
<v Speaker 5>Was there a moment for you in your life,</v>

3870
01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:42.760
<v Speaker 5>your lives when you understood this or it's just,</v>

3871
01:52:42.971 --> 01:52:43.804
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>

3872
01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 5>did you not understand this at</v>

3873
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.880
<v Speaker 6>a certain point or have this concept and then you suddenly learned it?</v>

3874
01:52:50.210 --> 01:52:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I learned it slowly but surely through a lifetime of struggle and failure and</v>

3875
01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:58.970
<v Speaker 1>some success and every success cling to it.</v>

3876
01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a new log that you found after you were swimming in the ocean to the</v>

3877
01:53:02.451 --> 01:53:03.620
<v Speaker 1>point where you thought you're going to drown.</v>

3878
01:53:03.621 --> 01:53:04.101
<v Speaker 1>Then boom,</v>

3879
01:53:04.101 --> 01:53:04.934
<v Speaker 1>you find a log.</v>

3880
01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3881
01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:06.321
<v Speaker 1>we got something.</v>

3882
01:53:06.321 --> 01:53:06.591
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3883
01:53:06.591 --> 01:53:10.640
<v Speaker 1>ready and then jump off that log and keep going and make yourself to another log</v>

3884
01:53:10.641 --> 01:53:11.870
<v Speaker 1>that slowly but surely,</v>

3885
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I accumulated all this information along with a lot of books,</v>

3886
01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:16.880
<v Speaker 1>a lot of documentaries,</v>

3887
01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of talking to people that I found inspirational,</v>

3888
01:53:19.581 --> 01:53:21.470
<v Speaker 1>a lot of martial arts,</v>

3889
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.410
<v Speaker 1>a lot of uh,</v>

3890
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:26.400
<v Speaker 1>talking to instructors that explained like what it's about to get through it,</v>

3891
01:53:26.401 --> 01:53:27.380
<v Speaker 1>a hard training session,</v>

3892
01:53:27.381 --> 01:53:28.910
<v Speaker 1>what it's about to achieve your black belt,</v>

3893
01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:30.620
<v Speaker 1>what it's about to be a champion,</v>

3894
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:34.190
<v Speaker 1>what it's about to hit the highest levels and competing.</v>

3895
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Competing was a big one.</v>

3896
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Competing in martial arts as a boy shaped my brain,</v>

3897
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:40.130
<v Speaker 1>shaped who I am as a human being.</v>

3898
01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:44.870
<v Speaker 1>You cannot have any bullshit when you're throwing your bones at people,</v>

3899
01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:45.851
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

3900
01:53:45.851 --> 01:53:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you're in involved in whatever it is.</v>

3901
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:51.650
<v Speaker 1>With some other trained killer and you're both really good at knocking people</v>

3902
01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:52.940
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and you,</v>

3903
01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3904
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 1>you're planning on doing it to each other,</v>

3905
01:53:55.131 --> 01:53:55.970
<v Speaker 1>ready go,</v>

3906
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:57.343
<v Speaker 1>you know your,</v>

3907
01:53:57.370 --> 01:53:59.040
<v Speaker 1>your brain does not accept any bullshit.</v>

3908
01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 1>You have to know exactly who you are and you have to have a very objective</v>

3909
01:54:03.321 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 1>assessment of your abilities.</v>

3910
01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're going to get brained.</v>

3911
01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to get a bone is going to bounce off your head and you're</v>

3912
01:54:10.071 --> 01:54:10.920
<v Speaker 1>going to get concussed.</v>

3913
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like very real consequence that very rarely faces you in everyday life.</v>

3914
01:54:15.831 --> 01:54:18.250
<v Speaker 1>The choices you make very rarely get you cussed.</v>

3915
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:20.570
<v Speaker 1>But when the goal is for someone to knock you out,</v>

3916
01:54:20.571 --> 01:54:21.351
<v Speaker 1>like that's their goal.</v>

3917
01:54:21.351 --> 01:54:24.350
<v Speaker 1>They're trying really hard to do it and you know that that's the goal.</v>

3918
01:54:24.351 --> 01:54:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like one of the worst consequences you can get in everyday life other</v>

3919
01:54:28.911 --> 01:54:29.744
<v Speaker 1>than dying.</v>

3920
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3921
01:54:30.231 --> 01:54:30.371
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3922
01:54:30.371 --> 01:54:31.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a really hard one.</v>

3923
01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:32.691
<v Speaker 1>Your own health,</v>

3924
01:54:32.691 --> 01:54:33.830
<v Speaker 1>your own consciousness,</v>

3925
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you can get knocked the fuck out.</v>

3926
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:40.270
<v Speaker 1>So that reality I think forced me at a very early age to just cut the bullshit.</v>

3927
01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't cut corners,</v>

3928
01:54:42.471 --> 01:54:44.210
<v Speaker 1>look at exactly what it is.</v>

3929
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Do everything you have to do.</v>

3930
01:54:45.981 --> 01:54:47.960
<v Speaker 1>And also along the lines,</v>

3931
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:50.030
<v Speaker 1>learning that every time I didn't,</v>

3932
01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I felt terrible and that I felt weak.</v>

3933
01:54:53.650 --> 01:54:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I felt if I didn't,</v>

3934
01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:54.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3935
01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in shape.</v>

3936
01:54:55.761 --> 01:54:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I felt pathetic.</v>

3937
01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:57.561
<v Speaker 1>Like if I didn't,</v>

3938
01:54:57.561 --> 01:55:01.610
<v Speaker 1>if I got tired in a match and that's why I lost it was unbearable,</v>

3939
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:02.480
<v Speaker 1>unbearable,</v>

3940
01:55:02.481 --> 01:55:05.420
<v Speaker 1>just this stink on me just would never wash off,</v>

3941
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:06.200
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3942
01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:07.033
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

3943
01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.200
<v Speaker 1>that's where I learned</v>

3944
01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.190
<v Speaker 6>good answer for me.</v>

3945
01:55:09.191 --> 01:55:10.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm still learning every,</v>

3946
01:55:10.650 --> 01:55:11.483
<v Speaker 6>every day.</v>

3947
01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:11.651
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3948
01:55:11.651 --> 01:55:12.200
<v Speaker 6>me too.</v>

3949
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:12.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3950
01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:12.761
<v Speaker 6>definitely.</v>

3951
01:55:12.761 --> 01:55:13.151
<v Speaker 6>Me Too.</v>

3952
01:55:13.151 --> 01:55:13.930
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3953
01:55:13.930 --> 01:55:14.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3954
01:55:14.231 --> 01:55:16.990
<v Speaker 6>you think you know and you think you get it and then all of a sudden you'll be</v>

3955
01:55:16.991 --> 01:55:18.400
<v Speaker 6>on this weird path and you'd be like,</v>

3956
01:55:18.730 --> 01:55:20.980
<v Speaker 6>how did I forget so much just now?</v>

3957
01:55:21.730 --> 01:55:22.840
<v Speaker 6>Where am I?</v>

3958
01:55:22.841 --> 01:55:25.360
<v Speaker 6>What is this strange place I find myself in?</v>

3959
01:55:25.361 --> 01:55:27.340
<v Speaker 6>And you have to research it on my beautiful house.</v>

3960
01:55:28.330 --> 01:55:30.820
<v Speaker 6>You have to retrace your steps back and realize that,</v>

3961
01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3962
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:32.590
<v Speaker 6>things go in cycles,</v>

3963
01:55:32.591 --> 01:55:32.831
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3964
01:55:32.831 --> 01:55:34.240
<v Speaker 6>where it's at the top of the cycle.</v>

3965
01:55:34.241 --> 01:55:36.280
<v Speaker 6>You may feel like you have a good grasp,</v>

3966
01:55:36.281 --> 01:55:40.870
<v Speaker 6>but then you'll swing back down again to some lesser state of forgetfulness,</v>

3967
01:55:40.871 --> 01:55:41.560
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>

3968
01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.760
<v Speaker 6>where you have to learn that,</v>

3969
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.261
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3970
01:55:43.261 --> 01:55:46.260
<v Speaker 6>relearn some things back and be reminded of some other things.</v>

3971
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:47.340
<v Speaker 6>But for me,</v>

3972
01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.450
<v Speaker 6>I think the process,</v>

3973
01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:52.260
<v Speaker 6>one of the defining moments for me actually happened from a movie when this</v>

3974
01:55:52.261 --> 01:55:54.660
<v Speaker 6>process was actually when I saw brave heart as a kid.</v>

3975
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:56.880
<v Speaker 6>I remember at that point,</v>

3976
01:55:56.881 --> 01:56:01.881
<v Speaker 6>it really like struck me that the impracticality of going through all that</v>

3977
01:56:02.521 --> 01:56:05.100
<v Speaker 6>torture just to say the word freedom,</v>

3978
01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:05.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3979
01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:06.511
<v Speaker 6>and I started,</v>

3980
01:56:06.511 --> 01:56:08.310
<v Speaker 6>I kind of kind of got,</v>

3981
01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:09.180
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3982
01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 6>well I kinda got that there was something,</v>

3983
01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:11.971
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3984
01:56:11.971 --> 01:56:15.510
<v Speaker 6>something else that some other kind of level that you could push yourself</v>

3985
01:56:15.511 --> 01:56:15.930
<v Speaker 6>through.</v>

3986
01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:18.480
<v Speaker 6>And I remember I would go running and before I would work out and stuff,</v>

3987
01:56:18.481 --> 01:56:19.261
<v Speaker 6>I was an active kid.</v>

3988
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:21.180
<v Speaker 6>I love playing around and loved every sport I could,</v>

3989
01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:21.961
<v Speaker 6>martial arts,</v>

3990
01:56:21.961 --> 01:56:22.680
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3991
01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:26.520
<v Speaker 6>But I was running on the beach and normally when I would have stopped,</v>

3992
01:56:26.521 --> 01:56:27.510
<v Speaker 6>I just didn't stop.</v>

3993
01:56:27.570 --> 01:56:28.200
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

3994
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 6>William Wallace wouldn't have said.</v>

3995
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:31.560
<v Speaker 6>And saw</v>

3996
01:56:33.130 --> 01:56:36.660
<v Speaker 6>some part of me then like some little inkling just planted.</v>

3997
01:56:36.661 --> 01:56:37.030
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

3998
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.530
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3999

01:56:40.051 --> 01:56:40.950
<v Speaker 6>many internal thing.</v>

4003
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:43.020
<v Speaker 6>Carlos cast the native played a big part.</v>

4004
01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:43.770
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4005

<v Speaker 6>some of the Toltec beliefs,</v>

4007
01:56:45.171 --> 01:56:47.010
<v Speaker 6>so many other different things.</v>

4008
01:56:47.011 --> 01:56:47.251
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4009
01:56:47.251 --> 01:56:48.440
<v Speaker 6>your book meeting,</v>

4010
01:56:48.441 --> 01:56:48.610
<v Speaker 6>right</v>

4011
01:56:48.610 --> 01:56:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Joe through the immediate people right now guaranteed or listening to this and</v>

4012
01:56:53.491 --> 01:56:53.881
<v Speaker 1>they're going,</v>

4013
01:56:53.881 --> 01:56:54.151
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

4014
01:56:54.151 --> 01:56:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get my shit together.</v>

4015
01:56:55.710 --> 01:56:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And just that sometimes is all you need.</v>

4016
01:56:57.781 --> 01:57:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Just need a little spark and then nurture that spark,</v>

4017
01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:02.670
<v Speaker 1>turn into a fire.</v>

4018
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what it is.</v>

4019
01:57:04.831 --> 01:57:05.664
<v Speaker 1>It's like we,</v>

4020
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Hunter Thompson had a great,</v>

4021
01:57:07.670 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 1>I saved it on my phone because,</v>

4022
01:57:09.691 --> 01:57:09.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4023
01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4024
01:57:10.130 --> 01:57:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I read it online the other day and it's so poignant and beautiful,</v>

4025
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:15.900
<v Speaker 1>but it was about his,</v>

4026
01:57:15.901 --> 01:57:16.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4027
01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:19.500
<v Speaker 1>the quote was about music and about,</v>

4028
01:57:19.501 --> 01:57:19.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4029
01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:23.970
<v Speaker 1>some people say that music is a inspiration,</v>

4030
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:28.380
<v Speaker 1>but what he says is he says what they really mean is fuel.</v>

4031
01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:30.360
<v Speaker 1>And that I've always needed fuel.</v>

4032
01:57:30.361 --> 01:57:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm a serious consumer on some nights.</v>

4033
01:57:32.461 --> 01:57:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about 50 more</v>

4034
01:57:36.481 --> 01:57:38.430
<v Speaker 1>miles if you have the right music,</v>

4035
01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:39.630
<v Speaker 1>very loud on the radio,</v>

4036
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:40.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4037
01:57:40.921 --> 01:57:42.360
<v Speaker 1>and there's something about that.</v>

4038
01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I find that not just in music,</v>

4039
01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but in conversations like this that I could,</v>

4040
01:57:47.831 --> 01:57:49.680
<v Speaker 1>if I could download this and let's do it as podcast.</v>

4041
01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 1>If I were in a part of it,</v>

4042
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I'd be so fucking psyched.</v>

4043
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing about your book,</v>

4044
01:57:54.151 --> 01:57:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I found it through your book.</v>

4045
01:57:55.141 --> 01:57:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I found it through certain songs I found through movies.</v>

4046
01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I found it through performances of a musicians,</v>

4047
01:58:01.231 --> 01:58:02.220
<v Speaker 1>comedians,</v>

4048
01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:02.981
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

4049
01:58:02.981 --> 01:58:03.251
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4050
01:58:03.251 --> 01:58:03.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4051
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:05.040
<v Speaker 1>it exists everywhere around us.</v>

4052
01:58:05.041 --> 01:58:07.290
<v Speaker 1>And so it's all saw sparks,</v>

4053
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.211
<v Speaker 1>it's all sparked.</v>

4054
01:58:08.211 --> 01:58:10.260
<v Speaker 1>He grabbed those sparks and you make your own fire.</v>

4055
01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:12.670
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

4056
01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:13.750
<v Speaker 6>What are you still learning,</v>

4057
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:14.663
<v Speaker 6>Steve?</v>

4058
01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:15.543
<v Speaker 3>Same stuff.</v>

4059
01:58:15.850 --> 01:58:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Same stuff.</v>

4060
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

4061
01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:17.793
<v Speaker 3>Never stops.</v>

4062
01:58:18.130 --> 01:58:19.870
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking listening to you guys,</v>

4063
01:58:19.871 --> 01:58:20.111
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4064
01:58:20.111 --> 01:58:22.540
<v Speaker 3>my experience was not like in martial arts or something.</v>

4065
01:58:22.541 --> 01:58:22.811
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>

4066
01:58:22.811 --> 01:58:24.280
<v Speaker 3>it was more in,</v>

4067
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:27.040
<v Speaker 3>in writing day to day of,</v>

4068
01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:29.050
<v Speaker 3>would I fuck off today?</v>

4069
01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:30.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4070
01:58:30.010 --> 01:58:31.510
<v Speaker 3>would I drop the ball today?</v>

4071
01:58:31.511 --> 01:58:32.291
<v Speaker 3>Would I stop?</v>

4072
01:58:32.291 --> 01:58:32.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4073
01:58:32.501 --> 01:58:33.160
<v Speaker 3>or like Abra,</v>

4074
01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.050
<v Speaker 3>you were saying you'd running a little farther on the beach.</v>

4075
01:58:35.051 --> 01:58:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Like what would we have Mollis do you know?</v>

4076
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4077
01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:39.790
<v Speaker 3>can I push myself a little farther?</v>

4078
01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Or even the idea of like whipping yourself or anything like that.</v>

4079
01:58:43.871 --> 01:58:44.790
<v Speaker 3>The idea of like,</v>

4080
01:58:44.791 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4081
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:46.340
<v Speaker 3>being kind to yourself,</v>

4082
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 3>be gentle to yourself.</v>

4083
01:58:47.351 --> 01:58:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're training a thoroughbred racehorse,</v>

4084
01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:52.120
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to beat the crap out of that horse.</v>

4085
01:58:52.121 --> 01:58:53.440
<v Speaker 3>You're going to make it fun for that horse.</v>

4086
01:58:53.441 --> 01:58:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4087
01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4088
01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:55.660
<v Speaker 3>So to do that,</v>

4089
01:58:55.661 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 3>and like you were saying,</v>

4090
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:56.791
<v Speaker 3>Jill,</v>

4091
01:58:56.791 --> 01:58:57.100
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4092
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.140
<v Speaker 3>you find a log that's floating.</v>

4093
01:58:59.710 --> 01:59:00.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4094
01:59:00.250 --> 01:59:01.840
<v Speaker 3>this worked today.</v>

4095
01:59:01.841 --> 01:59:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I did this,</v>

4096
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:04.900
<v Speaker 3>it worked here in is the end of the day.</v>

4097
01:59:04.901 --> 01:59:05.734
<v Speaker 3>I feel good.</v>

4098
01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:08.410
<v Speaker 3>So tomorrow let me try to do that again.</v>

4099
01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4100
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:09.760
<v Speaker 3>And then you don't,</v>

4101
01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you don't quite succeed,</v>

4102
01:59:10.841 --> 01:59:11.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4103
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 3>but then you find another log and little by little you put those logs together</v>

4104
01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:19.090
<v Speaker 3>and truth start to form in your mind or this works,</v>

4105
01:59:19.091 --> 01:59:20.020
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't work.</v>

4106
01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:21.820
<v Speaker 3>And then also like you guys say,</v>

4107
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:22.840
<v Speaker 3>you get it from other people.</v>

4108
01:59:22.841 --> 01:59:23.710
<v Speaker 3>You get it from books,</v>

4109
01:59:23.711 --> 01:59:24.910
<v Speaker 3>you get it from conversations,</v>

4110
01:59:24.911 --> 01:59:25.750
<v Speaker 3>you get it from music.</v>

4111
01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:27.310
<v Speaker 3>It reinforces itself.</v>

4112
01:59:27.311 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Like this conversation now is reinforcing it for me.</v>

4113
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:32.170
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure it's reinforcing it for you guys too.</v>

4114
01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:37.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like what's interesting to me is it doesn't matter what pursuit you're in,</v>

4115
01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:39.880
<v Speaker 3>the laws seem to be the same.</v>

4116
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:41.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4117
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that if we had a,</v>

4118
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:43.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4119
01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.290
<v Speaker 3>a weaver in here or a potter or somebody,</v>

4120
01:59:47.291 --> 01:59:47.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4121
01:59:47.711 --> 01:59:49.000
<v Speaker 3>that made furniture,</v>

4122
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:50.740
<v Speaker 3>they would say the exact same thing.</v>

4123
01:59:50.741 --> 01:59:50.981
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4124
01:59:50.981 --> 01:59:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I get a piece of wood in and that piece of wood is telling me it wants to be a</v>

4125
01:59:54.911 --> 01:59:55.740
<v Speaker 3>couch,</v>

4126
01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:56.290
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4127
01:59:56.290 --> 01:59:57.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4128
01:59:58.330 --> 02:00:00.580
<v Speaker 3>so it's interesting that there,</v>

4129
02:00:00.850 --> 02:00:05.590
<v Speaker 3>there are laws and we're just sort of learning them and uncovering them as we</v>

4130
02:00:05.591 --> 02:00:05.830
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

4131
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:06.221
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

4132
02:00:06.221 --> 02:00:10.120
<v Speaker 4>this is what Musashi spoke of and this is one of the things that Musashi,</v>

4133
02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:10.973
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4134
02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:16.000
<v Speaker 4>put put in his book where he described his pursuit of calligraphy,</v>

4135
02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:17.950
<v Speaker 4>his pursuit of poetry,</v>

4136
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.261
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4137
02:00:18.261 --> 02:00:19.094
<v Speaker 3>There are</v>

4138
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:20.990
<v Speaker 4>disciplines in,</v>

4139
02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:22.200
<v Speaker 4>in a pursuit of,</v>

4140
02:00:22.201 --> 02:00:23.900
<v Speaker 4>of when you're writing poetry,</v>

4141
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:26.070
<v Speaker 4>when you're drawing something or painting something,</v>

4142
02:00:26.250 --> 02:00:29.040
<v Speaker 4>you're still trying to get at that same source,</v>

4143
02:00:29.041 --> 02:00:30.360
<v Speaker 4>that pure source,</v>

4144
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:31.740
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

4145
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:36.950
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a cartoon or whether it's a Steven Pressfield novel about Greek</v>

4146
02:00:36.961 --> 02:00:37.794
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

4147
02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.761
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

4148
02:00:38.761 --> 02:00:39.810
<v Speaker 4>it's the same thing.</v>

4149
02:00:39.811 --> 02:00:40.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

4150
02:00:40.530 --> 02:00:44.220
<v Speaker 4>it's this weird creating energy that you're trying to tap in.</v>

4151
02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.220
<v Speaker 3>It's getting rid of that mind boy and getting it to the,</v>

4152
02:00:47.221 --> 02:00:47.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4153
02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.410
<v Speaker 3>the higher nobler set.</v>

4154
02:00:50.230 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 4>What's the,</v>

4155
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:52.120
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is the mind boy?</v>

4156
02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:54.330
<v Speaker 4>Therefore though is he doesn't need do something good.</v>

4157
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:55.600
<v Speaker 4>He's good at solving puzzles,</v>

4158
02:00:55.930 --> 02:00:56.621
<v Speaker 4>is what he's good at.</v>

4159
02:00:56.621 --> 02:00:57.281
<v Speaker 4>He's good at pool.</v>

4160
02:00:57.281 --> 02:00:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Is He,</v>

4161
02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.020
<v Speaker 4>is he what makes you play pool?</v>

4162
02:00:59.080 --> 02:00:59.891
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to pull it,</v>

4163
02:00:59.891 --> 02:01:00.470
<v Speaker 4>but he's good.</v>

4164
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.890
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna,</v>

4165
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:01.810
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna doing,</v>

4166
02:01:01.811 --> 02:01:02.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4167
02:01:02.110 --> 02:01:02.760
<v Speaker 4>doing the,</v>

4168
02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:05.980
<v Speaker 4>the mechanistic puzzle work of the human life,</v>

4169
02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:06.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4170
02:01:06.371 --> 02:01:07.510
<v Speaker 4>figuring things out,</v>

4171
02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.040
<v Speaker 4>putting on different masks,</v>

4172
02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:10.480
<v Speaker 4>socially adapting,</v>

4173
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:11.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4174
02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:13.360
<v Speaker 4>modifying behavior in a certain way.</v>

4175
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I was call that the ego as opposed to the shelf shelf with the capital Ash.</v>

4176
02:01:18.130 --> 02:01:18.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4177
02:01:18.461 --> 02:01:19.294
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

4178
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:20.381
<v Speaker 3>it's in,</v>

4179
02:01:20.381 --> 02:01:25.381
<v Speaker 3>maybe we're talking about tribal ways and and seeing those mysterious worlds and</v>

4180
02:01:25.901 --> 02:01:26.471
<v Speaker 3>all that other thing.</v>

4181
02:01:26.471 --> 02:01:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the self and somehow when we became civilized,</v>

4182
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:36.000
<v Speaker 3>we shrunk it down to to the ego that knows how to build a wall or something like</v>

4183
02:01:37.421 --> 02:01:39.440
<v Speaker 3>that but doesn't know how to access.</v>

4184
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.430
<v Speaker 3>And then what,</v>

4185
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:45.230
<v Speaker 3>what you guys are talking about when I'm talking about is breaking through those</v>

4186
02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:49.670
<v Speaker 3>walls and trying to get even for just a minute at a time to that,</v>

4187
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:52.190
<v Speaker 3>that thing that's got some magic to it.</v>

4188
02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:53.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4189
02:01:53.251 --> 02:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Creating and I feel bad for people who don't get it create.</v>

4190
02:01:56.130 --> 02:01:56.963
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

4191
02:01:57.230 --> 02:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Whether W I mean even if it's creating,</v>

4192
02:01:59.041 --> 02:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>like at your job,</v>

4193
02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:00.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4194
02:02:00.781 --> 02:02:01.201
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a,</v>

4195
02:02:01.201 --> 02:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you're a carpenter or you know,</v>

4196
02:02:03.091 --> 02:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>someone who puts things together.</v>

4197
02:02:04.770 --> 02:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about making something that wasn't there before and now</v>

4198
02:02:08.641 --> 02:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

4199
02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that,</v>

4200
02:02:10.201 --> 02:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>whether it's even just a performance or you know,</v>

4201
02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>a song or whatever.</v>

4202
02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that.</v>

4203
02:02:14.491 --> 02:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the few magical things in life.</v>

4204
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:17.071
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4205
02:02:17.071 --> 02:02:17.570
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

4206
02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:18.740
<v Speaker 3>what God does,</v>

4207
02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:19.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4208
02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly create.</v>

4209
02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:23.270
<v Speaker 3>So we as human beings when we can do that,</v>

4210
02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:24.673
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty cool.</v>

4211
02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:24.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4212
02:02:24.891 --> 02:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>But you're also creates nuclear bombs,</v>

4213
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4214
02:02:27.321 --> 02:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>creating also meant what Oppenheimer did,</v>

4215
02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:29.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4216
02:02:29.961 --> 02:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>it's all creating.</v>

4217
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4218
02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>that's creating as well.</v>

4219
02:02:32.361 --> 02:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very strange thing that what you drop out of the Enola gay that kills</v>

4220
02:02:36.261 --> 02:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>a half a million people.</v>

4221
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>That's creative too.</v>

4222
02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:40.803
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of implied.</v>

4223
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:42.020
<v Speaker 6>It's almost there.</v>

4224
02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:44.780
<v Speaker 6>That destructive force is also part of,</v>

4225
02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:45.151
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4226
02:02:45.151 --> 02:02:46.340
<v Speaker 6>is part of the creation.</v>

4227
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:46.671
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4228
02:02:46.671 --> 02:02:47.920
<v Speaker 6>I was talking to someone who,</v>

4229
02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:50.270
<v Speaker 6>who I really respect and I was asking him about,</v>

4230
02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:50.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4231
02:02:50.871 --> 02:02:51.704
<v Speaker 6>that kind of,</v>

4232
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:52.580
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4233
02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:53.920
<v Speaker 6>the demon force,</v>

4234
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:56.000
<v Speaker 6>that purely destructive force.</v>

4235
02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:58.760
<v Speaker 6>And it doesn't have to be an actual angel or demon,</v>

4236
02:02:58.761 --> 02:02:59.031
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4237
02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:00.830
<v Speaker 6>kind of conceptualize religiously,</v>

4238
02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.440
<v Speaker 6>but whatever that destructive forces,</v>

4239
02:03:03.441 --> 02:03:04.280
<v Speaker 6>it's tapped in and,</v>

4240
02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:05.840
<v Speaker 6>and he's basically saying that,</v>

4241
02:03:05.841 --> 02:03:06.081
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4242
02:03:06.081 --> 02:03:07.430
<v Speaker 6>when that's really high,</v>

4243
02:03:07.431 --> 02:03:07.910
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

4244
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:09.260
<v Speaker 6>it's just doing its job.</v>

4245
02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:09.830
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4246
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 6>there has to be that,</v>

4247
02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 6>that opposing force from which creation can push forward.</v>

4248
02:03:15.471 --> 02:03:16.304
<v Speaker 6>It's strength,</v>

4249
02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:16.821
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4250
02:03:16.821 --> 02:03:17.750
<v Speaker 6>And so yeah,</v>

4251
02:03:17.751 --> 02:03:18.081
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

4252
02:03:18.081 --> 02:03:21.710
<v Speaker 6>these nuclear bombs do it in a dramatic and terrifying way.</v>

4253
02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:25.520
<v Speaker 6>But that's one opposing force by which you know,</v>

4254
02:03:25.521 --> 02:03:27.890
<v Speaker 6>you can try and flourish life in spite of,</v>

4255
02:03:27.891 --> 02:03:28.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4256
02:03:28.131 --> 02:03:30.770
<v Speaker 6>so there's some kind of weird harmony in,</v>

4257
02:03:30.771 --> 02:03:33.860
<v Speaker 6>in all of that that was created in the soup to begin with.</v>

4258
02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.131
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4259
02:03:34.131 --> 02:03:36.500
<v Speaker 6>everything has to be find the balance,</v>

4260
02:03:36.501 --> 02:03:41.501
<v Speaker 6>but I do think that we get way off balance one way or the other in certain ass.</v>

4261
02:03:41.641 --> 02:03:42.620
<v Speaker 6>And you see that in people.</v>

4262
02:03:42.621 --> 02:03:43.940
<v Speaker 6>And I think the key is,</v>

4263
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:44.803
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4264
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:45.830
<v Speaker 6>you can really only,</v>

4265
02:03:45.831 --> 02:03:47.330
<v Speaker 6>there's only one corner of the universe.</v>

4266
02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:48.980
<v Speaker 6>You can be sure to change.</v>

4267
02:03:48.981 --> 02:03:50.660
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's a quote from,</v>

4268
02:03:50.661 --> 02:03:51.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4269
02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.130
<v Speaker 6>from Huxley actually.</v>

4270
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:55.270
<v Speaker 6>And that's yourself and that's what you can be sure to change.</v>

4271
02:03:55.271 --> 02:03:56.990
<v Speaker 6>So bringing yourself back into balance,</v>

4272
02:03:57.260 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 6>everybody does that.</v>

4273
02:03:58.730 --> 02:03:59.420
<v Speaker 6>Guess what?</v>

4274
02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.680
<v Speaker 6>The world's back in balance,</v>

4275
02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:01.161
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4276
02:04:01.161 --> 02:04:02.210
<v Speaker 6>so you can be sure,</v>

4277
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.601
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4278
02:04:02.601 --> 02:04:05.030
<v Speaker 6>take that step to get yourself in balance.</v>

4279
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:08.930
<v Speaker 6>And then slowly all these other things will start to lay out the dominoes.</v>

4280
02:04:08.931 --> 02:04:09.260
<v Speaker 6>Will,</v>

4281
02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:12.010
<v Speaker 6>I want to ask you a question about writing.</v>

4282
02:04:12.190 --> 02:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you have when you start writing and you have an idea,</v>

4283
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>like I'm reading Stephen King's book on writing.</v>

4284
02:04:19.450 --> 02:04:20.283
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

4285
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4286
02:04:20.630 --> 02:04:21.251
<v Speaker 1>really good book.</v>

4287
02:04:21.251 --> 02:04:21.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4288
02:04:21.371 --> 02:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he said that I found was incredibly fascinating is</v>

4289
02:04:24.431 --> 02:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't make a plot before he gets going.</v>

4290
02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>He might have some ideas,</v>

4291
02:04:28.810 --> 02:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>but he creates the characters.</v>

4292
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>He uh,</v>

4293
02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>he starts writing their dialogue and then what they do is up to them and then</v>

4294
02:04:36.551 --> 02:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

4295
02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>shit just goes down.</v>

4296
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:38.461
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4297
02:04:38.461 --> 02:04:42.000
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible when you think about the plots of someone's Stephen King's</v>

4298
02:04:42.001 --> 02:04:42.301
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

4299
02:04:42.301 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>especially with the gunslinger and you know,</v>

4300
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>the state what you,</v>

4301
02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>that just came out of your head.</v>

4302
02:04:47.941 --> 02:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't even plot that out.</v>

4303
02:04:49.361 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's crazy.</v>

4304
02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you plot your stuff out?</v>

4305
02:04:52.411 --> 02:04:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like a cork board where you put like index cards on it and you move</v>

4306
02:04:56.371 --> 02:04:57.480
<v Speaker 1>them around or how do you,</v>

4307
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:58.343
<v Speaker 1>how do you write?</v>

4308
02:04:58.390 --> 02:05:00.400
<v Speaker 3>I do sort of,</v>

4309
02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:02.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to do that eventually.</v>

4310
02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Scribner.</v>

4311
02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:04.490
<v Speaker 1>You ever tried that?</v>

4312
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.731
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4313
02:05:04.731 --> 02:05:05.511
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that.</v>

4314
02:05:05.511 --> 02:05:06.140
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of stuff.</v>

4315
02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't do anything on a,</v>

4316
02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:08.353
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>

4317
02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:08.811
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

4318
02:05:08.811 --> 02:05:09.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4319
02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:10.153
<v Speaker 1>one of those</v>

4320
02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:10.910
<v Speaker 3>programs.</v>

4321
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:15.300
<v Speaker 3>It shows you a corkboard and it lets you move index cards around virtual</v>

4322
02:05:15.301 --> 02:05:15.691
<v Speaker 3>corkboard.</v>

4323
02:05:15.691 --> 02:05:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4324
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:18.630
<v Speaker 3>that's a little too much mechanical for me.</v>

4325
02:05:19.050 --> 02:05:21.090
<v Speaker 3>But I do try to,</v>

4326
02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:26.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of times I will start purely on instinct and just take it from</v>

4327
02:05:27.061 --> 02:05:27.894
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

4328
02:05:27.930 --> 02:05:30.900
<v Speaker 3>But I think I'm always asking myself,</v>

4329
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:31.950
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>

4330
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:32.910
<v Speaker 3>what's the finish?</v>

4331
02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.770
<v Speaker 3>What is this going to,</v>

4332
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:35.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4333
02:05:35.011 --> 02:05:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm always trying to get the final moment,</v>

4334
02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.830
<v Speaker 3>the climax and then work backwards from there.</v>

4335
02:05:41.130 --> 02:05:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Cause within any idea,</v>

4336
02:05:45.930 --> 02:05:46.320
<v Speaker 3>how can I,</v>

4337
02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:46.800
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

4338
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4339
02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:49.380
<v Speaker 3>one of the books I wrote was about,</v>

4340
02:05:49.381 --> 02:05:50.214
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4341
02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:54.060
<v Speaker 3>it's called the virtues of war was about Alexander the Great and the way it kind</v>

4342
02:05:54.061 --> 02:05:58.710
<v Speaker 3>of came to me was the first two sentences came to me in this first two sentences</v>

4343
02:05:58.711 --> 02:06:01.260
<v Speaker 3>were I have always been a soldier.</v>

4344
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I have known no other life.</v>

4345
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:04.260
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

4346
02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:05.650
<v Speaker 3>when I heard those in my head of style,</v>

4347
02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:06.090
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

4348
02:06:06.090 --> 02:06:06.923
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

4349
02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:11.730
<v Speaker 3>But I had no idea who was saying it or where it went.</v>

4350
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:12.750
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

4351
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:17.750
<v Speaker 3>so it in a way it's like a finding that the tip tippy top part of a buried</v>

4352
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:21.630
<v Speaker 3>asteroid or something.</v>

4353
02:06:22.230 --> 02:06:26.520
<v Speaker 3>So I sort of tried to just partly foe follow instinct and say,</v>

4354
02:06:26.521 --> 02:06:26.911
<v Speaker 3>well okay,</v>

4355
02:06:26.911 --> 02:06:27.780
<v Speaker 3>what's the next sentence?</v>

4356
02:06:27.781 --> 02:06:28.021
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4357
02:06:28.021 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 3>what's the next scene but at this then I'll kind of pull back out of it and say,</v>

4358
02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:35.940
<v Speaker 3>what is his fucking thing about why,</v>

4359
02:06:36.210 --> 02:06:37.440
<v Speaker 3>what is buried,</v>

4360
02:06:37.441 --> 02:06:40.080
<v Speaker 3>what id is buried in those two sentences?</v>

4361
02:06:40.530 --> 02:06:41.363
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

4362
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:42.330
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll try to,</v>

4363
02:06:42.690 --> 02:06:43.810
<v Speaker 3>is this making any sense?</v>

4364
02:06:44.970 --> 02:06:47.400
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll try to push it forward to the finish.</v>

4365
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.470
<v Speaker 3>What's the climax of this thing?</v>

4366
02:06:49.890 --> 02:06:54.890
<v Speaker 3>And cause otherwise I think maybe Stephen King is a genius and he can just kind</v>

4367
02:06:54.931 --> 02:06:58.230
<v Speaker 3>of plunge in and just throw shit against the wall and it'll stick.</v>

4368
02:06:58.710 --> 02:07:00.120
<v Speaker 3>But I think most of us,</v>

4369
02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:00.691
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

4370
02:07:00.691 --> 02:07:02.310
<v Speaker 3>I'll get lost if I,</v>

4371
02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:03.060
<v Speaker 3>if I do that,</v>

4372
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:03.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4373
02:07:03.570 --> 02:07:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll just write this scene and that scene.</v>

4374
02:07:05.041 --> 02:07:05.730
<v Speaker 3>The other scene and,</v>

4375
02:07:05.730 --> 02:07:06.331
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

4376
02:07:06.331 --> 02:07:07.164
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

4377
02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:07.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4378
02:07:07.681 --> 02:07:08.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll get lost in it.</v>

4379
02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:12.600
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of need to know if my sailboat is hidden for Tahiti.</v>

4380
02:07:13.110 --> 02:07:14.070
<v Speaker 3>That helps me a lot.</v>

4381
02:07:14.071 --> 02:07:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Then I know I got to go south of Hawaii and you know,</v>

4382
02:07:16.411 --> 02:07:19.560
<v Speaker 3>north of Ltd is so,</v>

4383
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:20.543
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4384
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:21.361
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

4385
02:07:21.361 --> 02:07:21.901
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

4386
02:07:21.901 --> 02:07:25.290
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a combination of instinct and just winging it,</v>

4387
02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:29.400
<v Speaker 3>but also then pulling back to the left brain and asking,</v>

4388
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:30.600
<v Speaker 3>what's this about,</v>

4389
02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:31.830
<v Speaker 3>where's it going?</v>

4390
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.690
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4391
02:07:32.690 --> 02:07:34.890
<v Speaker 3>and then structuring it back from,</v>

4392
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that</v>

4393
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:36.873
<v Speaker 1>answers your question.</v>

4394
02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4395
02:07:37.991 --> 02:07:38.131
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4396
02:07:38.131 --> 02:07:38.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4397
02:07:38.370 --> 02:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting cause he didn't go too far into depth as far as what I've read</v>

4398
02:07:41.891 --> 02:07:42.970
<v Speaker 1>at least that,</v>

4399
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:43.833
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4400
02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>he died,</v>

4401
02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>

4402
02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:45.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4403
02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:49.180
<v Speaker 1>along the way he writes things down or sets up an ending along the way,</v>

4404
02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:50.133
<v Speaker 1>or he might,</v>

4405
02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those,</v>

4406
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:52.510
<v Speaker 1>he might fucking write the ending first.</v>

4407
02:07:52.511 --> 02:07:52.961
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4408
02:07:52.961 --> 02:07:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

4409
02:07:53.650 --> 02:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

4410
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:58.240
<v Speaker 1>But his point being is that when he's writing,</v>

4411
02:07:58.241 --> 02:07:58.960
<v Speaker 1>he's just sort of,</v>

4412
02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:00.100
<v Speaker 1>he's not following,</v>

4413
02:08:00.250 --> 02:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>like today he's going to write down that Sally meets Betty and Betty can let on</v>

4414
02:08:05.070 --> 02:08:05.950
<v Speaker 1>fire with her tits.</v>

4415
02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:07.251
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4416
02:08:07.251 --> 02:08:09.260
<v Speaker 3>if you have the idea of Kerry,</v>

4417
02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:09.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4418
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:12.530
<v Speaker 3>You know that the climax is going to be Carrie,</v>

4419
02:08:12.531 --> 02:08:12.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4420
02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:14.300
<v Speaker 3>blows everybody away.</v>

4421
02:08:14.301 --> 02:08:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4422
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4423
02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:19.850
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have to be to analytic to figure that out.</v>

4424
02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:21.170
<v Speaker 3>So we kind of knows what's coming.</v>

4425
02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

4426
02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:22.181
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

4427
02:08:22.181 --> 02:08:23.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe he might not have known that that was gonna.</v>

4428
02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:27.340
<v Speaker 1>You know the carry one's a really interesting one because he was throwing that</v>

4429
02:08:27.341 --> 02:08:29.230
<v Speaker 1>away and his wife pulled it out of the trash.</v>

4430
02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:29.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4431
02:08:29.471 --> 02:08:30.304
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

4432
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4433
02:08:31.110 --> 02:08:31.350
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4434
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:32.740
<v Speaker 1>that was his first big break.</v>

4435
02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:34.450
<v Speaker 1>His wife pulled it out of the trash.</v>

4436
02:08:34.451 --> 02:08:34.901
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

4437
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:35.231
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

4438
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:35.530
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

4439
02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:36.430
<v Speaker 1>don't quit this one.</v>

4440
02:08:36.431 --> 02:08:38.290
<v Speaker 1>But that goes to show you though.</v>

4441
02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4442
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 3>final power.</v>

4443
02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:43.700
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times we don't even recognize what great stuff.</v>

4444
02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

4445
02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:44.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4446
02:08:44.441 --> 02:08:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it's also probably because he was drunk and on Coke and his dad as well.</v>

4447
02:08:48.210 --> 02:08:49.043
<v Speaker 1>You can use it.</v>

4448
02:08:49.230 --> 02:08:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4449
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:50.550
<v Speaker 1>he may be the option.</v>

4450
02:08:50.551 --> 02:08:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he was sober.</v>

4451
02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:53.470
<v Speaker 1>He goes off about his,</v>

4452
02:08:53.471 --> 02:08:53.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4453
02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:56.770
<v Speaker 1>his massive amount of drug use when he was writing books.</v>

4454
02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 1>He wrote entire books that he doesn't remember at all.</v>

4455
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Cujo apparently it doesn't remember at all.</v>

4456
02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:04.671
<v Speaker 1>Has Your money.</v>

4457
02:09:04.671 --> 02:09:05.900
<v Speaker 1>You can read it for the first time.</v>

4458
02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:07.553
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

4459
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:08.663
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>

4460
02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

4461
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Talk about a movie that doesn't hold up.</v>

4462
02:09:11.501 --> 02:09:12.970
<v Speaker 1>I tried to watch Cujo the other day.</v>

4463
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:14.321
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4464
02:09:14.321 --> 02:09:16.270
<v Speaker 1>shut this fucking stew that talk stupid.</v>

4465
02:09:16.271 --> 02:09:16.481
<v Speaker 1>Shoot.</v>

4466
02:09:16.481 --> 02:09:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That fucking dumb thing smoothly sucks.</v>

4467
02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't scary at all.</v>

4468
02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:20.801
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

4469
02:09:20.801 --> 02:09:21.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4470
02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you've had quite a few of your movies,</v>

4471
02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:24.760
<v Speaker 1>your books rather than it become movies.</v>

4472
02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Is that a frustrating per say,</v>

4473
02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4474
02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:27.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4475
02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:31.210
<v Speaker 1>the legend of Bagger Vance was how many different movies or books have you</v>

4476
02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:31.531
<v Speaker 1>written?</v>

4477
02:09:31.531 --> 02:09:31.640
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4478
02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:32.270
<v Speaker 1>it become moving.</v>

4479
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:33.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the only one.</v>

4480
02:09:33.471 --> 02:09:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've had,</v>

4481
02:09:34.130 --> 02:09:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I've written screenplays but that became movies.</v>

4482
02:09:36.351 --> 02:09:37.184
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

4483
02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:38.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4484
02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:39.291
<v Speaker 3>let me put it this way.</v>

4485
02:09:39.291 --> 02:09:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a good experience yet.</v>

4486
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:41.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

4487
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.931
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4488
02:09:41.931 --> 02:09:42.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe uh,</v>

4489
02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:44.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm unlucky but I've never had a good,</v>

4490
02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:45.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

4491
02:09:45.341 --> 02:09:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I thought you had at least two that had become,</v>

4492
02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:48.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just forgetting.</v>

4493
02:09:49.330 --> 02:09:50.470
<v Speaker 1>How many screenplays have you,</v>

4494
02:09:50.471 --> 02:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4495
02:09:50.970 --> 02:09:51.260
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

4496
02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:52.510
<v Speaker 1>have been made from your books?</v>

4497
02:09:52.810 --> 02:09:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4498
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:53.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

4499
02:09:53.531 --> 02:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe five or six years.</v>

4500
02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:55.533
<v Speaker 1>That's what I read.</v>

4501
02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4502
02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:58.480
<v Speaker 1>so your all terrible.</v>

4503
02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:01.120
<v Speaker 1>What is it about that?</v>

4504
02:10:01.150 --> 02:10:01.871
<v Speaker 1>Like they can't,</v>

4505
02:10:01.871 --> 02:10:04.570
<v Speaker 1>it's is it because of trying to condense it to an hour and a half,</v>

4506
02:10:04.571 --> 02:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>

4507
02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>whereas a shitty job from the star,</v>

4508
02:10:07.831 --> 02:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4509
02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.191
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4510
02:10:09.191 --> 02:10:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Is it the Hollywood machine that that takes something and can take your ideas,</v>

4511
02:10:14.051 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 1>which are like,</v>

4512
02:10:14.981 --> 02:10:16.780
<v Speaker 1>as you were talking about the tides of war,</v>

4513
02:10:16.781 --> 02:10:18.790
<v Speaker 1>there's some ambiguous characters and</v>

4514
02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:19.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

4515
02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:19.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4516
02:10:19.650 --> 02:10:20.431
<v Speaker 3>I wish I knew Joe.</v>

4517
02:10:20.431 --> 02:10:20.641
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4518
02:10:20.641 --> 02:10:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes writers get really lucky and you know,</v>

4519
02:10:24.961 --> 02:10:27.030
<v Speaker 3>the godfather comes out fantastic,</v>

4520
02:10:27.031 --> 02:10:27.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4521
02:10:27.330 --> 02:10:27.571
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4522
02:10:27.571 --> 02:10:28.860
<v Speaker 3>every scene is perfect,</v>

4523
02:10:28.861 --> 02:10:29.610
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4524
02:10:29.610 --> 02:10:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4525
02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:31.140
<v Speaker 3>and other times,</v>

4526
02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4527
02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:33.380
<v Speaker 3>and then there's,</v>

4528
02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:34.213
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

4529
02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:35.450
<v Speaker 3>the sort of the,</v>

4530
02:10:35.451 --> 02:10:36.284
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4531
02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:38.060
<v Speaker 3>the politics of,</v>

4532
02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 3>of Hollywood where like if you're casting,</v>

4533
02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:41.913
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4534
02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.490
<v Speaker 3>the character of Bagger Vance,</v>

4535
02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:44.150
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

4536
02:10:44.150 --> 02:10:47.990
<v Speaker 3>and you want to cast Morgan Freeman who seems like he would be the perfect guy,</v>

4537
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:49.790
<v Speaker 3>but they run the numbers and they say,</v>

4538
02:10:49.791 --> 02:10:49.971
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4539
02:10:49.971 --> 02:10:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Morgan Freeman is not going to justify a budget of x,</v>

4540
02:10:52.731 --> 02:10:52.911
<v Speaker 3>Y,</v>

4541
02:10:52.911 --> 02:10:53.630
<v Speaker 3>z.</v>

4542
02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:54.740
<v Speaker 3>So maybe we need to,</v>

4543
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:56.270
<v Speaker 3>so we can't cast him.</v>

4544
02:10:56.271 --> 02:10:56.900
<v Speaker 3>We have to care.</v>

4545
02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:57.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4546
02:10:57.081 --> 02:10:57.914
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

4547
02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:03.040
<v Speaker 3>decisions are driven by factors other than I would have to,</v>

4548
02:11:03.550 --> 02:11:04.880
<v Speaker 3>other than instinct,</v>

4549
02:11:04.881 --> 02:11:05.714
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4550
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:07.010
<v Speaker 3>I would have to disagree sir.</v>

4551
02:11:07.011 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I think some of your movies</v>

4552
02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:08.781
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

4553
02:11:08.781 --> 02:11:12.010
<v Speaker 1>including King Kong lives above the law.</v>

4554
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Well you weren't.</v>

4555
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:15.140
<v Speaker 1>You made above the Law Free Jack.</v>

4556
02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.820
<v Speaker 3>I was one of three good misery people.</v>

4557
02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:18.500
<v Speaker 3>That was the only one I ever actually liked</v>

4558
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 1>above the law.</v>

4559
02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:20.890
<v Speaker 1>It's Randy Davis,</v>

4560
02:11:20.891 --> 02:11:21.724
<v Speaker 1>the director.</v>

4561
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4562
02:11:22.331 --> 02:11:22.601
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4563
02:11:22.601 --> 02:11:27.601
<v Speaker 1>I everybody goofs on time gall but above the law was fucking great at the time.</v>

4564
02:11:29.250 --> 02:11:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Moving is Steven Seagal movie.</v>

4565
02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:34.660
<v Speaker 1>My 14 hours shouldn't because there's the one that launched him.</v>

4566
02:11:34.690 --> 02:11:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Dow was the one that was the best above the law was the best one.</v>

4567
02:11:38.171 --> 02:11:39.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of silliness to it.</v>

4568
02:11:39.611 --> 02:11:40.391
<v Speaker 1>Of course there is,</v>

4569
02:11:40.391 --> 02:11:42.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's a God damn cop movie.</v>

4570
02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It's about a bad ass guy who's kicking ass and you know,</v>

4571
02:11:45.730 --> 02:11:46.511
<v Speaker 1>fucking people out.</v>

4572
02:11:46.511 --> 02:11:48.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to do that where it's not silly.</v>

4573
02:11:48.251 --> 02:11:51.910
<v Speaker 1>And Army of one with Dolphin London can really do that.</v>

4574
02:11:52.230 --> 02:11:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

4575
02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Man.</v>

4576
02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:55.990
<v Speaker 1>You guys were going to do this.</v>

4577
02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:56.400
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

4578
02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4579
02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.260
<v Speaker 1>someone told a fib and Brian caught him.</v>

4580
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:02.860
<v Speaker 1>W why is it about a King Kong?</v>

4581
02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:03.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4582
02:12:03.251 --> 02:12:03.971
<v Speaker 1>what is it about,</v>

4583
02:12:03.971 --> 02:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4584
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:05.800
<v Speaker 1>the terrible,</v>

4585
02:12:05.801 --> 02:12:06.634
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

4586
02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.290
<v Speaker 1>That was what that was the movie that was going on in when you were 40,</v>

4587
02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:14.640
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about your life being in a shambles.</v>

4588
02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:16.503
<v Speaker 1>That was that movie.</v>

4589
02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:17.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4590
02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:20.650
<v Speaker 1>What is it about King Kong that we keep making that fucking movie over and over</v>

4591
02:12:20.651 --> 02:12:21.484
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>

4592
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:22.343
<v Speaker 1>Happens.</v>

4593
02:12:22.630 --> 02:12:23.463
<v Speaker 1>Archetype.</v>

4594
02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Gorilla thing is a werewolf,</v>

4595
02:12:25.571 --> 02:12:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

4596
02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4597
02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:26.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4598
02:12:26.951 --> 02:12:28.550
<v Speaker 1>it's worse because the same goddamn story.</v>

4599
02:12:28.551 --> 02:12:30.100
<v Speaker 1>He always falls off the fucking building.</v>

4600
02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:34.780
<v Speaker 1>An American Werewolf in London is different than the man with Benito del Toro.</v>

4601
02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:34.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4602
02:12:34.961 --> 02:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot more places to go when they keep redoing that Goddamn King Kong</v>

4603
02:12:38.891 --> 02:12:39.201
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

4604
02:12:39.201 --> 02:12:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the same fucking thing happens every time.</v>

4605
02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like nobody ever figures that they can make a King Kong movie where he</v>

4606
02:12:45.551 --> 02:12:46.384
<v Speaker 1>doesn't die.</v>

4607
02:12:46.530 --> 02:12:46.810
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4608
02:12:46.810 --> 02:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that it was a movie that like somebody made it to begin with</v>

4609
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:52.210
<v Speaker 1>like a stone tablet.</v>

4610
02:12:52.211 --> 02:12:54.610
<v Speaker 1>You can do a whole different King Kong story,</v>

4611
02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:55.240
<v Speaker 1>but nope.</v>

4612
02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

4613
02:12:55.570 --> 02:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Got a blonde girl,</v>

4614
02:12:56.570 --> 02:12:57.730
<v Speaker 1>get a building climb,</v>

4615
02:12:57.940 --> 02:12:58.721
<v Speaker 1>shoot him down,</v>

4616
02:12:58.721 --> 02:12:59.554
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

4617
02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:00.071
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

4618
02:13:00.071 --> 02:13:02.710
<v Speaker 1>does that frustrate the shit out of you as a creative guy?</v>

4619
02:13:02.711 --> 02:13:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Like would they want to keep doing the same goddamn thing over and over again?</v>

4620
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.823
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4621
02:13:08.930 --> 02:13:10.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure how to answer that too.</v>

4622
02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:11.001
<v Speaker 3>I'll be there.</v>

4623
02:13:11.001 --> 02:13:11.630
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

4624
02:13:11.630 --> 02:13:12.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4625
02:13:12.021 --> 02:13:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I want to do the same thing over and over again.</v>

4626
02:13:13.791 --> 02:13:14.421
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it'd be,</v>

4627
02:13:14.421 --> 02:13:17.840
<v Speaker 3>there are sort of principles of storytelling that you want to do,</v>

4628
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:18.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4629
02:13:18.650 --> 02:13:19.940
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

4630
02:13:19.941 --> 02:13:20.661
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean.</v>

4631
02:13:20.661 --> 02:13:21.231
<v Speaker 3>And it is,</v>

4632
02:13:21.231 --> 02:13:22.310
<v Speaker 3>it is pretty frustrating.</v>

4633
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:23.683
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

4634
02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:24.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4635
02:13:24.021 --> 02:13:26.570
<v Speaker 3>you give a lot of advice for writing fiction in this,</v>

4636
02:13:26.571 --> 02:13:27.950
<v Speaker 3>especially the authentic swing.</v>

4637
02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4638
02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.740
<v Speaker 3>but what about some of your nonfiction works?</v>

4639
02:13:30.741 --> 02:13:30.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4640
02:13:30.930 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>how is that different?</v>

4641
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:35.520
<v Speaker 4>How is that process different than crafting a story and characters?</v>

4642
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:36.080
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4643
02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:37.410
<v Speaker 4>cause you've done amazing job,</v>

4644
02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:37.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4645
02:13:37.890 --> 02:13:39.210
<v Speaker 4>writing nonfiction as well.</v>

4646
02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:39.951
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4647
02:13:39.951 --> 02:13:44.360
<v Speaker 3>of course the only nonfiction I've done is stuff about the writing process</v>

4648
02:13:44.361 --> 02:13:45.770
<v Speaker 3>rather than something like,</v>

4649
02:13:45.771 --> 02:13:46.604
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4650
02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:47.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4651
02:13:47.181 --> 02:13:48.014
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4652
02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:48.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4653
02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:50.230
<v Speaker 3>all the president's men or something.</v>

4654
02:13:50.231 --> 02:13:50.521
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4655
02:13:50.521 --> 02:13:50.741
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

4656
02:13:50.741 --> 02:13:50.881
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

4657
02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:51.170
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4658
02:13:51.170 --> 02:13:53.090
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of,</v>

4659
02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:54.261
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4660
02:13:54.261 --> 02:13:56.000
<v Speaker 3>but that's sort of the specialized genre,</v>

4661
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:57.380
<v Speaker 3>didactic kind of self help.</v>

4662
02:13:57.590 --> 02:13:59.150
<v Speaker 3>My theory is,</v>

4663
02:13:59.290 --> 02:14:00.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4664
02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:03.320
<v Speaker 3>that it has to be a story anyway.</v>

4665
02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:05.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4666
02:14:05.090 --> 02:14:05.451
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

4667
02:14:05.451 --> 02:14:05.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4668
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:09.500
<v Speaker 3>my partner Shawn Coyne is a big believer in act one,</v>

4669
02:14:09.501 --> 02:14:09.891
<v Speaker 3>act two,</v>

4670
02:14:09.891 --> 02:14:10.430
<v Speaker 3>act three,</v>

4671
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:11.510
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it is,</v>

4672
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:13.850
<v Speaker 3>even if it doesn't have any characters,</v>

4673
02:14:14.150 --> 02:14:15.290
<v Speaker 3>it's got to start somewhere,</v>

4674
02:14:15.291 --> 02:14:17.300
<v Speaker 3>have a middle and then have an end.</v>

4675
02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.630
<v Speaker 3>So I sort of tried to follow the same,</v>

4676
02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:22.370
<v Speaker 3>the same process,</v>

4677
02:14:22.371 --> 02:14:23.600
<v Speaker 3>make it a story a little bit</v>

4678
02:14:24.110 --> 02:14:25.940
<v Speaker 4>where the reader plays,</v>

4679
02:14:25.941 --> 02:14:26.300
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4680
02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:27.260
<v Speaker 4>plays a role then.</v>

4681
02:14:27.290 --> 02:14:28.820
<v Speaker 4>So the reader is kind of the,</v>

4682
02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:30.420
<v Speaker 4>the protege and you're the</v>

4683
02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:30.850
<v Speaker 3>mentor.</v>

4684
02:14:30.850 --> 02:14:35.130
<v Speaker 3>The reader follows along rooting for you or you know,</v>

4685
02:14:35.131 --> 02:14:38.850
<v Speaker 3>even if you're on your character is only salted in there a little bit here and</v>

4686
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:39.390
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

4687
02:14:39.390 --> 02:14:39.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4688
02:14:39.601 --> 02:14:41.400
<v Speaker 3>going from one fiasco to another,</v>

4689
02:14:41.401 --> 02:14:42.300
<v Speaker 3>to another bed at all,</v>

4690
02:14:42.301 --> 02:14:43.240
<v Speaker 3>sort of if,</v>

4691
02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:43.980
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

4692
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:44.910
<v Speaker 3>if you do it right,</v>

4693
02:14:44.911 --> 02:14:47.250
<v Speaker 3>it has a flow to it and it builds to a climax.</v>

4694
02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Like the war of art starts kind of out with,</v>

4695
02:14:50.551 --> 02:14:51.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4696
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:52.320
<v Speaker 3>it's in three parts.</v>

4697
02:14:52.410 --> 02:14:53.041
<v Speaker 3>My partner,</v>

4698
02:14:53.041 --> 02:14:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Sean figured that out.</v>

4699
02:14:53.941 --> 02:14:54.181
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4700
02:14:54.181 --> 02:14:54.690
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4701
02:14:54.690 --> 02:14:55.523
<v Speaker 3>it's what,</v>

4702
02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:57.390
<v Speaker 3>what is the enemy resistance?</v>

4703
02:14:57.660 --> 02:14:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Second part is what's,</v>

4704
02:14:59.160 --> 02:14:59.670
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

4705
02:14:59.670 --> 02:15:02.280
<v Speaker 3>how do you overcome that enemy turning pro?</v>

4706
02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:05.100
<v Speaker 3>And the third part is getting into the metaphysics of it.</v>

4707
02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:06.180
<v Speaker 3>What does it all mean?</v>

4708
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:08.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's sort of a natural progression,</v>

4709
02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:09.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4710
02:15:09.181 --> 02:15:09.930
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>

4711
02:15:09.930 --> 02:15:11.700
<v Speaker 3>what's the metaphysical aspect of it?</v>

4712
02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:13.080
<v Speaker 3>And at the end,</v>

4713
02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:14.033
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>

4714
02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.570
<v Speaker 3>what's the spiritual side of it?</v>

4715
02:15:15.571 --> 02:15:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4716
02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:16.440
<v Speaker 4>That's this,</v>

4717
02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:21.440
<v Speaker 4>that's the aspect of what you've written in your book that makes it not really a</v>

4718
02:15:21.751 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 4>book about writing.</v>

4719
02:15:23.190 --> 02:15:25.200
<v Speaker 4>It's not really a book about the creative process.</v>

4720
02:15:25.201 --> 02:15:27.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a book about achieving a mindset.</v>

4721
02:15:27.150 --> 02:15:27.521
<v Speaker 4>It's a book,</v>

4722
02:15:27.521 --> 02:15:32.521
<v Speaker 4>a book about achieving a victory over this resistance thing.</v>

4723
02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:33.631
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

4724
02:15:33.631 --> 02:15:33.961
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4725
02:15:33.961 --> 02:15:34.141
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4726
02:15:34.141 --> 02:15:36.420
<v Speaker 4>the achieving this state of mind that just,</v>

4727
02:15:36.421 --> 02:15:36.690
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4728
02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:37.980
<v Speaker 4>there's no nonsense.</v>

4729
02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Cut Out all the nonsense and get to it state of mind.</v>

4730
02:15:41.730 --> 02:15:42.031
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4731
02:15:42.031 --> 02:15:42.421
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>

4732
02:15:42.421 --> 02:15:43.680
<v Speaker 4>it's a psychological handbook.</v>

4733
02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4734
02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:45.290
<v Speaker 4>It's the writing as,</v>

4735
02:15:45.291 --> 02:15:45.841
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>

4736
02:15:45.841 --> 02:15:46.890
<v Speaker 4>I think you even point this out.</v>

4737
02:15:46.891 --> 02:15:49.040
<v Speaker 4>It's just a metaphor for the process.</v>

4738
02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:49.501
<v Speaker 4>Same what?</v>

4739
02:15:49.501 --> 02:15:50.334
<v Speaker 4>Same with golf,</v>

4740
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:53.760
<v Speaker 3>which I didn't even realize when I was doing it kind of became clear afterwards.</v>

4741
02:15:53.970 --> 02:15:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Are you a big golf man?</v>

4742
02:15:55.051 --> 02:15:56.190
<v Speaker 4>Is that why you keep writing?</v>

4743
02:15:56.191 --> 02:15:57.090
<v Speaker 4>And I was stuck off</v>

4744
02:15:57.190 --> 02:15:57.941
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid.</v>

4745
02:15:57.941 --> 02:15:58.420
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

4746
02:15:58.420 --> 02:15:59.680
<v Speaker 3>I grew up as a caddy,</v>

4747
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4748
02:16:00.641 --> 02:16:03.760
<v Speaker 3>so from the time I was like 11 till all the way through college,</v>

4749
02:16:03.761 --> 02:16:03.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4750
02:16:03.941 --> 02:16:06.010
<v Speaker 3>back in the days where the worst such things just caddies.</v>

4751
02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:07.990
<v Speaker 3>So I kinda grew up in the caddy shack,</v>

4752
02:16:07.991 --> 02:16:08.890
<v Speaker 3>just like a,</v>

4753
02:16:08.891 --> 02:16:09.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4754
02:16:09.221 --> 02:16:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Rodney Dangerfield.</v>

4755
02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:11.553
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4756
02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:15.310
<v Speaker 3>but since then I haven't really been able to play.</v>

4757
02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:16.750
<v Speaker 3>So really why is that?</v>

4758
02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:18.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm working for a living.</v>

4759
02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:18.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4760
02:16:18.171 --> 02:16:18.871
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

4761
02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:21.870
<v Speaker 4>So you don't give yourself a chance to like take a little day off and go play</v>

4762
02:16:21.871 --> 02:16:22.250
<v Speaker 4>golf.</v>

4763
02:16:22.250 --> 02:16:22.521
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4764
02:16:22.521 --> 02:16:23.600
<v Speaker 3>I do that every once in a while,</v>

4765
02:16:23.601 --> 02:16:24.440
<v Speaker 3>but I'm so lousy.</v>

4766
02:16:24.441 --> 02:16:25.340
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty depressing.</v>

4767
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:25.551
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4768
02:16:25.551 --> 02:16:25.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4769
02:16:25.881 --> 02:16:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I graduated from college to New York,</v>

4770
02:16:29.671 --> 02:16:30.280
<v Speaker 3>got married</v>

4771
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:32.200
<v Speaker 7>first day we moved into the city,</v>

4772
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:33.250
<v Speaker 7>the car,</v>

4773
02:16:33.250 --> 02:16:35.710
<v Speaker 7>my car was vandalized and they stole my golf clubs.</v>

4774
02:16:35.711 --> 02:16:37.420
<v Speaker 7>I didn't play for another 20 years,</v>

4775
02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:38.050
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

4776
02:16:38.050 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 7>And then by the time I did then,</v>

4777
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:40.833
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4778
02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:42.910
<v Speaker 7>it's interesting was all in my memory,</v>

4779
02:16:42.930 --> 02:16:43.880
<v Speaker 7>the love for the sport,</v>

4780
02:16:43.881 --> 02:16:45.360
<v Speaker 7>it seems to bleed out in this and the,</v>

4781
02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:45.971
<v Speaker 7>I love this.</v>

4782
02:16:45.971 --> 02:16:46.751
<v Speaker 7>I love the game.</v>

4783
02:16:46.751 --> 02:16:48.280
<v Speaker 7>It's a game.</v>

4784
02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 7>Weird people</v>

4785
02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:52.540
<v Speaker 1>watching golf more than you like,</v>

4786
02:16:53.130 --> 02:16:53.371
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

4787
02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:56.310
<v Speaker 7>I would love playing golf more if I played below better than I play.</v>

4788
02:16:57.090 --> 02:16:59.790
<v Speaker 7>So do you get very self critical on yourself when you play golf?</v>

4789
02:16:59.791 --> 02:17:00.350
<v Speaker 7>Is that,</v>

4790
02:17:00.350 --> 02:17:00.750
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4791
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:02.060
<v Speaker 7>bring up a love that I,</v>

4792
02:17:02.510 --> 02:17:06.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean I've been so bad for so long that I kind of forgive myself now.</v>

4793
02:17:06.331 --> 02:17:06.601
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4794
02:17:06.601 --> 02:17:07.200
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

4795
02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:08.300
<v Speaker 7>isn't that part of now my,</v>

4796
02:17:08.590 --> 02:17:11.070
<v Speaker 7>my main goal is just not to hurt myself,</v>

4797
02:17:11.071 --> 02:17:11.904
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4798
02:17:13.590 --> 02:17:14.121
<v Speaker 7>get through it.</v>

4799
02:17:14.121 --> 02:17:14.701
<v Speaker 7>Try to enjoy,</v>

4800
02:17:14.701 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 7>not kidding either.</v>

4801
02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:17.670
<v Speaker 7>Do you walk in or do you take the cart?</v>

4802
02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:18.570
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4803
02:17:18.570 --> 02:17:19.131
<v Speaker 7>well I,</v>

4804
02:17:19.131 --> 02:17:20.640
<v Speaker 7>I tried to walk when I can,</v>

4805
02:17:20.641 --> 02:17:21.120
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4806
02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:24.780
<v Speaker 7>but I'm pretty much Karcher the way it is these days.</v>

4807
02:17:24.781 --> 02:17:25.490
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4808
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I think people are being pussies.</v>

4809
02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:27.621
<v Speaker 1>I think if you,</v>

4810
02:17:27.621 --> 02:17:29.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're gonna knock that ball that far away,</v>

4811
02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you should go walk off.</v>

4812
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:31.180
<v Speaker 7>Nice.</v>

4813
02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:31.891
<v Speaker 7>I agree with it.</v>

4814
02:17:31.891 --> 02:17:32.441
<v Speaker 7>It's too bad.</v>

4815
02:17:32.441 --> 02:17:35.380
<v Speaker 7>Then you should carry your own fucking clubs evolve to that point.</v>

4816
02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:36.600
<v Speaker 1>It's we're cowards,</v>

4817
02:17:36.810 --> 02:17:38.020
<v Speaker 1>we're were cowards and pussies.</v>

4818
02:17:38.021 --> 02:17:40.260
<v Speaker 1>So we will have other people carry our clubs and getting the thing.</v>

4819
02:17:41.050 --> 02:17:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to drive those when you're,</v>

4820
02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.800
<v Speaker 1>it is fun to drive those,</v>

4821
02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:46.170
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is play some serious golf.</v>

4822
02:17:46.171 --> 02:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You need to whack that fucker and then walk after it.</v>

4823
02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Problem when you really suck though is if you walk,</v>

4824
02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>there will be people just so mad at just right behind you cause it's taken</v>

4825
02:17:54.661 --> 02:17:55.141
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

4826
02:17:55.141 --> 02:17:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You got to go walk to the left and you got to walk to the right and then you got</v>

4827
02:17:58.741 --> 02:17:58.801
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4828
02:17:58.801 --> 02:17:59.634
<v Speaker 1>It looks as if it's me.</v>

4829
02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Then you walk to the left,</v>

4830
02:18:00.661 --> 02:18:00.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4831
02:18:00.811 --> 02:18:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm all over there.</v>

4832
02:18:01.470 --> 02:18:02.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

4833
02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:02.761
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

4834
02:18:02.761 --> 02:18:03.594
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4835
02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like Beverly Hills the other day at a meeting and I'm uh,</v>

4836
02:18:06.750 --> 02:18:07.291
<v Speaker 1>at this,</v>

4837
02:18:07.291 --> 02:18:07.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4838
02:18:07.650 --> 02:18:12.510
<v Speaker 1>network and I'm looking out the window and they have this giant view of this</v>

4839
02:18:12.511 --> 02:18:16.170
<v Speaker 1>golf course and just the mass of the golf course.</v>

4840
02:18:16.171 --> 02:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I had to take it into my head.</v>

4841
02:18:17.611 --> 02:18:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4842
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:19.860
<v Speaker 1>how much is that worth?</v>

4843
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4844
02:18:20.370 --> 02:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was Beverly Hills Country Club or one of those big country clubs down</v>

4845
02:18:23.311 --> 02:18:23.730
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4846
02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:24.151
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

4847
02:18:24.151 --> 02:18:29.151
<v Speaker 1>this is a giant piece of land in the middle of like the most expensive real</v>

4848
02:18:29.521 --> 02:18:30.480
<v Speaker 1>estate in the country.</v>

4849
02:18:30.481 --> 02:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Like this is crazy.</v>

4850
02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:34.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a $300 million plot of land.</v>

4851
02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:34.831
<v Speaker 7>It is amazing.</v>

4852
02:18:34.831 --> 02:18:35.910
<v Speaker 7>That's La Country Club.</v>

4853
02:18:35.911 --> 02:18:37.020
<v Speaker 7>It's two courses there.</v>

4854
02:18:37.530 --> 02:18:39.090
<v Speaker 7>So that's a lot of lamp.</v>

4855
02:18:39.091 --> 02:18:40.170
<v Speaker 7>I imagine what that's worth.</v>

4856
02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:41.133
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts,</v>

4857
02:18:41.350 --> 02:18:41.891
<v Speaker 1>but it's what a,</v>

4858
02:18:41.891 --> 02:18:43.060
<v Speaker 1>what a wacky sport.</v>

4859
02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:45.170
<v Speaker 1>You're going to walk around the land,</v>

4860
02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:45.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4861
02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:46.361
<v Speaker 1>and it rains,</v>

4862
02:18:46.361 --> 02:18:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

4863
02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:47.853
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4864
02:18:48.570 --> 02:18:53.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy sport where you need a giant piece of land and so like influential</v>

4865
02:18:54.101 --> 02:18:56.530
<v Speaker 1>as far as like business meetings and you know,</v>

4866
02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:00.220
<v Speaker 1>people that love to like get together and play golf together.</v>

4867
02:19:00.370 --> 02:19:00.611
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4868
02:19:00.611 --> 02:19:02.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a big part of the comradery</v>

4869
02:19:03.470 --> 02:19:04.560
<v Speaker 7>I think for business.</v>

4870
02:19:04.561 --> 02:19:06.840
<v Speaker 7>It reveals something about the person you're playing with.</v>

4871
02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:09.690
<v Speaker 7>That's pretty unique because it will bring to the surface.</v>

4872
02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:14.600
<v Speaker 7>Those parts of themselves that are a little ugly are a little weird or noble and</v>

4873
02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:15.450
<v Speaker 7>and good.</v>

4874
02:19:15.450 --> 02:19:15.661
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4875
02:19:15.661 --> 02:19:16.800
<v Speaker 7>when you play with somebody,</v>

4876
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:18.930
<v Speaker 7>you get to know more than just your conversation,</v>

4877
02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:19.711
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4878
02:19:19.711 --> 02:19:22.350
<v Speaker 7>because you see if they're going to fudge it and they're going to cheat a little</v>

4879
02:19:22.351 --> 02:19:25.110
<v Speaker 7>bit if they're going to get really self critical.</v>

4880
02:19:25.111 --> 02:19:28.870
<v Speaker 7>And I get all mad at Ryan Callahan</v>

4881
02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:29.691
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>

4882
02:19:29.691 --> 02:19:34.691
<v Speaker 1>an instance when his father was playing golf with this man and his mother was</v>

4883
02:19:34.941 --> 02:19:39.941
<v Speaker 1>there and his mother watched the Guy Playing Golf with his dad cheat and then</v>

4884
02:19:40.011 --> 02:19:40.670
<v Speaker 1>told them,</v>

4885
02:19:40.670 --> 02:19:43.310
<v Speaker 1>do not go into business with this guy.</v>

4886
02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:44.840
<v Speaker 1>And she told him why.</v>

4887
02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:45.801
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

4888
02:19:45.801 --> 02:19:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4889
02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:48.890
<v Speaker 1>like in Brian as a young man remembers that.</v>

4890
02:19:48.891 --> 02:19:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just,</v>

4891
02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:50.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just a game.</v>

4892
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.681
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

4893
02:19:51.681 --> 02:19:51.891
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4894
02:19:51.891 --> 02:19:52.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

4895
02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:52.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4896
02:19:52.761 --> 02:19:53.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

4897
02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:54.013
<v Speaker 1>It just a game.</v>

4898
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:55.220
<v Speaker 1>It is just a game of,</v>

4899
02:19:55.221 --> 02:19:56.330
<v Speaker 1>so why did he cheat it?</v>

4900
02:19:56.331 --> 02:19:57.164
<v Speaker 1>Just a game?</v>

4901
02:19:57.920 --> 02:19:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what he does.</v>

4902
02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:00.530
<v Speaker 1>That's who he is.</v>

4903
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:02.480
<v Speaker 1>That sleazy motherfucker.</v>

4904
02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:03.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4905
02:20:03.741 --> 02:20:04.491
<v Speaker 1>So in that,</v>

4906
02:20:04.491 --> 02:20:04.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4907
02:20:04.881 --> 02:20:05.714
<v Speaker 1>you can learn,</v>

4908
02:20:05.780 --> 02:20:07.400
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard women complain.</v>

4909
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:07.851
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4910
02:20:07.851 --> 02:20:11.860
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting argument that there's like a patriarchy thing about these a</v>

4911
02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:16.370
<v Speaker 1>men's club meetings on golf courses that they could never get in on this and</v>

4912
02:20:16.371 --> 02:20:16.640
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4913
02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:17.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4914
02:20:17.031 --> 02:20:17.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4915
02:20:17.310 --> 02:20:18.830
<v Speaker 1>they would never be in,</v>

4916
02:20:18.831 --> 02:20:19.880
<v Speaker 1>even if they were in that circle,</v>

4917
02:20:19.881 --> 02:20:21.200
<v Speaker 1>they would almost like be,</v>

4918
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:22.910
<v Speaker 1>it would be the white elephant in the room,</v>

4919
02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:23.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4920
02:20:23.691 --> 02:20:27.410
<v Speaker 1>and that they would have to learn how to play golf and go in order to have a,</v>

4921
02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:31.820
<v Speaker 1>like an equal stake in the companies and an equal stake in the future.</v>

4922
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:35.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of be a part of this little goofy club of these fuckers chasing</v>

4923
02:20:35.271 --> 02:20:36.104
<v Speaker 1>after a ball.</v>

4924
02:20:36.350 --> 02:20:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>

4925
02:20:37.850 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 1>They can learn.</v>

4926
02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:39.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not MMA.</v>

4927
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4928
02:20:39.741 --> 02:20:40.850
<v Speaker 1>but why should they have to,</v>

4929
02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4930
02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:43.020
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't it be the men ideally.</v>

4931
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4932
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:44.480
<v Speaker 1>But I do,</v>

4933
02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:44.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4934
02:20:44.631 --> 02:20:45.470
<v Speaker 1>some of them do though.</v>

4935
02:20:45.471 --> 02:20:46.304
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

4936
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:48.590
<v Speaker 1>in order to be like in that sort of,</v>

4937
02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:52.010
<v Speaker 1>they are people that in order to be in the group with them,</v>

4938
02:20:52.011 --> 02:20:53.270
<v Speaker 1>you have to do the things they do.</v>

4939
02:20:53.390 --> 02:20:53.991
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>

4940
02:20:53.991 --> 02:20:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to like the kind of music they like and it's a part of the tribe thing.</v>

4941
02:20:57.500 --> 02:20:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of our tribal instincts.</v>

4942
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:00.320
<v Speaker 1>You have to be,</v>

4943
02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you have to have like two people don't like working together.</v>

4944
02:21:02.931 --> 02:21:04.490
<v Speaker 1>If one's a Republican and one's Democrat,</v>

4945
02:21:04.491 --> 02:21:06.410
<v Speaker 1>they fucking hate each other.</v>

4946
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:07.011
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4947
02:21:07.011 --> 02:21:07.231
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4948
02:21:07.231 --> 02:21:11.120
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen it in offices like this fucking liberal breeding hard over here</v>

4949
02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:11.910
<v Speaker 1>and it was guy.</v>

4950
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Everything will go bama over.</v>

4951
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:16.520
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another one that's fucking redneck asshole over here.</v>

4952
02:21:16.521 --> 02:21:16.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4953
02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:17.690
<v Speaker 1>if he could have his way,</v>

4954
02:21:17.691 --> 02:21:17.841
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4955
02:21:17.841 --> 02:21:18.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4956
02:21:18.021 --> 02:21:20.250
<v Speaker 1>we don't have slavery again and there's,</v>

4957
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:21.990
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit is just,</v>

4958
02:21:21.991 --> 02:21:22.970
<v Speaker 1>it's so prevalent.</v>

4959
02:21:23.930 --> 02:21:24.950
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that the,</v>

4960
02:21:24.951 --> 02:21:25.161
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4961
02:21:25.161 --> 02:21:27.020
<v Speaker 1>the game of golf sort of like,</v>

4962
02:21:27.210 --> 02:21:28.490
<v Speaker 1>it encompasses a,</v>

4963
02:21:28.491 --> 02:21:30.320
<v Speaker 1>an aspect of that tribal behavior.</v>

4964
02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:30.951
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4965
02:21:30.951 --> 02:21:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I think you can probably do that with most sports too.</v>

4966
02:21:33.210 --> 02:21:33.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4967
02:21:33.411 --> 02:21:35.480
<v Speaker 1>how much do you learn about somebody when you roll with them,</v>

4968
02:21:35.481 --> 02:21:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

4969
02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:36.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4970
02:21:36.111 --> 02:21:37.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn every,</v>

4971
02:21:37.131 --> 02:21:37.970
<v Speaker 1>learn everything,</v>

4972
02:21:37.971 --> 02:21:38.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4973
02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:40.040
<v Speaker 1>You learn everything and learn who they are,</v>

4974
02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:41.330
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're tired.</v>

4975
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4976
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:43.460
<v Speaker 1>We learned a lot of that person when they're tired.</v>

4977
02:21:43.490 --> 02:21:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Some dude's can keep going,</v>

4978
02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:45.230
<v Speaker 1>so I'm good.</v>

4979
02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking fall down.</v>

4980
02:21:46.551 --> 02:21:47.570
<v Speaker 1>They just flatten out.</v>

4981
02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4982
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:49.423
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

4983
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:50.503
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

4984
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4985
02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you learned about pool too.</v>

4986
02:21:52.641 --> 02:21:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>

4987
02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:54.283
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

4988
02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Pursued any,</v>

4989
02:21:55.401 --> 02:21:56.480
<v Speaker 1>any sort of a pursuit.</v>

4990
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:57.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4991
02:21:57.290 --> 02:21:58.310
<v Speaker 1>if it becomes hard,</v>

4992
02:21:58.460 --> 02:21:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4993
02:21:58.850 --> 02:22:00.260
<v Speaker 1>you learn who can keep it together,</v>

4994
02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:01.520
<v Speaker 1>who's going to fall apart.</v>

4995
02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

4996
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4997
02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4998
02:22:02.890 --> 02:22:03.770
<v Speaker 1>and doing this,</v>

4999
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it's the practice for,</v>

5000
02:22:04.901 --> 02:22:05.734
<v Speaker 1>for the life,</v>

5001
02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:06.051
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5002
02:22:06.051 --> 02:22:09.620
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why I always innately people who've been in athletics,</v>

5003
02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:10.520
<v Speaker 1>male or female,</v>

5004
02:22:10.521 --> 02:22:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I have such a much greater affinity towards and trust,</v>

5005
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:14.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5006
02:22:14.001 --> 02:22:17.750
<v Speaker 1>when they've been to a high level and they felt that pressure of fans and</v>

5007
02:22:17.751 --> 02:22:20.570
<v Speaker 1>obligations and expectation and pushed through,</v>

5008
02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5009
02:22:21.050 --> 02:22:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I know the feeling when you know,</v>

5010
02:22:22.401 --> 02:22:24.350
<v Speaker 1>some days and these biggest games in high school,</v>

5011
02:22:24.351 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>we'd get a couple thousand people's Texas</v>

5012
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:28.770
<v Speaker 6>sports and it would be so intense.</v>

5013
02:22:28.771 --> 02:22:30.930
<v Speaker 6>I would just want to go to sleep before the game.</v>

5014
02:22:31.170 --> 02:22:31.981
<v Speaker 6>I just want to curl.</v>

5015
02:22:31.981 --> 02:22:34.740
<v Speaker 6>It has just really tired right now.</v>

5016
02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:37.440
<v Speaker 6>But then you get out there and you feel the rush and you put your,</v>

5017
02:22:37.441 --> 02:22:37.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5018
02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:42.000
<v Speaker 6>put your forearm into somebody on that first play and get your first hard drive</v>

5019
02:22:42.001 --> 02:22:45.210
<v Speaker 6>to the basket and then this feeling just kind of explodes and you,</v>

5020
02:22:45.211 --> 02:22:45.960
<v Speaker 6>and you're in it,</v>

5021
02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:46.201
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

5022
02:22:46.201 --> 02:22:48.510
<v Speaker 6>But making it through that process without folding.</v>

5023
02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:52.830
<v Speaker 6>There was also other games where I never got that kind of restrictive energy out</v>

5024
02:22:52.831 --> 02:22:54.060
<v Speaker 6>and I played like shit,</v>

5025
02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:54.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5026
02:22:54.481 --> 02:22:55.440
<v Speaker 6>just terrible.</v>

5027
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:56.640
<v Speaker 6>And you learn about that.</v>

5028
02:22:56.641 --> 02:22:58.200
<v Speaker 6>You learn how to deal with the pressure,</v>

5029
02:22:58.201 --> 02:22:59.250
<v Speaker 6>not internalize it,</v>

5030
02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:00.510
<v Speaker 6>push through and,</v>

5031
02:23:00.810 --> 02:23:01.643
<v Speaker 6>and men,</v>

5032
02:23:01.650 --> 02:23:04.080
<v Speaker 6>so many times in business and these challenges,</v>

5033
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:04.381
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5034
02:23:04.381 --> 02:23:05.100
<v Speaker 6>it applies,</v>

5035
02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:05.933
<v Speaker 6>it applies.</v>

5036
02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:08.190
<v Speaker 6>Pressure is to deal with pressure.</v>

5037
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:09.000
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

5038
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.320
<v Speaker 6>You got to get used to that bitch.</v>

5039
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:12.810
<v Speaker 6>Gotta feel her and what she does,</v>

5040
02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:14.093
<v Speaker 6>how she tricks you,</v>

5041
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.930
<v Speaker 6>messes with your head.</v>

5042
02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:17.520
<v Speaker 6>That's it messes with your head.</v>

5043
02:23:17.521 --> 02:23:18.630
<v Speaker 6>You've got to learn that too.</v>

5044
02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:19.090
<v Speaker 6>That's a,</v>

5045
02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:19.801
<v Speaker 6>that's the big one.</v>

5046
02:23:19.801 --> 02:23:20.310
<v Speaker 6>Just like,</v>

5047
02:23:20.310 --> 02:23:20.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5048
02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:21.870
<v Speaker 6>essentially it's resistance.</v>

5049
02:23:21.871 --> 02:23:22.704
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing.</v>

5050
02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 6>That doubt,</v>

5051
02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 6>that creeping doubt makes its way.</v>

5052
02:23:26.850 --> 02:23:27.683
<v Speaker 6>You got to figure out a way.</v>

5053
02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:28.861
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5054
02:23:28.861 --> 02:23:29.694
<v Speaker 6>Boy,</v>

5055
02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:31.770
<v Speaker 6>and we are all luck contributing to this.</v>

5056
02:23:31.771 --> 02:23:35.400
<v Speaker 6>A collective guidebook of how to be a human.</v>

5057
02:23:35.850 --> 02:23:36.600
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5058
02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:36.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5059
02:23:36.871 --> 02:23:39.870
<v Speaker 6>one thing I've just recently started playing with that it occurred to me that</v>

5060
02:23:39.871 --> 02:23:44.280
<v Speaker 6>there's little fears that we think of as trivial and a trivial fear,</v>

5061
02:23:44.281 --> 02:23:45.960
<v Speaker 6>like a fear of spiders or,</v>

5062
02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:47.790
<v Speaker 6>and there's also things like,</v>

5063
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.721
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

5064
02:23:48.721 --> 02:23:49.111
<v Speaker 6>for me,</v>

5065
02:23:49.111 --> 02:23:52.530
<v Speaker 6>I have this block about doing a backflip on a trampoline,</v>

5066
02:23:52.531 --> 02:23:53.790
<v Speaker 6>even like a super safe,</v>

5067
02:23:53.791 --> 02:23:54.624
<v Speaker 6>super big one.</v>

5068
02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:56.220
<v Speaker 6>And I can back flip into pools.</v>

5069
02:23:56.221 --> 02:23:57.030
<v Speaker 6>I can do,</v>

5070
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.180
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5071
02:23:57.180 --> 02:23:58.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm a fairly athletic guy,</v>

5072
02:23:59.190 --> 02:24:01.410
<v Speaker 6>but as soon as I go to do it on a trampoline,</v>

5073
02:24:01.411 --> 02:24:02.400
<v Speaker 6>which is fairly soft,</v>

5074
02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:07.080
<v Speaker 6>my body just freezes up and I lock and I was talking to my friend about it.</v>

5075
02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:08.970
<v Speaker 6>And for me,</v>

5076
02:24:08.971 --> 02:24:09.181
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5077
02:24:09.181 --> 02:24:13.230
<v Speaker 6>when you allow these fears that are disproportionate away from the actual danger</v>

5078
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:14.460
<v Speaker 6>to take hold,</v>

5079
02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.290
<v Speaker 6>it's almost giving credence,</v>

5080
02:24:16.310 --> 02:24:16.531
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5081
02:24:16.531 --> 02:24:17.460
<v Speaker 6>giving resistance,</v>

5082
02:24:17.461 --> 02:24:20.160
<v Speaker 6>like this little bit of victory that can apply to other things.</v>

5083
02:24:20.310 --> 02:24:22.500
<v Speaker 6>Or if you're so afraid of spiders,</v>

5084
02:24:22.501 --> 02:24:23.580
<v Speaker 6>you can't even look at it.</v>

5085
02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:24.450
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

5086
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:25.560
<v Speaker 6>Just by doing that,</v>

5087
02:24:25.561 --> 02:24:28.380
<v Speaker 6>it's acknowledging that you have some certain limitations,</v>

5088
02:24:28.650 --> 02:24:28.891
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5089
02:24:28.891 --> 02:24:33.030
<v Speaker 6>and it's giving that other force that's going to limit you in life and deny you</v>

5090
02:24:33.031 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 6>from achieving your goal.</v>

5091
02:24:34.470 --> 02:24:35.910
<v Speaker 6>Just a little bit more power.</v>

5092
02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:37.230
<v Speaker 6>So even for me,</v>

5093
02:24:37.231 --> 02:24:41.130
<v Speaker 6>and this is something I'm just recently playing with these little trivial fears</v>

5094
02:24:41.131 --> 02:24:42.270
<v Speaker 6>that we just kind of avoid like,</v>

5095
02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:42.421
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

5096
02:24:42.421 --> 02:24:43.320
<v Speaker 6>this doesn't matter.</v>

5097
02:24:43.410 --> 02:24:43.621
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5098
02:24:43.621 --> 02:24:44.041
<v Speaker 6>who cares?</v>

5099
02:24:44.041 --> 02:24:45.090
<v Speaker 6>What am I going to see a spider?</v>

5100
02:24:45.091 --> 02:24:45.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

5101
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:48.750
<v Speaker 6>I'll fucking deal with it when it comes or cares if I do a backflip on a</v>

5102
02:24:48.751 --> 02:24:49.261
<v Speaker 6>trampoline,</v>

5103
02:24:49.261 --> 02:24:50.094
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5104
02:24:50.100 --> 02:24:52.080
<v Speaker 6>in effect that practically it doesn't matter.</v>

5105
02:24:52.081 --> 02:24:56.310
<v Speaker 6>But as far as doing the little things to battle against these forces that are</v>

5106
02:24:56.311 --> 02:24:57.900
<v Speaker 6>constantly looking to confine us,</v>

5107
02:24:58.380 --> 02:24:59.790
<v Speaker 6>I think maybe it matters.</v>

5108
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:00.391
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5109
02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:03.480
<v Speaker 6>like maybe pushing through these seemingly trivial things.</v>

5110
02:25:03.630 --> 02:25:04.463
<v Speaker 6>It counts.</v>

5111
02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:05.360
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5112
02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:06.193
<v Speaker 6>it's an exercise.</v>

5113
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:08.610
<v Speaker 6>Set yourself the task Aubrey,</v>

5114
02:25:08.611 --> 02:25:09.444
<v Speaker 6>to do that.</v>

5115
02:25:09.450 --> 02:25:09.931
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

5116
02:25:09.931 --> 02:25:10.381
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>

5117
02:25:10.381 --> 02:25:11.940
<v Speaker 6>I decided that like last,</v>

5118
02:25:11.970 --> 02:25:12.810
<v Speaker 6>like a few days ago,</v>

5119
02:25:12.811 --> 02:25:13.644
<v Speaker 6>I haven't been home yet.</v>

5120
02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:17.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm walking out to the trampoline and I'm pushing through that moment where my</v>

5121
02:25:17.161 --> 02:25:17.910
<v Speaker 6>legs just say,</v>

5122
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:18.420
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>

5123
02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:19.110
<v Speaker 6>nobody,</v>

5124
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:20.820
<v Speaker 6>you're not doing this and I'm going to do it.</v>

5125
02:25:20.821 --> 02:25:21.540
<v Speaker 6>I hope.</v>

5126
02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:22.373
<v Speaker 6>I hope I can.</v>

5127
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:23.291
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

5128
02:25:23.291 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 6>but I'll see y'all video.</v>

5129
02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:25.993
<v Speaker 3>Figure it out.</v>

5130
02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:29.900
<v Speaker 3>I would guess that the backflip is a metaphor for something else,</v>

5131
02:25:29.901 --> 02:25:30.171
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

5132
02:25:30.171 --> 02:25:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Stands for something.</v>

5133
02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:32.113
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5134
02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:33.080
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

5135
02:25:33.081 --> 02:25:33.950
<v Speaker 3>we all have that stuff.</v>

5136
02:25:33.951 --> 02:25:35.600
<v Speaker 3>For me it's like claustrophobia.</v>

5137
02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5138
02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:36.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5139
02:25:36.850 --> 02:25:37.311
<v Speaker 3>elevator,</v>

5140
02:25:37.311 --> 02:25:38.270
<v Speaker 3>certain elevators.</v>

5141
02:25:38.271 --> 02:25:40.190
<v Speaker 3>I can't get on airplanes,</v>

5142
02:25:40.191 --> 02:25:40.850
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5143
02:25:40.850 --> 02:25:43.280
<v Speaker 3>And I know that it's,</v>

5144
02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:45.560
<v Speaker 3>it relates to other stuff,</v>

5145
02:25:45.561 --> 02:25:45.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5146
02:25:45.801 --> 02:25:46.634
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

5147
02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:48.290
<v Speaker 3>it's not isolated.</v>

5148
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5149
02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done a sensory deprivation tank experience?</v>

5150
02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:51.991
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5151
02:25:51.991 --> 02:25:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Never have.</v>

5152
02:25:52.650 --> 02:25:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5153
02:25:53.130 --> 02:25:53.641
<v Speaker 1>you need to get,</v>

5154
02:25:53.641 --> 02:25:53.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5155
02:25:53.731 --> 02:25:54.180
<v Speaker 1>you do it.</v>

5156
02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:55.080
<v Speaker 1>If I hook it up for you,</v>

5157
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:56.023
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5158
02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't look like a claustrophobic in there.</v>

5159
02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:58.993
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

5160
02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:00.170
<v Speaker 5>You got we through that.</v>

5161
02:26:00.171 --> 02:26:00.441
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>

5162
02:26:00.441 --> 02:26:00.750
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

5163
02:26:00.750 --> 02:26:02.570
<v Speaker 5>Will tell me what is the walk?</v>

5164
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:07.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a tank that's filled with water and a,</v>

5165
02:26:07.210 --> 02:26:08.850
<v Speaker 1>you've ever seen the movie altered states?</v>

5166
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5167
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:10.583
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

5168
02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5169
02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:12.600
<v Speaker 1>is a tank filled with water?</v>

5170
02:26:12.601 --> 02:26:15.240
<v Speaker 1>The water's the same temperature as you're scanning and it's filled with salt.</v>

5171
02:26:15.570 --> 02:26:20.340
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a thousand pounds of salt in the water and you lie down in it</v>

5172
02:26:20.341 --> 02:26:21.510
<v Speaker 1>and you float,</v>

5173
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you float your above,</v>

5174
02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you breathe cause your,</v>

5175
02:26:24.090 --> 02:26:26.100
<v Speaker 1>your body is a half underwater.</v>

5176
02:26:26.250 --> 02:26:27.980
<v Speaker 1>But there's so it's so dense with salt,</v>

5177
02:26:27.981 --> 02:26:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the float,</v>

5178
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:32.040
<v Speaker 1>he closed the lid on the door and you're in complete silence.</v>

5179
02:26:32.041 --> 02:26:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Complete darkness.</v>

5180
02:26:32.971 --> 02:26:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Your ears are actually already</v>

5181
02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:35.760
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't panic.</v>

5182
02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Can we leave the door open?</v>

5183
02:26:37.211 --> 02:26:38.044
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>

5184
02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:38.913
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

5185
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:40.080
<v Speaker 5>How dare you not walked.</v>

5186
02:26:40.081 --> 02:26:41.740
<v Speaker 5>The walk is going on here.</v>

5187
02:26:41.741 --> 02:26:43.420
<v Speaker 5>We're learning so much about Steven Pressfield.</v>

5188
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:44.561
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5189
02:26:44.561 --> 02:26:45.394
<v Speaker 5>it's um,</v>

5190
02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:46.300
<v Speaker 1>but if you are,</v>

5191
02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:49.210
<v Speaker 1>if you really do have an issue with Claustrophobia,</v>

5192
02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:51.370
<v Speaker 1>that'd be the place to curate it with great way to get through it.</v>

5193
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:51.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5194
02:26:51.641 --> 02:26:54.400
<v Speaker 1>You'll get through it 100% because it's the most claustrophobic place in the</v>

5195
02:26:54.401 --> 02:26:54.910
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

5196
02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5197
02:26:55.170 --> 02:26:55.520
<v Speaker 1>sounds</v>

5198
02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:55.820
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

5199
02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:57.020
<v Speaker 5>Separates you from your body,</v>

5200
02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:01.120
<v Speaker 5>but they're amazing at a coffin.</v>

5201
02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:03.290
<v Speaker 5>Let me explain to you what it is.</v>

5202
02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:05.290
<v Speaker 1>The benefit is when you're in that water,</v>

5203
02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:06.490
<v Speaker 1>your water is,</v>

5204
02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:09.700
<v Speaker 1>the water is the same temperature as your skin so you don't feel the water.</v>

5205
02:27:09.701 --> 02:27:10.391
<v Speaker 1>You're floating,</v>

5206
02:27:10.391 --> 02:27:11.920
<v Speaker 1>so it's a feeling of weightlessness,</v>

5207
02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:12.971
<v Speaker 1>total silence,</v>

5208
02:27:12.971 --> 02:27:13.691
<v Speaker 1>total darkness,</v>

5209
02:27:13.691 --> 02:27:15.520
<v Speaker 1>a complete absence of sensory input.</v>

5210
02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.740
<v Speaker 1>So because there's nothing coming in,</v>

5211
02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:21.100
<v Speaker 1>your brain is so much more powerful.</v>

5212
02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:22.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

5213
02:27:22.061 --> 02:27:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like the way I describe it as like if we're having this conversation,</v>

5214
02:27:24.731 --> 02:27:25.870
<v Speaker 1>there was a Jack Hammer next door.</v>

5215
02:27:25.871 --> 02:27:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It'd be very hard to concentrate.</v>

5216
02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:29.470
<v Speaker 1>We would want to move away from the sound of that Jackhammer,</v>

5217
02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but life is a Jackhammer to Jackhammer on your ass.</v>

5218
02:27:32.111 --> 02:27:33.130
<v Speaker 1>When you're sitting in this chair,</v>

5219
02:27:33.430 --> 02:27:34.390
<v Speaker 1>like as we're sitting,</v>

5220
02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:37.210
<v Speaker 1>your ass is constantly sending signals like,</v>

5221
02:27:37.211 --> 02:27:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

5222
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:39.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a leather chair under my ass,</v>

5223
02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:39.581
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5224
02:27:39.581 --> 02:27:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5225
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:41.200
<v Speaker 1>These are things under my armpits.</v>

5226
02:27:41.201 --> 02:27:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Yet there's Aubrey.</v>

5227
02:27:42.370 --> 02:27:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5228
02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:43.810
<v Speaker 1>There's Steven Pressfield.</v>

5229
02:27:43.811 --> 02:27:44.030
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

5230
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:45.130
<v Speaker 1>this is a wood table.</v>

5231
02:27:45.130 --> 02:27:47.680
<v Speaker 1>There's the shit's all coming in and we just don't,</v>

5232
02:27:47.681 --> 02:27:49.150
<v Speaker 1>we just completely take it for granted.</v>

5233
02:27:49.180 --> 02:27:50.260
<v Speaker 1>When you're inside that tank,</v>

5234
02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:51.820
<v Speaker 1>nothing comes in.</v>

5235
02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:53.470
<v Speaker 1>You're floating in space,</v>

5236
02:27:53.471 --> 02:27:56.680
<v Speaker 1>completely weightless and in the absence of sensory input,</v>

5237
02:27:56.681 --> 02:28:01.510
<v Speaker 1>the mind becomes supercharged because the mind has all this resources that all</v>

5238
02:28:01.511 --> 02:28:04.450
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden are available that he thought it was going to have to deal with the</v>

5239
02:28:04.451 --> 02:28:08.650
<v Speaker 1>weight of the body and moving along the ground and avoiding objects and social</v>

5240
02:28:08.651 --> 02:28:11.050
<v Speaker 1>cues and all that stuff it doesn't have to deal with right now.</v>

5241
02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:15.070
<v Speaker 1>So the mind has all these resources free and you,</v>

5242
02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:18.160
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a very self examining self,</v>

5243
02:28:18.210 --> 02:28:18.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5244
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.911
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5245
02:28:18.911 --> 02:28:21.350
<v Speaker 1>objective analysis of a,</v>

5246
02:28:21.351 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>

5247
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It almost like a seminar on your life and then it becomes a psychedelic</v>

5248
02:28:25.221 --> 02:28:27.470
<v Speaker 1>experience and more comfortable you get with it.</v>

5249
02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:28.970
<v Speaker 1>The more you have like visions.</v>

5250
02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:30.650
<v Speaker 1>But I think for you creatively,</v>

5251
02:28:30.651 --> 02:28:30.921
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5252
02:28:30.921 --> 02:28:34.610
<v Speaker 1>the things that you would come up with inside of that tank would be amazing.</v>

5253
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Once you got over it,</v>

5254
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:36.880
<v Speaker 1>he got a couple of bucks by</v>

5255
02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:38.153
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5256
02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:40.600
<v Speaker 6>have a panic button put in amuses.</v>

5257
02:28:40.650 --> 02:28:42.920
<v Speaker 6>They're ready to visit tab and start seeing Steve.</v>

5258
02:28:43.710 --> 02:28:45.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to force you to walk the walk.</v>

5259
02:28:45.201 --> 02:28:46.034
<v Speaker 6>Sir.</v>

5260
02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:47.000
<v Speaker 6>This is ridiculous.</v>

5261
02:28:47.001 --> 02:28:47.834
<v Speaker 6>You need to get in there.</v>

5262
02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:49.470
<v Speaker 6>Aubrey's done it.</v>

5263
02:28:49.470 --> 02:28:50.303
<v Speaker 6>He loves it.</v>

5264
02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:50.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5265
02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:51.260
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

5266
02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:52.790
<v Speaker 6>it's a really interesting experience.</v>

5267
02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:54.800
<v Speaker 6>I think the same for these fears.</v>

5268
02:28:54.801 --> 02:28:56.000
<v Speaker 6>There's our superstitions.</v>

5269
02:28:56.001 --> 02:28:59.780
<v Speaker 6>I've realized too that you allow these superstitions to persist and that's just</v>

5270
02:28:59.781 --> 02:29:01.190
<v Speaker 6>another head on the,</v>

5271
02:29:01.191 --> 02:29:02.570
<v Speaker 6>on the resistance hydra,</v>

5272
02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:03.630
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

5273
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:04.020
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5274
02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:07.690
<v Speaker 6>and I noticed this of compulsive shit that people do today,</v>

5275
02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:08.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5276
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.930
<v Speaker 6>today was,</v>

5277
02:29:08.930 --> 02:29:09.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5278
02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:13.040
<v Speaker 6>it's a podcast where I'm reaching them a lot of people and so I'm kind of amped</v>

5279
02:29:13.041 --> 02:29:13.281
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>

5280
02:29:13.281 --> 02:29:15.290
<v Speaker 6>And so I was picking my Kombucha is,</v>

5281
02:29:15.291 --> 02:29:16.100
<v Speaker 6>and I was like,</v>

5282
02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:16.251
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

5283
02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:17.180
<v Speaker 6>which one should I pick?</v>

5284
02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:18.230
<v Speaker 6>And then all of a sudden I was like,</v>

5285
02:29:18.410 --> 02:29:20.270
<v Speaker 6>well maybe I should pick this one over this when I was like,</v>

5286
02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:21.050
<v Speaker 6>hey dummy,</v>

5287
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:22.490
<v Speaker 6>like stop being superstitious.</v>

5288
02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:24.680
<v Speaker 6>They're all this things like it doesn't matter.</v>

5289
02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:26.600
<v Speaker 6>We're thinking that if you got the wrong one,</v>

5290
02:29:26.601 --> 02:29:28.010
<v Speaker 6>you'd have a bad time on the show.</v>

5291
02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:28.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5292
02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:30.020
<v Speaker 6>Maybe not all that far,</v>

5293
02:29:30.021 --> 02:29:30.471
<v Speaker 6>but I was like,</v>

5294
02:29:30.471 --> 02:29:32.360
<v Speaker 6>this one has better than the other one.</v>

5295
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:33.191
<v Speaker 6>And then I did,</v>

5296
02:29:33.191 --> 02:29:34.790
<v Speaker 6>I just stopped myself and I was like,</v>

5297
02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:37.280
<v Speaker 6>just because there's like a pressure to vent,</v>

5298
02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:39.380
<v Speaker 6>all these little things will come out.</v>

5299
02:29:39.381 --> 02:29:39.771
<v Speaker 6>They normally,</v>

5300
02:29:39.771 --> 02:29:41.480
<v Speaker 6>normally I'd just rip that thing off the shelf,</v>

5301
02:29:41.481 --> 02:29:42.350
<v Speaker 6>never think about it.</v>

5302
02:29:42.590 --> 02:29:43.580
<v Speaker 6>But because you know,</v>

5303
02:29:43.610 --> 02:29:44.181
<v Speaker 6>as you said,</v>

5304
02:29:44.181 --> 02:29:48.620
<v Speaker 6>you're moving from lower to higher and I'm trying to bring my best self to this,</v>

5305
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:49.603
<v Speaker 6>to this show,</v>

5306
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:50.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5307
02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:53.630
<v Speaker 6>I was like stressed about these little things and then I had to stop myself and</v>

5308
02:29:53.631 --> 02:29:53.751
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>

5309
02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:54.110
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

5310
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.921
<v Speaker 6>this is bullshit.</v>

5311
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:58.280
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't allow these trivial things to bother you.</v>

5312
02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:02.540
<v Speaker 6>It's just another form of resistance in this point because the pressure's on.</v>

5313
02:30:02.541 --> 02:30:03.560
<v Speaker 6>So your mind's like,</v>

5314
02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:07.760
<v Speaker 6>oh there's a lock and omens and if the birds fly this way or that way,</v>

5315
02:30:07.970 --> 02:30:09.230
<v Speaker 6>you got to get rid of that shit too.</v>

5316
02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:09.890
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5317
02:30:09.890 --> 02:30:12.770
<v Speaker 6>these trivial fears and these trivial superstitions,</v>

5318
02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:13.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5319
02:30:13.350 --> 02:30:15.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm really think that you got to cut those out,</v>

5320
02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:16.041
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5321
02:30:16.041 --> 02:30:17.240
<v Speaker 6>and just ruthlessly,</v>

5322
02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:20.120
<v Speaker 6>but I'll take the other side of that,</v>

5323
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:21.110
<v Speaker 6>getting that topic.</v>

5324
02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:22.233
<v Speaker 6>I think</v>

5325
02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:26.370
<v Speaker 3>there is luck and I think there is funkshway or whatever it is.</v>

5326
02:30:26.371 --> 02:30:26.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5327
02:30:26.581 --> 02:30:29.100
<v Speaker 3>if you think about people are getting married,</v>

5328
02:30:29.101 --> 02:30:29.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5329
02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:34.050
<v Speaker 3>A couples getting married put in tremendous thought rossed me,</v>

5330
02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:39.140
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't everybody puts your thought into what day are we getting married or</v>

5331
02:30:39.141 --> 02:30:40.680
<v Speaker 3>where are we getting married?</v>

5332
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to get on a cliff and Malibu or whatever it is and why did they do</v>

5333
02:30:44.851 --> 02:30:45.061
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

5334
02:30:45.061 --> 02:30:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Because it's going to be either lucky,</v>

5335
02:30:46.681 --> 02:30:47.850
<v Speaker 3>it'll be lucky for them.</v>

5336
02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Or like when you're naming a child and you're trying to say,</v>

5337
02:30:51.571 --> 02:30:53.760
<v Speaker 3>well what name am I going to give this child?</v>

5338
02:30:53.761 --> 02:30:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

5339
02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:55.081
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>

5340
02:30:55.081 --> 02:30:56.160
<v Speaker 3>What do you think so or not?</v>

5341
02:30:56.161 --> 02:30:57.360
<v Speaker 3>You feel like shit,</v>

5342
02:30:57.361 --> 02:30:59.970
<v Speaker 3>if I gave this my daughter the wrong name,</v>

5343
02:31:00.210 --> 02:31:04.440
<v Speaker 3>it's going to fuck up her entire life has changed with the armory or vice versa.</v>

5344
02:31:05.430 --> 02:31:06.420
<v Speaker 3>The right name.</v>

5345
02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:07.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5346
02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:10.590
<v Speaker 3>So I mean you're saying that you were saying before,</v>

5347
02:31:10.591 --> 02:31:11.160
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

5348
02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:14.320
<v Speaker 3>that there are dragons possibly flying through the air that we just can't see</v>

5349
02:31:14.321 --> 02:31:16.410
<v Speaker 3>you right now cause we're not in a psychedelic state.</v>

5350
02:31:16.770 --> 02:31:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't it true that there's luck in,</v>

5351
02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:20.370
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

5352
02:31:20.370 --> 02:31:20.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5353
02:31:20.701 --> 02:31:22.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean certainly the Chinese Japanese believe in it,</v>

5354
02:31:22.861 --> 02:31:23.071
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5355
02:31:23.071 --> 02:31:23.461
<v Speaker 6>You get,</v>

5356
02:31:23.461 --> 02:31:24.294
<v Speaker 6>I just think it's,</v>

5357
02:31:24.410 --> 02:31:26.580
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a slippery slope and it can,</v>

5358
02:31:26.581 --> 02:31:27.414
<v Speaker 6>it can,</v>

5359
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.931
<v Speaker 6>it can be a virtual,</v>

5360
02:31:29.931 --> 02:31:32.010
<v Speaker 6>you look like someone like Raffi on the doll.</v>

5361
02:31:32.011 --> 02:31:33.210
<v Speaker 6>It's somehow he makes it works,</v>

5362
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:35.130
<v Speaker 6>but he's got a tie in retires shoe,</v>

5363
02:31:35.310 --> 02:31:35.611
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5364
02:31:35.611 --> 02:31:37.560
<v Speaker 6>12 times to get it right.</v>

5365
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.831
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5366
02:31:37.831 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 6>if he doesn't get it right,</v>

5367
02:31:38.671 --> 02:31:39.660
<v Speaker 6>he's not going to play that point.</v>

5368
02:31:39.661 --> 02:31:40.200
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5369
02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:40.411
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5370
02:31:40.411 --> 02:31:41.640
<v Speaker 6>and he's going to have you get,</v>

5371
02:31:41.641 --> 02:31:44.460
<v Speaker 6>you can bring it to its logical conclusion.</v>

5372
02:31:44.461 --> 02:31:45.560
<v Speaker 6>You can take it to floats.</v>

5373
02:31:45.561 --> 02:31:45.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5374
02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:49.860
<v Speaker 6>It's logical conclusion is always in the realm of wackiness that there's nothing</v>

5375
02:31:49.861 --> 02:31:50.610
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

5376
02:31:50.610 --> 02:31:50.941
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

5377
02:31:50.941 --> 02:31:51.251
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5378
02:31:51.251 --> 02:31:51.690
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5379
02:31:51.690 --> 02:31:52.441
<v Speaker 6>I can't prove it,</v>

5380
02:31:52.441 --> 02:31:53.360
<v Speaker 6>but I think they're shopping.</v>

5381
02:31:53.361 --> 02:31:54.960
<v Speaker 6>I think it has to do a lot more.</v>

5382
02:31:54.961 --> 02:31:55.231
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5383
02:31:55.231 --> 02:31:55.281
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5384
02:31:55.281 --> 02:31:58.210
<v Speaker 6>I think it has a lot more to do with your own kind of intent.</v>

5385
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.650
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5386
02:31:58.650 --> 02:31:59.371
<v Speaker 6>when I go to Vegas,</v>

5387
02:31:59.371 --> 02:32:01.410
<v Speaker 6>the only game I like to play is crap.</v>

5388
02:32:01.411 --> 02:32:04.080
<v Speaker 6>So anybody who's played enough craps and rolled the dice,</v>

5389
02:32:04.081 --> 02:32:05.160
<v Speaker 6>you gotta be a little bit,</v>

5390
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:06.690
<v Speaker 6>you've got to believe in La a little bit.</v>

5391
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:06.940
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5392
02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:09.960
<v Speaker 6>you'll feel these moments where you just feel invincible.</v>

5393
02:32:10.310 --> 02:32:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Cool you.</v>

5394
02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I was out pool tool as well.</v>

5395
02:32:12.301 --> 02:32:12.601
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

5396
02:32:12.601 --> 02:32:15.060
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys who a w when you play nine ball,</v>

5397
02:32:15.061 --> 02:32:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I play in a lot of tournaments and nine balls.</v>

5398
02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:19.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of luck involved in nine ball.</v>

5399
02:32:19.111 --> 02:32:21.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of skill because he played from one to nine,</v>

5400
02:32:21.690 --> 02:32:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but any ball that goes in,</v>

5401
02:32:23.791 --> 02:32:25.920
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't make it on purpose,</v>

5402
02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:27.780
<v Speaker 1>it counts including the nine ball,</v>

5403
02:32:27.781 --> 02:32:28.830
<v Speaker 1>which is the game winning ball.</v>

5404
02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So there's some guys that just ride the nine ball like he,</v>

5405
02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:33.400
<v Speaker 1>they get ball in hand when they scratch.</v>

5406
02:32:33.401 --> 02:32:36.230
<v Speaker 1>So they'll set up a ball behind another ball and just whacked that ball and the</v>

5407
02:32:36.231 --> 02:32:39.090
<v Speaker 1>nine ball hoping it bounces around the table and falls in somewhere.</v>

5408
02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:39.601
<v Speaker 1>Because if it does,</v>

5409
02:32:39.601 --> 02:32:40.350
<v Speaker 1>they win.</v>

5410
02:32:40.350 --> 02:32:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And there's this one motherfucker that I play in this front of it with that</v>

5411
02:32:43.291 --> 02:32:47.610
<v Speaker 1>drives everybody crazy because every time he gets cue ball in hand,</v>

5412
02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:49.920
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if there's three balls in the table,</v>

5413
02:32:49.921 --> 02:32:50.754
<v Speaker 1>one of them is the nine,</v>

5414
02:32:50.910 --> 02:32:54.660
<v Speaker 1>he sends up all in it and I wax it and lets it fly her out.</v>

5415
02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:57.060
<v Speaker 1>But when he's on a hot streak,</v>

5416
02:32:57.150 --> 02:32:58.170
<v Speaker 1>they fall,</v>

5417
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:59.730
<v Speaker 1>they fall like rain.</v>

5418
02:32:59.910 --> 02:33:00.241
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

5419
02:33:00.241 --> 02:33:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it happen and I've seen this where people go,</v>

5420
02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:04.170
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

5421
02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:04.951
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

5422
02:33:04.951 --> 02:33:06.420
<v Speaker 1>just one again.</v>

5423
02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:06.661
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5424
02:33:06.661 --> 02:33:07.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5425
02:33:07.051 --> 02:33:09.390
<v Speaker 1>and he won by just total luck.</v>

5426
02:33:09.391 --> 02:33:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Just crashing the balls together.</v>

5427
02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:14.370
<v Speaker 1>And that nine ball finds a way into a hole somewhere and he,</v>

5428
02:33:14.371 --> 02:33:15.181
<v Speaker 1>when he's on,</v>

5429
02:33:15.181 --> 02:33:16.080
<v Speaker 1>it's tangible.</v>

5430
02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:16.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5431
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.960
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5432
02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:18.560
<v Speaker 6>and to me the distinction is,</v>

5433
02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:20.570
<v Speaker 6>is you're putting out your own internet,</v>

5434
02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:21.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5435
02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:22.160
<v Speaker 6>and I think there it is,</v>

5436
02:33:22.370 --> 02:33:24.080
<v Speaker 6>there is a key in the universe there.</v>

5437
02:33:24.081 --> 02:33:24.914
<v Speaker 6>There's kind of a,</v>

5438
02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:29.570
<v Speaker 6>an access point where if you put your intent and put your belief in into that,</v>

5439
02:33:29.571 --> 02:33:30.560
<v Speaker 6>whether you're rolling dice,</v>

5440
02:33:30.890 --> 02:33:31.581
<v Speaker 6>I do,</v>

5441
02:33:31.581 --> 02:33:32.750
<v Speaker 6>and it gets a little fuzzy here,</v>

5442
02:33:32.751 --> 02:33:35.000
<v Speaker 6>but I believe that there are some forces at work,</v>

5443
02:33:35.001 --> 02:33:40.001
<v Speaker 6>this kind of momentum force that causes seemingly chance events to more line up</v>

5444
02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:41.144
<v Speaker 6>in your way.</v>

5445
02:33:41.210 --> 02:33:43.130
<v Speaker 6>And I know this is a very controversial topic,</v>

5446
02:33:43.131 --> 02:33:45.260
<v Speaker 6>but it just feels that's the way I can't,</v>

5447
02:33:45.261 --> 02:33:46.280
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't prove it of course,</v>

5448
02:33:46.281 --> 02:33:49.280
<v Speaker 6>but that's the way it feels to me when I'm in those moments.</v>

5449
02:33:49.281 --> 02:33:50.060
<v Speaker 6>You know where,</v>

5450
02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:53.600
<v Speaker 6>where he feels like you can control things that you would think are out of your</v>

5451
02:33:53.601 --> 02:33:55.970
<v Speaker 6>control by the will of your own intent and belief.</v>

5452
02:33:55.971 --> 02:33:56.540
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>

5453
02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:56.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5454
02:33:56.751 --> 02:33:57.710
<v Speaker 6>not just my belief.</v>

5455
02:33:57.711 --> 02:34:00.840
<v Speaker 6>That's the belief of many of the shamanistic cultures that</v>

5456
02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:03.450
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting.</v>

5457
02:34:03.451 --> 02:34:05.190
<v Speaker 1>That can't be statistically proven.</v>

5458
02:34:05.310 --> 02:34:06.061
<v Speaker 1>What's really interesting,</v>

5459
02:34:06.061 --> 02:34:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I had a Sam Harris on the podcast.</v>

5460
02:34:07.851 --> 02:34:08.020
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

5461
02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:11.370
<v Speaker 1>he's coming back again at the end of this month and he was talking about the hot</v>

5462
02:34:11.371 --> 02:34:11.960
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

5463
02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:14.430
<v Speaker 1>a phenomena of basketball.</v>

5464
02:34:14.610 --> 02:34:15.510
<v Speaker 1>We're guys just,</v>

5465
02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:16.440
<v Speaker 1>just all net.</v>

5466
02:34:16.890 --> 02:34:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5467
02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:19.480
<v Speaker 1>they just can't miss statistically.</v>

5468
02:34:19.481 --> 02:34:20.314
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>

5469
02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:20.561
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5470
02:34:20.561 --> 02:34:20.690
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

5471
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:21.001
<v Speaker 6>Did that,</v>

5472
02:34:21.001 --> 02:34:21.521
<v Speaker 6>that study,</v>

5473
02:34:21.521 --> 02:34:24.490
<v Speaker 6>I have a big problem with that study because the way they helped me,</v>

5474
02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:29.140
<v Speaker 6>the way they did that study as they measured the hot hand by when three baskets</v>

5475
02:34:29.141 --> 02:34:29.974
<v Speaker 6>in a row when it,</v>

5476
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.640
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5477
02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:32.920
<v Speaker 6>anybody who's played basketball knows I can be,</v>

5478
02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:36.220
<v Speaker 6>have my head in my ass and make three baskets in a row.</v>

5479
02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:37.810
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean I have the hot hand.</v>

5480
02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:40.600
<v Speaker 6>Only you know when you have the hot hand,</v>

5481
02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:41.860
<v Speaker 6>like you feel it,</v>

5482
02:34:41.861 --> 02:34:43.150
<v Speaker 6>it feels sensibly different.</v>

5483
02:34:43.210 --> 02:34:44.140
<v Speaker 6>Same like in pool.</v>

5484
02:34:44.141 --> 02:34:46.330
<v Speaker 6>If you are going to measure people who are on a,</v>

5485
02:34:46.331 --> 02:34:48.400
<v Speaker 6>on the role and pool and measuring it by,</v>

5486
02:34:48.401 --> 02:34:48.641
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

5487
02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:50.760
<v Speaker 6>The person who after they run five,</v>

5488
02:34:50.770 --> 02:34:51.760
<v Speaker 6>four or five balls,</v>

5489
02:34:51.761 --> 02:34:54.820
<v Speaker 6>well it could have been an easy run that you just hit five balls.</v>

5490
02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:55.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5491
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:57.600
<v Speaker 6>When you're in the zone and you're really feeling it,</v>

5492
02:34:57.601 --> 02:34:58.540
<v Speaker 6>it's a different thing.</v>

5493
02:34:58.570 --> 02:34:59.381
<v Speaker 6>You're absolutely right.</v>

5494
02:34:59.381 --> 02:35:00.160
<v Speaker 6>So they have to,</v>

5495
02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:03.160
<v Speaker 6>you'd have to basically go to basketball players and say are,</v>

5496
02:35:03.161 --> 02:35:03.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5497
02:35:03.371 --> 02:35:04.360
<v Speaker 6>they'd have to hold up a little,</v>

5498
02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:05.200
<v Speaker 6>push a little button,</v>

5499
02:35:05.201 --> 02:35:05.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5500
02:35:05.530 --> 02:35:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and he know.</v>

5501
02:35:05.930 --> 02:35:08.660
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that it would fuck up.</v>

5502
02:35:08.661 --> 02:35:09.494
<v Speaker 1>There's all,</v>

5503
02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:11.150
<v Speaker 1>there's moments that you have in food,</v>

5504
02:35:11.151 --> 02:35:11.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5505
02:35:11.391 --> 02:35:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5506
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:13.310
<v Speaker 1>there was a moment I was playing in pool.</v>

5507
02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5508
02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it was me and my friend Eric [inaudible].</v>

5509
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.891
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>

5510
02:35:15.891 --> 02:35:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Chris is the guy who,</v>

5511
02:35:17.091 --> 02:35:17.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5512
02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>he's a Q maker,</v>

5513
02:35:18.231 --> 02:35:19.190
<v Speaker 1>make sugar tree cues.</v>

5514
02:35:19.650 --> 02:35:24.230
<v Speaker 1>We were playing and I was fucking running out like every time I got to the</v>

5515
02:35:24.231 --> 02:35:24.800
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

5516
02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:25.760
<v Speaker 1>if you left me a shot,</v>

5517
02:35:25.761 --> 02:35:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I was running out like a pro and we're playing on a tight diamond.</v>

5518
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:29.750
<v Speaker 1>But it was craziness.</v>

5519
02:35:29.751 --> 02:35:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5520
02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't miss,</v>

5521
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I just had have this feel of where the ball,</v>

5522
02:35:33.530 --> 02:35:37.460
<v Speaker 1>we had been playing for like seven hours and I was just completely lubed up high</v>

5523
02:35:37.461 --> 02:35:39.350
<v Speaker 1>as all hell.</v>

5524
02:35:39.770 --> 02:35:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And I just had this zone.</v>

5525
02:35:41.841 --> 02:35:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I had this feel for where the ball was going.</v>

5526
02:35:43.881 --> 02:35:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I knew exactly where it was going at all times.</v>

5527
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it forever.</v>

5528
02:35:46.970 --> 02:35:49.970
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day I played again and I was terrible for like the first two</v>

5529
02:35:49.971 --> 02:35:52.580
<v Speaker 1>hour only had two hours to play that time and I couldn't get it back.</v>

5530
02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:53.493
<v Speaker 1>A good was gone,</v>

5531
02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:55.940
<v Speaker 1>but I know it was there the night before it was there.</v>

5532
02:35:55.941 --> 02:35:56.241
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

5533
02:35:56.241 --> 02:35:56.661
<v Speaker 1>It was there.</v>

5534
02:35:56.661 --> 02:35:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And because even he was going,</v>

5535
02:35:57.891 --> 02:35:58.724
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

5536
02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:00.320
<v Speaker 1>like I never seen you play as good before.</v>

5537
02:36:00.321 --> 02:36:00.591
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

5538
02:36:00.591 --> 02:36:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I've never played this good before.</v>

5539
02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:02.811
<v Speaker 1>It's never happened.</v>

5540
02:36:02.811 --> 02:36:03.740
<v Speaker 1>But I'm in that thing.</v>

5541
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

5542
02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do it right now.</v>

5543
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It's locked in to zone.</v>

5544
02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:10.040
<v Speaker 1>What is Daniel only feel it?</v>

5545
02:36:10.130 --> 02:36:10.830
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

5546
02:36:10.830 --> 02:36:11.120
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

5547
02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:11.630
<v Speaker 1>That zone.</v>

5548
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:12.261
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

5549
02:36:12.261 --> 02:36:12.591
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5550
02:36:12.591 --> 02:36:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I made it.</v>

5551
02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Look just what you're talking about Joe,</v>

5552
02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:16.040
<v Speaker 3>you get into that place where the,</v>

5553
02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:16.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5554
02:36:16.370 --> 02:36:17.203
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

5555
02:36:17.210 --> 02:36:18.620
<v Speaker 3>the mind boy goes away.</v>

5556
02:36:18.650 --> 02:36:20.030
<v Speaker 3>That's not loving your tapping.</v>

5557
02:36:20.410 --> 02:36:21.110
<v Speaker 3>That's not luck.</v>

5558
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.261
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5559
02:36:21.261 --> 02:36:22.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is luck.</v>

5560
02:36:22.251 --> 02:36:22.760
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5561
02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:23.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5562
02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure what it is,</v>

5563
02:36:23.961 --> 02:36:28.310
<v Speaker 3>but something lines up with something because we've all been there one way or</v>

5564
02:36:28.311 --> 02:36:28.581
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

5565
02:36:28.581 --> 02:36:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Stephen King saying that he didn't even remember certain books that he wrote</v>

5566
02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:33.471
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>

5567
02:36:33.471 --> 02:36:34.340
<v Speaker 3>that's where he was.</v>

5568
02:36:34.430 --> 02:36:35.090
<v Speaker 3>That lockers,</v>

5569
02:36:35.090 --> 02:36:35.923
<v Speaker 3>that cocaine,</v>

5570
02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:38.620
<v Speaker 3>whatever the zone is,</v>

5571
02:36:40.050 --> 02:36:41.840
<v Speaker 3>cocaine is never connected.</v>

5572
02:36:41.841 --> 02:36:42.674
<v Speaker 3>The luck.</v>

5573
02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5574
02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:45.510
<v Speaker 1>that's zone.</v>

5575
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:46.830
<v Speaker 6>It's your authentic swing.</v>

5576
02:36:46.831 --> 02:36:50.580
<v Speaker 6>It's when you're really in the doing what it is that you do and nothing else is</v>

5577
02:36:50.581 --> 02:36:51.414
<v Speaker 6>blocking you.</v>

5578
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5579
02:36:51.831 --> 02:36:52.460
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

5580
02:36:52.460 --> 02:36:53.990
<v Speaker 1>It's also with pool.</v>

5581
02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:54.590
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5582
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:55.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5583
02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:58.320
<v Speaker 1>it's processing information because there is information,</v>

5584
02:36:58.321 --> 02:36:59.930
<v Speaker 1>information's coming back from the queue,</v>

5585
02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:02.240
<v Speaker 1>there's information that's coming back from your arm,</v>

5586
02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:03.260
<v Speaker 1>your hands,</v>

5587
02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:07.310
<v Speaker 1>and then when you processed that information over a long period of time,</v>

5588
02:37:07.311 --> 02:37:12.311
<v Speaker 1>then you get so much data that you really understand the dynamics of the table.</v>

5589
02:37:13.011 --> 02:37:14.930
<v Speaker 1>You'll really understand the mechanics of your,</v>

5590
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:17.990
<v Speaker 1>you really understand how hard exactly.</v>

5591
02:37:17.991 --> 02:37:20.030
<v Speaker 1>You have to hit that ball to make it travel.</v>

5592
02:37:20.031 --> 02:37:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly as far as you want it to.</v>

5593
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:24.800
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird thing that goes on and then,</v>

5594
02:37:24.850 --> 02:37:28.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's this tipping point moment where you're accumulating,</v>

5595
02:37:28.251 --> 02:37:28.821
<v Speaker 1>accumulating,</v>

5596
02:37:28.821 --> 02:37:29.631
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's gradual,</v>

5597
02:37:29.631 --> 02:37:30.140
<v Speaker 1>more data,</v>

5598
02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:32.640
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden it hits a tipping point where your deer,</v>

5599
02:37:32.650 --> 02:37:33.680
<v Speaker 1>they're gone.</v>

5600
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

5601
02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:37.070
<v Speaker 1>that's where the weirdness happens.</v>

5602
02:37:37.071 --> 02:37:38.920
<v Speaker 1>That's where I think there is a little bit of magic.</v>

5603
02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I think about pool much like everything else is that there's this mindset that</v>

5604
02:37:44.031 --> 02:37:47.330
<v Speaker 1>must be maintained and if you think you're going to miss,</v>

5605
02:37:47.420 --> 02:37:48.620
<v Speaker 1>you'll fucking miss.</v>

5606
02:37:48.890 --> 02:37:50.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird thing about pool.</v>

5607
02:37:50.271 --> 02:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>You could line it up,</v>

5608
02:37:51.171 --> 02:37:51.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5609
02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Everything's telling you like,</v>

5610
02:37:52.671 --> 02:37:53.121
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

5611
02:37:53.121 --> 02:37:54.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to mess by blank.</v>

5612
02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:55.633
<v Speaker 1>And you miss.</v>

5613
02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:56.810
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

5614
02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:57.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5615
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:59.390
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's such a straightforward thing.</v>

5616
02:37:59.570 --> 02:38:00.630
<v Speaker 1>The arm moves straight,</v>

5617
02:38:00.631 --> 02:38:01.461
<v Speaker 1>it hits into the ball,</v>

5618
02:38:01.461 --> 02:38:02.360
<v Speaker 1>the ball goes straight.</v>

5619
02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

5620
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:04.220
<v Speaker 1>If you think you're going to miss,</v>

5621
02:38:04.250 --> 02:38:06.230
<v Speaker 1>if you decide right before you're doing it,</v>

5622
02:38:06.350 --> 02:38:06.741
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

5623
02:38:06.741 --> 02:38:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I hope I don't miss.</v>

5624
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:08.420
<v Speaker 1>You're going to miss.</v>

5625
02:38:08.450 --> 02:38:09.740
<v Speaker 1>So how do you diffuse that?</v>

5626
02:38:09.741 --> 02:38:12.800
<v Speaker 1>When that little nasty devil comes up either in writing or in Pool,</v>

5627
02:38:12.801 --> 02:38:15.560
<v Speaker 1>how do you diffuse that little voice that comes up</v>

5628
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:17.730
<v Speaker 7>that seems to be a self prophecy.</v>

5629
02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:18.890
<v Speaker 7>How you've done it,</v>

5630
02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:19.730
<v Speaker 7>you've done it,</v>

5631
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:19.971
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5632
02:38:19.971 --> 02:38:23.060
<v Speaker 7>I mean there must have been voices at times it's say and it is a form of</v>

5633
02:38:23.061 --> 02:38:23.601
<v Speaker 7>resistance,</v>

5634
02:38:23.601 --> 02:38:23.990
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

5635
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:25.070
<v Speaker 7>Well the thing about writing,</v>

5636
02:38:25.071 --> 02:38:25.401
<v Speaker 7>of course,</v>

5637
02:38:25.401 --> 02:38:26.720
<v Speaker 7>this is always rewriting.</v>

5638
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:29.800
<v Speaker 7>It's not like shoot shooting pool and yeah,</v>

5639
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:30.651
<v Speaker 7>one moment,</v>

5640
02:38:30.651 --> 02:38:31.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

5641
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:32.810
<v Speaker 7>you could screw it up in a,</v>

5642
02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:34.850
<v Speaker 7>come back tomorrow and do it a little better.</v>

5643
02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:35.690
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5644
02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:36.920
<v Speaker 7>That's the great thing about writing.</v>

5645
02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:38.900
<v Speaker 7>So what about when you're taking that shot,</v>

5646
02:38:38.901 --> 02:38:39.081
<v Speaker 7>Joe,</v>

5647
02:38:39.081 --> 02:38:40.730
<v Speaker 7>and you get that little nasty voice.</v>

5648
02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:41.240
<v Speaker 7>How do you</v>

5649
02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:42.160
<v Speaker 1>reset yourself?</v>

5650
02:38:42.260 --> 02:38:43.093
<v Speaker 1>I stop,</v>

5651
02:38:43.390 --> 02:38:44.223
<v Speaker 1>I stop.</v>

5652
02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I stopped the voice first of all.</v>

5653
02:38:45.921 --> 02:38:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

5654
02:38:46.470 --> 02:38:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I usually sit up for a second,</v>

5655
02:38:48.350 --> 02:38:49.520
<v Speaker 1>stroke my cue again,</v>

5656
02:38:49.521 --> 02:38:50.090
<v Speaker 1>put it down.</v>

5657
02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I go through like the whole reset through.</v>

5658
02:38:52.170 --> 02:38:53.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important thing.</v>

5659
02:38:53.421 --> 02:38:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Professionals will tell you that people actually coach that.</v>

5660
02:38:55.491 --> 02:38:55.881
<v Speaker 1>Like Max.</v>

5661
02:38:55.881 --> 02:38:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I really coaches that,</v>

5662
02:38:57.020 --> 02:38:57.261
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5663
02:38:57.261 --> 02:38:57.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5664
02:38:57.471 --> 02:38:58.460
<v Speaker 1>when you're down a shot,</v>

5665
02:38:58.461 --> 02:38:59.181
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like it,</v>

5666
02:38:59.181 --> 02:39:02.360
<v Speaker 1>stand up and then begin your whole pre shot ritual again,</v>

5667
02:39:02.390 --> 02:39:03.470
<v Speaker 1>get back into position.</v>

5668
02:39:03.471 --> 02:39:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Make sure your arms in line you accusing in line.</v>

5669
02:39:05.810 --> 02:39:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Go back again and approach it the same way.</v>

5670
02:39:07.431 --> 02:39:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever take a shot where you think you're going to miss,</v>

5671
02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:10.370
<v Speaker 1>but I've done it.</v>

5672
02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it tonight.</v>

5673
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:12.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5674
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I do it every time I play.</v>

5675
02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:14.151
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5676
02:39:14.151 --> 02:39:14.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5677
02:39:14.700 --> 02:39:15.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5678
02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:15.291
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5679
02:39:15.291 --> 02:39:15.771
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

5680
02:39:15.771 --> 02:39:16.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a swim.</v>

5681
02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not a mountain climb.</v>

5682
02:39:18.020 --> 02:39:19.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to the time of plants a flag.</v>

5683
02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:20.720
<v Speaker 1>You never win.</v>

5684
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:21.680
<v Speaker 1>You never win.</v>

5685
02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:22.670
<v Speaker 1>You never win with anything.</v>

5686
02:39:22.671 --> 02:39:23.660
<v Speaker 1>You just gotta keep going.</v>

5687
02:39:23.930 --> 02:39:24.401
<v Speaker 1>You'll Gig,</v>

5688
02:39:24.401 --> 02:39:25.880
<v Speaker 1>you get way better than you used to be.</v>

5689
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.721
<v Speaker 1>But there's still,</v>

5690
02:39:26.721 --> 02:39:27.050
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

5691
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:28.370
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're pushing yourself,</v>

5692
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:29.870
<v Speaker 1>as long as you just still trying to create,</v>

5693
02:39:29.871 --> 02:39:32.180
<v Speaker 1>as long as you still trying to get movement going,</v>

5694
02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:32.990
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

5695
02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:34.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna work all the time.</v>

5696
02:39:34.101 --> 02:39:35.720
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be flubs.</v>

5697
02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:38.810
<v Speaker 1>But those flubs I love him because those,</v>

5698
02:39:38.930 --> 02:39:41.130
<v Speaker 1>those signal growth moments for me that the,</v>

5699
02:39:41.140 --> 02:39:41.271
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5700
02:39:41.271 --> 02:39:41.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5701
02:39:41.410 --> 02:39:43.790
<v Speaker 1>at least that's how I have a managed to,</v>

5702
02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:44.440
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

5703
02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:44.690
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

5704
02:39:44.690 --> 02:39:45.620
<v Speaker 1>to navigate them.</v>

5705
02:39:45.770 --> 02:39:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Every time I fucked something up,</v>

5706
02:39:47.091 --> 02:39:51.050
<v Speaker 1>like I can look back in my career as a comedian and my biggest growth periods</v>

5707
02:39:51.051 --> 02:39:53.600
<v Speaker 1>came after I fucking ate a plate of shit on stage.</v>

5708
02:39:54.020 --> 02:39:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>

5709
02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:54.711
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

5710
02:39:54.711 --> 02:39:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that ever again.</v>

5711
02:39:56.510 --> 02:40:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And then I figured it out and even like weird sets today like that or it was</v>

5712
02:40:00.071 --> 02:40:03.470
<v Speaker 1>like mediocre or I don't like see things didn't come together right.</v>

5713
02:40:03.471 --> 02:40:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Or I was tired or I wasn't in comedy shape.</v>

5714
02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Who does things fucking fire me up,</v>

5715

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5716

5717
02:40:09.511 --> 02:40:10.700
<v Speaker 1>That makes me want to perform more.</v>
