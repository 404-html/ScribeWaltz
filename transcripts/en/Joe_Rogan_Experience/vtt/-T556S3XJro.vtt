00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the neuroscience stuff is like my bread and butter.</v>

3
00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:04.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love.</v>

4
00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And that is the holy grail of neurosis.</v>

5
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 2>So when you hear like Depok show pro type dudes talk about consciousness,</v>

6
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>my eyes rolling like Deepak Chopra,</v>

7
00:00:12.581 --> 00:00:12.941
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

8
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for me to not just discount everything he says.</v>

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.451
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

10
00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I reason it's,</v>

11
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's truth there,</v>

13
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:19.541
<v Speaker 1>but he is,</v>

14
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>he's a whoop peddler</v>

15
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.143
<v Speaker 1>Chopra,</v>

16
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.101
<v Speaker 1>Eckhart.</v>

19
00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:27.934
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

20
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Terry Robbins,</v>

21
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>is that his name?</v>

22
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Greg Fitzsimmons loves ECKART.</v>

23
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Toley he's probably the least hook story of all of them,</v>

24
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.884
<v Speaker 2>but he's still,</v>

25
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.101
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

26
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:38.281
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

27
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is huckster worry about providing motivation to people and</v>

28
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 2>giving people sort of a framework to work on as far as,</v>

29
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 2>living in the now and taking charge of their life,</v>

31
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's something that someone like Eckhart Toley had personal</v>

32
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.671
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

33
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 2>We'll compare somebody like at cart.</v>

34
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Totally to robins.</v>

35
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Compare and Eckhart totally.</v>

37
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Or an Anthony Robbins to,</v>

38
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.281
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

39
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>somebody like,</v>

40
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.561
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

43
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:04.191
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

44
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I was able to,</v>

45
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.901
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

46
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:06.734
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

47
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I was able to interview a,</v>

48
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

49
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>this really interesting guy who has a phd in molecular genetics and then move to</v>

50
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.010
<v Speaker 1>the Himalayas to become a Buddhist monk.</v>

51
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>his name is Matthew Ricard and he's,</v>

53
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>he's a French Buddhist monk and he talks about mindfulness meditation and he</v>

54
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>talks about the neuroscience of the things that the Tibetans are doing right</v>

55
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:30.074
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

56
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but he's not trying to make money off of it.</v>

57
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is a fundamental kind of red flag for me.</v>

58
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying just because somebody is trying to make money,</v>

59
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>they are selling snake oil.</v>

60
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

61
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>But first of all,</v>

62
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>what's the motivation that,</v>

63
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>that that has to be the first red flag.</v>

64
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you go into,</v>

65
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>what is it that they're saying if they're talking,</v>

66
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>if they're trying to use science and they're trying to kind of go in and pick</v>

67
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>and choose the science that tells the story the right way,</v>

68
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>and then they're making these really broad a leaps from that science.</v>

69
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>It makes me nervous.</v>

70
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.861
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

71
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if you've got like a motivational speaker who's just like,</v>

72
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I know this about the world and I'm not basing it on anything,</v>

73
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>but if you like me to come follow me.</v>

74
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:11.841
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

75
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:12.021
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

76
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:12.621
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

77
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:12.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

78
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:13.341
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

79
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>That's like culty behavior,</v>

80
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:15.284
<v Speaker 1>but that's fine.</v>

81
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 1>But when people pick and choose how they want to use science and how they want</v>

82
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 1>to bastardize science to meet their needs,</v>

83
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>it makes me nervous.</v>

84
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I did a piece recently about the power of positive thinking.</v>

85
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.031
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I've also done a piece about the power of prayer and I went through the</v>

87
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 1>literature and I tried to find examples where positive thinking actually helped</v>

88
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

89
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's just no good evidence that thinking positively is going to actually</v>

90
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>bring goodwill to your life.</v>

91
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Like the secret,</v>

92
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.691
<v Speaker 1>you know this like,</v>

93
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:41.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

94
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>if I just want it bad enough,</v>

95
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a bunch of money.</v>

96
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

97
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.321
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

98
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>if you want it bad enough,</v>

99
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to fucking work for it.</v>

100
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>And then it's gonna come to you.</v>

101
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And actually they find that the power of positive thinking can actually be kind</v>

102
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:57.251
<v Speaker 1>of detrimental to cancer patients because it causes a whole extra layer of guilt</v>

103
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>to the process of dying.</v>

104
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you caused this to yourself because you didn't,</v>

106
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you didn't think positively enough,</v>

107
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>you didn't will yourself out of this.</v>

108
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And there's a whole culture around that in America where we kind of blame the</v>

109
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>victims and where we call cancer survivors,</v>

110
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.361
<v Speaker 1>survivors,</v>

111
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>and we call cancer victims victims,</v>

112
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:18.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:19.804
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

114
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>and you're not doing so well.</v>

115
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Nobody says it directly to somebody who was dying of cancer.</v>

116
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Well you didn't will yourself out of it,</v>

117
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>but they feel that because they say it indirectly to the people who are coming</v>

118
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>

119
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.191
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

120
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>it was all that nice prayer and all those positive thoughts and all those Oprah</v>

121
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>magazines you read.</v>

122
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

123
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.944
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

124
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.791
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

125
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a bad precedent to set.</v>

126
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.940
<v Speaker 2>It's also shitty science because if you're,</v>

127
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:42.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:44.790
<v Speaker 2>you're only looking at the group that was successful.</v>

129
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

130
00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>not all the people that died.</v>

131
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing.</v>

132
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I tried to look at a lot of those studies and I tried to compare,</v>

133
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:54.980
<v Speaker 1>and and I found enough stuff out there that kind of shows that the power of</v>

135
00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:56.600
<v Speaker 1>positive thinking is not a real thing.</v>

136
00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

137
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.580
<v Speaker 1>prayer is not a real thing.</v>

138
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Disagree to the power of positive thinking is not a real thing.</v>

139
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good way to operate and live your life in a happy manner will</v>

140
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 2>probably lend you to being more successful.</v>

141
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 2>You'll have less hurdles.</v>

142
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like talking about Karma,</v>

143
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you know like in some sense Karma is totally real because if you're a fucking</v>

144
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>nice person and you're just,</v>

145
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:17.501
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

146
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>you do goodwill all of the time,</v>

147
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>sometimes shitty things are going to happen to you,</v>

148
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>but most people are going to be nice to you too.</v>

149
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>If you put bad Karma out there.</v>

150
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>To me what that really means is if you're just a fucking asshole all the time,</v>

151
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be an asshole back to you.</v>

152
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

153
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.151
<v Speaker 1>that's obvious,</v>

154
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that Karma is some sort of cosmic force that says you,</v>

155
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>you store up goodwill with the universe and then the universe pays you back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Try Monday Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

157
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

158
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 3>the last time you were here you coined</v>

159
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.180
<v Speaker 2>grace,</v>

160
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.990
<v Speaker 2>or you used a phrase that I have stolen and abused over and over and over again.</v>

161
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.273
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you credit,</v>

162
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's Wu peddler.</v>

163
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh Yeah,</v>

164
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 2>love that box show pro.</v>

165
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:57.791 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 2>I definitely didn't coin that,</v>

168
00:04:58.891 --> 00:04:59.940
<v Speaker 2>but I love it too.</v>

169
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I use a lot.</v>

170
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Every time I see that dude,</v>

171
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I just think Wu peddler have a little kind of Twitter thing with him.</v>

172
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I was calling him,</v>

173
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 2>I asked if he whooped pedaled much like I am a god.</v>

174
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 2>And you were like [inaudible].</v>

175
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

176
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.211
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

177
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:16.021
<v Speaker 2>it was really funny.</v>

178
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I favorite at it,</v>

179
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 2>but he was actually like,</v>

180
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

181
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.980
<v Speaker 2>he had a good sense of humor about it.</v>

182
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he takes himself totally seriously.</v>

183
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.043
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

184
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.973
<v Speaker 2>I think he gets,</v>

185
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.790
<v Speaker 2>he gets ahead of himself and he said some really ridiculous shit.</v>

186
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.260
<v Speaker 2>And then when people call them on it,</v>

187
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.180
<v Speaker 2>he just starts using the word quantum.</v>

189
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Quantum consciousness is know I think better him than a lot of other people in</v>

190
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 2>his position better him.</v>

191
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Then you know that Kevin Trudeau guy that's selling you weight loss secrets that</v>

192
00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:52.190
<v Speaker 2>they don't want you to know about.</v>

193
00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

194
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like depot Deepak's trying to sell his books,</v>

195
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>but outside of that I don't really feel like he that much of,</v>

196
00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:05:58.641 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>like a Predator,</v>

198
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>like he's not using this kind of pseudo science and truth be told there is a</v>

199
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>little bit of truth to some of the things that he talks about,</v>

200
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:06.761
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

201
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>but he does kind of,</v>

202
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I think step way outside of the boundaries of what's reasonable and healthy.</v>

203
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:12.801
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>

204
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's actually trying to take advantage of people fundamentally.</v>

205
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that Deepak Chopra thinks what he's talking about.</v>

206
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean he believes in what he's talking about and I think that he actually</v>

207
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>thinks that he's helping people and maybe it's helping some people,</v>

208
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>but he's also peddling a lot of woo.</v>

209
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.823
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

210
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I think he probably is helping a lot.</v>

211
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I think he's definitely peddling a lot of woo.</v>

212
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing that I always get out of him is that I don't think even he</v>

213
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 2>knows what he's saying.</v>

214
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of times where people will try to impress upon you that</v>

215
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying is important.</v>

216
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways they do that is by using these like really kind of like</v>

217
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 2>vague terms.</v>

218
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 2>That sound fantastic.</v>

219
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:55.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really,</v>

221
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I think where that term pseudoscience comes from.</v>

222
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not real science,</v>

223
00:06:58.371 --> 00:06:58.561
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

224
00:06:58.561 --> 00:06:58.821
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

225
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>it's fake science,</v>

226
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>it's bad science.</v>

227
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>But it sorta sounds like science to an untrained ear.</v>

228
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's the dangerous thing is if you throw around a lot of really big words</v>

229
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 1>and you are really authoritative,</v>

230
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people kind of believe what you're telling them.</v>

231
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.343
<v Speaker 1>What also do</v>

232
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.901
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

233
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Some of it does have some truth to it.</v>

234
00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 2>And when you fuck around and pretend that it all does</v>

235
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.710
<v Speaker 1>mush it altogether,</v>

236
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.171
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

237
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:21.381
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

238
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:21.621
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

239
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you create this really cloudy atmosphere.</v>

240
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:23.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

241
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm under,</v>

242
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what the fuck you're saying.</v>

243
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not sure if it's true,</v>

244
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard for like an everyday person who goes,</v>

245
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:29.571
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

246
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>well I've heard that before and you know,</v>

247
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>my doctor told me that and you know,</v>

248
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that seems important.</v>

249
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they throw in all these other things will,</v>

250
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're an authority figure and you're saying all these things that are</v>

251
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:39.621
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

252
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should believe you.</v>

253
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And you say all these other things,</v>

254
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a really dangerous,</v>

255
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

256
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

258
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.093
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

259
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

260
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I was an atheist Hashtag until I discovered I was God.</v>

261
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.141
<v Speaker 2>And then I said,</v>

262
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:52.471
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

263
00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.420
<v Speaker 2>don't make me smack you woo pedal.</v>

264
00:07:54.421 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

265
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

266
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And then he responded,</v>

267
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>he responded something really funny.</v>

268
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can find it.</v>

269
00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:58.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

270
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I roll God in drag.</v>

271
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.440
<v Speaker 1>That actually is very fun.</v>

272
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.351
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

273
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:06.471
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

274
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty awesome.</v>

275
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:07.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

276
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:08.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:13.121
<v Speaker 2>he did a thing with his son where his son of followed him around with a camera</v>

278
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 2>and completely exposed him and he went on tour,</v>

279
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 2>like promoted this with his son and did like interviews on like opie and Anthony</v>

280
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 2>and all these different places.</v>

281
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 2>But one of them was like his son,</v>

282
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 2>like caught him sleeping when he was supposed to be meditating.</v>

283
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to the temple to meditate.</v>

284
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

285
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 2>they go into the temple,</v>

286
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:33.794
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

287
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 2>he's completely out cold line.</v>

288
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I his back and it's,</v>

289
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

290
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 2>it's quite funny because his son sort of,</v>

291
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:39.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:44.060
<v Speaker 2>grew up with him and his sons and fathers have notoriously contentious</v>

293
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:44.894
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

294
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm always incredibly impressed when I meet a daughter who gets along great with</v>

295
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 2>her mom or a son who gets along great with his dad because somewhere along the</v>

296
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>line and those male,</v>

297
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 2>male,</v>

298
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.741
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>

299
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 2>female relationships that seems to be this like changing of the guard or</v>

300
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 2>something like that or this need to be your own person.</v>

301
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And [inaudible] son has that shit in buckets,</v>

302
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 2>buckets full of that.</v>

303
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And it's cool that Deepak doesn't really take himself too seriously.</v>

304
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.521
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

305
00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

306
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 2>his son catches him asleep and he's like,</v>

307
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:12.511
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

308
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:13.344
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

309
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.573
<v Speaker 2>I was not called,</v>

310
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I was traveling.</v>

311
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Speaker 2>It was aware of,</v>

312
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

313
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>my third eye was open to the possibilities.</v>

314
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

315
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.813
<v Speaker 2>He did a,</v>

316
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

317
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.270
<v Speaker 2>an interview or a debate rather with Richard Dawkins fairly recently on,</v>

318
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

319
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.580
<v Speaker 2>he was challenging Dawkins on the concept of atheism and you know,</v>

320
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.490
<v Speaker 2>and Dawkins was just being as cadre old country settled,</v>

321
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.130
<v Speaker 2>but it actually made it actually made him Dawkins look bad.</v>

322
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's the thing,</v>

323
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:47.791
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

324
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 2>it's when you engage in those kinds of conversations with people who can really</v>

325
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.444
<v Speaker 2>hold their own,</v>

326
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 2>you've gotta be really careful because Dawkins,</v>

327
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I think he's taking,</v>

328
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 2>and I respect the man immensely.</v>

329
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 2>His take is very much an educated,</v>

330
00:09:58.951 --> 00:09:59.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm an evolutionist,</v>

332
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm an evolutionary biologist.</v>

333
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.900
<v Speaker 2>These are the reasons that I don't believe in God,</v>

334
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 2>but he's very hard lined about it.</v>

335
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And there is something about being this kind of ivory tower,</v>

336
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 2>British elite that just kind of makes you seem like a dick.</v>

337
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Even like he's not a dick.</v>

338
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a really sweet man.</v>

339
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:16.381
<v Speaker 2>I've met him before.</v>

340
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

341
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.950
<v Speaker 2>he's soft spoken.</v>

342
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.490
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is you,</v>

343
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you put those two men in a room together,</v>

344
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Depok knows what he's doing.</v>

345
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 2>He knows that like part of a debate or part of the conversation is about</v>

346
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 2>bringing out certain aspects of somebody's character.</v>

347
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 2>It's about likability.</v>

348
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's easy for people who aren't already kind of hard lined atheist</v>

349
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 2>and who aren't already big dock and supporters to be like,</v>

350
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 2>that guy seems mean.</v>

351
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:40.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

352
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I think he is mean.</v>

353
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with you.</v>

354
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I think he is a dick and I think he is mean.</v>

355
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 2>And I think um,</v>

356
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 2>that's because he's had to deal with idiots over and over and over again.</v>

357
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 2>And he's an extremely intelligent man and he's tired of it and it gets this</v>

358
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Speaker 2>quivering and his lips,</v>

359
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 2>when he talks to people,</v>

360
00:10:58.081 --> 00:10:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:58.651
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

362
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:00.000
<v Speaker 2>that is not what's going on.</v>

363
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 2>He gets so furious about defending science and defending the truth.</v>

364
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's a dick in an unjust way.</v>

365
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 2>And he's a Dick for a reason.</v>

366
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 2>He's a Dick because he's a normal guy.</v>

367
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he's also a dick because he's a normal guy with a lot of knowledge that</v>

368
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.230
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a lot of release in his life probably.</v>

369
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:19.831
<v Speaker 2>And he's also,</v>

370
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 2>I think he's also sheltered a little bit because of his position because of,</v>

371
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:23.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>when you work in academia and you're kind of surrounded by likeminded people a</v>

373
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>lot and only periodically do you go out into the real world where there's a lot</v>

374
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 2>of people who don't have the education that you have and who have totally</v>

375
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 2>different values and belief systems.</v>

376
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it can be really,</v>

377
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>really frustrating because you're constantly having to defend a position that's</v>

378
00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:43.170
<v Speaker 2>the rational that like anybody else who's come up through the ranks that you</v>

379
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.004
<v Speaker 2>came up,</v>

380
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.251
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

381
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:44.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>97% of practicing scientists or something like that don't believe in God.</v>

383
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's not that high,</v>

384
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 2>but 97% definitely,</v>

385
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 2>know that global warming is true.</v>

387
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.060
<v Speaker 2>And maybe</v>

388
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 1>it's something like 75% in America don't believe in God,</v>

389
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but we're like a very religious country.</v>

390
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 1>But when you kind of go through the motions and you just come to these logical</v>

391
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>conclusions because of all of the different life choices you've made,</v>

392
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>but then you interact with people who are from such different backgrounds,</v>

393
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>who have never studied evolution,</v>

394
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 1>who have never studied,</v>

395
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:11.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 1>global climate change or whatever.</v>

397
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like talking to a wall sometimes because you almost can't have the same</v>

398
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 1>kind of reasonable conversations because when you're talking to somebody who's</v>

399
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 1>not coming from a rational evidence based place,</v>

400
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 1>who's coming from kind of appeals to emotion or who's coming from folklore or</v>

401
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

402
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:33.310
<v Speaker 1>they have to defend their kind of belief structure,</v>

403
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>their faith position.</v>

404
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really frustrating because you don't really have a lot of ammunition at a</v>

405
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:38.854
<v Speaker 1>certain point,</v>

406
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>but especially when you're talking to somebody like Deepak Chopra who has like</v>

407
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 1>made a career kind of being good at debating,</v>

408
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 1>who knows exactly the way to twist your words and to make it sound like what</v>

409
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 1>he's speaking is the truth.</v>

410
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.890
<v Speaker 1>And then he's got this like very benevolent kind of kind and calm demeanor and</v>

411
00:12:56.531 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make Dawkins look like a dick.</v>

412
00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:58.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

413
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

414
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that he did any,</v>

415
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:01.451
<v Speaker 1>any twisting them.</v>

416
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:02.284
<v Speaker 1>Any words at all?</v>

417
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

418
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:03.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

419
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

420
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.031
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

421
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 1>he seemed like a woo peddler.</v>

423
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:06.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

424
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 1>to use your term,</v>

425
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:08.171
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

426
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 1>that's what he seemed like.</v>

427
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>But Dawkins was just getting so angry and it's that old saying,</v>

428
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>never argue with an idiot,</v>

430
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 1>cause people won't be able to tell who's who.</v>

431
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.440
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same.</v>

432
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works for me.</v>

433
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:19.901
<v Speaker 1>I would never,</v>

434
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

435
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I would never debate a creation.</v>

436
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like people say,</v>

437
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

438
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:22.871
<v Speaker 1>you should blah,</v>

439
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:22.991
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

440
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:23.171
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

441
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think like Bill Nye,</v>

442
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if it's happened yet,</v>

443
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but they'll nice of us to debate Ken Ham.</v>

444
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

445
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he's doing it.</v>

446
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

447
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I have friends,</v>

448
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:31.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm friends with Sean Carroll,</v>

450
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>who's a physicist at Caltech and writes these really great books about,</v>

451
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 1>about time and about,</v>

452
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

453
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

454
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics.</v>

455
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.860
<v Speaker 1>And he does periodically debate creationists.</v>

456
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:45.281
<v Speaker 1>And I'm always like,</v>

457
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:46.560
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing that's,</v>

458
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.890
<v Speaker 1>that's like such a bad idea.</v>

459
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:48.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

460
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

461
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Speaker 1>because these people are skilled just in the art of conversation.</v>

462
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 1>They're skilled in the art of debate.</v>

463
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Even if what they're saying has no weight,</v>

464
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 1>they know how to argue these positions and try and trap you and get you on the</v>

465
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>defensive.</v>

466
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.400
<v Speaker 1>They have all of these different kind of uh,</v>

467
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.973
<v Speaker 1>skillsets,</v>

469
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>but he always says,</v>

470
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not for me.</v>

471
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not to try and prove him wrong.</v>

472
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not to try and convince him not to believe in God.</v>

473
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:12.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

474
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:14.070
<v Speaker 1>like this guy is it.</v>

475
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Ken Ham is like a hardcore fundamentalist Christian.</v>

476
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.390
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to change his mind.</v>

477
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 1>So they say the reason that we do these debates is for the people who are</v>

478
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 1>sitting there watching who may be like,</v>

479
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.281
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

480
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the difference between evolution and intelligent design.</v>

481
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought about it.</v>

482
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I've never really looked at the evidence that may be even a small percentage of</v>

483
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 1>the people who decide to tune in.</v>

484
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 1>We'll be given some sort of information that they didn't have before that they</v>

485
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 1>can be armed with to make better decisions.</v>

486
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know.</v>

487
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>To me it just seems like,</v>

488
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's a noble pursuit,</v>

489
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:46.600
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

490
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how effective it really is to debate a creationist.</v>

491
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I say I disagree with you.</v>

492
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

493
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're going to convince the creationist.</v>

494
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

495
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

496
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.240
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that there's,</v>

497
00:14:58.241 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 2>there's value in someone who's good at it.</v>

498
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.490
<v Speaker 2>If someone has the ability to speak and speak well and also they have to have a</v>

499
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of charisma.</v>

500
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 2>And the issue,</v>

501
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.780
<v Speaker 2>the Dawkins issue is that he gets so emotionally invested in this fucking</v>

502
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 2>horseshit that Depok spewing that he gets angry and furious instead of mocking</v>

503
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:19.311
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

504
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a brilliant exchange with a,</v>

505
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:22.510
<v Speaker 2>there was a scientist,</v>

506
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.171
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

507
00:15:23.171 --> 00:15:23.331
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

508
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 2>a panel and Deepak was on the panel and this,</v>

509
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:26.271
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

510
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

511
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.130
<v Speaker 2>scientists stepped up and,</v>

512
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

513
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.450
<v Speaker 2>ask Depok a question and Eh,</v>

514
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Depok clearly didn't know what the fuck he was talking about.</v>

515
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:40.210
<v Speaker 2>But the way the guy handled it was very sweet and he was smiling while he did</v>

516
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 2>explain that he was in the process of writing a book with Stephen Hawkings and</v>

517
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 2>then he was in the middle of this and then that I don't,</v>

518
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:47.901
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

519
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:49.460
<v Speaker 2>I understand those words you said,</v>

520
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.091
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

521
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if they mean anything.</v>

522
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 2>The way he said it was,</v>

523
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 2>it was adorable.</v>

524
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

525
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 2>cause the guy didn't lose his cool and it made Depok look like a fucking idiot.</v>

526
00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.011
<v Speaker 2>Where's it at?</v>

527
00:15:59.011 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 2>The same guy got up and said,</v>

528
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

529
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 2>what is this quantum talk?</v>

530
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.470
<v Speaker 2>You're talking a bunch of fucking bullshit and shut up and you don't know.</v>

531
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden,</v>

532
00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:07.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Deepak is this pudgy Indian man that you're picking up the screams of racism and</v>

534
00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 2>all this other fucking hot buttons get pushed.</v>

535
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And I think the same thing can be done skillfully with these creationist</v>

536
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:19.491
<v Speaker 2>fellows.</v>

537
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Like shy.</v>

538
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea behind creationism is so preposterous that in the form that we</v>

539
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 2>see it in the form of,</v>

540
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.791
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

542
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 2>not in the form of something created the universe,</v>

543
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:36.370
<v Speaker 2>whether it's some sort of a universal force that creates stars or the reason why</v>

544
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Adam's exists in the first place.</v>

545
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.140
<v Speaker 2>All these like fundamental questions that scientists have as to why the</v>

546
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Speaker 2>structure of the universe is what it is.</v>

547
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.493
<v Speaker 2>There's that,</v>

548
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 2>but then there's this book that has been translated from other books and then</v>

549
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 2>they're sticking to this fucking crazy book.</v>

550
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Just point out the other shit in the book that's ridiculous.</v>

551
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Like the shit in the book about not being on the word to deploy different types</v>

552
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 2>types of cloth.</v>

553
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.151
<v Speaker 2>And they do that.</v>

554
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Usually they'll point out the shit in the book.</v>

555
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:00.951
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

556
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:02.030
<v Speaker 2>And they figure out,</v>

557
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

558
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.380
<v Speaker 2>and point out how,</v>

559
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 2>if the book says this,</v>

560
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:09.521
<v Speaker 2>you truly believe this in this century and science has unequivocally disproven</v>

561
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 2>what it is that you believe.</v>

562
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:12.321
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

563
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:13.220
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to talk about,</v>

564
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.054
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

565
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

566
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Speaker 2>these big questions like what came before the Big Bang or you know what a lot</v>

568
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:18.771
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

569
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm intelligent design advocates confused,</v>

570
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:22.791
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

571
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:25.910
<v Speaker 2>evolution via natural selection with a a biogenesis.</v>

572
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:30.911
<v Speaker 2>So they confuse the idea of how a organisms have evolved over time with how life</v>

573
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 2>began in the first place,</v>

574
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 2>which is a fundamentally different scientific question,</v>

575
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.111
<v Speaker 2>different topic,</v>

576
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 2>totally different field of inquiry.</v>

577
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.051
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

578
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

579
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times what they do is they appeal to these two questions.</v>

580
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 2>They say like,</v>

581
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:42.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

582
00:17:42.531 --> 00:17:44.360
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what existed before the Big Bang,</v>

583
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.910
<v Speaker 2>therefore God done Mike Drop,</v>

584
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.073
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>

586
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>And instead of kind</v>

587
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 1>of allowing that,</v>

588
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it's to say,</v>

589
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:52.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

590
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

591
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.753
<v Speaker 1>neither of us know why.</v>

592
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Why has God the,</v>

593
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.993
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

594
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 1>answer that you jumped to,</v>

596
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 1>let's look at all the other times when you're saying that the answer is God and</v>

597
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 1>we've disproven it over and over and over and over.</v>

598
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And just because we don't have all of the answers to every question right now</v>

599
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 1>using the scientific method doesn't mean that,</v>

600
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

601
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:13.440
<v Speaker 1>through through new tools,</v>

602
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:17.190
<v Speaker 1>through new lines of inquiry that we might be able to answer those in the</v>

603
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:17.940
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

604
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that like,</v>

605
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 1>just because we don't have,</v>

606
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:23.730
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that there aren't other philosophical answers to these</v>

607
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 1>questions that don't rely on this like very fundamentalist view.</v>

608
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I think personally that for example,</v>

609
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Bill Nye is going to be able to hold his own.</v>

610
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 1>He's a total bad ass.</v>

611
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to lose his cool and Ken Ham,</v>

612
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.210
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever watched him in PE,</v>

613
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a nut job.</v>

614
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a total pull up some videos,</v>

615
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 1>he's a total nutter butter and he will lose his cool and he's totally not</v>

616
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:45.570
<v Speaker 1>likable like nothing about this guy.</v>

617
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:46.201
<v Speaker 1>He's likable.</v>

618
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:50.250
<v Speaker 1>So I think that maybe that's why bill and I was willing to do it cause I've seen</v>

619
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:50.641
<v Speaker 1>Bill Nye,</v>

620
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:50.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

621
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Go on like Bill O'reilly a million times and there's kind of a mutual respect</v>

622
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:56.011
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

623
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:56.141
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

624
00:18:56.141 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>he deals with bill O'Reilly very well,</v>

625
00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 1>and I'm always impressed.</v>

626
00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>And just one,</v>

627
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>one is the tide comes in.</v>

628
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

629
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 1>You can't explain that.</v>

631
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

632
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.833
<v Speaker 1>he was with Steve.</v>

633
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

635
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.473
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

636
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 1>it was so fucking funny.</v>

637
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Such a face balm.</v>
