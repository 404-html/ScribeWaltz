<v Speaker 1>Tell us what the fuck happened.</v>

12
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.390
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

13
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 2>this is in 1993 probably I think is what I went to Russia.</v>

14
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I was taking Russian classes at Florida state.</v>

15
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were Spanish classes because I thought has been this classes</v>

16
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 2>because I was a noon class and I signed up and then I was like fucking sweet</v>

17
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Spanish at noon.</v>

18
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I get phone that in and then I get there and they start writing a new language,</v>

19
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.961
<v Speaker 2>a new alphabet.</v>

20
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:39.291
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

21
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

22
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 2>this clearly isn't Spanish.</v>

23
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 2>So then I said it,</v>

24
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:42.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave.</v>

25
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>And the teacher's like,</v>

26
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

27
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 2>don't leave.</v>

28
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.803
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 2>because if you leave,</v>

30
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 2>we can't have a class and I can't get my master's degree.</v>

31
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.491
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

32
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 2>but if you stick around,</v>

33

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I get done the end of class.</v>

36
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:53.894
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

37
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.351

<v Speaker 2>if you don't leave when I want to show up at class,</v>

42
00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:58.694
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a c.</v>

43
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

44
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.170
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

46
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 2>So I took Russian,</v>

47
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.721
<v Speaker 2>I took Russian one,</v>

48
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:02.901
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

49
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 2>and three because these kids need it.</v>

50
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Another guy in the class to take these classes.</v>

51
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 2>So then finally I take rush,</v>

52
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd take her out and four and we go to Russia,</v>

53
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 2>we go to Russia.</v>

54
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.391
<v Speaker 2>But this is Rochelle.</v>

55
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Like when the mob ran Russia,</v>

56
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.413
<v Speaker 2>like are you,</v>

57
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 2>are you guys aware of that?</v>

58
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

59
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.440

60
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 2>late nineties mid nineties the mob ran everything that had to do with Russia.</v>

61
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>So when going over to Russia,</v>

62
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:24.164
<v Speaker 2>you had to,</v>

63
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.820

64
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So we paid off the mob and they gave us in return to banditos too young mobsters</v>

65
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 2>who would go everywhere with us.</v>

305
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 2>And he pulls out a thing of keys.</v>

306
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 2>He's got keys to the whole fucking train and he's like,</v>

307
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.750

00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>So we get stark and sure enough,</v>

314
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.130

315
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>go through my class first and we'd fucking open the door,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the little eagle rock crawl and pull the bags out.</v>

317
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 2>John and I would go through them and try not to steal like anything important</v>

318
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 2>and Biggie or would stand guard.</v>

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>And if anyone woke up,</v>

320
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 2>he'd take us civil vodka and spit it in their face.</v>
