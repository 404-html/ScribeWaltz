<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

154
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I exaggerate everything right?</v>

155
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>But let's see a picture of it.</v>

156
00:02:58.891 --> 00:02:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Which one is it?</v>

157
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.360

158
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck dog.</v>

162
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.871
<v Speaker 1>The size of it.</v>

163
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.291
<v Speaker 1>They get a tear.</v>

164
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>That whole thing down.</v>

165
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

166
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>like not safe for people.</v>

167
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

168
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Wrapped in black netting prior.</v>

169
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>What does that say prior to demolition.</v>

170
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

171
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's wrapped in black netting.</v>

172
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

173
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.513
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

174
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you have the hotel next to it and like,</v>

175
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:21.484
<v Speaker 1>don't worry dude.</v>

179
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to blow up my car,</v>

180
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.170
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to put a net over yours.</v>

182
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't sweat it.</v>

183
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't sweat it.</v>

184
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:34.541
<v Speaker 1>Don't sweat it.</v>

185
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to blow it up right next to you.</v>

186
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

187
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.683
<v Speaker 1>They should have.</v>

188
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>They should build up a solid steel enclosure.</v>

189
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Blow it up and then dispose of rock.</v>

190
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine for the engineer looking at this,</v>

191
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.183
<v Speaker 1>it says here,</v>

192
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>he said it was originally to have arisen 49 floors as a show piece of the city</v>

193
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>center,</v>

194
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>which opened just as Nevada was entering the depths of the recession,</v>

195
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>the 4,000 room,</v>

196
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Aria resort and casino along with the Mandarin Hotel.</v>

197
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Fewer than 400 rooms and the all suite 57 story Vadera open within a month of</v>

198
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:08.201
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

199
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>But the Harmon stage shuttered.</v>

200
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a recession,</v>

201
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>but construction issues that kept the harm and clothes.</v>

202
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 1>It's construction plan was eventually scaled down by almost half,</v>

203
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but then concerns remained that it would topple in an earthquake.</v>

204
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

205
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I knew it while I'm Macau hotel supposed to open there soon in a big area that's</v>

206
00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 3>been under development for over like 10 years in Vegas.</v>

207
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.480
<v Speaker 3>I watched a documentary about,</v>

208
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.550
<v Speaker 3>it's probably talking about some of this.</v>

209
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.443
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

210
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

211
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like the MGM crew or one of them.</v>

212
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say who because I don't know exactly,</v>

213
00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:44.750
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

214
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.690
<v Speaker 3>they were developing a huge thing and it fell apart basically.</v>

215
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:50.720
<v Speaker 3>And she had been sitting empty for 10 years and this Macau company is moving in</v>

216
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.700
<v Speaker 3>and it's supposed to open up and about a year or so,</v>

217
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.500
<v Speaker 3>if it's not opening sooner than that,</v>

218
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 3>a big multibillion dollar Asian hotel that all these McCowen Chinese people were</v>

219
00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:01.370
<v Speaker 3>supposed to come in and Save Vegas.</v>

220
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

221
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.231
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

222
00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Would it be if Vegas got taken over by Chinese,</v>

223
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>they came in guns blazing and just built some unbelievable hotels because</v>

224
00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 1>they're written money over there.</v>

225
00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Just true written money.</v>

226
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.080
<v Speaker 1>So it was my man Donald Trump though.</v>

227
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Yet before bullies get the fuck outta here with all that nonsense.</v>

228
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump can hang with the triads.</v>

229
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.240
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come over here with a giant space ships zeppelins filled with</v>

230
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:33.074
<v Speaker 1>diamonds,</v>

231
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.360
<v Speaker 1>just rained them down on Las Vegas.</v>

232
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.300
<v Speaker 1>We're going to build a building made of entirely of diamonds,</v>

233
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.590
<v Speaker 1>all filled with hookers,</v>

234
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.390
<v Speaker 1>all filled with 10 side meet the Alpha,</v>

235
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.420
<v Speaker 1>drive everybody around it or Rolls Royce.</v>

236
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to go to any other casino.</v>

237
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take it to the most ultimate level ever.</v>

238
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at that if cause it.</v>

239
00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Macau really is what they say it is.</v>

240
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 1>If it really is 10 times Vegas,</v>

241
00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:56.180
<v Speaker 1>that means they're making 10 times as much money as vague.</v>

242
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Remember that joke says,</v>

243
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Sam</v>

244

<v Speaker 4>per bleed said that.</v>

245
00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

246
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.690
<v Speaker 4>it was something about how girls will always be with the guys with money.</v>

247
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:05.361
<v Speaker 4>No matter what.</v>

248
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Girl doesn't have a recession for hot Darth Vader.</v>

249
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 4>Darth Vader can come down takeover and,</v>

250
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.120
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>

251
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm killing the joke,</v>

252
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 4>but it was one of the Best Sam Tripoli,</v>

253
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 4>Tripoli dead on.</v>

254
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

255
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.701
<v Speaker 4>I remember.</v>

256
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it today.</v>

257
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 4>You see some ugly as dudes with harness chicks.</v>

258
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

259
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.290
<v Speaker 4>The only reason you guys got mad paper.</v>

260
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Mad Paper makes up for a lot of things.</v>

261
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 4>There's hope for every man out there.</v>

262
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 4>If you're an unattractive woman,</v>

263
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 4>mad paper gets you a gay guy pretending to be straight.</v>

264
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I ain't that a bitch.</v>

265
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.471
<v Speaker 4>That's what you get.</v>

266
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 4>If you look like a warlock as a girl and you're a millionaire,</v>

267
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.590
<v Speaker 4>you think Bruce Jenner was kind of like that?</v>

268
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.281
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

269
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:46.521
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

270
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:46.701
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

271
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:46.881
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

272
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 4>I think if you live with crazy bitches on enough,</v>

273
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 4>you become one.</v>

274
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.521
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

275
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 4>Did you know Bruce Jenner said he's always felt like a woman even when he was a</v>

276
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>

277
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 4>he's always felt like it was gay.</v>

278
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.620
<v Speaker 4>It turns out he's gay the whole time.</v>

279
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

280
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.701
<v Speaker 4>he's not gay.</v>

281
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 4>He's just felt like he's in a man's body.</v>

282
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 4>The crazy thing about a lot of these people that become transgender,</v>

283
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 4>there's this like there's so many different possibilities when it comes to</v>

284
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 4>sexuality.</v>

285
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.323
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>

286
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 4>that still like checks.</v>

287
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 4>That's something that a lot of us have a hard time accepting because we only</v>

288
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 4>have our own version of sexuality and gender,</v>

289
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 4>but some people are men.</v>

290
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 4>They're attracted to women,</v>

291
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 4>but they're attracted to women and wish they were a woman and we're in love with</v>

292
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 4>a woman as a lesbian.</v>

293
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 4>They will sacrifice their dick.</v>

294
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 4>They'll sacrifice the ability to come.</v>

295
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 4>They'll sacrifice their testicles,</v>

296
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 4>they'll sacrifice testosterone,</v>

297
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 4>they'll sacrifice their male gender and still be with women.</v>

298
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.571
<v Speaker 4>Bro,</v>

299
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:39.261

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.420

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.110
<v Speaker 4>This badass navy seal.</v>

304
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 4>Who said he,</v>

305
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.001
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

306
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

307
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.991
<v Speaker 4>she likes me.</v>

308
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

309
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 4>so he was a navy seal from seal team one to seal team six and then he was just</v>

310
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:53.571
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

311
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

312
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to be a woman my entire life.</v>

313
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:56.744
<v Speaker 4>I felt like a woman.</v>

314
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 4>Straight dude.</v>

315
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.071
<v Speaker 4>Now you know,</v>

316
00:07:59.071 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 4>you know like trying to look like a woman in a dress.</v>

317
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Polka dot dress looks like me.</v>

318
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Really Tattoos and shit.</v>

319
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 4>Mascara on.</v>

320
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 4>Teach another navy seals how to shoot and shit.</v>

321
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Is there a chance or a chance that the Bruce Jenner thing could be a situation</v>

322
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 4>where he's coming out slowly?</v>

323
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Cause remember Elton John was,</v>

324
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 4>he looked totally gay.</v>

325
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 4>He was flaming but he denied it.</v>

326
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 4>He was managing,</v>

327
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 4>he said he was bi and then now he's full game.</v>

328
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 4>So he came out first.</v>

329
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 4>They came out where he is by,</v>

330
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 4>he didn't come out fully all the way.</v>

331
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe Bruce Jenner's like,</v>

332
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:31.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

333
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:35.000
<v Speaker 4>and I can't come out and say I'm gay and I want to be a woman.</v>

334
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell people I want to be a woman first and then laid or Morrissey saying,</v>

335
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

336
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.781
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gay,</v>

337
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm asexual.</v>

338
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.871
<v Speaker 4>That's what he said.</v>

339
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 4>He said he's asexual.</v>

340
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.480
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Jenner sat down with one of those fucking interviews and it's,</v>

341
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I just read some details about it.</v>

342
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:51.981
<v Speaker 4>He's coming out and saying,</v>

343
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 4>I felt like a woman my entire life.</v>

344
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 4>I believe that.</v>

345
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Why you leave out?</v>

346
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Why</v>

347
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>would you doubt that someone would be asexual?</v>

348
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause then a lot of ways Stan hope is asexual at this point in his life.</v>

349
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have sex anymore.</v>

350
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.211
<v Speaker 1>He's still a man,</v>

351
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't have sex anymore.</v>

352
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.151
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it doesn't,</v>

353
00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get hard anymore.</v>

354
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Not Interested in his testosterone,</v>

355
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>just so I can just booze.</v>

356
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Damn booze and cigarettes while he's having a great time.</v>

357
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't care.</v>

358
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Have a great live in life.</v>

360
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:15.781
<v Speaker 1>Loves it.</v>

362
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Teach though.</v>

363
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.163
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

364
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.413
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

365
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.673
<v Speaker 1>He's having a good time.</v>

366
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

367
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>He talks about it openly.</v>

368
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.210
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

369
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:22.381
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

370
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 1>he's down with the slide.</v>

371
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

372
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

373
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 1>so there's different people,</v>

374
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

375
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.763
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's different.</v>

376
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

377
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Stan is not the dummy.</v>

378
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

379
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 1>that's just what his decision,</v>

380
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.083
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't care.</v>

381
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And there's some people that you know,</v>

382
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 1>like they might be asexual,</v>

383
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Marcy might be asexual.</v>

384
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>That might not be bullshit.</v>

385
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It might be just this is how he is the eye,</v>

386
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:41.724
<v Speaker 1>if everybody,</v>

387
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 1>have you heard some of the smiths songs?</v>

388
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully,</v>

389
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.151
<v Speaker 1>thankfully,</v>

390
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

391
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.313
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

392
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a few of them,</v>

393
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 1>but they made me sad.</v>

394
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I just only getting sad.</v>

395
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You know there's there,</v>

396
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.590
<v Speaker 1>is it all about having sex with dudes?</v>

397
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:57.901
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

398
00:09:57.901 --> 00:09:58.550
<v Speaker 1>You could just,</v>

399
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've heard the songs.</v>

400
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Speaker 1>You haven't heard of Smith Smith,</v>

401
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.430
<v Speaker 1>the smiths with Morrissey,</v>

402
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>the singer?</v>

403
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.753
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

404
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.623
<v Speaker 1>How old are you again?</v>

405
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:07.951
<v Speaker 1>31 okay.</v>

406
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:08.784
<v Speaker 1>It's before your time.</v>

407
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like the cure,</v>

408
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.410
<v Speaker 1>the passion mode,</v>

409
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Morrissey,</v>

410
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:13.580
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

411
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought we're talking kind of easy,</v>

412
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>like just hip hop everything.</v>

413
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.101
<v Speaker 1>I listen to everything.</v>

414
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:17.761
<v Speaker 1>Do you know this guy?</v>

415
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And he was such a rabid Vegan,</v>

416
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:19.901
<v Speaker 1>not a catch.</v>

417
00:10:19.901 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>He won't let anybody who works for him.</v>

418
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 1>He won't let anybody who works for meet meet this guy.</v>

419
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

420
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>When people working from like the crew,</v>

421
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>he won't let them eat meat like he,</v>

422
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>he like if you worked for him on tour,</v>

423
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>you cannot eat meat.</v>

424
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:32.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

425
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:33.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking,</v>

426
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>these guys get together and we'll,</v>

427
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:36.670
<v Speaker 1>the idea that he could dictate what someone's died is.</v>

428
00:10:36.671 --> 00:10:37.504
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

429
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 1>But he controls not just their physical body when they work for him,</v>

430
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 1>but what they put in their body when they're on tour with him,</v>

431
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 1>he does not allow them to eat meat.</v>

432
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.641
<v Speaker 1>So the crew,</v>

433
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>they get together in one hotel room,</v>

434
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Speaker 1>they'll find,</v>

435
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 1>pick a hotel room and they ordered room service and just go off and have</v>

436
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburgers and steak and shit and they have to hide it from Morrison here.</v>

437
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>This just her from some kid that told Brennan shop.</v>

438
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.090
<v Speaker 5>I did tell me though,</v>

439
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.023
<v Speaker 5>it was a roadie</v>

440
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 5>who heard it from Brendan shot then I've heard the band.</v>

441
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.230
<v Speaker 5>I heard it from the guy who actually worked for him.</v>

442
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.473
<v Speaker 5>The guy was a Rodeo.</v>

443
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:18.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

444
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:18.781
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

445
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:19.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

446
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>he really feels strongly about it.</v>

447
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you hired a bunch of people and you found out that they like to eat</v>

448
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:23.810
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>

449
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.141
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

450
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:24.650
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

451
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.480
<v Speaker 1>you can't fucking eat babies if you want to work for me.</v>

452
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.021
<v Speaker 1>I don't get,</v>

453
00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:29.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe babies is a little different,</v>

454
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:34.331
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is just so he's so anti animal cruelty that he doesn't want anyone</v>

455
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.190
<v Speaker 1>around him working in any capacity that kills animals.</v>

456
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 1>He feels like they're murderers.</v>

457
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

458
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with them,</v>

459
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.380
<v Speaker 1>but that's where it comes from.</v>

460
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.110
<v Speaker 1>If you found out already eight baby dogs,</v>

461
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.490
<v Speaker 1>would you let him open for you?</v>

462
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I would try to</v>

463
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 5>Benson the naughty baby dogs after the talk was,</v>

464
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I get a logical argument.</v>

465
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 1>What is a lamb?</v>

466
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 1>What does lamb?</v>

467
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Lamb is a baby sheet.</v>

468
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

469
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Mutton is a sheep.</v>

470
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck with lamb either.</v>

471
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.813
<v Speaker 1>Lamb has doors.</v>

472
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck with landlord veal chops.</v>

473
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I love lamb chops.</v>

474
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately I don't,</v>

475
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat veal.</v>

476
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Veal cancels Gig in Iceland after venue refuses to go vegetarian,</v>

477
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 1>so he wants everyone to go vegetarian.</v>

478
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 1>No hot dog is this singer.</v>

479
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:20.171
<v Speaker 1>Was due to perform it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Harper concert hall and Reggie Avik and Iceland around.</v>

481
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>He's still a rock star.</v>

482
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Look at Mick Jagger,</v>

483
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 1>but listen to it loosened this.</v>

484
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>It was this request.</v>

485
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Iceland doesn't have any fucking ground.</v>

486
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>You can grow vegetables in Asshole,</v>

487
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 1>like you can't be a vegetarian Iceland unless you're bringing in trucks,</v>

488
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 1>load of food or unless you've got some sort of a crazy fucking greenhouse in</v>

489
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

490
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Now look at that face right there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'd think he's asexual and I like guys,</v>

492
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.463
<v Speaker 1>he's Asexual,</v>

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.470

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.100

00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 1>He walked off the stage.</v>

515
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Poland show after being heckled by a fan.</v>

516
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:18.191

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this guy wants to fuck or not.</v>

522
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.860
<v Speaker 1>He might be saying yes.</v>

523
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 1>The other dude's</v>

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 1>He's like so hung up on the guy being asexual.</v>

526
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.020

531
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.081
<v Speaker 1>Marcy?</v>

00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:52.030

<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

536
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think,</v>

537
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:55.954
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

538
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a human sexual.</v>

539
00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

540
00:13:58.241 --> 00:13:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Humus,</v>

541
00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.733
<v Speaker 1>human sexual.</v>

542
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I think he just eats salary.</v>

543
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking Dick don't work no more.</v>

544
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:04.594
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

545
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.523
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

546
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.143
<v Speaker 1>I was like</v>

547
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>fucking commentators were commentating on biology.</v>

548
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:12.814
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

549
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 1>If you have too much capital for the record,</v>

550
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:23.070
<v Speaker 1>my favorite singer of all time is crazy gay and it makes no difference to me,</v>

551
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:24.260
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

552
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.530
<v Speaker 1>no need to talk about names.</v>

553
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 1>The guys that have come out like Rob Halford,</v>

00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:35.944
<v Speaker 1>He's openly gay.</v>

559
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.010
<v Speaker 1>He came out,</v>

560
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:37.843
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

561
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I still listen to Judas priest.</v>

562
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:39.671
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>

563
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:40.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh guys,</v>

564
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I could give two shits.</v>

565
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Jedi makes no difference.</v>

566
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>

567
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:43.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:44.434
<v Speaker 1>just don't,</v>

569
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you want to know if it has sex with this,</v>

570
00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:49.001

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:49.781
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

573
00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:50.111
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

574
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:50.381
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

575
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I think my blues fans,</v>

576
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 1>the people that care about that,</v>

577
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 1>there's less of them in less than them every day and I think we just hang in</v>

578
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 1>there and we just hang in there as a civilization.</v>

579
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I think racism,</v>

580
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I think people that are homophobic,</v>

581
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 1>transsexual,</v>

582
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>phobic or transphobic or whatever they call it,</v>

583
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 1>people will give a fuck what anybody does.</v>

584
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:07.131
<v Speaker 1>Loan.</v>

585
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:08.150
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hurt you or,</v>

586
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.080
<v Speaker 1>or other folks.</v>

587
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go away.</v>

588
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be around anymore.</v>

589
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.321
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

590
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

591
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I think this is all just a blip in our evolution and our learning.</v>

592
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 1>How long,</v>

593
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.031
<v Speaker 1>how long do you think,</v>

594
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:18.650
<v Speaker 1>how many hundred years at least?</v>

595
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.010
<v Speaker 1>At least no,</v>

596
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.190
<v Speaker 1>no racism.</v>

597
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.801
<v Speaker 1>A hundred years,</v>

598
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:22.710
<v Speaker 1>no homophobia.</v>

599
00:15:22.711 --> 00:15:23.211
<v Speaker 1>A hundred years.</v>

600
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:23.541
<v Speaker 1>All of it.</v>

601
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:24.291
<v Speaker 1>It'd be out the window.</v>

602
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>There'll be like a little blips here and there that'll shock the shit out of</v>

603
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 1>people will find out that there's still people that they're terrible at raising</v>

604
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

605
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think 100 years is several generations in the future.</v>

606
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.121
<v Speaker 1>That's two,</v>

607
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:35.391
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

608
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:35.691
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

609
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:36.351
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it.</v>

610
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:37.071
<v Speaker 1>What's a generation?</v>

611
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:38.630
<v Speaker 1>What's the technical generation?</v>

612
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 1>20 how many years?</v>

613
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:40.491
<v Speaker 1>Five years now,</v>

614
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they consider a generation 75 years.</v>

615
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a 10 or 20 year period that they called you,</v>

616
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>like how long it is before if you're born where you can start fucking and having</v>

617
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 1>kids like how long.</v>

618
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they think of as a generation.</v>

619
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a full life one.</v>

620
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Life's Mexico's 16 ah,</v>

621
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:56.803
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

622
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

623
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>How long has the generation roughly</v>

624
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 1>as the average period,</v>

625
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 1>but 25 years in their offspring.</v>

626
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>That's all it said.</v>

627
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 1>20 it says right here in general,</v>

628
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:11.330
<v Speaker 1>we think of a generation as being 25 years from the birth of a parent to the</v>

629
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:12.130
<v Speaker 1>birth of a child.</v>

630
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

631
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>he's hookers or getting pregnant quick.</v>

632
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>25 already having kids.</v>

633
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Give yourself a chance,</v>

634
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.290
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

635
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.123
<v Speaker 1>go get a life.</v>

636
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Go around.</v>

637
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.020
<v Speaker 1>See the world.</v>

638
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch that shit on 16 pregnant though.</v>

639
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:23.531
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

640
00:16:23.531 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>You know when I watched the other day that I got obsessed with is that Goddamn</v>

641
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.041
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

642
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:29.460
<v Speaker 1>My strange addiction show.</v>

643
00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Let's get you watched five of those fuckers in a row.</v>

644
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 1>The mattresses?</v>

645
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

646
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the bitch snacks on mattresses.</v>

647
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>You see this now?</v>

648
00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It's been five different ones though.</v>

649
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Then she ate her entire mattress,</v>

650
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 1>then went to her moms.</v>

651
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

652
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.080
<v Speaker 1>The mattress cookie monster.</v>

653
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.313
<v Speaker 1>This monster.</v>

654
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.090
<v Speaker 1>That was another eating disorder one there too.</v>

655
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.953
<v Speaker 1>We're all eating.</v>

656
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

657
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:55.250
<v Speaker 1>She's eating a mattress.</v>

658
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Shits.</v>

659
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Look at her house.</v>

660
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.623
<v Speaker 1>The calories.</v>

661
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.543
<v Speaker 1>The one above it.</v>

662
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.590
<v Speaker 1>A faithful mattress and what does that chick drinking gasoline.</v>

663
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:03.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

664
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:04.470
<v Speaker 1>she's drinking.</v>

665
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Guess what about the girl with a giant titties?</v>

666
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.570
<v Speaker 1>She's eating matches my addiction to teal.</v>

667
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 1>What is she saying?</v>

668
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Women has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the surgery ones crazy too.</v>

669
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 1>What does she done to herself,</v>

670
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:18.044
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

671
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.973
<v Speaker 1>We needed to know.</v>

672
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Obviously she hasn't gotten a boob job.</v>

673
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

674
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I saw a girl the other day that was into eating those dryer sheets.</v>

675
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

676
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I saw that bitch and they were too strong.</v>

677
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So what she would do is you're too strong.</v>

678
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 1>She would wrap them and toilet paper,</v>

679
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 1>fold them up and eat the dryer sheets.</v>

680
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:35.931
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

681
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 1>that one you skip by the fucking guy.</v>

00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:41.120
<v Speaker 1>He makes love to his car</v>

685
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:43.190

686
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.030
<v Speaker 1>They showed him that full,</v>

687
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like dry humping the car and get a 98 Monte Carlo.</v>

688
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:47.444
<v Speaker 1>What do you expect?</v>

689
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.860

690
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:50.694

691
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.480
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking American paper as a kid ball,</v>

692
00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>but every paper,</v>

693
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.073
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

694
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

695
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Look at her.</v>

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.531

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 1>K.</v>

699
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.431
<v Speaker 1>K.</v>

700
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>She's uh,</v>

701
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 1>she's Ku Klux Klan.</v>

702
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>She just wanted to get to k because it's a KKK thing.</v>

703
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fun for a night.</v>

704
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:08.521
<v Speaker 1>Then you wake up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Or implants or 14 pounds.</v>

708
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 1>That would not be fun.</v>

709
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd be surprised.</v>

710
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be a hell of a time.</v>

711
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're scared,</v>

712
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're scared,</v>

714
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.600
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't complain about you putting it in her ass.</v>

715
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

716
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 1>She's got 14 pound implants.</v>

717
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean she could take someone conference,</v>

718
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 1>get a certain size.</v>

719
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a turnoff.</v>

720
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:31.861
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

721
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:32.041

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

725
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about like 12 hours a week or scrapes or ear canal with scissors.</v>

726
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

727
00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Nail files and other sharp objects until she bleeds.</v>

728
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.240

923
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:14.210
<v Speaker 1>it'd be off the market.</v>

924
00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:18.020
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't even have to be because these bitches be eight tracks.</v>

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 1>They want it to be able to pause the remote and they don't want the government</v>

930
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:27.170

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't want their jack and to be dependent upon their Internet</v>

936
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 1>You know it's on your phone.</v>

939
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 1>That guy's whacking it for sure.</v>

940
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:40.310

947
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.040
<v Speaker 1>He might not have even made a swing.</v>

948
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 1>He might not have even never stepped to the plate and I can look it up.</v>

949
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.410
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he swung it at some dicks.</v>

950
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest here.</v>

00:24:56.091 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Would that haircut like that and better and better?</v>

952
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.700

00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>to come in and talk to each person has an addiction.</v>

954
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a guy or a Gal.</v>

955
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.800
<v Speaker 1>If there's some,</v>

956
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 1>there's different counselors all the time.</v>

957

965
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>How low tech is this show?</v>

966
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.360
<v Speaker 1>They've got a GoPro behind that dude's right shoulder.</v>

976
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but they get this counselor that comes in and pretends he's got it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which I liked a lot.</v>

1207
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:02.290
<v Speaker 1>A lot of violent criminals between age of 19 and 23 like there's been studies</v>

1208
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:02.830

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Speaker 1>if you removed all the 19 to 23 year old males in our society of violent crime</v>

1214
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:15.880
<v Speaker 1>would drop by like 90% shit.</v>

1215
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Some crazy number who came up with that?</v>

1216
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.920
<v Speaker 1>They just did studies on the amount of people that commit violent crimes and</v>

1217
00:32:20.921 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 1>when they committed the crimes,</v>

1218
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the age for V for young males,</v>

1219
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.151
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1220
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>

1221
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 1>But they always say when in the prison system you go in with whatever,</v>

1222

<v Speaker 1>you know your bachelors of crime and you come out with your master's master's.</v>

1227
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like you're going in and you're learning positive shit.</v>

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It's becomes your culture too.</v>

1235
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 1>money and then you find out there's guys like that judge in Pennsylvania that</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't even want to read into it.</v>

1252
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.110
<v Speaker 1>The idea that some guy had a lot though,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He made hundreds of thousands of dollars over a period.</v>

1262
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.823

1267
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 1>The idea that a judge put people in jail for money and now he's in jail.</v>

1268
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna fuck that guy up.</v>

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:06.080
<v Speaker 1>but most likely you won't make it.</v>

1305
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:07.071
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1306
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:07.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.240
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked in there.</v>

1308
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

1309
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking piece of shit.</v>

1310
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:14.600
<v Speaker 1>That guy is the idea that a human being could do that to a kid though.</v>

1311
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:15.051
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>

1312
00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1313
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just terrifying.</v>

1314
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just terrifying.</v>

1315
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just terrifying that that someone would have that in there.</v>

1316
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Their DNA,</v>

1317
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.600
<v Speaker 1>they have that in their brain where they can accept that.</v>

1318
00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And then you have guys like,</v>

1319
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you see that documentary?</v>

1320
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:32.030
<v Speaker 1>The Jinx on Hbo Has Holy Shit.</v>

1321
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.501
<v Speaker 1>Robert Durst,</v>

1322
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:33.571
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1323
00:35:33.571 --> 00:35:34.850
<v Speaker 1>who got away with murder,</v>

1324
00:35:34.851 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 1>he chopped dude's limbs off and his head off,</v>

1325
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.951
<v Speaker 1>he got busted.</v>

1326
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

1327
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.120
<v Speaker 4>admitted he killed the guy,</v>

1328
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.051
<v Speaker 4>but he says,</v>

1329
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:40.201
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1330
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 4>I kill.</v>

1331
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 4>I had to do that because I accidentally killed him.</v>

1332
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think anybody was going to believe me.</v>

1333
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.350
<v Speaker 4>So I thought,</v>

1334
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

1335
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.070
<v Speaker 4>I better chop off all his limbs in his head and throw him in the river.</v>

1336
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.750
<v Speaker 4>And he got off to the money because he said it was self defense.</v>

1337
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:56.540
<v Speaker 4>It was caught up with him,</v>

1338
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't call the cops.</v>

1339
00:35:57.631 --> 00:35:59.430
<v Speaker 4>He just as a side and nobody was going to believe him.</v>

1340
00:35:59.431 --> 00:36:01.380
<v Speaker 4>So he had to chop the dude up and he got away with it.</v>

1341
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.190
<v Speaker 4>God damnit.</v>

1342
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.023
<v Speaker 4>So crazy.</v>

1343
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Totally get.</v>

1344
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 4>And on top of that,</v>

1345
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:06.270
<v Speaker 4>when they first arrested him,</v>

1346
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:07.441
<v Speaker 4>did you saw it right?</v>

1347
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1348
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 4>When they first arrested him,</v>

1349
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:09.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1350
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 4>he posted bail and skip town.</v>

1351
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 4>So he was a fugitive down.</v>

1352
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.460
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

1353
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.300
<v Speaker 4>They finally catch him,</v>

1354
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.830
<v Speaker 4>catch him and shot him some money.</v>

1355
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 4>They catch him shoplifting,</v>

1356
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:19.471
<v Speaker 4>he's said,</v>

1357
00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:20.304
<v Speaker 4>and he's a millionaire.</v>

1358
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.220
<v Speaker 4>Murdered the guy and chopped him up.</v>

1359
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:24.030
<v Speaker 4>But he said he,</v>

1360
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.850
<v Speaker 4>he did it because he didn't think people were going to believe him because his</v>

1361
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.380
<v Speaker 4>wife was missing and they think he did.</v>

1362
00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:29.214
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

1363
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 4>went missing.</v>

1364
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.131
<v Speaker 4>His wife went,</v>

1365
00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:35.320
<v Speaker 4>Miss [inaudible] says wife went missing.</v>

1366
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 4>He killed his best friend.</v>

1367
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.410
<v Speaker 4>His,</v>

1368
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 4>his wife went missing.</v>

1369
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.570
<v Speaker 4>They never found the body.</v>

1370
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 4>So for 10 years,</v>

1371
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 4>her family suspected,</v>

1372
00:36:43.141 --> 00:36:45.390
<v Speaker 4>and they knew he did it because she was always saying,</v>

1373
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 4>he's going to kill me.</v>

1374
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:46.651
<v Speaker 4>He's going to kill him.</v>

1375
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:47.550
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna fuck me up.</v>

1376
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:48.384
<v Speaker 4>He's going to kill me.</v>

1377
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 4>And then one night she disappeared and he had an alibi or you know,</v>

1378
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 4>she never showed up or she came and I dropped her off at the train and I don't</v>

1379
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:54.384
<v Speaker 4>know where she went.</v>

1380
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.710
<v Speaker 4>We were having a lot of trouble,</v>

1381
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 4>so maybe she just left me,</v>

1382
00:36:57.421 --> 00:36:57.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1383
00:36:57.631 --> 00:36:58.381
<v Speaker 4>people just leave,</v>

1384
00:36:58.381 --> 00:36:59.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1385
00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.791
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1386
00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:01.080
<v Speaker 4>so they never found the body,</v>

1387
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 4>so they just let it go.</v>

1388
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.390
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

1389
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:08.250
<v Speaker 4>he's an air of like a gazillionaire own skyscrapers in New York.</v>

1390
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1391
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.810
<v Speaker 4>He had a lot of power,</v>

1392
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:10.644
<v Speaker 4>a lot of money.</v>

1393
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.820
<v Speaker 4>And he got away with making his wife disappear.</v>

1394
00:37:12.821 --> 00:37:13.890
<v Speaker 4>They still haven't found the body.</v>

1395
00:37:13.891 --> 00:37:16.290
<v Speaker 4>They think there's another case too from the,</v>

1396
00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:18.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm a health food store in Vermont.</v>

1397
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.280
<v Speaker 4>There was a girl who's working in that town.</v>

1398
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.570
<v Speaker 4>A young girl disappeared.</v>

1399
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:22.501
<v Speaker 4>That's another one.</v>

1400
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:23.334
<v Speaker 4>They didn't talk about it,</v>

1401
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 4>but it came out after there's a new one,</v>

1402
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 4>they're connecting to him.</v>

1403
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.463
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1404
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 4>That might have been the first one he killed.</v>

1405
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.140
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the greatest documentaries I've done.</v>

1406
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.360
<v Speaker 4>Last one's insane.</v>

1407
00:37:33.361 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 4>When he goes to the bathroom,</v>

1408
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 4>he's a way to go like talking to himself like an asshole.</v>

1409
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:37.760
<v Speaker 4>He got,</v>

1410
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.590
<v Speaker 4>I killed him.</v>

1411
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Of course they got me.</v>

1412
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.700
<v Speaker 4>Of course he's like talking,</v>

1413
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't realize that Mike is still in the bath talking to himself confess</v>

1414
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.900
<v Speaker 4>because I busted him that that's the evidence though.</v>

1415
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:51.711

00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:07.834
<v Speaker 4>You're doing all these things.</v>

1490
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.561
<v Speaker 4>He went like this,</v>

1491
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:09.394
<v Speaker 4>he went like this</v>

1492
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 4>and then the Gulf and then the burping and when he's in the bathroom,</v>

1493
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:20.410
<v Speaker 4>why did you burp the burden of pain?</v>

1494
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:20.831
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1495
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:22.780
<v Speaker 4>it's so obvious talking himself.</v>

1496
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.521
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1497
00:39:23.521 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 4>it's so crazy.</v>

1498
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 4>But he had the pressure of gliding that long.</v>

1499
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.090
<v Speaker 4>Must be overwhelming,</v>

1500
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:28.660
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1501
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.920
<v Speaker 4>He must've been a smart dude.</v>

1502
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 4>Cause so many investigators came after me at the same story over and over.</v>

1503
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that fucked him is the way spelled Beverly Beverly hills,</v>

1504
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.540
<v Speaker 4>he spelled it with an extra e.</v>

1505
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.820
<v Speaker 4>So the killer killed a lady and sent the letter,</v>

1506
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 4>said the cadavers here with,</v>

1507
00:39:45.221 --> 00:39:45.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1508
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:50.580
<v Speaker 4>the address and he spelt Beverly with an extra e white killed the chick.</v>

1509
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1510
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1511
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 4>it was all about his wife.</v>

1512
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 4>He made his wife disappear.</v>

1513
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.350
<v Speaker 4>So for 10 years he got away with it.</v>

1514
00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:57.131
<v Speaker 4>But he had a really,</v>

1515
00:39:57.131 --> 00:40:01.150
<v Speaker 4>his best friend with some chick who was the daughter of a big mob boss.</v>

1516
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 4>So he was really connected with the mob.</v>

1517
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.310
<v Speaker 4>So that was the only chick who knew she was his publicist during the 10 years</v>

1518
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 4>when people were accusing him,</v>

1519
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 4>they ended up dropping the case.</v>

1520
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.580
<v Speaker 4>They could never find a body.</v>

1521
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.511
<v Speaker 4>So she knew.</v>

1522
00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:12.340
<v Speaker 4>She ended up moving to fucking la.</v>

1523
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 4>She was a writer.</v>

1524
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.190
<v Speaker 4>They still kept in touch,</v>

1525
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.500
<v Speaker 4>but her,</v>

1526
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 4>the wife who was missing her family would always tell the investigators goal,</v>

1527
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:22.361
<v Speaker 4>interview,</v>

1528
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:22.931
<v Speaker 4>that chick,</v>

1529
00:40:22.931 --> 00:40:23.711
<v Speaker 4>Sharon something,</v>

1530
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:24.544
<v Speaker 4>go interview that chick.</v>

1531
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 4>That chick knows go question.</v>

1532
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.350
<v Speaker 4>And then when they were finally going to do at 10 15 years later,</v>

1533
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 4>they were going to reopen it and go question that chick.</v>

1534
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.030
<v Speaker 4>He's in New York,</v>

1535
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 4>she's dead.</v>

1536
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:41.130
<v Speaker 4>She gets blown away and it just so happens he flew to California like that name,</v>

1570
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:28.120
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1571
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.440
<v Speaker 4>He's wanted his mom.</v>

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.890
<v Speaker 4>You want to just send them to see was what he said.</v>

1573
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 4>But all his defense was always about feel sorry for me.</v>

1574
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1575
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1576
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.130
<v Speaker 4>for Siphon it was all,</v>

1577
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>

1578
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 4>just kidding.</v>

1579
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.110
<v Speaker 4>That's what he said.</v>

1580
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.020
<v Speaker 4>He was real shit.</v>

1581
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.190
<v Speaker 4>It be create a monster.</v>

1582
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 4>If his dad killed his mom in front of them were really what it was.</v>

1583
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 4>What it was is he got rid of his,</v>

1584
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 4>his wife.</v>

1585
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 4>So the only reason he murdered that check was cause she was going to start</v>

1586
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 4>talking 10 15 years later.</v>

1587
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.510
<v Speaker 4>So he had to kill it.</v>

1588
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.191
<v Speaker 4>What about the neighbors?</v>

1589
00:41:57.191 --> 00:41:57.830
<v Speaker 4>So he killed her,</v>

1590
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 4>the neighbor because then he kills her and then he disappears and dresses up</v>

1591
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:03.231
<v Speaker 4>like a chicken.</v>

1592
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:08.231
<v Speaker 4>Rents a house in Arizona or mute chick in Texas so that no one talks to me.</v>

1593
00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:09.710
<v Speaker 4>He's like an old lady.</v>

1594
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 4>So after he kills her,</v>

1595
00:42:11.271 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 4>he's in Texas hiding out and he had this neighbor that eventually he started</v>

1596
00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 4>talking to after a while and then he,</v>

1597
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.830
<v Speaker 4>he ended up telling him who he was and then he had to kill him too because he</v>

1598
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 4>knew like it was just really obvious.</v>

1599
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.700
<v Speaker 4>He looks like shit because he knew he was killing it.</v>

1600
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 4>How's he getting away with this?</v>

1601
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:30.590
<v Speaker 4>He looks like a piece of shit.</v>

1602
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:30.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1603
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.340
<v Speaker 4>he looks like Mr. Burns Bro.</v>

1604
00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like Mr. Burns just shooting and killing anybody.</v>

1605
00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 4>He's chopping bitches up to and then check this out.</v>

1606
00:42:39.051 --> 00:42:39.884
<v Speaker 4>That would be,</v>

1607
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:40.930
<v Speaker 4>that would take four.</v>

1608
00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:43.180
<v Speaker 4>So the neighbor that he told every,</v>

1609
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:43.830
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1610
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.110
<v Speaker 4>his wife disappeared.</v>

1611
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.400
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful,</v>

1612
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:47.720
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>

1613
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 4>great skin.</v>

1614
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 4>And so he has to kill his neighbor in Texas because he knows everything.</v>

1615
00:42:51.831 --> 00:42:52.750
<v Speaker 4>So he chocked,</v>

1616
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.481
<v Speaker 4>he chops up,</v>

1617
00:42:53.481 --> 00:42:54.860
<v Speaker 4>has he chops off his arms,</v>

1618
00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:55.694
<v Speaker 4>his legs in his head.</v>

1619
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.200
<v Speaker 4>He puts them in plastic bags,</v>

1620
00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:58.130
<v Speaker 4>he throws him in the leg.</v>

1621
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.910
<v Speaker 4>The next morning he comes to see if they float it up and they floated up.</v>

1622
00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 4>So it's like fuck all these body parts right there.</v>

1623
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.611
<v Speaker 4>So he says,</v>

1624
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

1625
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.240
<v Speaker 4>He grabs the head cause he shot him in the head and disappeared with that.</v>

1626
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 4>They never found the head.</v>

1627
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.581
<v Speaker 4>They found the body.</v>

1628
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Obviously they check the fingerprints.</v>

1629
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:12.650
<v Speaker 4>They went to the guys,</v>

1630
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:13.790
<v Speaker 4>they went to the guy's house,</v>

1631
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:15.320
<v Speaker 4>they started interviewing the,</v>

1632
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:16.850
<v Speaker 4>the landlord and the neighbor go,</v>

1633
00:43:16.851 --> 00:43:17.391
<v Speaker 4>who lives here?</v>

1634
00:43:17.391 --> 00:43:17.601
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

1635
00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:18.740
<v Speaker 4>some mute old lady.</v>

1636
00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:19.574
<v Speaker 4>Then they started,</v>

1637
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:20.540
<v Speaker 4>then they figured out,</v>

1638
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

1639
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 4>this is the dude that fucking did it.</v>

1640
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 4>He gets busted,</v>

1641
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 4>he gets arrested,</v>

1642
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Speaker 4>post bail disappears.</v>

1643
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 4>They catch him shoplifting a sandwich like a week later.</v>

1644
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 4>So then he goes to trial,</v>

1645
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.481
<v Speaker 4>he goes to trial,</v>

1646
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 4>but he was wanted for the murder for that lady in California and still his wife.</v>

1647
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:38.300
<v Speaker 4>But Texas said he's willing to try him here.</v>

1648
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 4>We got them open and shut.</v>

1649
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:40.603
<v Speaker 4>He's done.</v>

1650
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.750

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 4>there was no way he was going to get.</v>

1654

<v Speaker 4>He was just a white self sabotage a little bit.</v>

1707
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:12.130
<v Speaker 4>He was in the,</v>

1708
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 4>in the early fifties he was washed up,</v>

1709
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:14.821
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:15.590
<v Speaker 4>he was done.</v>

1711
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Ava Gardner is trying to fucking get away from time.</v>

1712
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.110
<v Speaker 4>She's good.</v>

1713
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.550
<v Speaker 4>She's doing movies in Europe,</v>

1714
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 4>trying to get away,</v>

1715
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 4>and he's on plane Stockinger and going after.</v>

1716
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:25.020
<v Speaker 4>And she,</v>

1717
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.801
<v Speaker 4>she loved him,</v>

1718
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:26.910
<v Speaker 4>but she was done with them.</v>

1719
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 4>And so at the,</v>

1720
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.660
<v Speaker 4>he was rock bottom and he read this script from here to eternity.</v>

1721
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how I got the script,</v>

1722
00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:34.090
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

1723
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 4>that was a part in from here to eternity that he thought he could play a nail.</v>

1724
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 4>And he begged the studio,</v>

1725
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:40.140
<v Speaker 4>please give me one more chance.</v>

1726
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.003
<v Speaker 4>I could do this.</v>

1727
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.330
<v Speaker 4>And then they didn't want to do it.</v>

1728
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:43.600
<v Speaker 4>So Ava Gardner calls it,</v>

1729
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.820
<v Speaker 4>puts the call in and says,</v>

1730
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.990
<v Speaker 4>just give him a shot.</v>

1731
00:45:45.991 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 4>He put through,</v>

1732
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.240
<v Speaker 4>you know what he did for three grand?</v>

1733
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 4>So he did it,</v>

1734
00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1735
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.030
<v Speaker 4>And while he was making the movie,</v>

1736
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:53.410
<v Speaker 4>everybody knew that the movie was going to be big and then frank,</v>

1737
00:45:53.411 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 4>so I'm just going to make a big comeback.</v>

1738
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:55.650
<v Speaker 4>So with that heat,</v>

1739
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.500
<v Speaker 4>capitol records signed them and gave them another chance.</v>

1740
00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.730
<v Speaker 4>So the movie comes out,</v>

1741
00:45:59.731 --> 00:46:04.731
<v Speaker 4>he went to the fucking Oscar and his new album that came out fucking blew up.</v>

1742
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 4>So now he's a hundred times bigger than he's ever been.</v>

1743
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.150
<v Speaker 4>He's a monster.</v>

1744
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 4>Start his own record company.</v>

1745
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 4>Start his own movie company.</v>

1746
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Matt Hill saw anymore.</v>

1755
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.891
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1756
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:29.760
<v Speaker 4>It's not talking about that.</v>

1757
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get followed in shit.</v>

1758
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:31.561
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1759
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1760
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:32.311

1761
00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:37.311
<v Speaker 4>I converted that and I converted to Christianity is way crazier than Scientology</v>

1762
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.270
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

1763
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Fucking girl on a bearded guy up in the clouds or an alien that takes you out of</v>

1764
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:45.480
<v Speaker 4>a volcano.</v>

1765
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1766
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.770
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1767
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:47.220
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1768
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.053
<v Speaker 4>what's worse?</v>

1769
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:53.010
<v Speaker 4>What's worse is the guy who was obviously mentally ill created this religion.</v>

1770
00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously I think he was brilliant.</v>

1771
00:46:58.650 --> 00:46:59.483
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

1772
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.040
<v Speaker 4>You know he wrote more books than anybody ever.</v>

1773
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:02.963
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1774
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.840
<v Speaker 4>He would publish more books than anybody knows how close they're so bad.</v>

1775
00:47:06.841 --> 00:47:08.040
<v Speaker 4>You could write them in a day.</v>

1776
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:08.880
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>

1777
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.290
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever read battlefield earth?</v>

1778
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:10.961
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1779
00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:13.530
<v Speaker 4>Another right shadow field or and say that about LRA.</v>

1780
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:14.543
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1781
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.640
<v Speaker 4>are you?</v>

1782
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.920
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the,</v>

1783
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 4>if you watch the movie,</v>

1784
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:18.690
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1785
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.730
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking amazingly bad movie.</v>

1786
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a movie with John Travolta and forest Whitaker.</v>

1787
00:47:23.731 --> 00:47:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Forest Whitaker plays giant alien John Travolta.</v>

1788
00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:26.640
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1789
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:26.851
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1790
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1791
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:28.260
<v Speaker 4>it's the worst movie ever,</v>

1792
00:47:28.261 --> 00:47:29.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1793
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not the story I've heard.</v>

1794
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 4>It seems like a sketch and Saturday night live like a parody of a really bad</v>

1795
00:47:34.331 --> 00:47:35.111
<v Speaker 4>science fiction film.</v>

1796
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:35.944
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>

1797
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 4>It's so bad.</v>

1798
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 4>John Travolta defends it.</v>

1799
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 4>How dare he,</v>

1800
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.110
<v Speaker 4>and this is all based on an l Ron Hubbard book about,</v>

1801
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1802
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.760
<v Speaker 4>alien invaders and do their saints from,</v>

1803
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.980
<v Speaker 4>she wants to get out,</v>

1804
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 4>but they have too much dirt on them.</v>

1805
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1806
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.590
<v Speaker 4>who says that this documentary,</v>

1807
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 4>he can't get out now son.</v>

1808
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:56.223
<v Speaker 4>It's too late.</v>

1809
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 4>You're too deep too,</v>

1810
00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:58.270
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1811
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 4>They scare me to convince.</v>

1812
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Confess all your shit and they record it.</v>

1813
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 4>That's what they blackmail.</v>

1814
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 4>That's how they get you Cruz's balls deep in it allegedly.</v>

1815
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1816
00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:09.370
<v Speaker 4>It's also a gang.</v>

1817
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 4>What Gang?</v>

1818
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:12.360
<v Speaker 4>They'll protect you.</v>

1819
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:17.360
<v Speaker 4>I had to pick a religion to be totally 100% devoted to and be real.</v>

1820
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.090
<v Speaker 4>It would be Scientology.</v>

1821
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Fuck off.</v>

1822
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>

1823
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:21.871
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1824
00:48:21.871 --> 00:48:22.041
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1825
00:48:22.041 --> 00:48:24.680
<v Speaker 4>they have a lot of the things you like to know what they did this and killing</v>

1826
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1827
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:25.141
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1828
00:48:25.141 --> 00:48:25.310
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1829
00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:26.050
<v Speaker 4>But you know what?</v>

1830
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.610
<v Speaker 4>They real estate,</v>

1831
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:31.720
<v Speaker 4>the IRS make them after the IRS,</v>

1832
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.990
<v Speaker 4>all the Scientologists got together because IRS was going to bury him for</v>

1833
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:38.110
<v Speaker 4>billions and billions of dollars because of some back taxes.</v>

1834
00:48:38.111 --> 00:48:39.020
<v Speaker 4>They weren't paying taxes.</v>

1835
00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:39.600
<v Speaker 4>And they're saying,</v>

1836
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.091
<v Speaker 4>cause ever saying,</v>

1837
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:40.211
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1838
00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 4>we're religion.</v>

1839
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.381
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you guys.</v>

1840
00:48:41.381 --> 00:48:41.831
<v Speaker 4>Where religion,</v>

1841
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:42.910
<v Speaker 4>just like all your other religions.</v>

1842
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.280
<v Speaker 4>So the IRS said you will not a fucking religion.</v>

1843
00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.860
<v Speaker 4>This is not over that you owe $5 billion in taxes.</v>

1844
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 4>So what they decided to do is they filed each one of them,</v>

1845
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:51.940
<v Speaker 4>all the Scientology.</v>

1846
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 4>I'll filed lawsuits against the IRS and went after different people</v>

1847
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:56.650
<v Speaker 4>individually.</v>

1848
00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.370
<v Speaker 4>They all do.</v>

1849
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:58.660
<v Speaker 4>So they flooded them.</v>

1850
00:48:58.810 --> 00:48:59.350
<v Speaker 4>So they're like,</v>

1851
00:48:59.350 --> 00:48:59.951
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

1852
00:48:59.951 --> 00:49:01.240
<v Speaker 4>how do we make this shit go away?</v>

1853
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:02.590
<v Speaker 4>Just make us a religion,</v>

1854
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 4>make a fucking year religion.</v>

1855
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:05.590

1856
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1857
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Speaker 4>that's powerful and insane.</v>

1858
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 4>But the guy that took over after he died,</v>

1859
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:11.710

1860
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 4>It's like Tom Cruise.</v>

1861
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.673
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1863
00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:21.610
<v Speaker 4>that were in going clear like all the character assassinations.</v>

1864
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1865
00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:22.530

<v Speaker 4>See CVC,</v>

1867
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Scientology response to going,</v>

1868
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:26.450
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1871
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 4>There's two sides to every story.</v>

1872
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I just want to make it really clear.</v>

1873
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.840
<v Speaker 4>If I had to pick a religion,</v>

1874
00:49:31.841 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 4>I would pick Scientology and that's all I'm going to say.</v>

1875
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.343

1931
00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:54.410

<v Speaker 4>he should have finished him for the amount of shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't camp out on a mountain and you finish the fight.</v>

1934
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.030

1955
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:32.240
<v Speaker 4>He decides to go out on that high note.</v>

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.150
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2054
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 4>for some reason the we documentaries,</v>

2055
00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 4>you know it's a weed though.</v>

2056
00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.753
<v Speaker 4>There's just like a big,</v>

2057
00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.700
<v Speaker 4>well the union union was a little weird.</v>

2058
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 4>It had a big leaf though.</v>

2059
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:07.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2060
00:54:07.381 --> 00:54:09.480
<v Speaker 4>He can always tell the leaf this gotta be something.</v>

2061
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.180
<v Speaker 4>Don't get all crazy with zero more recognizable symbol that a company,</v>

2062
00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 4>a company didn't create.</v>

2063
00:54:14.371 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Then the leaf.</v>

2064
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2065
00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.180
<v Speaker 4>that'll pop.</v>

2066
00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:16.951
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't cry.</v>

2067
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 4>He didn't create the pot.</v>

2068
00:54:18.181 --> 00:54:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Leaf is not like Coca Cola.</v>

2069
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.970
<v Speaker 4>Anybody could use the pile leaf,</v>

2070
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.890
<v Speaker 4>but is there a more recognizable symbol that the,</v>

2071
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 4>that of the government or a company didn't create?</v>

2072
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.580
<v Speaker 4>How about that upside down pot leaf that,</v>

2073
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:29.700
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty good.</v>

2074
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>tied McCormick cheeses.</v>

2077
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.800
<v Speaker 4>You notice that he does the leaf,</v>

2078
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.591
<v Speaker 4>the leaf one,</v>

2079
00:54:34.591 --> 00:54:35.101
<v Speaker 4>the regular one.</v>

2080
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2081
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.650
<v Speaker 4>he does it upside down like that and it's pretty damn cool.</v>

2082
00:54:37.651 --> 00:54:38.071

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2085
00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.293
<v Speaker 4>It's cool.</v>

2086
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.570
<v Speaker 4>It's still pot leaf.</v>

2087
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:43.200
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

2088
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.070
<v Speaker 4>you can't mistake it.</v>

2089
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of anything more.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm just worried about my lungs.</v>

2094
00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:53.340
