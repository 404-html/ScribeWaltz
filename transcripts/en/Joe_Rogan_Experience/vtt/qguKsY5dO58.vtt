1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.230
What hotel?

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.520
We're on the air right now and I'm going to tweet and talk at the same time,

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.850
folks.
That's how I go.
That's how rose.
Here we go.

4
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:11.010
I don't even have to look at this fucking scream and that's how good on that.

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.350
Here we go.
I'm gonna go with you dirty bitches.

6
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:16.740
You do your t p t c h e s,

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.580
http colon backslash,
but I do it all by hand.

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.690
Tell you I'm a fucking throw back.
I drive a manual transmission car.

9
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.250
Ladies and gentlemen.
You know why?

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.090
Because I'm a fucking man and a man should know how to rope gears.
Okay,

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.640
can you shoot?
No.
Around the tree?
Yeah,
I've done that before,

12
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:35.580
but that's confuses the shit out of me.
A friend had a truck and I was like,

13
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:37.080
what's going to bill?
Burr has one of those.

14
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.870
He has a three on the tree for folks at home.

15
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.730
Don't know what we're talking about.

16
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.200
Old School trucks especially would have clutches on the floor.

17
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.420
Let me just do this commercial quick.
We'll talk about cars.

18
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.990
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by a bunch of shit.

19
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:56.100
That's groovy.
Okay.
One of them is death squad.
Dot.
TV.

20
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.780
If you look at desk [inaudible] dot TV,

21
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.990
that's where all the dope kitty cat shirts that Brian designs are a for sale.

22
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.390
Tate Fletcher's with us today.
He is old school.
Oh Gee.

23
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:11.391
Desk squad member from the day Sohn to the core in the DNA kid.

24
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.770
You can't extract that Shit.

25
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.630
rogan.ting.com is another place you should go.
Oh,
did I say a death squad.
Dot TV.

26
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.530
Go there by the TV.
By the time they buy a TV five by a fucking,

27
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.660
you can't actually through doug.com do that.

28
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.130
And it's another way Brian makes money.

29
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.560
That sneaky little fuck I can buy a new shoe.

30
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.610
If you go to Doug [inaudible] dot com and order,

31
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.480
like if you're going to buy something from Amazon,

32
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.300
Amazon has this crazy program where you,
uh,

33
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.700
you don't have to actually go just through Amazon.

34
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.340
You can have like a little affiliate link up on your site.

35
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.800
So if they want to look at something that go through your site and the person

36
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:46.890
who wants a site gets like a little kickback,
it's kind of Nice of Amazon to do.

37
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.480
So I think it's a cool thing to support anyway.
So doug.com a way to do that.
Um,

38
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.670
we're also brought to you by Ting Tang is the,
uh,

39
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.810
the mobile company that I've been talking about for awhile.
Uh,
they,
uh,

40
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.480
had been sponsoring us on a,
you know,
kind of an on and off basis,
uh,

41
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.410
just to try it out and it's been working out well.

42
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.360
And the reason why it's been working out well,

43
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.060
it's cause you guys were responding to what they're selling and it's a great

44
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:13.470
service.
There's no contracts,
right?
The waiting has it set up.
You can,
like,

45
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:17.340
you could have a whole family on the same amount of time.
There's a,

46
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.870
like if you,
if you don't use a certain amount of minutes per month,

47
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.360
like if you're allotted x amount of minutes and you don't use them,

48
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.440
you get credited to them on the next month.
It's as fair companies you can get.

49
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:29.850
There's no cancellation fees,

50
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.110
there's no contracts and they use the sprint network.
So it's a solid network.

51
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.880
They just do it in a way that I just think it's like,

52
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:41.580
it's a smarter move ethically.
Like they're not,

53
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.320
they're not trying to rip anybody off there.

54
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:47.340
They're not trying to lock you into some stupid ass fucking contract.
Why should,

55
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.050
why should it be even the legal that you can tell me that I have to be with you

56
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:55.710
even though you suck or if I want to leave I have to pay a fee.

57
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.760
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
It's,
that's terrible.
And these guys don't do that.

58
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.880
And that's what I love about Tang.
I think it's a fucking cool company.

59
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:06.620
It was probably a CIA front approach.
That's probably what it is,

60
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:11.080
is I'm selling some fucking recording devices and gps track.
No,

61
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.630
I'm not folks.
It's a,
I fucking talk to the guy in the phone.

62
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.970
He seems like it's totally,

63
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.040
the phones they have are the shit too,
by the way.
I like that.

64
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.870
Let's keep doing that in commercials and make it more exciting.
I'm shocked.
Me,

65
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.140
Brian.
Um,
the phones they have are excellent.

66
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.940
The one that I got is a Samsung Galaxy s three.
It's fucking dope.

67
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.140
I have not committed to it as my main phone over my iPhone mostly because I have

68
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.170
to move the context and everything,
but I'm just going to say this,

69
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.690
it shits all over the iPhone.

70
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.720
It shits all over the iPhone.

71
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.430
It's fucking that Samsung Galaxy s three is the shit.
It's huge.

72
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.151
First of all,

73
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.570
you get used to looking at web pages on their big thing and you don't ever want

74
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.120
to go back to an iPhone.
You're like,
it's so stupid.

75
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.590
I could browse the web and actually read a website instead of scrolling to the

76
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:06.340
left and scrolling to the right and trying to fit it all in like a fucking

77
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.520
caveman.
What that Samsung Galaxy s three,
you can see the whole screen.

78
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.940
They have a bunch of other cool smartphones to,

79
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.970
there's like a wide variety of phones and they even have like if you like old

80
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:18.200
school flip phone dude,
they've got one of those things to man.

81
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.220
You can a lot of dudes,
they,
even Dana White,
Dana white goes,

82
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.870
he rocks old school who Brock's a flip phone and he texted with one thumb.

83
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.820
Dude is weird,
but that's,
that's all possible on Ting.

84
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.480
Um,
all sorts of different LG mostly.
Um,

85
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.070
mostly droid smartphones though and ones that have excellent ratings online too.

86
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.390
If you go and go to like,
um,
uh,
any of the tech sites,

87
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.320
see net along those lines and check out some of the reviews on some of these

88
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:50.650
phones.
A lot of them are like really bad ass,
especially the galaxy s three.

89
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.480
So go Walter rogan.ting.com and if you sign up for service,

90
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:59.950
you save 50 bucks off the price of a phone.
Whoa.
Can you believe that shit?

91
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.390
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's a alpha brain.
That's my,

92
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:07.270
um,
that's the one thing that I talk about on this podcast.

93
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:10.180
Probably more than anything as far as like sponsorships that have really worked

94
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.770
for me is this,

95
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.400
fuck the idea of bottling up the best nootropics.

96
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.850
I'm a big fan of nutrition and health and uh,

97
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.760
and I'm a big fan of supplementation to,

98
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:26.320
and I think that there are absolutely certain supplements that it can enhance,

99
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.810
can enhance the way your brain functions.

100
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.280
Just like caffeine can pick you up and give you a little boost and give you some

101
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:33.701
energy,

102
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.870
just like a lot of different nutrients can have a positive effect on athletic

103
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.680
performance.

104
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.970
There are certain compounds that have been shown to clearly have a positive

105
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.790
effect on your brain's ability to function.
Your,
your,

106
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.320
your ability to rattle off sentences,

107
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.350
your ability to recall things that you need to remember.
It's um,

108
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.060
it's just if there are nutrients that help to enhance your brain's ability to

109
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:56.170
produce neurotransmitters,

110
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.630
all of it can be explained and way more detailed than me because I'm a fucking

111
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:02.690
idiot and I don't really know what I'm saying.
The things that I'm saying,

112
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.730
it's like I'm saying the right words and the right order,

113
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.640
but what am I saying really?
I don't know.
I don't know.

114
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.970
I really don't know much about neurotransmitters.

115
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.000
If you told me where's the w w where's the neurotransmitter factory?

116
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.780
In the brain.
I was like,
hmm,
I don't know the plumbing.

117
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.410
I don't know where the light switches.
I don't know shit.

118
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.880
But I know when I take Alpha brain,
uh,
first of all,
I have insanely vivid dreams.

119
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.150
That is the one thing that seems nothing seems universal,

120
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:32.420
which I found really fascinating about this experience getting involved with a

121
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:34.670
vitamin company is nothing's universal.

122
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.120
There's some people that just do not respond to a lot of different things,

123
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.110
or their sensitivity is different than yours or I don't know,

124
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.050
or their body's different.
There's no doubt about it.
Look,

125
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:46.850
some people can eat peanuts and they love him.

126
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.680
Some people eat peanuts and they're fucking dead.

127
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.930
Some people can eat shellfish and they love him.

128
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:54.110
Some people eat shell fish in there fucking debt.
It's weird,
you know,

129
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.330
it's like food for one person is literally poison for the neck,

130
00:06:57.331 --> 00:07:00.860
so our bodies are not the same.
And because of that,

131
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:03.500
to make sure that no one ever feels ripped off.

132
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.880
One of the things we have at on it is a 100% money back guarantee on the first

133
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:10.910
30 pills.
You don't have to return the product.
You just say,

134
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:12.830
the shit is not for me.
It doesn't work for me.

135
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.310
But that's the way it's set up that ways for two reasons.
One,

136
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.870
to ensure you that we're not trying to rip anybody off and everything we sell is

137
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:25.310
something that I personally stand behind.
My livelihood is not dependent on this.

138
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.031
This is,

139
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:30.380
this is like some extra money that sponsors the podcast for some shit that I

140
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:32.840
really believe in that that's how I look at it.

141
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.720
But if I had nothing to do with this,

142
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:40.460
I would still be raving about this shit because every one of the different

143
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.990
supplements,
whether it's room tech sport,

144
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:44.600
which is based on the quarter steps mushroom,
that helps,
uh,

145
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.040
it gives you endurance.

146
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.900
All of these things are based on real science and their bay and it's all stuff

147
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:52.940
that I would take if I had nothing to do with this show.

148
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.240
<v 1>Go to Joe Rogan.

150
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.100
That little commercial you became really confusing.

151
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.840
You just fucking marred the message.

152
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.390

Will Not stop cause you gotta think this is a job stupid.
It's not.

153
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.060
You know you're actually supposed to be doing something.

154
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.440
Oh shoot here for two minutes.
I've got to make fart noises.
They can't dig it.

155
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.260
Add.

156
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.260
Are you hitting the monkey one or how to get it confused to be like I'm going to

157
00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:32.000
go to parks cause I'm bored.
Yeah.
Well let's see.
Well the bank aren't doing it.

158
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.270
<v 0>Don't see that there's any other way to do this job.</v>

159
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.130
So on a.com get yourself some kettle bells.

160
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.050
That's the newest thing we have.
We have packages,

161
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.990
all sorts of different packages of different kettle bells.

162
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.220
The best quality they're made by Troy and they will survive the apocalypse and

163
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:50.800

166
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.320

167
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.710
is expensive.
Them Shits is very expensive,

168
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:11.310

183
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:08.840
it looks like it's glued on.

184
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.810
It looks like the fake Rick Ross beard like they were talking about.

185
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.760
He goes to the front gate,
the fake Rick Ross.
Well,
you got to

186
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.770
free freeway,
Rick Ross.
If you haven't listened to those episodes of my podcast,

187
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.630
please do it just for your own edification because it's a fascinating scenario.

188
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.100
Guy Was a big time drug dealers name is freeway,
Rick Ross and went to jail.

189
00:10:31.101 --> 00:10:33.740
I mean he had a freeway,
Rick Ross Task Force and the LAPD,

190
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.720
his drug sales were a part of the Iran contra gate.
All that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

191
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.380
His drug sales where what's funding foreign militaries.

192
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.870
That's where they were getting the money from the CIA.

193
00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:48.290
And this is all part of how a Gary Webb expose this in a book.

194
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:53.090
And Michael Rupert who was a la police department,
narcotics officer exposed it.

195
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.720
Yeah.
I mean,
so this guy freeway Rick Ross was a part of this.

196
00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:59.030
He was a huge drug dealer making millions and millions of dollars.
Right?

197
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.300
Just crazy,
crazy money.
Drove around in a hearse,
you know,

198
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:06.470
like drive around like station wagons and shit.
So like no flashy,
no bling,

199
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.080
just kept it on the DL,
just raking in the cash.

200
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.880
Meanwhile the dude couldn't even read.
Okay.
Goes to jail,
learns how to read,

201
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.930
becomes a lawyer,

202
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.730
finds a hole in his fucking in his three strikes thing and gets out.

203
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.340
So while he's in jail,

204
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.540
some dude is calling himself Rick Ross and he's a big fat guy who used to be a

205
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:29.360
corrections officer.
No Way.

206
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:34.450
A corrections officer is pretending that he was this big time drug dealer,

207
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.930
Rick Ross.
So now Rick Ross gets out of jail and he's trying to sue them.

208
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.170
He's trying,
but he's like going to battle.
They're going to have the record.

209
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:46.340
Companies are going to battle with him over his own real name.

210
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.730
That's awesome.
It's insane.
This is a movie Tait Fletcher.

211
00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:53.950
This is not a real world.
This is not of this world is not real.

212
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.940
Just because you can touch it and move it around as a mother fucker's fake this,

213
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.450
this is,

214
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.560
there's no way that's possible in 2012 is no way that should be possible.

215
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.490
Some guy could,
it could be a corrections officer.
I get that.
He's like that.

216
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.810
Every one of his raps.

217
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:11.290
Is there a wrap that he has that's not about shooting somebody or having a pound

218
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:12.990
of blow?
Yeah,
it's all about hustling.
He's,

219
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.110
but how about the fact that he's got Rick Ross tattooed on his fingers?

220
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.770
He's get Rick Ross Thompson that closely,
dude,

221
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:24.430
he's got another man's name tattooed on his fingers and that other man is that a

222
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:28.150
jail now because he's smart.
None of the guys are real bad mother fucker.

223
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.600
He's not some fake fat guy who knows how to make shit rhyme.
That's awesome.
Wow.

224
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.580
It's a crazy story,
man.
It's really weird story.
How long did you spend with them?

225
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.330
We did two podcasts with him and he came back and the,

226
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:44.290
the dude's we could do a hundred more man.
They got some stories.
Yeah.
Yeah.

227
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:49.060
And he's still fighting it in court.
Very nice guy,
man.
He's got money.
No,
no,
no.

228
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:53.020
He's barely getting by.
But he's a,
I mean he's,
I'm sure,
I mean,

229
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.740
I guess he could make money doing like interviews or doing like,
um,

230
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.770
uh,
seminars or something like that.
But I think he's trying to do it more for,

231
00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:03.370
for like real benefit.
Man.

232
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:07.090
He's like doing a lot of different speeches for young kids and telling his story

233
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:09.640
and trying to offer inspiration because the dude went to jail.

234
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:11.650
He didn't even know how to read.
He was a tennis player,

235
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.310
like a really bad ass tennis player and in learning how to play tennis,

236
00:13:16.311 --> 00:13:19.510
the Williams,
his uncle,
he was a really good tennis player,

237
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:21.190
but he couldn't read so it couldn't go to college.

238
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.390
So it's like you would never go get a screen play.

239
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.810
So I'm sure they must have something going on.
We actually talked to him about,

240
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:33.400
we said too short how to play it
too short.
Looks just like him.
I'm telling you,

241
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.910
he's taller than too short,
but he has two shorts face.
It's kind of crazy.

242
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.840
Or maybe Denzel Washington could play him.
They can fucking play anybody.
Right.

243
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.600
He's bad ass man.
You're doing it.
You did a movie with them.
Yeah.
Yeah.

244
00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:47.320
It just got off.
What is it?
It's called two guns.
Tim,

245
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.940
him and Mark Wahlberg and uh,
we're,

246
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.410
our crew is all navy seals and then we split from Walberg.

247
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:54.280
He was one of our crew.

248
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:57.880
And then we go to kill them and the movie's US hunting them basically.

249
00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.830
What do you,
what do you feel like when,

250
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.700
if you are real navy seal and you saw these crazy like missing an action type

251
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:05.800
movies and shit,
when people do ridiculous stuff,

252
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.700
what the fuck does it like crazy dude on films is that all those guys,

253
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:13.930
the producers and directors,
they're like,
we need this to look real.
We need this.

254
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:17.230
We want it to be authentic and tell it's the day to shoot it.

255
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.430
And then they're like,
okay,

256
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:21.300
we're going to flip the car over 16 times and you're just going to,
uh,

257
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.070
you're going to push it off and you'll just push out and roll something like

258
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.060
that.
It's ridiculous,
you know?
And um,
there's a lot of that,

259
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.810
that none of it matters.
It's all a suspension of belief,
you know?
Yeah.

260
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.550
There's a certain amount of that you do in a movie though.
And I lose level 10.

261
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.520
I could never get to level 10 of you move it.
You know what though,
dude is like,

262
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:41.470
you look at uh,
American kickbox or something,

263
00:14:41.471 --> 00:14:44.320
and as a MMA fighter you look at that and you're still like awesome.

264
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:48.040
And he's dipping his fucking gauze and not in glass and shit.
You're like,
yeah,

265
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.740
right.
But it's never going to kick.

266
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.380
I don't think it was that just called kickboxer.
Yeah,

267
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.630
just the John Claude van Damme.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think when you get to a certain,
uh,

268
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.250
you,
you know,
we have to suspend disbelief like that,

269
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.340
you'd never going to hit like that godfather level.
Right.
You know,

270
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.580
when you see like the Godfather and you watch that movie go,
God damn,

271
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:08.360
they nailed that motherfucker.
The way they choke that dude in the restaurant,

272
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:10.460
the murders looked real.
Everything.

273
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.490
There was no sensationalizing do's is exactly as much gore as you would see if

274
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:18.680
you were in the periphery.
You felt like you were in the experience.

275
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.420
They weren't bullshitting you at all.
So by the time you,

276
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.060
when you get out of that movie,
like,
Whoa,

277
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.910
same things like apocalypse now forever.
Those movies hold up,
or the deer hunter,

278
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.010
perfect example.
Perfect example.
What a crazy ass movie that was,

279
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.470
and they had to take the deer with one shot.
That was their thing.
Well,

280
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:40.790
they're all getting tortured with the,
with the,
uh,
Alicia over that and all that.

281
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.270
Oh my God,
me,
the Russian roulette scene with Christopher Walken,

282
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:48.850
that is one of the most intense scenes in any movie of a,
of any era.

283
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.430
Even today,
if that movie came out today,
it would a hundred percent hold up.

284
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.390
Like maybe a little bit of the music was probably a little coin in this.

285
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.000
What's out there today that doesn't even have you seen expendables to no,

286
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.430
it's a nine millimeter shooting in the head,
in your head vaporizers.

287
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.490
It's like that kind of like,
Oh,
kill bill.
And you're like,

288
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.240
why are we doing that right now?
Like,
how about we don't do that?
See,

289
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.810
I'm a hypocrite though,
because I like,
like Avengers type shit.

290
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.740
I like superhero type shit,
but I know it's bullshit.
You know?
It's like,

291
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:21.860
I like that too,
but I don't like this miss you.

292
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:25.820
Marshy like halfway shit when you pretended it to real movie.

293
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:27.380
But some nonsense happens.

294
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.370
How come this Duke to beat everybody up so easy like what's going on there?

295
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.181
You know these guys,

296
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:35.090
you're making these guys look like skilled fighters and this guy is just taking,

297
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:40.070
I'm going to see Batman.
No mass.
Yeah,
I was going to see it.
But that whole uh,

298
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.430
Colorado shooting thing kind of scared me.
No,
no,
no.
Fuck.

299
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.350
<v 4>Well definitely if I was there and he's scared,
but uh,</v>

300
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.350
<v 2>don't,</v>

301
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.220
I don't think I could watch it without thinking what those people were thinking.

302
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:54.390
I didn't think of those people at all.

303
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:54.850
<v 4>I'm going to,</v>

304
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.130
I'm ready to get it on blue ray and wear my shoes in bed just in case you gotta

305
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.320
run.
Yeah.
You felt the same way,
right?
Like I just,
I,
you know,

306
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:04.860
I barely go to the movies so

307
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.770
<v 2>I dunno.
I haven't had a hurt the box office to that.
She had had to,
it had to it,</v>

308
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:11.080
that's a terrible thing to think of.

309
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.900
Why would you think that is all they would think of?

310
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.820
But it also highlighted how you could have 300 million people living together.

311
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.110
But it's so rare that something like this pops off.
To me it was like,
it was,

312
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.290
it was disgusting,
horrible,
sad event.

313
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.170
But when I really analyze the facts,
I was like,
man,

314
00:17:29.171 --> 00:17:32.920
we get along way better than people give us credit for.
True.
Everybody's armed,

315
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.800
everybody's hammered drunk or what,
you know what I mean?

316
00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:37.150
It's like there's all that shit going on,

317
00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:40.090
there's all these variables and people are vying for the same job.

318
00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:42.700
People aren't doing very well and still,
you know,

319
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.920
people aren't getting axed everyday.

320
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.410
It's not like it was back in the 90s in la where there's shootings on the

321
00:17:47.411 --> 00:17:50.360
freeway and Shit,
you know?
Yeah.
Uh,

322
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.740
I think it mean even back in the night,

323
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.550
I think it's like we have more access to the,
to the news now.

324
00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:00.120
Like from everywhere.
Anything that's bad from anywhere we get real quick.

325
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:04.590
So we get a real distorted perception of what interacting with human beings is

326
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:08.010
like.
Cause the,
the model that we're dealing with is 300 million people,

327
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:13.011
which is just crazy that you would take individual episodes out of that and try

328
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:16.770
to apply it to like what the world is actually like because there's just too

329
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:18.930
many.
The numbers are just to like,
no,

330
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.960
people don't really know what the fuck 300 million is,
but you couldn't see it.

331
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.660
300 million is if you got everybody in front of you just in this country that

332
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:29.370
lived there would literally be,

333
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:33.780
you could stand on top of like a mountain and you would see nothing but people

334
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:35.070
till the horizon.

335
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.670
Like that's an insane amount of people and they're making some shit choices and

336
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.730
they're coming over to your house and they're fucking putting some drugs on

337
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:47.610
aluminum foil and lighten it up in front of you.
And you're like,

338
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:51.030
what the fuck are yous killing?
Disrespectful.

339
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:56.070
Lighten up fucking crystal meth and funding with Nice tits.
Even less respectful.

340
00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.360
Well,
it's just like,
whoa,
what kind of craziness are you one in here?

341
00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.590
<v 5>What do you think about all that?</v>

342
00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:05.770
Like now we don't have as much outward violence like that.

343
00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:09.460
But you look at right now what's happening and it seems like it started like it

344
00:19:09.461 --> 00:19:11.890
seems like prison is a template for shit and I'm just like,

345
00:19:11.891 --> 00:19:13.660
we're going make sure blacks,
Mexicans,

346
00:19:13.661 --> 00:19:16.990
white people don't get along and we're going to control the population that way.

347
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.610
And you look now like 2030 40 years later,
like down the road.

348
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.030
And even now we'd like you within the Republican Party or like people are hating

349
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.800
like there's more division.
The more divisions that are created,

350
00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:32.200
the more easily controlled people are.

351
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.530
<v 2>You know what,
man?
I think that's just human nature.</v>

352
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.550
I think people are insecure and they're always going to hate on the other team.

353
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.470
It's so,
it's like part of our DNA.

354
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.600
It's part of our DNA to look at Mexicans and go,
oh,
that's not me.
And look at a,

355
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.480
you know,
a white guy looks exactly like,
you're like,
that's my guy.

356
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.700
And look at a black eye.
Like,
Ooh,
I can't trust him.

357
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.480
It's like that's another team.
Like they,
it's hard out there.

358
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:58.890
And the best way to get through this shit is we form groups and we have loyal

359
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.820
mother fuckers that are down with us.
Fuck everybody else.
Right.

360
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.780
And that's what people sort of,
they,
they,
they,
they gravitate towards that.

361
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.940
And when you gravitates towards that,
it's like,
it's,

362
00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:10.080
you're always going to have conflict.

363
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.130
But it's like where there's a lack of enlightenment.
Is that a broken construct?

364
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.390
I think there's a lot of people capitalizing on human nature and that's what

365
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:21.390
they're doing and making a fuck load of money off of prisons and they're making

366
00:20:21.391 --> 00:20:25.770
a fuck load of money off of making sure that these areas are not rehabilitated.

367
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:28.020
So they have a steady supply of people to keep that.

368
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:29.400
I think that's absolutely true.

369
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.170
<v 5>Maria mine,
his brother does like big,
like if you've got $20 million,</v>

370
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:36.840
he'll do your mutual funds and set up your portfolio and all that shit.

371
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.070
And I ask him what were,
where's all the real money going?
Where,

372
00:20:40.071 --> 00:20:41.790
where people really look into put,

373
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.530
put Lou and he says in the correction system in prisons,
Jeez.
And those are the,

374
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.100
those are the futures.
That's fucking kind of,
it's a little crazy,

375
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.380
but it makes sense.
Then also you look,

376
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.400
we're going to go to war with the Mexican immigrants that are coming in and

377
00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:58.660
we're going to need to house them now.

378
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.290
And so we're putting like ever since the 90s when they started doing privatized

379
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:07.150
prisons,
that became a a cash cow for people.
And so every bad,

380
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.860
so we need longer sentences,
pot.

381
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.530
We're never really going to get really legal because most of those fucking

382
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:15.670
people that are in these victimless crimes or are in prison for drugs like that

383
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.510
shit that doesn't it.

384
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.070
<v 0>And when you find out that corrections officers have unions and the unions lobby</v>

385
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.970
to keep thinking it's crazy

386
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.300
<v 5>or that Ikea gets their furniture made by guys that are making 12 cents a day,</v>

387
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.703
you know what I mean?

388
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.540
<v 0>That's slavery.
If that's not slavery,
you tell me what it is.
Oh,</v>

389
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.780
this guy fucked ups and now he has to be a slave.

390
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.630
It's not that you trying to protect society from an rehabilitate and was like,

391
00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:39.800
nope,
now you work for pennies now your work.
I mean it's really nuts.
You know?

392
00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:42.320
Those Foxconn people,
they're riding right now.

393
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:47.180
There's one of the Foxconn factory.
He's just like a 2000 person riot going on.

394
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.720
They blacked it off from the Chinese version of Twitter.

395
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.880
They've like deleted images.
Like they're,

396
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.260
they're suspending accounts and trying to like delete everyone's uh,

397
00:21:57.261 --> 00:22:01.700
accounts of it because they can get into the internet and they can delete shit

398
00:22:01.701 --> 00:22:03.590
in China.
They can like just delete your websites,

399
00:22:03.591 --> 00:22:07.220
which basically they can do here too.
Now the government has already done that.

400
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.040
They're trying taking those kinds of things.
Yeah.

401
00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:13.010
They want to have more and more power to be able to do that.
But in China,

402
00:22:13.011 --> 00:22:14.060
what they're doing right now,
it's,

403
00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:16.700
it's stopping descent because there's a gigantic,

404
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.510
this is the reason why this shit is dangerous in America and we,

405
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.230
for whatever reason,
we accept it and we think it's okay.
It's no big deal.
Hey,

406
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.230
if you're not putting anything bad on the internet,
shouldn't worry about it.

407
00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.580
But that's,
that's what's ridiculous is when people have power over you,

408
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.740
they fucking almost always abused it.

409
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.710
If you go back to the Stanford prison studies and they did it with college

410
00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:40.160
students,
they had college students pretend to be prisoners and prison guards,

411
00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.870
people with power abuse.
It's inside of like a day.
It's on a day like no time.

412
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.390
And these are just college students in a simulation.
Yep.

413
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.140
And that has just w w you can't have it that way.

414
00:22:51.141 --> 00:22:53.570
You can't have people to be able to take down the internet.

415
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.290
The Internet has to stay free because if it doesn't stay free,

416
00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.320
then you're not going to be able to squash you.
You're,
you're,

417
00:23:00.321 --> 00:23:03.650
you're not going to be able to get rid of really corrupt governments.

418
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.080
Like the reason why all these people in Egypt,

419
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.530
all these people in other parts of the world that they,

420
00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.840
they're having these rallies against their corrupt government is because they're

421
00:23:11.841 --> 00:23:13.230
able to communicate with each other.

422
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.350
So we're assuming that our people that are in power are always going to be fair

423
00:23:18.351 --> 00:23:19.580
and always going to be just,

424
00:23:19.581 --> 00:23:23.210
and always going to be loyal to the good of the American people.

425
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.160
But we've already seen through Nixon.

426
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.160
We've already seen through the evidence of shit that was past the past.

427
00:23:28.161 --> 00:23:29.030
That's not the case

428
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.440
<v 5>in Iran.</v>

429
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.430
The only way that they were able to mobilize the resistance there was through

430
00:23:34.431 --> 00:23:35.264
Twitter.

431
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.050
They blacked out everything else and that's the only thing that was free and

432
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:39.860
clear for them.

433
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.000
And then that went on to Spain and the Indignados that started off the

434
00:23:44.001 --> 00:23:49.001
revolution there to Syria right now in the news right now today,

435
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.380
and then he marks now what happened with occupy Wall Street.

436
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:53.450
They've fucking got a couple of hundred people they arrested.

437
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.630
Even though if you listen to mainstream media,
they say,
Nah,
that shit's dead.

438
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.111
It's like,

439
00:23:57.111 --> 00:24:01.010
well how come you arrest 200 fucking citizens that just wanted to go and talk

440
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:02.570
about how come the banks are fucking us?

441
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:05.110
<v 0>The real,
the,
the,</v>

442
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:09.260
the real situation has that this system is broken and they're just trying to

443
00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:13.410
like glute keep like taping it together as it's a fallen apart until like

444
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.680
couldn't tape and it's wrong.
Noma got it.
We got him.
Got It.

445
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:17.000
We got do in order to have it,

446
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:19.190
we're going to have to take some rights away to keep this fucking thing up.

447
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.400
And the glue,
the top of it up there,
it's,
you know,

448
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:27.410
it's a broken ass system and some mathematical genius first and foremost has to

449
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:31.540
come up with some way of distributing,
uh,

450
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:36.650
like to distributing taxes and a way of figuring out what money really is based

451
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:41.000
on and what money really is to say have something,

452
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.090
it has to be based on something.
It has to be some sort of resources,

453
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:48.470
whether it's oil and gas or coal or wood or money has to be based on something.

454
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:52.790
It has to equal x amount of something because right now it's just chaos.

455
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.920
And because of the fact that it's just chaos,

456
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.610
it's like people are manipulating it and do not kinds of wacky shit with it.

457
00:24:58.611 --> 00:25:01.460
And you,
you can,
you can move things up and down and move them all around.

458
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.400
And the idea of stocks and dividends and banking,

459
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.020
there's a whole economy based on gambling that other businesses are going to

460
00:25:09.021 --> 00:25:12.140
fail shitty.
It's insane.
It doesn't even make any sense.

461
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.890
<v 5>Well,
it's like I listen to the grand home,
uh,</v>

462
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.700
who was the governor of Michigan and she was talking about states and incentives

463
00:25:17.701 --> 00:25:20.490
and people have so much surplus money to bring in Dell computers or whoever to

464
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.790
start businesses.
So we can have 5,000 new jobs in Michigan,
whatever the deal is.

465
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:24.391
She says,

466
00:25:24.391 --> 00:25:28.500
but that whole construct is built and based upon that Ohio doesn't do well then

467
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:29.960
it's all built on taking.

468
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.820
And Texas has really great incentives so they get a lot of like,

469
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.860
and so that's a for if for national construct that's fucking horrible.

470
00:25:37.861 --> 00:25:40.110
We've got to have states doing.
And then if you look globally,

471
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.260
it's like I need Mexico and Cuba to do poorly for United States.

472
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.680
Like it's like that whole consciousness has to shift in a way.

473
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.490
<v 0>Yeah.
Well we got to figure out a way,</v>

474
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.180
first of all to the idea that there's,

475
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.780
this is going to sound really crazy,
but we can't have countries.

476
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.550
It doesn't make any sense.

477
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.180
You can't say that just because you were born on this patch of dirt.

478
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.560
You can't make your way over here where there's opportunity because isn't that

479
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:11.561
what being a fucking human and a society developing is all about developing

480
00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:16.280
society is a society that wants everyone to have an opportunity to do better.

481
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.560
Everyone.
It doesn't just mean these.

482
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.710
The people that were lucky enough to be born in California.

483
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:23.420
What about the people that are born in South America?

484
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:27.020
They should be able to come here and it's going to fuck things up for a while,

485
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.700
but will balance out eventually and the benefit would be the entire human race

486
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.880
if it's handled by brilliant people,

487
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:39.260
if it's handled by true humanitarians,
if it's handled wisdom,
true altruism.

488
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.230
If the people at the top of the of government really we're explaining to

489
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:44.040
everyone that we

490
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.420
<v 2>have to think about the future of the human race and in order for the human race</v>

491
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:52.080
to grow at the top,
it has to also grow at the bottom.

492
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:53.880
It can't have a rotten foundation.

493
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:56.310
And that's essentially when you deal with these,

494
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.870
these parts of the city where there's no getting out,
man,
you're fucked.

495
00:26:59.871 --> 00:27:03.810
Like this Rick Ross Story.
It's 28 years old.
Can't fucking read.
You know,

496
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.370
like how did he get through high school?

497
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:10.371
What happened is poor fucking guy that we got that that rotten system has to

498
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:13.980
somehow or another be fixed.
The thing you're talking about too,
there's not,

499
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.780
when you say it'll be fucked up for a while,

500
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:19.920
it's like there's not like an epic downside.
It's like everybody will be fed,

501
00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:21.040
clothed and taken care of,

502
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.870
but where we're going now that's not fucking happening and those divisions are

503
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:26.970
getting greater and greater and it's like at the same time,

504
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.010
if there's no separation between you and me,

505
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:32.370
the dude in India or the fucking pop that he's fucking trying to make with his

506
00:27:32.371 --> 00:27:37.020
hands that can,
we're all the same shit.
Like those divisions hurt me.
Yeah.

507
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:39.040
They definitely hurt us in the air.

508
00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:42.360
Could be reconstruction money just like this reconstruction money in Iraq,

509
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.170
this reconstruction money and Iraq.
They could make money by,
first of all,

510
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:48.840
hiring excellent counselors.

511
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.080
They could fucking set up businesses or these kids can be trained in like trades

512
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:59.310
and shit where you can set them up where they,
they always have a place to sleep.

513
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:03.810
So nobody has ever threatened their life,
has never threatened that.
Never scared.

514
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.690
Like if you,
if you can't go to your neighborhood,
you can't come home.

515
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.010
Like you can come here.
This mother Fucker is guarded 24 hours a day.
We have,

516
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.150
you know,
armed cops here,

517
00:28:12.151 --> 00:28:16.340
we have plenty of food come on in and is no shame in this and we're just going

518
00:28:16.341 --> 00:28:19.410
to have to ask you to contribute a little bit.
You come in here and use a bed,

519
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.680
maybe you to wash a couple of dishes or maybe you've got to put some stuff away

520
00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:25.140
or May,
you know,
real simple.
Now you don't have to work all day.

521
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:26.520
Maybe put in 20 you know what I mean?

522
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.690
Like have it set up so somebody gets a value for what they do and then have

523
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.840
people who can teach them shit cause that's the same shit with the welfare

524
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:37.500
system is that you give it to them.
Nobody values that shit it.
And so,

525
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:40.530
so they don't feel that merited.
They feel lower self esteem that,

526
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:42.030
you know what I mean?
The whole shit cycles.

527
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:46.290
But what you're talking about is if people that were in power had a desire to do

528
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:49.620
that.
Right now you can look in somebody's ass in prison and,

529
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.870
and it's the richest drug community ever.

530
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:53.840
And they talk about we don't want drugs in the early,

531
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.470
you don't cause at how are they or you're thriving off of it looking at people's

532
00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.950
and that mom's scared by putting more public money into fucking the DEA.
Yeah,

533
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.930
you,
it's,
it's,
it's a weird situation.
It's like,
it's totally a logical,

534
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.580
like if you look at the way human beings have set up our society and the way we

535
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:16.380
treat like impoverished neighborhoods and the way we deal with ridiculous laws

536
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.600
and none,
you know,

537
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.820
laws of victimless crimes where people like rot away in jail for the dozens of

538
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.580
pages upon pages of,
of cases,

539
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.660
even recently of people going to jail for long stretches under questionable

540
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:34.710
circumstances.
And this is this stories where people were set up by,

541
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.090
by government agents.

542
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:39.050
That's the other thing you have to think about is like when you're uh,

543
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.430
working for the DEA or you're working for the FBI,

544
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.960
like you've got to arrest people,
you got a bus crime,

545
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.350
you got to actually get things done.
I have one of the ways to get things done.

546
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.450
It's a talk someone into doing some crime,

547
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:57.220
talk a bit of doing some crime and then arrest them.
And that's not illegal.

548
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.280
And that's crazy because you can talk people into sucking your Dick.

549
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.230
You can talk people that are jumping in front of trains,

550
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.210
you could talk a whole bunch of people to,

551
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:07.450
into killing themselves because the fucking comments coming and there's a UFO

552
00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:09.550
behind it.
You can talk people in anything.

553
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
You can't tell me that a smart cop who makes a living being an undercover agent.

554
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.940
So that means a person who thrives under pressure is really good at lying and

555
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:19.990
manipulating people.

556
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.020
Really good at lying and manipulating people enough so that he can hang around

557
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.910
with the enemy and they think he's one of them.

558
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.810
You told me this guy can't talk someone and doing some shit,
they would never do.

559
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.490
Of course he can.

560
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.080
So he's essentially creating crime and then arresting people for doing that

561
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:39.340
crime that's been paid people to keep doing crime.
And when I was a kid,

562
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:40.920
I worked for this guy and uh,

563
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.980
and he maybe he crossed a couple state lines or something.

564
00:30:44.981 --> 00:30:46.780
He ended up doing about nine years behind it.

565
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:51.550
But the way he got set up and pinched was because his cousin worked for the

566
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:55.900
police and they'd give him below and they,
and they would fucking go and say,

567
00:30:55.901 --> 00:30:57.220
just stay in the game.
Just stay in.

568
00:30:57.221 --> 00:31:00.520
And so there's a bunch of dudes that are just pieces of shit that are like,

569
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.940
they're like,
stay in the game,
stay in the game and you know,

570
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.070
so he's selling dope,
they know that he's doing all kinds of crime,

571
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.880
but he's going,
hey Lyle,
I need to get two keys from you.
And then he's like,
yeah,

572
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:12.010
come on over.
And he comes over and next thing there's a,

573
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:15.670
there's a door kicker in and,
and so it's like that shit happened.
Like,

574
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.730
and that's just little shit that I know from my personal life from fucking 20

575
00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:21.880
years ago.
But that's what's really going on around big level.

576
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.240
That's like come on and people would not want to believe that that is the case.

577
00:31:25.241 --> 00:31:28.630
But that's what happened with Whitey Bulger when I was a kid and I lived in

578
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:31.780
Boston.
Whitey Bulger was the scariest guy in Boston.

579
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:33.520
He was the number one gangster in Boston.

580
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.180
You're talking about a guy who won the lottery twice.
Irish crime boss.

581
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.150
He won the lottery twice.
I mean if that's not just ruthless.
Yeah.

582
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.560
That mother fucker won the lottery twice.
I mean,
he was just a straight criminal.

583
00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:49.330
Okay.
Killed a bunch of people and turns out he was working for the FBI the whole

584
00:31:49.331 --> 00:31:53.770
time.
So the FBI would give him information,
he would kill people.
The FBI would,

585
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:58.570
okay,
so that's like a,
the departed.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
Based on him,

586
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.970
based on race.
Based on what you Bolger yeah,

587
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:04.990
they just arrested him like in Santa Monica a little while ago,

588
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.360
a year and had a couple of hundred grand in the,
in the,

589
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:09.430
in a little apartment up there.
Yup.
Yup.

590
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.370
And they were looking for that guy forever,
man.
They were looking for him for la.

591
00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.760
He was living in modest man just trying to standard PBL and Santa Monica.
Yeah.

592
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:18.490
Him and his old lady,
they got pinched up there though.
Fuck.

593
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:22.180
He thought people wouldn't recognize him like you and they actually got them

594
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:25.350
because someone recognized the girl really recognize his girlfriend.

595
00:32:25.351 --> 00:32:27.910
They all these photos of his girlfriend and they put his photos of his

596
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:30.850
girlfriend everywhere and someone in the neighborhood recognize the girlfriend

597
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:33.940
from some TV show.
I don't know why.
I guess he couldn't get out of the country.

598
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:34.930
Huh?
Well,
I don't know.

599
00:32:34.931 --> 00:32:38.230
I guess he was fighting with the chick to like screaming and yelling and that's

600
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:39.860
like,
it would turn on to them.

601
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.880
<v 0>You know,
there was a,
some,
some fucking,
uh,
a violent altercation,</v>

602
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.000
a lot of yelling and so that,
that guy,
people that tune into them.

603
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:50.960
And then the lady recognized her,
I think this,
I might be butchering the story,

604
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.370
but the bottom line is that guy was a fucking undercover agent for the FBI as

605
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:59.360
well as the number one crime figure in Boston.
That's crazy.

606
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:03.140
And not just some crime,
but murder,
setting up likes,
massacres.

607
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.390
How were those FBI guys not in jail?
I know.

608
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.410
How are they not in jail if they're still alive?
So they not in Jay.

609
00:33:08.411 --> 00:33:12.320
How's it not an investigation?
Those dudes who was it the guy right after,
uh,

610
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.760
after uh,
the Oklahoma City bombing and that Guy Tim Mcveigh.
Yeah.

611
00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.860
But the guy that kept,
uh,

612
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.850
who was like a white separatist or something up in the mountains.
Oh,
Ruby Ridge.

613
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.620
Yeah.
I think that's before.

614
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:27.950
That wasn't as right after on the heels when they'd just want to vilify all the

615
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:32.450
malicious oh yeah.
I'm,
I'm thinking,
I'm thinking it was different,
but um,

616
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.410
cause I think Ruby Ridge was like,
yeah,
it was from 92.
Was that,
yeah,
the um,

617
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.510
Ruby,
which was [inaudible] 92 and Oklahoma City was 90.
Man,

618
00:33:41.511 --> 00:33:45.320
I think it was 93 or four,
because I think I was living here.

619
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.320
When was the Oklahoma Obama.
Obama.

620
00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:56.380
Obama.
It looks like this.
Uh,
the,

621
00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:00.980
the real,
uh,
um,
oh,
I'm sorry.

622
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:04.460
Here in Oklahoma City bombing,
it was Ruby Ridge and killed that guy.

623
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.840
Randy Weaver.
Was it,
and they killed him and his kids.
Yeah.
Ruby Ridge was later.

624
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.700
You know,
there's a lot of fucking conspiracy with the Oklahoma City bombing.

625
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:18.220
There's all these news reports.
It says the FBI pulled out,
um,

626
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.970
many bombs,
more than one,
multiple bombs from the building that hadn't exploded.

627
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.200
And a,
if you look at the damage that's done to the building,

628
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.400
apparently demolitions experts say that the building blew out.

629
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.580
It didn't blow in.
So if there,

630
00:34:33.581 --> 00:34:38.010
you're saying that a car was parked that did that [inaudible] they're saying no.

631
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.150
The rear,
the demolitions experts are saying,
no,
this is something that blew out,

632
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:44.870
is it was,
it was detonated from the inside and it blew outward.

633
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.410
And so there's a lot of people that think that there must have been something

634
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:53.150
more than just Timothy Mcveigh's efforts and weren't all the agents cleared out

635
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:56.170
the kids in daycare or something like that and that's it.

636
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.740
The agents were cleared out,

637
00:34:57.741 --> 00:35:01.220
they knew about something in advance they were evacuated and that which is

638
00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:03.290
really just sick when you just think about that.

639
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.210
Like why didn't you evacuate the whole building?

640
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:07.390
Like well what the fuck is going on in collateral damage.

641
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.320
Cause they also had to make sure that it actually happened.

642
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.260
If the guys pulls up in his truck and everyone's out of the building,

643
00:35:12.261 --> 00:35:15.550
you know in his firetrucks everywhere,
he's like,
Oh fuck this job and leaves.

644
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.630
So I don't know,
that's speculation.

645
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:21.380
But it was weird that Timothy move Vagos to his grave without ever making a

646
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:25.420
statement ever.
Yeah.
But like well the thing is that they,

647
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.030
the fertilizer bomb experts,
I guess there are actually are those,

648
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.950
they say that this is not,

649
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:34.040
this is not indicative of the damage that one of those things is capable of

650
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:37.920
doing.
This is not that much pop like this is,
this is some crazy shit.

651
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.860
Like if you look at the building,
half the building's missing.

652
00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.900
It's like the whole front,
it just blew out.

653
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.431
<v 5>You know what I mean?</v>

654
00:35:43.431 --> 00:35:46.060
It's like if you're in a pickup truck or whatever you need for,

655
00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.310
for like if you have gunpowder and he put it in your palm and you light it,

656
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:54.260
poof it poofs but if you wrap that fucker and tin foil boom,
like,

657
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:57.020
or a pipe bomb.
Like if you ever fuck with explosives,

658
00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:59.780
it's like you need it wrapped in a certain way for it to go.

659
00:35:59.781 --> 00:36:03.500
It's not just going to be sitting in a truck and have a huge mag magnanimous

660
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.350
kind of explosion or you had an explosive affects her.

661
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.380
I've gotten to that way a little bit just because of my work lately.
Like I,

662
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:14.240
I've been going like,
how has this bomb wrap?
How close can I get to that?

663
00:36:14.241 --> 00:36:17.060
Like on a vendors that we had a lot of bombs going off down the middle of the

664
00:36:17.061 --> 00:36:21.740
street.
Right.
And so you had to get like within a certain distance of it.

665
00:36:21.741 --> 00:36:24.630
But then I found out about wraps and how they were,
um,

666
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.590
how they really changed the nature of the explosion.

667
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.110
And I blew a couple of things up when I was a kid,

668
00:36:30.111 --> 00:36:31.250
but I didn't really know much about it.

669
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.860
But that's if that's what you're getting at Brian now,
I'd just like to,

670
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.860
you look like an explosive expert.
How you do

671
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.420
<v 0>some,
it's a weird thing man.
It seems like every event that happens,</v>

672
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.490
no matter what it is,
has a gang of conspiracy theories.

673
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.050
<v 5>What do you think about the Batman thing?
Like when they're like,</v>

674
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:50.220
that kid's a broke college student,

675
00:36:50.221 --> 00:36:52.860
how do you get 30 grand worth of fucking a student loans,

676
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.210
student loans that cuts that one,
right?
Yeah.
Um,

677
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.320
so government funded,
you're saying that you're saying it is government?

678
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:01.520
<v 0>Well,</v>

679
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.400
his therapist was not surprised that that kid was apparently exhibiting some

680
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.640
very troublesome issues.

681
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:11.390
I'm not buying the idea that you could program someone to do that without

682
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.250
spending all fuck load of time with them.

683
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.680
And I've heard that this kid was involved in something,
you know,

684
00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:19.130
is in an area that had something,
but I,

685
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.340
he was a fucking a phd student.
Right.

686
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.590
Positing is it going to get a doctorate?
Yeah.
This is,
I,

687
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.190
this is a really brilliant kid who has worked really hard about the same age as

688
00:37:30.191 --> 00:37:32.360
the cause brokens.
Well,
those kids were,

689
00:37:32.361 --> 00:37:37.040
a lot of that was linked to antidepressants,
you know,
so both in Colorado.
Yeah,

690
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.600
it's true.
There's a lot of links here.

691
00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.410
You know what that Christine's in Colorado.
Yeah.
There's a little of that.

692
00:37:42.411 --> 00:37:46.180
A lot of wackiness.
Yeah,
it's true.
There's a lot of calories,

693
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.150
especially Colorado Springs.
Yup.
But there's also like not that much air.

694
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.193
Maybe that's,
sorry.

695
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.210
<v 5>Well,
my wife</v>

696
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.430
<v 0>was pregnant up there,
man.
It was fucking hard to watch her man.</v>

697
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:59.120
Just like she had the flu.
And then when she came back,

698
00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:04.170
we moved back to California.
Boom.
Instantly she was 50% better.
Yup.

699
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.920
Yeah.
You're not really supposed to live with the EHRs,
that thing,
man.

700
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:11.370
<v 5>And having a fucking baby man.
That'd be crazy.
Yeah.
It's pretty fucking crazy.</v>

701
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:15.000
Imagine carrying that around the whole thing that women go through.

702
00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.600
I think you make giving birth well that too.

703
00:38:17.601 --> 00:38:22.320
I said you think you'd like to give birth?
I think it'd be sweet,
easy parts.

704
00:38:22.321 --> 00:38:25.380
Could you imagine having it like a human commodity?
It's insane.

705
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.380
I've

706
00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.750
<v 0>seen it happen twice.
It's the strangest thing ever,
man.</v>

707
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:32.600
It was the strangest thing ever.
But uh,
they,

708
00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:36.160
they have a lot of premature births in Colorado because that era,
it's,

709
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:36.860
I think it's like one,

710
00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.430
the number one places in the country where that's premature births because

711
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:40.450
there's no fucking air up there.

712
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.780
<v 5>I hear the actresses do it in Hollywood a lot so that they don't get stretched</v>

713
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:47.380
out to get them a month or two before they're ready to pop.
Was sought him out.

714
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:50.640
Who the fuck does that?
Explosive.
What?
Did he know?

715
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.020
No,
ray is he,
that is so crazy.
Heat that body viable.

716
00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.210
<v 0>Oh,
well some girls do get like really bad stretch marks.
It's just genetics.</v>

717
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.420
Some girls don't get nothing.
It's weird.
I was like,
some girls,

718
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.430
they have one baby and you're done son.

719
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.260
<v 5>It's,
and they have him young.
Yeah.</v>

720
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.750
That can happen to do it in the way we just got back from Louisiana.

721
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.710
Everybody's got a baby,
but everybody looks like they're 12 years old anyway.

722
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:17.980
It's like you're in 98% humidity all the fucking time.

723
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:21.850
It's like you're living in in water almost like in an aquarium and you're like,

724
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.090
it's just like a couple of degrees off of the air just turning to water.

725
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.030
It's like really good for your skin.
Right?
Fucking crazy.
He goes,
great.

726
00:39:29.031 --> 00:39:31.510
If my joints felt great,
like really everything my show,

727
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.390
I got fucked shoulders and everything.
I felt good.

728
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:37.780
I worked out every day and everyone felt awesome.
Wow.

729
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:41.120
Maybe we should move to Louisiana desk.
Why Louisiana?
You down?
No,

730
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.770
I don't think you want a new Orleans.
You don't even like Marnie ground,

731
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.770
hurricane,

732
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.020
hurricane zombies out loud guys.

733
00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:55.021
Just murdering people and they got a thing they call misdemeanor murder

734
00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:01.940
<v 0>side of,
uh,
outside of,
um,
Louie of um,
Louisiana or in the,
in Louisiana,</v>

735
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:03.680
outside of New Orleans.
It's a,

736
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.580
they have so many people in jail that if they don't officially like try you for

737
00:40:07.581 --> 00:40:08.180
something,

738
00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.780
if they don't officially charge you with something and that within 30 days they

739
00:40:11.781 --> 00:40:12.614
have to release you.

740
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.820
So guys get arrested for murder and they just can't get to them so they can
just,

741
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:20.090
they just let them out because there's so many motherfuckers in jail and so once

742
00:40:20.091 --> 00:40:24.350
they get used to popping people,
um,
I might have butchered that,
that thing,

743
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.510
but I know that there is a term called misdemeanor murder.

744
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.440
I might have butchered whatever the,

745
00:40:28.441 --> 00:40:32.600
the actual reason they let him out so quickly.
Yes,
but it's not,

746
00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:36.680
they don't get charged.
They just,
this is crazy.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

747
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:41.690
This w there was a lot of reports of like really crazy shit going down in the

748
00:40:41.691 --> 00:40:42.780
post.
They,

749
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:47.910
the days post Katrina like bet the cops were just fucking Jack and people

750
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.620
everywhere.
Just taking people out.
You know,

751
00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:54.480
that there was all sorts of breaking in and looting and lot

752
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.290
<v 5>a lot of goods.</v>

753
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.490
Imagine you drive around the like Bourbon street drive around the French quarter

754
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.370
and it's like,
it's kind of hazy.

755
00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:04.700
You expect Jack The ripper to come out from around the corner.

756
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.090
Like that's where that motherfucker lives.

757
00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:08.280
Like anybody could get got there at any time.

758
00:41:08.281 --> 00:41:12.120
It feels like you should have to have a passport to go to New Orleans.

759
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.430
Beautiful.
The other time everybody's so fucking sweet,
their co honey,

760
00:41:17.431 --> 00:41:20.640
how you doing?
It's like you can't walk down,
everybody's going to smile at you,

761
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.680
ask you how you're doing and they're going to give a fuck.

762
00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:25.450
They're going to be genuine.
It's crazy friendly,
too.

763
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.780
<v 0>Great.
Um,
a limo driver,
he was the shit,
this guy who was really cool as fuck man.</v>

764
00:41:30.781 --> 00:41:34.520
And he took us around New Orleans and from New Orleans and he was telling us

765
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:37.700
stories about like the one time it moved out of New Orleans and uh,

766
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.830
came out of store and he's sitting there drinking a beer and uh,

767
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:45.230
the cop cop pulled up and the cops like,
you want to tell us what you're doing?

768
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.450
Oh yeah,
man.
I'm just a friend's going to meet me.

769
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:49.520
I'm just having a beer and he goes,

770
00:41:49.521 --> 00:41:52.610
are you really so fucking stupid that you're drinking his beer in front of me?

771
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.800
Like he got,
he kept drinking it and he's like,
what the fuck is wrong?

772
00:41:55.801 --> 00:41:58.580
Like what's wrong?
He goes,
he goes,
where are you from?
And the guy goes,

773
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.260
New Orleans,
and he goes,
okay,
let me tell you the way they do things down there.

774
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.560
It's not like anywhere in the world.
You can't just,
I,

775
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.450
I'm telling you this because I know that you don't know because you're from New

776
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.130
Orleans and I've talked to people from New Orleans before.

777
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.290
I just got to tell you,
you're not allowed to drink in public.

778
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.190
Like that's alien to them.
Alien.
You could drink everywhere in New Orleans,

779
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.970
but really that's the way it should be,
man.
You should be able to drink anywhere.

780
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.550
You should be able to drink anywhere you want.
You just,

781
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.320
you have to have another house somewhere.

782
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.880
You have to have a house in a fucking dude.

783
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.760
<v 5>Katie was,
however,
an idea about what life is like anywhere else and you just,</v>

784
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.640
it's fucking locked down Bourbon Street.
I'm like,

785
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:37.390
did they just get everybody fucked up at the Walmart and put them in too tight

786
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.790
clothes and then get a party bus and dump them all off here?
Like,
yeah,

787
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:46.200
it's fucking nutty.
It's weird.
Yeah.
Guy gave me a laser pointer and he goes,

788
00:42:46.201 --> 00:42:50.970
man,
I want you to have this.
I go,
what is is the laser pointer?
I go,
uh,
why?

789
00:42:50.971 --> 00:42:53.760
Why go,
why you want me to have a manned sub?
Thank you.
Cool Dude.

790
00:42:53.761 --> 00:42:54.990
I want you to have my laser pointer.

791
00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:59.280
<v 0>Okay,
thanks man.
He just had to give me something.
We wanted to give me something,</v>

792
00:42:59.281 --> 00:43:02.730
man.
I'll fucking move.
You know true.
Here's your laser point of has a awesome,

793
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.170
it's like this is so bizarre.

794
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:08.600
A laser pointer and everywhere you go it's like Strip club bars,

795
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:09.450
strip club bar

796
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:14.230
<v 5>called livestream show,
live sex show advertised in the street.</v>

797
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:18.400
Come on in.
Watch people.
Fuck.
I didn't have the heart to go in and I didn't.

798
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.750
I wanted to,
I want it to like 4% of me and I'm like,
I just can't

799
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.580
<v 0>tell you what I did.
It was a beautiful place to do.
Standup comedy.</v>

800
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:27.770
That is a beautiful place to do stand up comedy.

801
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:31.040
I might have to type my next special after I released the Atlanta one,

802
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.110
I might have to take my next one,

803
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.370
<v 5>do it early in the day.
They'll get too fucked up.
Nah Man,</v>

804
00:43:35.371 --> 00:43:37.800
I had a regular nighttime show.
It was great.
You know,

805
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:42.390
every weekend they have a huge party.
Like they have a red,
like a red dress run.

806
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.110
Everybody throws on a red dress and fucking runs like a fucking half mile.

807
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.621
But it's like,

808
00:43:46.621 --> 00:43:50.250
it's like a moving cocktail party basically happens in the morning and goes all

809
00:43:50.251 --> 00:43:53.070
the way down tonight.
Or they had a running of the bulls that I did.

810
00:43:53.071 --> 00:43:54.930
It was awesome.
I put some videos on Facebook,

811
00:43:54.931 --> 00:43:57.870
but it was like all of these roller derby girls from surrounding states will

812
00:43:57.871 --> 00:44:00.810
come there.
They'll all put on red.
Yeah,
red.

813
00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:03.450
And they'll put horns on their helmets and shit and they'll have wiffle ball

814
00:44:03.451 --> 00:44:07.170
bats and there'll be the bowls of Pamplona and there'll be beating
motherfuckers.

815
00:44:07.171 --> 00:44:10.590
Everybody's dressed in white.
I had on a Tutu.
It was awesome

816
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:17.100
to sue.
So funny.
That's crazy.
And this theme for a party there,
man,

817
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:17.611
there's,

818
00:44:17.611 --> 00:44:20.370
I was in the strip bar and there's a fucking Mexican chick comes up and we're

819
00:44:20.371 --> 00:44:24.270
talking and she's again from Tucson originally,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Cool,
cool,
cool.

820
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.270
It's just like everybody's twisted a little bit there.
And she goes,
Hey,

821
00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:29.370
I'm going to this,
uh,
you want to come with me this weekend?

822
00:44:29.371 --> 00:44:32.950
I'm going to go to this music festival.
My best friend's band he's playing in.

823
00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.820
I said,
oh,
awesome.
She's like,
what kind of music do you like?
I'm like,
you know,

824
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:39.990
whatever.
And like,
usually with strippers it's like ACDC or little Wayne.

825
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:43.260
It's like,
what?
Like something in that genre is what you're thinking.
I,
you know.

826
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.800
And she's like,
yeah,
it's a Neo Nazi punk show.
And I said,
excuse me?

827
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:53.310
She's like a Neo Nazi punk show and like your best friend's band.
And she's like,

828
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:56.430
yeah,
and you're Mexican.
I'm like,

829
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.310
I'm too confused and there no way I wouldn't get killed.

830
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:03.120
They're out here one conversation and then it be just like a boot party on me.

831
00:45:03.121 --> 00:45:06.600
Like there'd be 15 little skinny dudes with fucking steel toed boots kicking my

832
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:11.070
face.
Then
it's like the,
these are confused folks.
Oh,

833
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:12.150
that's hilarious.

834
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.700
<v 2>Yeah.
There's a lot of that going on as country too.</v>

835
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:19.710
If they said that something like 50% of the country believes in the biblical

836
00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:23.520
tale of creation and that the earth is less than 10,000 years old,

837
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:24.933
50%.

838
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.330
<v 5>I don't know how they estimate that,
but seems low.</v>

839
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:33.090
They can't point to where a state has either.
The shores,
Florida,
they're like,

840
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.163
I don't know.

841
00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.310
<v 2>Well,
if I didn't fly around a lot of mine,
I know.
You know,</v>

842
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.940
I can't explain to you where the fucks out the code is.

843
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.420
He asked me to pinpoint that motherfucker gonna Learn North Dakota.
Yeah.

844
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.720
But I wouldn't find that fucker either.
I don't know where that shit is.
You know?

845
00:45:46.721 --> 00:45:49.000
I barely know where Ohio is and I love Ohio,

846
00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.080
but like places that I don't go to shit,
I don't know where the fuck they are.

847
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.210
You know?
Where's Wyoming?
Where the fucking north.
Yeah,

848
00:45:58.211 --> 00:46:02.040
but try to find it.
I'm the same way.
There's only a few places everywhere.

849
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.740
This places that I've never been like Wyoming's one of 'em Montana's another
one.

850
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.410
No,
never.
I don't know where the fuck they iron man.
I'll go there,

851
00:46:08.411 --> 00:46:10.780
but I don't want to stay there very fucking long.
It seems desolate.

852
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.550
Montana's bu I'm going hunting in Montana over for what?
Me and Brian Cowen.

853
00:46:15.551 --> 00:46:19.480
We're going hunting for deer with this guy.
Steve Rinella.

854
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.200
He's the author of this show,
the meat eater,
and uh,

855
00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:24.670
I've been wanting to go honey forever.

856
00:46:24.671 --> 00:46:26.380
I've been saying I want to do it for years,

857
00:46:26.381 --> 00:46:29.290
to the point where people are getting annoyed at me for saying it.
But it's true.

858
00:46:29.291 --> 00:46:31.000
I,
I've,
I like,
I like,
I eat meat.

859
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:35.740
I should be responsible for killing at least one animal that I eat.
You know,

860
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.790
you'd never killed an animal.
No.
Just fish.
Never killed an animal.
Yeah,

861
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.180
we grew up.
That's all.
Yeah,
that's all we did.
Like just murdering.
Yeah.

862
00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:47.090
<v 5>Poppy isn't shit that my first kill was a doberman.</v>

863
00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.753
You killed it.

864
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.290
Everybody in Michigan,
we

865
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:56.780
<v 2>grew up hunting deer shooting deer,
and there's so many.
I mean,
fuck,</v>

866
00:46:56.781 --> 00:46:59.610
I've got friends that we would stop straight hillbillies,
man,

867
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.420
and they'd stop on the side of the road because there's deer that get hit by

868
00:47:02.421 --> 00:47:05.750
cars all the time.
Daddy killing people,
they'll jump out of the guts,

869
00:47:05.751 --> 00:47:07.400
aren't exploded.
They'll go,
got them,

870
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:11.010
take out their heart tenderloins and then bounce.
Yeah.

871
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:15.030
That's what a lot of people do.
Crazy.
They found a source,
Steve Vanilla Guy,

872
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:16.460
and they want to,
on one of his shows,

873
00:47:16.461 --> 00:47:21.230
they found a good deer that was shot and killed and the only thing that was

874
00:47:21.231 --> 00:47:23.600
taken was the backstraps.
That's it.
Yeah.

875
00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.720
They just took the backstraps and left the rest of the body.
I'm like,
wow,

876
00:47:26.721 --> 00:47:29.890
that's kind of fucking crazy.
That's part of the deer deal,

877
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.700
but that's really ruthless.
That's fucked up.
You know,

878
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.430
just drag it to a bunch of Xapi,
Lazy Bitch,
you know,

879
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:37.980
venison sausage is delicious,
dude.

880
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:41.530
The whole thing is rad that I would take that shit like right when I shoot a

881
00:47:41.531 --> 00:47:44.110
deer,
just because the people that I'd hunt with,

882
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.070
if you left it there like you didn't drag it all the way back to camp.

883
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:49.300
Hang it up,
scan it and all that.

884
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:52.450
Yet they'd go and steal your heart and backstraps they'd steal all the

885
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:54.940
tenderloins.
They'd still have all the best part,
all the best cuts of the meat.

886
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:59.410
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Route bitches.
Yeah.

887
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:00.580
Apparently that's a lot of,

888
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:03.940
it's common that people find the idea that someone shot but couldn't find,

889
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:04.241
you know,

890
00:48:04.241 --> 00:48:07.390
cause a lot of times you find them the blood trails get out so people will like

891
00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:10.990
put their own tag on it and pretend they do it.
I've hit a deer with a 30,

892
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:14.320
ought six right through the heart,
like in obliterate,
like found it later.

893
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:19.500
Obliterates the heart one shot runs 250 yards before it,

894
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.540
you know what I mean?
It's like a gut shot deer or something like that.

895
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:23.380
They go fucking,

896
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.650
and then people go to find them too soon and then they jump them and they'll

897
00:48:26.651 --> 00:48:28.440
just keep running and you'll never did.

898
00:48:28.441 --> 00:48:33.190
You see these photos and Matt Hughes in in Africa and you want an African safari

899
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:38.140
and killed everything in Africa.
Took pictures of it and put it,
uh,

900
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:41.140
on,
uh,
like Facebook or something like that,
or his website.

901
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:45.820
And there's just this crazy like,
like Ted Nugent.
Yay.
Yeah.

902
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:50.650
Yeah.
And there's this,
you know,
people are really mad at him.
It's Kinda,
it's,

903
00:48:50.651 --> 00:48:53.650
it's kind of a funny situation with those,
uh,

904
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:57.550
killing those animals that you don't eat because although there's something

905
00:48:57.551 --> 00:49:00.010
fucked up about killing an animal,
not eating it,
period.

906
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.210
But then they do donate the money or that they do donate the food rather to

907
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:08.170
tribes who need it.
And so they,
it,
the food does kill you.
This tiger.

908
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:11.300
That's true.
That's a good point.
You know what I mean?
Well then he didn't shoot,

909
00:49:11.301 --> 00:49:15.490
shoot any tigers.
He only shot like antelopes and stuff like that.
Zebra.
Yeah.

910
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:20.170
Waste son shutters.
He froze.
That's Kinda kinda crazy.
But here's,

911
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:23.080
but here's the other part of it.
Um,
when you,

912
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.520
when you go on these hunts,
which is essentially like hunting in a fucking zoo.

913
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:30.850
Okay.
It's like a wildlife preserve.
When you go on these hunts,

914
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.270
the money goes to conservation.

915
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.600
So it actually helps these animals stay like maintained because otherwise the

916
00:49:40.331 --> 00:49:44.470
poachers,
and there'd be no way to stop all the,
the people from,
you know,

917
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:47.980
going after animals that they can profit from like rhinos and shit like that.

918
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:51.820
They were essentially zebra.
They've essentially made rhinos almost extinct.

919
00:49:51.821 --> 00:49:54.730
Like some rhinos are extinct and they've got an extinct in our lifetime.

920
00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:59.020
So this controlled hunting actually keeps a lot of those animals alive.

921
00:49:59.021 --> 00:50:02.440
So it's really ironic.
There's two parts of that though for me.
Like I go,

922
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.800
if you really care about the animals than just give them your fucking money.

923
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:08.440
You know what I mean?
Like don't some fucking money then Dick head.

924
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.040
Well that's the other thing is that no,
you actually have to kill some of them,

925
00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:15.460
but that's in Michigan.
That's so true.
You get Lyme disease and shit like that.

926
00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:17.200
Like the animals will,

927
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:19.600
we'll start to disease themselves if they're overpopulated.

928
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.560
And so the DNR goes and they count them and they know what's happening and they

929
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.590
issue so many permits or whatever.
But I don't think that's happening with,

930
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:27.980
I mean maybe it is,
I

931
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.640
<v 1>don't know what the conservancy is in Africa,
but you know in places like that,</v>

932
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:34.070
do you need to kill that many of them?
I think they do.

933
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:36.090
In certain areas you have to look in.

934
00:50:36.091 --> 00:50:39.500
Unless you have an abundance of cats a year,

935
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.840
you're going to have to have something that controls the population and they

936
00:50:41.841 --> 00:50:45.650
don't want to have an abundance of cats.
Right.
It's dangerous as fuck,
you know?

937
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:48.800
So in these wildlife preserves,
I'm pretty sure they have to kill a lot of them.

938
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.880
I think they have to do it unless there are fucking around with as lions and

939
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:57.470
tigers,
Barbara.
Yeah.
Right.
I think we do.
Not Enough.

940
00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:02.330
Not Enough.
We've got a sick gene pool.
Yeah,
it's a little bit broken,

941
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:03.890
but it's,
again,

942
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.400
it's a little bit broken when you think about the fact there's 300 plus million

943
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:10.490
of us just on this spot.
I think if you look at us worldwide,

944
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:14.330
I mean it's pretty astonishing like person to person how good we have it here.

945
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:18.570
I think we are getting,
I mean,
we're moving up,
like when I talked like,
I dunno,

946
00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:21.260
I talk a lot about like,
like lately I'm doing this thing,

947
00:51:21.261 --> 00:51:24.300
this whole life challenge and uh,
what does that,
it's like,
uh,

948
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:25.910
this thing off this website,

949
00:51:25.911 --> 00:51:29.120
whole life challenge.com and we started it down at a place I work out here

950
00:51:29.121 --> 00:51:33.590
called a crossfit la in Santa Monica a couple,
three years ago,

951
00:51:33.591 --> 00:51:34.790
I guess there's the third year.

952
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:39.110
And it started with like 40 people doing it and now there's like 9,000 people

953
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:40.210
doing it.
But it's like a,

954
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.840
it's an accountability program that speaks to nutrition,
mobility,

955
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.950
exercise,
uh,
consciousness.
Um,
what,

956
00:51:47.951 --> 00:51:51.140
what your daily life is like learning something new this week,

957
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:54.140
kind of a holistic look at your life,
you know,
and,

958
00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:58.190
and just kind tightened in the game of like whatever it is for you.
But,
you know,

959
00:51:58.191 --> 00:52:00.920
part of the thing,
like last week was find out like,

960
00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:02.720
you can't eat anything fried in canola oil.

961
00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:06.140
You can only basically a paleo ish diet,
like no dairy,

962
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:10.040
no artificial sweeteners and all that kind of stuff.
And,
um,

963
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.610
and so you'd have a lot of conversations if you go out to dinner,

964
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:17.190
what are your sweet potato fries fried in or whatever.
And you know,

965
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:22.010
if it's canola oil,
no good duck fat with the awesome grapeseed oil,

966
00:52:22.011 --> 00:52:25.520
awesome.
But uh,
you know,
it's still shit like that.

967
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:29.420
But like doing it for the last three years and talking to people and I talked to

968
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:32.900
people about diet and nutrition,
a whole bunch.
People are hip to it now,

969
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:36.080
whereas before,
like three years ago,
people are like,
mother Fucker,

970
00:52:36.081 --> 00:52:38.960
he's a pain in my ass.
And now people are like,
oh yeah,

971
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:43.100
this is gluten free and this is easier.
Theresa made was uh,

972
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.710
any kind of wheat or any kind of sugars or no,
no,
we make in the back and Dah,

973
00:52:46.711 --> 00:52:48.440
Dah,
Dah,
and it's fucking Rad.

974
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:51.920
The conversations and there does seem to be like a coming together of all these

975
00:52:51.921 --> 00:52:55.540
things,
definitely were being more informed about diet and that's the end.

976
00:52:55.541 --> 00:52:58.910
Gluten free.
Yeah.
That is the internet and 100% of the food and free,

977
00:52:58.911 --> 00:53:01.490
nobody was fucking gluten free just 10 years ago.

978
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:05.060
Ever heard that shale way that was really rare to hear.
Yep.

979
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.860
Now I can always heats on.
Now my phone is fucking gluten free.
Everywhere you go.

980
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:14.160
It's weird.
While we're realizing the impact nutrition has on the,

981
00:53:14.161 --> 00:53:18.260
the real realistic,
you know,
uh,
impact it has on your health.

982
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.380
When you see someone who eats healthy and you see someone who doesn't and you

983
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:24.530
see the difference,
it sits pretty palpable.
There's no getting around it.

984
00:53:24.531 --> 00:53:28.470
And when you,
it yourself and you realize how much better you feel and you start,

985
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.870
and you know,
I,
I,
I do a Kale shakes every morning.

986
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.200
This a thing that I'm doing and now I've got a lot of people doing it because

987
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:38.380
they listen to the show.
Right?

988
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.920
I can't tell you how many people are running to sir.
Yeah.

989
00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:42.960
Well blender got a Vitamix.

990
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.070
BLENDTEC is supposed to be the shit that's,

991
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.700
they actually blended an iPhone in it.
Yeah,
we check it.
Yeah.
This is a video.

992
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:54.600
Go,
go Google it because it's ridiculous.
They,
they planned it.
Fuck it.

993
00:53:54.601 --> 00:53:57.150
This blender so bad.
They blended a phone.

994
00:53:57.151 --> 00:54:00.510
I mean it's a blender that can blend other blenders.
It's ridiculous.

995
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.990
And the idea is that it makes these smoothies cause he could cut through,

996
00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.700
it cuts through ice like butter Qsen yeah,
loves it.
But he says there's,

997
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.470
there's different kinds of juicers and one like it's an extract shoot up and

998
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:15.330
then that ruins all the nutrients.

999
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.170
Well it's also hold juicing or something like cold pressing as good.

1000
00:54:19.171 --> 00:54:20.460
But I'm not talking about juicing.

1001
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:25.140
I'm talking about making smoothies out of shit.
You need e all of the whole food.

1002
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:28.490
Not just the judge.
Check this,
this blend tech shit up.

1003
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.390
You got half a screen so there it goes.

1004
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:35.580
<v 6>Look at this door.
Check the shit up.</v>

1005
00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:42.400
<v 1>God Damn it Brian.
Brian know cause you got the sound off.</v>

1006
00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:49.010
It's not working on this isn't my favorite sticker over here.
Oh yeah.

1007
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.690
That gets said a lot.
What is it?
Why is it no volume?
I don't know

1008
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.520
<v 6>which is,
there's no figuring out bitch.
It's weird.</v>

1009
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.470
<v 1>I can't believe you're talking about the the galaxies better than the iPhone.</v>

1010
00:55:03.471 --> 00:55:06.640
Huh?
It's better looking to me for free.

1011
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:11.720
For like going on a blind screen for looking at Twitter.
Yeah,

1012
00:55:11.721 --> 00:55:13.520
it's all touch screen.
It's beautiful.

1013
00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:17.060
I like that to be bigger because I have fucking fingers,
toes.
Exactly.

1014
00:55:17.061 --> 00:55:21.500
Me To watch this.
He's going to blend a fucking phone.
This is crazy shit,
man.

1015
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:23.330
He my sis,
he better drink it.

1016
00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:24.793
<v 6>Watch this shit.</v>

1017
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:30.750
<v 1>Do it,
bitch.
Hit the button.
Stop talking.
Watch this.</v>

1018
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:32.933
<v 6>Look at that.</v>

1019
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.010
<v 1>He blended a fucking phone into powder.</v>

1020
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:43.280
It was a forest,
so that doesn't make me sad,
but dude,
how incredible is that?

1021
00:55:43.281 --> 00:55:46.740
That blender blended a fucking phone in the powder dust.

1022
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:50.190
Look at that shit grows.
That's insane.
Ready to drink and that.

1023
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.900
How smart would you be?
Put a little almond.
Oh God,

1024
00:55:54.901 --> 00:55:59.520
look at these.
I put that's toxic as fuck dude.
He shouldn't be inhaling air.

1025
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.480
Look what that became.
That's insane.
You know what?

1026
00:56:03.481 --> 00:56:05.430
That's what the universe is going to do to your iPhone.
Anyway,

1027
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:07.470
that right there is a perfect description.

1028
00:56:07.471 --> 00:56:12.090
While we can't find shit from advanced civilizations for 15 20,000 years ago,

1029
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:17.010
it's called the Sahara.
It's called the or of the world,
which is glaciers.

1030
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.970
Glaciers are like set up as like if the world was an Etch,

1031
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:24.070
a sketch glaciers of the big shake cause they come

1032
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.330
<v 2>down and they literally smush everything in their place.</v>

1033
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.070
When you're dealing with a glacier,
a lot of people think,

1034
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.430
oh well it's ice and then it's the isis.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1035
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:38.640
It's a mile high mother fucking mountain of ice that's moving.

1036
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.710
And it only moves like a little bit every year,

1037
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:46.540
but it crushes everything in front of.
Think about how big that is.
Mile High.

1038
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.320
Well,

1039
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:52.210
North America was covered in a glacier that was a mile high just 10,000 years

1040
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:53.044
ago.

1041
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.100
Just 10,000 and Doug about their head see fish that they find skeletons of in

1042
00:56:57.101 --> 00:57:00.340
Denver,
which is a mile high already.
And then what is that?

1043
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.660
That was under the sea.
Yeah.
What the fuck,
man?
They found,
um,

1044
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:09.700
uh Oh,
a lake,
Ontario.
Like that.
We were a,
we were in Toronto this past weekend.

1045
00:57:09.701 --> 00:57:11.470
Right.
And you,
you fly over it like I've,

1046
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:14.530
I've only flown over the Great Lakes couple of times where you really get to

1047
00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.050
look at it.
You're like,
why am I at the ocean?
Like how am I?

1048
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.980
How's this the ocean in the middle of the country?
But it's an ocean.

1049
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:22.720
You can call it a lake all you want.

1050
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.650
That fucking thing is huge and that's not even the biggest one.

1051
00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.030
That was way bigger ones.

1052
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:32.530
There's giant ass lakes and what those are is that used to be glaciers and they

1053
00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:36.730
melted.
I mean it's you wrap your head around it.
It's,
it really hurts.

1054
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:40.890
It hurts to think that this spot wasn't even livable one.

1055
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.960
When you think about like all the humanity and like how,
how long?

1056
00:57:43.961 --> 00:57:45.220
Like we're a blip.
Yeah.

1057
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:48.700
We're nothing like this isn't going to let like so clinging to our house on the

1058
00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:53.350
Malibu beach.
This is here forever.
This is a family heirloom.
Like you're,
you're,

1059
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:58.390
you're on the most unstable park where we think it's going or it's going to be

1060
00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:01.450
covered in ice.
The whole thing is going to cover again,

1061
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.950
the whole world is constantly rolling.
Like that shifts.

1062
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:10.840
They're not the kid that polar bear that came off of a cap and Greenland,

1063
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:11.591
I believe,

1064
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:16.591
and fucking floated to Iceland and took out a troop of fucking boy scouts that

1065
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.250
fucking the fucking polar bear.
I'm a fucking ice cap that breaks off.

1066
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:24.400
He's fucked.
He floats.
He's at sea for God knows how long.

1067
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:27.790
And it comes up on some fucking boy scouts and killed like,
I dunno,

1068
00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:32.440
12 of them or something like that.
He wiped out crazy.
When did this happen?

1069
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:34.090
I think last year.
Oh,

1070
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:38.230
I just had a friend that did a show in Iceland and they're like this.
Oh,

1071
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:41.950
that's a beautiful spot.
I'd love to go there.
Yeah.
Iceland's amazing.

1072
00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:45.360
But fuck polar bears,
man.
They're tripping.
They come out,

1073
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.280
they come out with crocodiles are like great whites,
like a predator.

1074
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.770
They come out as a predator.
Do you remember when we,
we,
uh,

1075
00:58:50.771 --> 00:58:54.490
we were in Denver and uh,
one of the times we were in Denver,
there was a guy,

1076
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:56.740
I think you were there.
He came down to the show.

1077
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.330
He's a local comic and he's also,
forgive me,
I forget,
I forgot the guy's name.

1078
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:05.470
He's Fitzgerald.
Kevin Fitzgerald.
I think that's it.
Uh,

1079
00:59:05.471 --> 00:59:07.930
he's also a,
um,
a veterinarian,

1080
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.630
so he was talking to us about like a little baby polar bears.

1081
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:13.690
They come out and he said like,
aliens,
like the movie the alien.

1082
00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:18.460
They come out of this,
just looking at fucking get you full teeth.

1083
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:22.030
Yeah.
Full teeth
to

1084
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:26.330
<v 5>Tufts was a fucking just on,
on the La news there was,</v>

1085
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.660
it was like a mile out.
It wasn't even that far out off of Santa Monica.

1086
00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.060
There was like a 30 foot great white.

1087
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:36.530
I see babies a lot.
Oh,
out in the bay,

1088
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:40.290
like audit point Dume and Shit when we go surfing.
But like they're,

1089
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.580
they're babies.
They're five feet or eight,
eight feet would be a bigger one,

1090
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.040
but a fucking 30 foot.
Great White.
Fuck you.

1091
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:50.030
I know they said that off a Malibu is one of the richest breeding ground where

1092
00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:53.030
they drop them off country.
My friend was out,
dude.

1093
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:55.190
He went out to the end of point doom and uh,

1094
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:59.270
why he says a little five foot or it hit us like didn't quite hit his board,

1095
00:59:59.271 --> 01:00:04.170
but the tail slap fucking blew them.
Like it's crazy dude too.
That's so scary.

1096
01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.530
I think of a little one.
It's five pounds,
five feet long.

1097
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:09.440
But like how big that is and how much force it just a pure muscle.

1098
01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:14.050
You little one little one Qa just as easy as a pit could kill Ya.
Yup.

1099
01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:18.830
Yeah.
That's an amazing,
they're so terrifying,
man.
So scary.

1100
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.220
It's like you're out there in the water.
First Time I ever went surfing,

1101
01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:27.170
Dude's like
big sea lions come up.
They look like a huge fucking rottweiler.

1102
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.700
Just they make noise and shit,
claws and teeth and you're like,
holy fuck.

1103
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.980
And then you know,

1104
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:35.930
you see the little porpoises or dolphins or whatever the fuck they are out
there.

1105
01:00:35.931 --> 01:00:38.630
And I'm like,
this is fucking Rad.
I'm just sitting there looking at,
he's like,

1106
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.780
yeah,
how's it feel to be in the middle of the food chain now?
I'm like,
dude,

1107
01:00:41.781 --> 01:00:45.410
if a bunch of fucking salmon came up and just started fucking attacking me,

1108
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:49.160
I would drown.
Like I'm not in the middle.
I'm away at the fucking bottom.

1109
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.120
If a bunch of crabs came up and just annoyed me enough to where I fell off this

1110
01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:55.520
board,
I would drown in time and they would all eat me.

1111
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:57.910
Like there's no chance I'm in the middle.
You have salmon,

1112
01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.130
we're trying to jack you and knock you off that board.

1113
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.760
You wouldn't be able to stump them.
You'd be done.

1114
01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:05.630
A bunch of tuna came up and fucking walk with.
You'd be fat tuners are big man.

1115
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:09.000
And then you think about sea lion.
Yeah.

1116
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:12.770
Cause those are big scary motherfuckers.
Sharks love them.
The Yum.
Yum,
yum.

1117
01:01:12.771 --> 01:01:15.080
They'd drop tons of great whites in there all the time.

1118
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:21.730
Oh yeah.
I don't get the surfing thing.
I'm sure it's fantastic.
I might sure if I,

1119
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.170
maybe I would surf at that indoor place in Abu Dhabi.

1120
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.440
I think they've got like an indoor pool.

1121
01:01:25.441 --> 01:01:28.760
I'm sure they do or do buy one of those places.
I think,
you know,

1122
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:30.110
I'm going to play a Taliban guy.

1123
01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:32.980
I think you were a little worried about that man.

1124
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.630
I like it better not be like this fucking his innocence of Muslims video,

1125
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:42.740
that movie that's out.
You haven't eaten,
you know what's going on.
You don't know.

1126
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.880
No.
Oh my God.
Oh fuck.
How bad.
Clint Eastwood fucked up.

1127
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.700
<v 0>Forget him.
The Guy,
I'm a guy,</v>

1128
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:53.990
made a movie with a bunch of white people with black face on playing Muslims and

1129
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:58.580
made it about Muhammad and Muhammad being like a pedophile and it's like really

1130
01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:02.450
blasphemous.
So because of that,
there was a tax and American embassies,
uh,

1131
01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:04.220
the American embassy in Libya got attack.

1132
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:09.040
That was what it was from on September 11th.
And um,
this,
uh,

1133
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:13.040
one guy who was the American ambassador,
uh,
for Olivia was,

1134
01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:17.960
was killed in a rocket attack.
And then there's riots all over the world.

1135
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.650
And you know,

1136
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:23.650
it was like youtube was cut off by Iran and all these different places online

1137
01:02:23.881 --> 01:02:25.920
where you could get this,
they were all cut out.

1138
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:30.570
Like you can't get to it because there's so much to scent and so much revolt.

1139
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.200
Because
not only that,
this is,

1140
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:38.820
think about the fact that a hundred and I mean how if you're being conservative,

1141
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.530
would you say 150,000 Iraqi civilians died because of the,
uh,

1142
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:47.520
American attack.
That's being really nice.
It's probably way more than that.

1143
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.090
Some people estimate it's as much as a million.
So let's say it's 100,000.

1144
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.800
Let's be real nice.

1145
01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:57.660
They're freaking out about a bad movie,

1146
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.840
but they're not freaking out about a hundred thousand people being murdered.

1147
01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:06.060
Right?
I mean,
this movie,

1148
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.920
all these drone attacks that still crazy Pakistani soldiers.
Yeah.
Oh,

1149
01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:12.900
it's the same if you find the video,

1150
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:17.400
Brian show like some of the video of it because it does look almost that bad.

1151
01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.920
It's,
it's,
it's,
and then the other thing is that people think they really,
uh,

1152
01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.730
the people inclined to conspiracy think that this was all done by the CIA and

1153
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:30.630
that they're trying to get us ready.
Come up number 11,
just because,
exactly.

1154
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:34.440
They're trying to get us ready for this war in,
um,
in Iran.

1155
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:38.820
And the way they can facilitate the get the process moving along is to have

1156
01:03:38.821 --> 01:03:39.690
these people revolt.

1157
01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:43.320
So they made this movie and apparently the movie was made and then they dub

1158
01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:46.710
different lines into the people's mouths.
Like the woman said,

1159
01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:49.530
that's not my voice.
And the actress who's playing the woman,
she said,

1160
01:03:49.531 --> 01:03:51.900
I never said those things.
They dub those things in afterwards,

1161
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.150
which also sounds like something to CIA would do.

1162
01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:58.740
Just get you to act in one thing and then make it like fucking ridiculously

1163
01:03:58.741 --> 01:04:02.850
inflammatory.
Attach you to it.
Send you out there.
Boom.
You got a movie.

1164
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:07.860
The guy who was the PR person who made the movie is apparently the same guy who

1165
01:04:07.861 --> 01:04:11.830
was a burning the Koran.
He was uh,
he was involved in,
uh,

1166
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.060
doing some,
uh,
some shit with the Quran.
That was this it

1167
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.230
<v 6>is this the movie?
I've never seen it.</v>

1168
01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:25.490
<v 0>Oh my God.
That is the</v>

1169
01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.990
<v 6>look at his face.
This can't be real.</v>

1170
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.140
Look how brown is faces,
but they didn't brown his neck.

1171
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.083
Oh my God.

1172
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.290
This is the worst movie that's ever been made

1173
01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:54.720
a battleax.
Yo,
look at his beard.
Man that that's no beer.

1174
01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:58.300
That's the best beard ever.
That's the best fake beard ever.

1175
01:04:58.301 --> 01:05:02.020
Cause they didn't even try.
We just fake beard.

1176
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:06.430
He's mother fuckers have Halloween beards on set the place on fire.

1177
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.250
Oh look at his beard,
Dude.
Look at that beer.

1178
01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:18.040
Oh my God.
He just Shannon just on,
he had to do it.

1179
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.180
<v 1>Yeah.
He just attack this hot chick with a battleax cause she had a cross on.</v>

1180
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:25.990
She's on my cam.
What country are we in there?

1181
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.320
This is an unbelievable,
that was the hottest Arabic checkout oversight.
No,

1182
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:33.280
she wasn't.
Yeah,
she was a Christian though.
That's why she's super hot.

1183
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:38.230
I can't forgive that.
That was the worst movie ever.
Just that scene.

1184
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.610
I couldn't even if for the rest of the movie was like,
you know,

1185
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.470
team America was more realistic.
Yeah.

1186
01:05:44.471 --> 01:05:46.750
That was one of the worst movies all the time with the rest of the movie was

1187
01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:50.460
apocalypse now.
That movie's still stopped.
You know?
Did you,

1188
01:05:50.461 --> 01:05:52.870
you can't have a scene that bad ever in a movie.

1189
01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.520
If I saw that in the best movie ever.

1190
01:05:57.521 --> 01:06:01.030
If that was like five minutes of American Werewolf in London,
you'd be like,
what?

1191
01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.260
The five little kid put this in there.
Fuck can a piece of shit movie exists.

1192
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.420
There's levels and that the mother Fucker who made that movie is no Stanley

1193
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.410
Kubrick.
That's all I'm saying.

1194
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.070
The fucking guy had brown face only on his face and not on his neck.

1195
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:19.540
This is a movie tickets.
Fletcher excellence Tait Fletcher.
This shit is not real.

1196
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:21.400
This is a goddamn movie.
We're living in a movie.

1197
01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:25.540
We're going to simulation shit like this is just little pieces of evidence

1198
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:28.750
that's like allowing us to wake up and realize this is not real.

1199
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.570
It's not real tape.
It's not real.
But this coffee's real good.

1200
01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.600
Man did this coffee is amazing.
So what?
How do you actually do it?

1201
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:37.770
You said it was like butter.
It's bulletproof your while.

1202
01:06:37.771 --> 01:06:39.040
If you want a full explanation,

1203
01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:44.080
you got to go to bulletproof exec.com that guy's going to be on the podcast and

1204
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:48.290
a couple of weeks to listen.
Dave Asprey.
Yeah,
you're going to have him here.
Yeah.

1205
01:06:48.291 --> 01:06:51.070
Yeah.
He's going to be here on fucking wicked.
I'm such a fan.

1206
01:06:51.071 --> 01:06:55.000
Everything that tag is butter or bulletproof or fucking I love the fucking guy.

1207
01:06:55.001 --> 01:06:58.290
I'm all over his shit.
He uh,
I dunno.

1208
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.380
Like there's him and in conjunction with the dude that wrote the primal diet,

1209
01:07:02.381 --> 01:07:06.340
this guy,
Mark Sisson,
who you had fucked.
He should have him on.
He's bad ass.

1210
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:09.400
I would love to.
We had a Robb wolf on.
Rob's a good dude,
Huh?

1211
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:10.600
He worked out at my gym for a while.

1212
01:07:10.601 --> 01:07:13.540
He said undisputed when he was in Santa Fe is old lady was finishing up a

1213
01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:16.540
program there.
I tried to get me to go from Kale shakes to bacon and eggs.

1214
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:20.760
I tried it for a while.
No,

1215
01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:23.890
it doesn't give you the same amount of energy.

1216
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:26.020
It's a totally different experience.
It tastes good.

1217
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:28.780
You throw in a little bit about bulletproof coffee and you'll have that same

1218
01:07:28.781 --> 01:07:31.420
energy all day long songs.
Ridiculous.
No,

1219
01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.320
you got to try to keep drinking it all day.
It's cap.
What's wrong with that?

1220
01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:38.470
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
They crashed the end of the day.

1221
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.600
You do not,
you know when you crash,

1222
01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.510
when it's time to go to sleep and you know what I want to do at that time.

1223
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:47.650
I want to crash.
You just switched to Jack Daniels butter coffee.

1224
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.620
What evidence is there?
The coffee actually is bad for you.
Is there any,

1225
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:53.990
I mean I know that if you go too hard it fucks your adrenals to deal right?

1226
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.110
Here's the deal,
and you'll talk to Dave a lot about it,

1227
01:07:56.111 --> 01:07:57.470
but he talks about the Mycotoxins,

1228
01:07:57.471 --> 01:08:01.750
oxy toxins that are all in the blends of coffee and molds attached to coffee

1229
01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:02.950
beans all the time.

1230
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:06.040
And so especially if you're getting them from Starbucks or places like that,

1231
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:08.350
like do you ever drink a cup of coffee and then all of a sudden you feel like

1232
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:12.680
kind of down like you because you're poisoning yourself?
Whoa.

1233
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:14.910
You want to be really careful about what I get the coffee from.

1234
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.050
So I only drink single origin coffee that you know,

1235
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:21.560
it's comes from a small farm somewhere.
Do you want to really,
you become a geek.

1236
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:24.290
You did have had coffee before and then I get sleepy.
Yeah.

1237
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:27.610
What does that froze because 80 people who have him add also.

1238
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.320
You get that though?
No,
I got that shit.

1239
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:34.340
It's the mold that is attached to the coffee.
Dave Asprey talks a lot about it.

1240
01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:38.000
Uh,
this has been proven.
I Dunno,
he's like a,

1241
01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:42.230
he's a scientist Geek because I saw that on his website was like mole coffee

1242
01:08:42.231 --> 01:08:46.880
must be mold free.
All I know is Bryn Napkin.
I uh,

1243
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:49.820
that I changed it and this is what all I do and it fucking,

1244
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:54.050
it's a tremendous differences in 1000%.
So it's called single origin.

1245
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.490
If you get a single origin coffee,

1246
01:08:55.491 --> 01:08:57.560
which just means that you get it from the same farm.

1247
01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.090
If you have a blend or a decaf coffee,
your,

1248
01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:03.350
your chances of it being mold infested are through the fucking roof.

1249
01:09:03.610 --> 01:09:08.360
He's going to know if you go to bulletproof exec,
he's got a,

1250
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.110
uh,
an article called why bad coffee makes you weak.

1251
01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:17.340
So he elaborates on what talks and talks about how to get stronger from just

1252
01:09:17.451 --> 01:09:20.900
drinking coffee.
Well,
if you don't like the taste of bad coffee,

1253
01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:22.940
the same reason why you don't like the taste of gasoline,

1254
01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:25.070
your body's telling you it's toxic.
Uh,

1255
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:27.050
data on coffee consumption goes back and forth.

1256
01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:30.380
Some studies show health benefits or other shows,
negative outcomes.

1257
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.750
This might seem confusing,
but the simple reason is this,

1258
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.260
bad coffee is good for you.
Oh,
bad coffee is bad for you.

1259
01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:40.340
And scientists suck a differentiating types of coffee when they run studies on

1260
01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:41.160
coffee.

1261
01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:46.160
So their scientific tests that have no science because there's no static model.

1262
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:50.510
So you stay my Trent of ice coffee that I drink every day from Starbucks.

1263
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:54.770
You probably meet yourself as much as it is when you eat gluten.
This is fun.

1264
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:58.190
I've never heard this before and I can't wait to talk to him about this on the

1265
01:09:58.191 --> 01:10:01.880
podcast.
This is nuts.
Fascinated dude.
He biohacked his whole body.

1266
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:06.170
He talks about that.
He went up 20 Iq points.
He lost 150 pounds or something.

1267
01:10:06.171 --> 01:10:09.500
He was the bio hack,
his body,
an analyst,
a securities analyst,

1268
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.050
and in San Fran for a while and he's like,

1269
01:10:12.051 --> 01:10:13.880
I just wanted all the different facets of my body.

1270
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.790
I thought about how nutrition is affecting me and bringing me towards the

1271
01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:20.030
pharmaceutical pharmaceutical answer.
And so he says,

1272
01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:22.490
I wanted to get optimized in every aspect of my life.

1273
01:10:22.491 --> 01:10:26.000
And he just looked at nutrition and uh,
ed movement.

1274
01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.500
He even sells one of those machines.

1275
01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:30.110
The first time I ever heard of it was Diego Sanchez when he was just off the

1276
01:10:30.111 --> 01:10:32.810
ultimate fighter.
He goes,
and it's one of those vibrating.

1277
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:35.330
I get one of those and he's fucking,
he swears by it.

1278
01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:38.820
He's got one that he's making that he's making available,
like I dunno,

1279
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.621
1500 bucks,

1280
01:10:39.621 --> 01:10:43.160
something that's doable for the public and because they were like 12 grand or
so,

1281
01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:46.180
they're expensive.
But if it's a turbo sonic does,

1282
01:10:46.181 --> 01:10:48.110
he's all into all credible of that.

1283
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.640
I know like high end actors that use them for like,

1284
01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.530
but they do mobilization with them.
That's not the same machine.
A shaky machine.

1285
01:10:54.531 --> 01:10:58.580
This is actually sound.
It's actually sound that goes through your body.
Yeah.

1286
01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:03.590
It's a very interesting thing.
The Russian cosmonauts using it or not?

1287
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:07.850
It's a shaky thing.
Yeah.
But it's,
it's actually sound.
It doesn't make any noise,

1288
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.400
but it's,
it's a speaker underneath the base of it.

1289
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:14.310
The base of it is essentially like a gigantic speaker.
I just used my head tachy

1290
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:18.340
<v 5>it's,
I don't think we to say,
um,</v>

1291
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:21.090
it's a really fascinating thing.
It was a,

1292
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:24.420
the Russian cosmonauts use it to stay in space much longer than anybody else was

1293
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:26.700
able to.
Crazy without muscle atrophy and all that.
Yeah.

1294
01:11:26.701 --> 01:11:30.090
Well that was the big thing.
That's the big issue.
That's how Brian does it too.

1295
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:34.560
It's how he keeps that physique that's right.
To Hitachi.
So the thing,

1296
01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:37.470
so it's a high,
like I drink it,
look at the fast,

1297
01:11:37.471 --> 01:11:40.260
and he talks about intermittent fasting on there too.
And uh,

1298
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.140
like I haven't eaten today.
I did a fucking 40 minute workout earlier.

1299
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:45.900
I've been up since six.
I've fucking like,
and I'm not hungry.

1300
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.670
I don't get hypoglycemic and all that shit.

1301
01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:51.360
But it's not that I've been calorically deficient.
It's that I've fucked,

1302
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.880
I don't know how many calories are in my coffee,
but a ton.

1303
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.680
I'm drinking a bunch of fat through my coffee.
But Mark Sisson,

1304
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:58.890
the primal blueprint guy,
he talks a lot about it.

1305
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:02.430
And the reason I switched over like that was because he talks about sugar

1306
01:12:02.431 --> 01:12:03.840
burners and fat burners,
and he's like,

1307
01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:08.250
if you're getting in preponderance of your calories from carbohydrates,

1308
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:12.750
your body,
the mechanism never switches from burning sugars to burning fat.

1309
01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:14.520
So it's only burning the glucose in your blood,

1310
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:17.250
which is why you need to eat every couple hours or else he gets sluggish and all

1311
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:20.010
that kind of shit.
Right?
And,
uh,
and he says,
you know,

1312
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:21.540
insulin is a storage hormone.

1313
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:25.980
So every carbohydrate that comes in insulin shuttles it to store as fat for when

1314
01:12:25.981 --> 01:12:27.030
we don't have food.

1315
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:30.170
But that never fucking happens because we're never in four or five days

1316
01:12:30.171 --> 01:12:34.080
stretches of starvation in America.
And so we just stay fat that way.

1317
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.300
And we get hyperinsulinemic and we have diabetes later in life and whatever,
or,

1318
01:12:38.301 --> 01:12:40.710
or you just keep adipose tissue where you don't want it.

1319
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.770
So the thing he started saying,
he says,
you know,

1320
01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:46.800
maybe what you want to do is start eating less than a hundred grams a day.

1321
01:12:46.801 --> 01:12:50.160
Going into a state of ketosis kind of the way Atkins was talking about,

1322
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:52.770
but even a lot of fibers,
vegetables and,
and you know,

1323
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:55.920
you can eat a fucking bowl of steamed broccoli and not reach a hundred grams of

1324
01:12:55.921 --> 01:12:59.190
carbs and a eat a high fat diet.
Like you get hungry,

1325
01:12:59.191 --> 01:13:00.690
you want something to eat coconut butter.

1326
01:13:00.691 --> 01:13:04.600
Like I put coconut butter in my coffee a lot too.
Or MCT oil,
like,
um,

1327
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:09.290
what does MCT,
medium chain triglycerides.
It's another thing that,
uh,

1328
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.350
talks about fat conversion into energy.
And so like with this,

1329
01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:15.870
like there's a lot of different mechanisms that are going on that are making me

1330
01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:17.550
stay energetic all throughout the day.

1331
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.890
And also if I don't have calories in my body,

1332
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.180
my body's mechanisms already turned in and attuned to eating the fat out of my

1333
01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:28.380
body for energy as opposed to getting hypoglycemic and falling out and needing

1334
01:13:28.381 --> 01:13:31.050
to eat some sugar right now in order to keep going.
Yeah,

1335
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:34.380
we had rich roll on the podcast who's a Vegan,
uh,

1336
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:38.100
ultra endurance athlete.
Poor Guy,
nice guy.

1337
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.710
So the Vegan aspect of it,

1338
01:13:40.711 --> 01:13:42.990
but he was explaining the whole thing about burning fat,

1339
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.920
getting your body to burn fat.
Huge.
You have to,
I mean,
if you want to be healthy,

1340
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:49.380
if you like,
and it's just a little bit of discipline.

1341
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:53.430
It's not like I'm ever feeling like I'm lacking something or something like
that.

1342
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:56.030
It's like you're,
you're saying it all day long.
Yeah.

1343
01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.890
That's a weird thing about a us with our diets,
man.

1344
01:13:58.891 --> 01:14:01.560
It's like if you look at the average person and go to Disney land or something

1345
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:04.410
like that right there,
look at the average person when you see them anywhere,

1346
01:14:04.411 --> 01:14:08.090
you are around a giant mass of people.
So many people are so unhealed.
You know,

1347
01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.340
you got to go to go to the fucking crossfit games.
So I was at beach,
holy

1348
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.190
<v 1>fuck.
I was at the beach and the beach was,</v>

1349
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.350
was brutal the other day and I was watching these kids,
uh,

1350
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:22.640
eating chips with their fat family.
Everybody's fat.
Their parents are crap.

1351
01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:27.220
California where there's a higher level of like people aren't generally let way

1352
01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:31.400
higher level of cocaine.
I don't know.
Is that the cocaine?
No,

1353
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.160
there's not that many people in coke.
Dude.

1354
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:35.380
Have you ever done any of this stuff that makes the dude's eat their faces?

1355
01:14:35.381 --> 01:14:40.240
Brian Batsauce.
Yeah.
Nah,
it only makes one retard eda face.

1356
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.650
I have a feeling that is it good?

1357
01:14:41.651 --> 01:14:45.270
Other than that you get to talk to him and to doing that.
Anyway,
that goes pick.

1358
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:46.780
I was down to eat someone's face.

1359
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:50.430
I have a feeling that I've been waiting fucking,

1360
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:53.920
I'm waiting to blame it on basketball.
We all know one asshole.

1361
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.780
You know there's like that one motherfucker that's just can't ruin bath salts

1362
01:14:58.781 --> 01:15:01.450
for everybody.
Yeah,
he ruined the whole gig.
It was weird.

1363
01:15:01.451 --> 01:15:04.990
He just had the mind cheese mad.
We're just talking about that crash,

1364
01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:08.860
that turbo sonic site.
It's crazy.
Just us talking about it.

1365
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:11.870
That side is rack this crack him sites.
Let's talk about [inaudible].

1366
01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.530
You can't do that,
Brian.
You can't even say.
You can't say that you can't,

1367
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:21.010
but I'm just informing
while we're working together.

1368
01:15:21.011 --> 01:15:24.670
You cannot put us in danger like that.
Yeah.
That's actually a threat.

1369
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.830
If you talk about let's go crash a website,

1370
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.980
you're threatening to you to conspire to remove someone's product from business

1371
01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:34.630
and the way it's defined in like the Patriot Act,

1372
01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:39.160
I'm pretty sure that cyber terrorism now you gotta be real careful about shit

1373
01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:41.230
like that.
I'm not bullshitting you got to read,

1374
01:15:41.231 --> 01:15:44.710
be really careful what happened with the sonic boom site that your turbo sonic

1375
01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:49.200
is that did the device that I talked about that shake?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
And um,

1376
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.020
when we,
uh,
when you mentioned it enough,

1377
01:15:52.021 --> 01:15:55.240
people want there that it crashed it out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Holy Fuck.

1378
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:58.090
You're powerful Joe Rogan turbo.
It's not even that site.

1379
01:15:58.091 --> 01:16:02.200
It's actually to me is like watching this for the last few years and we haven't

1380
01:16:02.201 --> 01:16:05.260
been around each other a whole lot,
but watching the explosion of a podcast,

1381
01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:05.860
like the,

1382
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.420
like the way technology moves and like podcasts just happened and how powerful

1383
01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:15.190
they are and then the,
the reaching that it does into the world.
It's crazy.

1384
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:18.010
Yeah.
It's not like anything that's ever happened to me before.

1385
01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:21.520
There's a big difference between doing shows now,

1386
01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:25.810
post podcasts and Pre podcasts like pee,
you know,
I always had fans,

1387
01:16:25.811 --> 01:16:29.080
those people that want to come see me,
but it's just a totally different arena.

1388
01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.660
That's what Ari was talking about.
I'd asked him,
I was like,

1389
01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:33.730
how does this make it different for you?
And he's like,
dude,

1390
01:16:33.731 --> 01:16:37.130
it's fucking retarded.
It's,
it makes all the difference.
Yeah.
It's,

1391
01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:41.190
it's weird.
This is,
this is a,

1392
01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:44.350
<v 7>this is Toronto.</v>

1393
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:48.650
This is me just going on stage in Toronto.

1394
01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.680
It doesn't even make sense when I hear this.
It seems like a lie.

1395
01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.290
It sounds like the super bowl.

1396
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.320
It was

1397
01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.630
<v 0>crazy dude.
For Real.</v>

1398
01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:20.900
It's like one of the weirder moments of my life really.
Cause yeah,

1399
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:23.390
cause it doesn't seem real.
Was that like a on the show?

1400
01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:25.490
Like a one of the biggest ones?
It was a pretty big,

1401
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.610
I've sold out Massey Hall before though.
I sold it out last time.

1402
01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:31.340
I was there to Toronto.
Just amazing man.
It's just a great town.

1403
01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:34.200
They have a big comedy can be there too.
So we did a,

1404
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:37.180
a show on the night before this.
Uh,

1405
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.570
not to be named site where they a have a we'd show and a,

1406
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:44.750
it's super secret.
Only people within the community allowed,

1407
01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:48.110
I tweet nothing about it cause I don't know what the laws are.
Lastly,

1408
01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:51.500
I want to do is get arrested the night before the weigh ins.
Right.
Not,

1409
01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:53.080
not a good career move.
So uh,

1410
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:58.210
we literally landed at nine 30 I called the dude up who runs a show and we were

1411
01:17:59.061 --> 01:17:59.450
over that.

1412
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:02.810
We dropped the shit off the hotel and we were gone to me and Tripoli show up at

1413
01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.330
this place.
You,
we walk in,

1414
01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:07.850
we go into the back door and it's just like this party's as people drink and

1415
01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.690
smoke filled room and the iron sheik is on stage.
Oh yes.

1416
01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.840
So we here at mother fuck Joe Brolly hadn't motherfuck number one,

1417
01:18:17.631 --> 01:18:21.590
Greco Roman number one freestyle wrestling.
You hear him on stage,

1418
01:18:21.591 --> 01:18:25.760
like going through his shit.
Wow.
And it's just,
there's so much smoke in the room.

1419
01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:30.320
Like it looked,
it's like the room is on fire burn.
Oh yeah.

1420
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.750
Well I don't want to say so I did too late.

1421
01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.300
Did that cyber terrorism that they had,

1422
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.940
did they have some good cyber terrorism?
Did they have some good weed?
Goddamn.

1423
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.520
Did they have good weed in Toronto?
It's a just as good as California weed.

1424
01:18:43.521 --> 01:18:45.710
I think it's universal now.
I don't think,

1425
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:49.820
I think what happened was when the medical movement came along,
the California,

1426
01:18:49.821 --> 01:18:52.880
botanists got on it because they could be out in the open about it and they

1427
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:55.430
started to putting out the names of the strains and you know,

1428
01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:57.440
and telling you this is 70% sativa,

1429
01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.980
30% indigo and put all the different hybrids out and then everybody else just

1430
01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:04.580
ran with it.
So now I think when you get good weed,
you're getting,
it was,

1431
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:07.430
it's good California weed or it's good.
Colorado,

1432
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.410
Colorado is right there with California,

1433
01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:11.930
but it looks like Toronto's right there too.

1434
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.490
Like they know what the fuck they're doing.

1435
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.590
And then Vancouver has like a medical program.

1436
01:19:15.591 --> 01:19:19.270
They have like something similar that's like where everything came from the
base.

1437
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:24.170
Yeah.
But half the union was a documentary that I was in a few years back,

1438
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.770
uh,
that they've actually shown that the Canadian parliament,
they a,

1439
01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:32.600
they actually are using it to educate different Canadian politicians because

1440
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:37.310
most people don't even know the history of why it's illegal or what a big part

1441
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:41.420
it plays in the economy of British Columbia.
Like they don't even know.
But it's,

1442
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:44.740
it's like an,
it's a web holding the economy together.

1443
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:46.890
It's a big part of the industry.

1444
01:19:46.891 --> 01:19:51.080
It's one of the reasons why Vancouver is such a wealthy place and people don't

1445
01:19:51.081 --> 01:19:53.870
want to accept that,
but it's a fact.
It is a commodity.

1446
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.660
It's just as much of a commodity is living in an oil town.

1447
01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.800
It's just as much of a comma.

1448
01:19:57.870 --> 01:20:01.370
It mean that money gets distributed back into the community and there's a

1449
01:20:01.371 --> 01:20:05.300
massive amount of evidence and it's tolerated in the weirdest way possible where

1450
01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:08.550
it is and it isn't.
At the same time,
it's legal and the illegal,

1451
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:11.590
<v 2>it's the,
it's like they let it go be criminalized.
Does that either,</v>

1452
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:14.040
I don't even know how they say it,
but you can't sell it.

1453
01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:18.810
It's like they bus people,
they find the,
the one of the things in the union,

1454
01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:23.370
they found these undercover ones or underground like places where they were

1455
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:25.820
growing it with,
they had electricity running underground.

1456
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:27.690
Like they found those before in America too.

1457
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.370
And they also had trains where they had like train cars and the train cars were

1458
01:20:32.371 --> 01:20:36.180
all filled with grow house.
They're all grow houses and they just like,
you know,

1459
01:20:36.181 --> 01:20:39.970
hundreds of yards of trains filled with weed.
Yeah.
I mean the,
the,

1460
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.940
the demand is insane.
The,

1461
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.050
and there's money coming in and it's not totally legal.
It's,

1462
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.620
but it's a massive part of the economy and the union,
if you haven't seen it.

1463
01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:52.800
My friend Adam Score,
he did the documentary and I'm in it too.
It's,

1464
01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.280
I go crazy talking about weed laws,
but it's a,

1465
01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:59.310
it's one of the best documentaries as far as like explaining how ridiculous it

1466
01:20:59.311 --> 01:21:02.520
is.
But in Canada they watched this,
they're showing these to politicians.

1467
01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:05.610
These fucking monkeys we have in office are not going to sit down and be

1468
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:10.070
educated by something that actually makes sense.
No,
these ridiculous fucking pee.

1469
01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.610
But we have running this country.

1470
01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.480
They said that the lobbyists now that that even like companies like the

1471
01:21:15.481 --> 01:21:18.480
pharmaceutical companies are big electrical wherever,
that they're,

1472
01:21:18.481 --> 01:21:20.590
that they're pushing lobbyists away there.

1473
01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:24.300
The the hundred senators that are bought by everybody,
they're like,
we can't,

1474
01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.010
we've already,
we're already invested.
Sorry.

1475
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.710
Like the bribes aren't even counted anymore cause they're already,

1476
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:30.430
they're already the sides already Cozen.

1477
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:33.780
It's the idea that you can just bribe someone to give it another name,

1478
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:35.310
call it lobbyists.

1479
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.870
The idea that you can be in fucking office that like that's what you're groomed

1480
01:21:39.871 --> 01:21:43.590
for.
Like you ask a 12 year old,
do you want to be a politician?
Kill that kid.

1481
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:48.540
What the fuck?
Weird kid.
Love that George Washington Shit.
Like,
fuck no,

1482
01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:50.520
I don't want that.
They're like,
we want to make you king.
He was like,
are you,

1483
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:52.830
what will,
we were just doing it.
You'd ask not paying attention.

1484
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.920
We got us got away from that.
You're stupid man.
Yeah.

1485
01:21:55.921 --> 01:21:59.250
George Washington is the leader who hasn't wanted to be a leader,
you know?
Yeah.

1486
01:21:59.251 --> 01:22:01.770
That's what George Washington probably had to do it because if he didn't do it,

1487
01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:05.610
some other client would do it and ruin the whole fucking project.
Clean.
Yeah,

1488
01:22:05.611 --> 01:22:09.510
but that was like unpaid.
You're not like the whole thing is like,

1489
01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:11.160
it's taking you away from being a businessman,

1490
01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:15.840
like a plantation slave owner that he was,
you know,
it's like,
listen,

1491
01:22:15.841 --> 01:22:19.230
I got slaves to fuck.
I really don't have enough time.
Exactly.
When this country,

1492
01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.350
I wouldn't teeth and I own a bunch of people.
What do you think about that?

1493
01:22:22.351 --> 01:22:23.880
Did you ever see the,
the uh,

1494
01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.960
that Obama wasn't the first black president and all the other seven or eight

1495
01:22:27.961 --> 01:22:30.880
black press?
I've only seen that from the black Muslims.
They do.

1496
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:32.760
There's a website there is dedicated to it,

1497
01:22:32.761 --> 01:22:36.480
but I'm like Calvin Coolidge is how come I never thought of that before.
Cool.

1498
01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:41.880
Like my man,
I should've known that.

1499
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:45.830
Yeah.
When was the last time?
I do knew Calvin was a white guy.
Coolidge.

1500
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.270
Calvin Coolidge is black as fuck.
Right.

1501
01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:52.620
Used to be the article but it on my website who way,
way,

1502
01:22:52.621 --> 01:22:56.280
way back.
It was just like way before fear factor.

1503
01:22:56.610 --> 01:23:00.150
I was in New York doing a club and I was walking down the street and these black

1504
01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:02.850
Muslims,
the black Israelites,
excuse me,
not Muslims,

1505
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.400
the black Israelites have a,
they were crazy

1506
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:10.810
<v 0>outfits like superheroes.
Really?
Oh my God,
you've never seen it.
Oh my God,</v>

1507
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:14.920
it's amazing.
It's one of the weirdest religions ever.
They um,
they,

1508
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:16.530
they make fun of regular Jews.

1509
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:21.540
These so called Jews with curly hair and de de de stupid clothes.

1510
01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:25.460
This guy was saying that's why he's dressed up like a superhero.
Like I'm,

1511
01:23:25.461 --> 01:23:27.040
I'm not,
I'm not joking.

1512
01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:32.041
I mean they look like a guy who's in like a move like Charlton Heston movie

1513
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:35.710
about like people who lived in the Roman times and like that's how they're

1514
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:36.441
dressed.
The dress.

1515
01:23:36.441 --> 01:23:40.270
Like they dress these crazy outfits and then Marriott and they like,

1516
01:23:40.271 --> 01:23:44.620
they will read the Bible,
you know,
say us onto he what you,
you know,

1517
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:48.880
and then they would say what he means by that and then come up with some crazy

1518
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:53.960
exiting to keep the mud races and the white man and the like all the different

1519
01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:58.630
non African races like whoa.
How'd you get that out?
That sentence?

1520
01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.080
Awesome.
And you have to see some of the videos of these guys.

1521
01:24:02.081 --> 01:24:04.690
Could you would swear it was a,
it's a giant troll.

1522
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:07.540
See if he can pull some up Brian,
because a lot of people are not aware of them.

1523
01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.140
What do they call it again?
A black Israel lights.
Crazy Black Israelites.

1524
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:15.040
They all hate white people.
The white devil.
And they'll do all this.

1525
01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:19.570
And I sat there and watch these guys go off about white people.

1526
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:23.860
He let me sit her out cause yeah,
he goes,
you're not Jewish,
are you?
And I said,

1527
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:28.330
no,
no,
I'm Italian.
Oh,
say some shit.
I've said I'm Italian and go.
Okay,

1528
01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:32.020
you ain't even white.
Yeah,
a white.
I'm okay.
Okay.
I'm just,

1529
01:24:32.021 --> 01:24:34.020
I just don't want to hear your,
your rap right now,

1530
01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.640
but a dude asked to take a picture with me.
I wished,

1531
01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:38.320
I wonder if the picture's still up on my website,

1532
01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.630
but the picture was me standing there with the,

1533
01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:42.420
<v 6>it's fucking guy.</v>

1534
01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.530
The guys.
Where are they?

1535
01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:59.190
Oh,
this guy's got an actual Bible open down.

1536
01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:04.420
Let me ask you this man.

1537
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.240
This man don't as a parent you are racist when you were,

1538
01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.353
this was

1539
01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:17.380
the battle between crazy people.
This is no good.

1540
01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:18.371
<v 0>Well,</v>

1541
01:25:18.371 --> 01:25:21.860
I try to try to find one where it's just the other crazy people love just them

1542
01:25:21.861 --> 01:25:25.980
guy.
In fact,
guys like saying there's twisting up to scripture.
He's like,
you,
you,

1543
01:25:25.981 --> 01:25:29.240
you,
you are doing the wrong crazy shit.

1544
01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.270
Oh my.
Yeah.

1545
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.420
<v 8>Yeah.
Look at the outfits.
Nicole's in America.
I say sue to do's.
A one shot.</v>

1546
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:42.430
I said that's where you get them.
You get the word tribal?
Yeah.

1547
01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:49.290
Who am I?
What's your nationality?
I,

1548
01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:52.250
I'm just,
I'm just a person.
No.
What are you calling on?

1549
01:25:52.251 --> 01:25:54.500
You quote on the Caucasian?
Yes.
Okay.

1550
01:25:54.501 --> 01:25:57.920
When you are getting beat up by telling you that.

1551
01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.930
What does the Bible tell you that until you genesis chapter,

1552
01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:03.560
you guys against the war.
Do you want,

1553
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:08.450
if you want us to know where we were supporting total,
right,

1554
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.300
so awesome outfit.

1555
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:16.220
All 12 tribes of Israel are stuck in the I not to say that.

1556
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:18.590
Okay.
I mustn't it.
12 tribes,

1557
01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.670
negroes and deeds hastens

1558
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:29.750
Panama,
Puerto Ricans,
Cubans,
North American Indians,

1559
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:32.980
the Seminole Indians,
Argentina,
Chile,
Colombia,

1560
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:34.880
Uruguay in the so called Mexicans

1561
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:37.063
<v 2>again squares.</v>

1562
01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.460
<v 8>When Jesus a Jew,
yes,
he wants to do it.
Okay,</v>

1563
01:26:41.670 --> 01:26:44.400
so why do you have Jesus painted like,

1564
01:26:50.190 --> 01:26:52.380
Oh boy,
oh boy.

1565
01:26:55.170 --> 01:27:00.170
That is the family that it's a shock coming out in April and they're going to

1566
01:27:00.541 --> 01:27:01.590
give you the whole truth.

1567
01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:09.650
<v 2>This guy's not a good representation of it.
Temptations.
They read up,</v>

1568
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:12.470
they read as a Bible and then they twist it up,

1569
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:15.230
but it's all basically the same thing.
This guy wasn't spewed enough hate.

1570
01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.550
They all yell.
He was barely doing hate.
He was just doing silly.

1571
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.110
He was going silly with it.
He had like a cardboard,
like a,
like a outfit.

1572
01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:26.540
Looks like a fucking paper bags from Vons.

1573
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:32.360
John's not gone take a shit on.
Yeah,
it looked like he'd tape tape the trim.

1574
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:36.290
I don't know why.
You have to have a certain outfit in order to read the word.

1575
01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.070
I've always thought that was really interesting where people dress up and I

1576
01:27:40.071 --> 01:27:42.860
don't trust you when you're dressing up special.

1577
01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:46.310
I really don't because that's not you.
You know you,

1578
01:27:46.311 --> 01:27:50.420
you should be able to go and do a mass in front of everybody dressed the same

1579
01:27:50.421 --> 01:27:53.570
way you would dress if you went to dinner somewhere.
Right?
You should just dress.

1580
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.810
He should,
he shouldn't wear like crazy outfits or eat different.

1581
01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:01.820
If you want to wear a dress,
if that's your shit,
a velvet dress and a big hat.

1582
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.490
If you're that kind of Gal and that's what you want to wear,

1583
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:06.320
I think you should be aware or whatever the fuck you want,

1584
01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:09.290
but what I don't think you should do is dress like you're from another time

1585
01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:13.010
period and I give you extra spec.
It it all the people down in the neighborhood.

1586
01:28:13.011 --> 01:28:17.060
I used to live like all the dudes in the black wool suits and all that.
Oh yeah.

1587
01:28:17.061 --> 01:28:20.030
And the funny hats.
Some are fuzzy,
a cowboy hat.

1588
01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:23.240
Some of like a Christmas was always fucking cracks me up to see those guys

1589
01:28:23.241 --> 01:28:25.940
walking and then you'll see a dude with a Bluetooth.

1590
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:30.230
It's like you're in the 1840s but your Bluetooth like that's okay though.

1591
01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.480
You got to wear this uncomfortable shit all day long.

1592
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:34.310
They only wear that one outfit.
They only,

1593
01:28:34.311 --> 01:28:36.800
that's the only kind of clothes they wear.
And I think those poor kids,

1594
01:28:36.801 --> 01:28:40.730
you see these young kids and you're like,
fuck yeah,
they're,
they're stuck.

1595
01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.460
They're stuck in a cult.
But hopefully they can.
And Yahoo,

1596
01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:48.270
they're way out of there,
I guess.

1597
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:50.480
A bad motherfucker.
And he was stuck in there.

1598
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:53.780
I feel like you just got to pick your cult.
Yeah,
well maybe,

1599
01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:56.210
but that's not the one.
No,
this is too restrictive.

1600
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:58.250
The ones that are too restrictive,
it's to like,

1601
01:28:58.251 --> 01:29:02.140
people got out of control and they had a Jujitsu.
That's a call that is for sure.

1602
01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.780
No Paleo brother.
All the crossfit and that Shit's all cults.
But it's all good.

1603
01:29:06.781 --> 01:29:09.890
How do you want to call it?
Radio show that may,
yeah,
exactly.
Culture.

1604
01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:13.950
It's got to pick your goal.
Don't get full dumbed down.
Yeah.

1605
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:16.490
Well it's also,
what we were talking about before is this,

1606
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:18.420
people would naturally gravitate towards groups,

1607
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.000
groups of likeminded people because w this not everybody's fucking different.

1608
01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:27.570
This world,
man.
There's too many different variables that could affect people.

1609
01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:28.890
So many variables.

1610
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:35.020
That's why the idea of of a country is,
you know,
it's kind of a,

1611
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:40.530
it's almost like we're,
until we have evolved to next level of consciousness,

1612
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.170
we're going to keep having countries.
It's pretty historic.
It's good.

1613
01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:48.010
It's gonna be real hard for us to evolve past the point of needing a team pass

1614
01:29:48.011 --> 01:29:49.230
the point of needing a tribe,

1615
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:52.520
it's going to be real hard because some other cuts going to come along and you

1616
01:29:52.521 --> 01:29:56.910
kind of tried to Jack all the resources,
control the area.
You know some,

1617
01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.790
it's true.
It's if you look at like what's going on in the Middle East,

1618
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:04.620
like how does this not blow up eventually?
How does this not over boil?

1619
01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:07.740
You look at that shit.
That's going on,
whatever.
At least they have real food.

1620
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.580
You look at what's going on with Gmos and with Monsanto and fucking the head of

1621
01:30:11.581 --> 01:30:15.000
Monsanto gets appointed as the head of the FDA by Obama.
It's like,

1622
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:18.690
I want it to be on your side,
homeboy,
but holy fuck.
You know what I mean?

1623
01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:22.320
It's like,
we're like,
we're just controlled.
I mean,
controlling our food,

1624
01:30:22.321 --> 01:30:26.890
poisoning our food.
Monsanto made Agent Orange.
Yeah.
There.
Oh,

1625
01:30:26.891 --> 01:30:30.240
fucking weed fertilizer company for Fuck Sake.
Yeah.

1626
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:35.220
That makes our food that owns,
if you eat any corn at all,
it's Monsanto corn.

1627
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:38.640
It's all GMO.
It's all mutated.
The wind,

1628
01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:40.650
the way they shut down fucking farms,

1629
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.620
they'd put a farm next to it and then they'd fucking sue them.
They'd say,

1630
01:30:43.621 --> 01:30:44.790
you're growing our shit.
They're like,

1631
01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:48.420
the wind blew and fucking your shit is here.
Right?
Say we patented that.
Yeah,

1632
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:51.000
and then they send a farmer's bankrupt.
Bankrupt them.
Yeah.

1633
01:30:51.001 --> 01:30:54.960
That's common practice in now.
It's a done deal.
Every 30 seconds,

1634
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:56.610
commit suicide because they're,

1635
01:30:56.611 --> 01:31:00.450
they're involved in a Monsanto contract that they can't,
they can't profit from,

1636
01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:04.540
and it stinks.
Well,
they're there.
They're Sunni Kenny.
Uh,

1637
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:08.930
they're the only country that's doing a corporation and they're in a lawsuit.

1638
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:12.030
They're in a litigation on though because the egg plant,

1639
01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:14.430
they're trying to own the eggplant,
the way they did the,
uh,

1640
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:18.840
the way they did the corn in America and then like enough's enough man.

1641
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.170
Brazil one recently in Coriell.
Yeah.
The Brazilian farmers.

1642
01:31:22.171 --> 01:31:25.140
They one billions of dollars from,
how's Arizona cow?

1643
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:30.300
Those fucking Brazilians know how to do me.
They fuck.
Yeah,
they do.
Yeah.
And they,

1644
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:34.260
um,
apparently not so good at Jujitsu,
but they got so fucking,

1645
01:31:34.261 --> 01:31:35.580
I can cook some shit.

1646
01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:40.580
There's some suicides all over the world when it comes to the Monsanto.

1647
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.060
It's really scary,
right?

1648
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:48.110
Monsanto's connected to 200,000 suicides in India,

1649
01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.990
200,000.
In the past 10 years.

1650
01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:57.060
The past 10 years in 10 years,
man,
I had no idea.
That's insane.

1651
01:31:57.850 --> 01:31:59.740
365 days a year times crazy.

1652
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:04.030
That suicide where organisms are dying to recreate themselves.

1653
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.430
Like humans,
like everything.
Like,
we're like,

1654
01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:11.560
like biology wants it more biology and like,
and you've got to,

1655
01:32:11.561 --> 01:32:12.910
you've got a,
uh,

1656
01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:16.660
you've got self preservation as a gene in you and where people are dying like

1657
01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:19.150
that.
Like fucking what you're talking about suicides there.

1658
01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.980
Are you talking about the American soldier coming back?

1659
01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:25.120
Like it's fucking epidemic,
dude.
It talks about a do today kills himself.

1660
01:32:25.121 --> 01:32:28.180
That was in the army.
That's crazy.

1661
01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:31.540
And it seems like something we should address in there.
I mean,

1662
01:32:31.541 --> 01:32:34.540
you think about that 365 days a year,
10 years.

1663
01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:39.010
That's 3,650 years right through or 3,650 days.

1664
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.720
3,650 days.

1665
01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:45.570
200,000 people commit suicide.
That's amazing.

1666
01:32:45.571 --> 01:32:49.690
That's huge.
That's amazing.
I mean that's almost,
that's a lot.

1667
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:52.240
That's insane.
And that's just given hopelessness.

1668
01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:56.140
How much hopelessness can I give to a guy?
Kills himself.
Is that like 50 a day?

1669
01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:59.320
70 a day or something like that.
And I mean it's crazy.
It's going the wrong guy.

1670
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.900
Yeah,
I'm the,
I'm the wrong guy.
Questioning.

1671
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:06.570
I think it's been broken down though.
It's someone's broken down.
Like how,

1672
01:33:06.571 --> 01:33:08.520
how many minute every three minutes or something.

1673
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:13.450
An Indian commit suicide because in Monsanto,
well India is massive.
First of all,

1674
01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:17.140
there's a billion people,
but to extra folks there and Monsanto,
Monsanto's like,

1675
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:17.650
fuck them.

1676
01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:20.590
We're going to need to fucking thin to herd some way it was the week pitches to

1677
01:33:20.591 --> 01:33:23.080
kill themselves.
So we're just going to jack them.

1678
01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.270
I don't know what the deal they have over there is,

1679
01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:30.070
but I know that there's certain places in this country where these,
uh,
these,

1680
01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:30.330
they,

1681
01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:34.900
they make deals with people where you have to buy their shit and once you buy

1682
01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:37.210
their shit,
like it only works for a year.

1683
01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:42.211
They have like suicide seeds that don't work and then you've got to buy it from,

1684
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:43.930
you're strung out on him.
Yeah,
you're strung out.

1685
01:33:43.931 --> 01:33:45.910
You can't like the old days a farmer,

1686
01:33:45.911 --> 01:33:49.660
he used to take his tomatoes and then take some seeds from those tomatoes and

1687
01:33:49.661 --> 01:33:52.630
plant those seeds and make more tomatoes.
That shit ain't happening anymore.

1688
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:56.290
They've engineered that out of the equation up,
which is really nuts.
Right.

1689
01:33:56.291 --> 01:33:59.320
But they've twisted mun twisted it around.

1690
01:33:59.321 --> 01:34:02.530
They've twisted life around just so they can maximize the amount of money.

1691
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:05.830
It's not like you couldn't make money just selling.
See,
just read them on side.

1692
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:09.520
One of the,
the Monsanto headquarters,
they all vote on what their cafeterias.

1693
01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:14.480
They voted no GMO foods in our cafeteria.
Is that awesome?
They're like,

1694
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:17.740
we're not even that shit.
That's hilarious.
So then what is that shit?

1695
01:34:17.741 --> 01:34:19.870
Those are the people that know the most about that food.

1696
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:23.220
So what the fuck is that?
Well,
it gives tumors to rats.
Like they,

1697
01:34:23.221 --> 01:34:26.500
they're just a released in studies now that show that a kiss fucking rat's brain

1698
01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:29.620
tumors.
It just shows you gotta be more proactive,
know more about your life.

1699
01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:32.910
You believe the government,
you deserve to die.
You like,
it's a,

1700
01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.470
it's like if you take Fletcher law,
if you're looking at,

1701
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:40.471
if you're looking for somebody else to be relying on so you can get your health

1702
01:34:40.630 --> 01:34:43.690
and you're like,
that's fucking,
that's one way of looking at it.

1703
01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:47.020
I think the way I look at it than I would choose is that there's,

1704
01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:50.230
there's gotta be a way that these people can profit,

1705
01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:54.820
that everybody can make a living and do very well by selling a legitimate

1706
01:34:54.821 --> 01:34:57.770
product that doesn't fuck people over.
We just got to figure out a way,

1707
01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:59.170
what is that evil?

1708
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:03.500
We've got to figure out a way to stop people from putting money over humanity

1709
01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:06.770
and that's what they,
that's the firm like that documentary.
The corporation.

1710
01:35:06.771 --> 01:35:10.920
Do you ever watch that with a basically,
well,
yeah,
and that's not,

1711
01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.980
we don't leave companies.
People vote and they say,

1712
01:35:12.981 --> 01:35:15.170
what's going to be better for my taxes?
They don't say,

1713
01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:17.840
what's going to be better for the homeless guy down the street?
Well,

1714
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:21.170
fuck the homeless guy.
You know,
that bitch needs to get a job.
What's his problem?

1715
01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:23.210
There's a,
there's a lot of stuff that goes on with that.

1716
01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:24.860
There's a lot of mental illness.
I mean,

1717
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:26.620
I'm just saying that's how people look at it.

1718
01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:30.260
You'll receive this document I'm not inclined to do anyway.
I am once,
yes,
I have.

1719
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.070
I think once you get to be like a dude and you're pissing yourself and you're on

1720
01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:38.750
the street,
like the bring you back to baseline and build you up again.
God Damn,

1721
01:35:38.751 --> 01:35:41.440
that's an effort.
You know?
I'm not saying we may be doing it,

1722
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:43.490
we're going to do that.
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it,

1723
01:35:43.491 --> 01:35:44.930
but I don't know what made that guy.

1724
01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.170
But some something went wrong and created that dude.

1725
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:51.590
We definitely need to patch this fucking thing up one way or another.

1726
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:55.160
And having a company like Monsanto around and helping shit.
Oh,

1727
01:35:55.161 --> 01:35:58.370
and then what is that like when you talk about like every book,

1728
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.130
every country except for like three countries in the fucking world.

1729
01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.800
The central bank has a Ross child's bank.
Oh.

1730
01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.260
Like you think about things like that about like why,

1731
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:11.150
who go Chavez is a outcast and treated like Castro is is because fucking he
said,

1732
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:14.780
I'm not going to sell my natural resources to the World Bank and a swatch.

1733
01:36:14.781 --> 01:36:18.110
My debt.
Like when you,
when you look at that and you go,

1734
01:36:18.111 --> 01:36:21.930
it's about money and control and you go how much money you can draw.
Like how,

1735
01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:25.900
how many more billions do you need?
Like what?
What is that about?
Or,

1736
01:36:25.901 --> 01:36:27.690
or like you look at the thing where the word,

1737
01:36:27.691 --> 01:36:31.850
they break the oil pipeline and Halliburton comes to the rescue again.
Fuck you.

1738
01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.520
You know how to clean that up.
Nobody knows how to clean that up,

1739
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:37.540
but you got a contract to clean it up.
It's just more fleecing the taxpayer.

1740
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:41.840
So we're paying for our own imprisonment,
like,
and,
and that's the real rub.

1741
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.350
That's the whole game here is how can I keep the American public or all the

1742
01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:49.430
public scared so that I can make you pay for your own imprisonment.
How can I,

1743
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:54.140
how can we spin the euro so that the World Bank in fucking in Germany can by

1744
01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:54.974
Greece,

1745
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:59.050
it's not just taking corporations were Jack had countries like that's crazy.

1746
01:36:59.070 --> 01:37:03.620
It's,
and it's all from,
it's all based on someone's going to try to make money.

1747
01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:06.560
Right.
That's the only thing that everything is based on.
It's not even money,

1748
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.110
it's Po.
It's like it's sicker than that.
It's like a junkie.

1749
01:37:09.111 --> 01:37:13.340
It's like when you tell me as a dope fiend and you go,
if you're absent,

1750
01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.450
if you have one that's too many and a thousand's never enough.

1751
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:18.531
It's like there's,

1752
01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:23.531
it's an insatiable lust for power that they crave that because you've already

1753
01:37:24.291 --> 01:37:27.620
got opulence for forever.
So what is it?

1754
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:30.860
It's just like we were talking about with the prison guard experiment.

1755
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:32.060
It's just human nature.

1756
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:35.570
When humans get to a certain point where they have ultimate control over people,

1757
01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:37.310
they look at the regular people with disdain.

1758
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:41.540
They separate themselves from everybody else.
They,
it becomes a team of them.

1759
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.351
You know,
these,

1760
01:37:42.351 --> 01:37:45.940
these blueblood Weirdos who were fucking eyes wide shut masks and,

1761
01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:49.760
and go around fucking each other in the ass on videotape so that they have

1762
01:37:49.761 --> 01:37:52.900
something on each other or whatever the fuck they do.
Those,
uh,
it's,

1763
01:37:52.901 --> 01:37:56.070
it's just like anything else,
man.
They just have too much power.
It's too,

1764
01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:00.330
they manipulated the system.
There's a rig system and they're,

1765
01:38:00.331 --> 01:38:03.900
they pass money down from generation to generation and there was an enlightened

1766
01:38:03.901 --> 01:38:06.390
person teaches unenlightened children.

1767
01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:11.540
They remain that way and it goes on and on and on and it doesn't match up to the

1768
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:15.250
model of information that's out there now.
It's not at this,

1769
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.840
it's not like we're living in the 15 hundreds where it's really tough to get

1770
01:38:18.841 --> 01:38:19.381
worried out.

1771
01:38:19.381 --> 01:38:21.900
No one really knows how the fuck anything really works because the whole,

1772
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:25.430
the whole country's in the dark.
You've got to go to the library and books.

1773
01:38:25.431 --> 01:38:29.880
You can't,
you know there's no cars.
It's like that era too,
to get something by.

1774
01:38:29.881 --> 01:38:32.850
In that era it was almost like balanced.
It was normal,

1775
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:36.060
but now it's imbalanced because everybody knows it's a hustle.

1776
01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:38.550
It's not like it's,
there's no confusion anymore.

1777
01:38:38.551 --> 01:38:41.460
Anybody can go online and Google the stories about Monsanto.

1778
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:45.270
Anybody can go online and Google lobbyists and find out how that whole thing

1779
01:38:45.271 --> 01:38:45.960
works.

1780
01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:49.470
Anybody can go online and read what people are saying that I've actually read

1781
01:38:49.471 --> 01:38:54.300
the Nda and what a fucking crazy thing is that Obama passed this.

1782
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.920
Anybody can do that now.

1783
01:38:55.950 --> 01:39:00.930
And this wasn't the case when this sort of style of government was was born.

1784
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:05.400
It's just evolved to a point where it's gotten too big.
What's so funny though,

1785
01:39:05.401 --> 01:39:09.900
too about people,
because nobody cares.
It's like after the Bush administration,

1786
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:10.980
the,
the,

1787
01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:15.690
the robbery was obscene and blatant and nobody cared.

1788
01:39:15.691 --> 01:39:18.510
Nobody cared that he didn't really have a grasp on the English.
No,

1789
01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:21.900
but nobody cared.
Nobody cares about Mitt Romney.
How crazy he sounds.
He's like,

1790
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:23.770
you can't roll down the window and an airplane.

1791
01:39:23.771 --> 01:39:27.120
And so you can't get fresh air in the plane.
Somebody's got to fix that.
Like,

1792
01:39:27.230 --> 01:39:30.450
what is that like?
That's insane.
You're an insane fucking person.

1793
01:39:30.451 --> 01:39:33.720
You're nearly retarded and you're vying for one of the highest offices.

1794
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.130
But that's not the crazy part.

1795
01:39:35.131 --> 01:39:39.270
The crazy part is there's grips of people that are on your side because he's

1796
01:39:39.271 --> 01:39:43.650
white.
It's so,
he's a businessman.
He's white in the fact that he's a businessman.

1797
01:39:43.651 --> 01:39:47.900
The fact that he's been rating companies and fucking humble jobs away,

1798
01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:51.500
the video tape of him recently where he's going,
yeah.
Um,

1799
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.570
the 46% of Americans that are just taking from the country,

1800
01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.890
they're just scabs on the country and we've got to stop that.
Oh,

1801
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:59.940
these are people that we're paying into,
into all these social programs.

1802
01:39:59.941 --> 01:40:02.450
That's who he's talking about is retire reason shit.

1803
01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:05.490
And it's all he's talking about.
He said,
what are you saying?
That 47%,

1804
01:40:06.150 --> 01:40:07.290
apparently I didn't know this,

1805
01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:11.040
but 47% of the people in this country don't pay income taxes.

1806
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:14.820
They don't make enough money to pick up in crisis.
And it was like those people,

1807
01:40:14.821 --> 01:40:15.900
I don't worry about those.

1808
01:40:15.901 --> 01:40:19.110
And they still pay taxes because they pell up pay property taxes,
they pay

1809
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:24.360
taxes,
everything.
But he was trying to say that they don't contribute to,

1810
01:40:24.361 --> 01:40:27.000
they'll never,
they'll never vote for him.
And everybody was like,

1811
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:31.620
what did you say?
Crazy so crazy.
Like you can't concentrate on them.

1812
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:35.700
It's like,
well,
you can't concentrate on half the public on people.
Yeah.

1813
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:36.870
And a half the people,

1814
01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:40.950
you can't try to talk to them and explain to them that you can help them.
Whoa.

1815
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:42.030
Like he's an elitist.

1816
01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:47.010
He's as clear and elitist as it can be and I'm not into,
but Obama's done.

1817
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:50.010
I don't like it.
I guess it makes,
it makes me sad.

1818
01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:54.390
That's a bummer that really had the first black guy that's president who's a a

1819
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.170
liberal who's a brilliant guy,
who's Harvard educated and this is the result,

1820
01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:01.990
the National Defense Authorization Act,
all the,
all the,
the,

1821
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.660
the ridiculousness that's gone on with wikileaks.
Make anybody a terrorist.

1822
01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:09.220
You got zero rights in court.
We can hold you in.

1823
01:41:09.221 --> 01:41:13.360
Definitely all of that shit dude.
And like,
and for him,

1824
01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:16.660
what I was hoping for,
I'm hoping the second term it is,

1825
01:41:16.661 --> 01:41:19.240
he just played ball the first.
That's my,
that's my fantasy.

1826
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:22.180
Which I know isn't true.
Chris Rock's been saying that like,

1827
01:41:22.181 --> 01:41:25.150
you know the second terms and you do some gangster shit.
I'm like,
come on.

1828
01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:28.720
We'll see.
That's her date yet,
if that's really the case,
first of all,

1829
01:41:28.721 --> 01:41:30.040
you can't freedoms,

1830
01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:35.380
freedoms taken away or never returned once you'd give away some freedom.

1831
01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:39.100
It doesn't ever,
never in the history of the world hasn't gone back.

1832
01:41:39.101 --> 01:41:41.620
And I'm sorry,
retards.
It's not World War II.

1833
01:41:41.621 --> 01:41:45.130
Freedom where your great granddaddy and World War One or something you fucking

1834
01:41:45.131 --> 01:41:49.360
asshole.
It's people that came and carved a fucking country out from England.

1835
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:53.740
That's the freedom that was fucking bought from with a wholesale clean slate

1836
01:41:53.741 --> 01:41:55.690
place like that.
We don't get that shit back.

1837
01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:58.780
And ever since then it's slowly sliding away.

1838
01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:01.780
And those guys that built it back then,
they knew,

1839
01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:03.640
they knew that this could fucking fall apart.

1840
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:07.240
So they put a bunch of safeguards in place and essentially lately the

1841
01:42:07.241 --> 01:42:11.380
politicians had been cutting those up and selling those down the river and all

1842
01:42:11.381 --> 01:42:13.780
without the support of the American people.

1843
01:42:13.781 --> 01:42:16.900
We haven't told nobody was even in this war that no one,
no one's for it.

1844
01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.780
Not only he's known for it,
most people don't even know what's happened.
I mean,

1845
01:42:19.781 --> 01:42:23.440
I've talked to friends that are like really politically active supposedly,

1846
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:26.590
and you bring up the national defense authorization act and because it's done on

1847
01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:30.390
CNN,
right?
They uh,
they think like,
well,
what the fuck?
You know what?

1848
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.400
They get to keep it off CNN,
keep it up.

1849
01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:36.370
You've got to listen to Jamie Kilstein or you've got to listen to fucking,

1850
01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:40.810
you got to go to other places for that.
You know,
even BBC,
if you go go online,

1851
01:42:40.811 --> 01:42:45.370
you could find information about that.
But BBC,
Al Jazeera,
all that Shit,
you know,

1852
01:42:45.371 --> 01:42:48.890
that's,
um,
terrorist.
Yeah,
it's motherfuckers,

1853
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.460
it's weird,
man.
We got a weird world we live in.
Dude.
It's very weird.
Strange.

1854
01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.980
We've got this woman coming on next week,
Amber Lyon,
she's from CNN.

1855
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.810
She seems interesting.
Yeah,
very interesting.
She's going to,

1856
01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:06.140
she's going to break open some massive,
she's gonna.
Well,

1857
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:09.970
she exposed massive,
uh,
censorship at CNN.

1858
01:43:09.971 --> 01:43:12.460
She kind of told what it's like over there and,
uh,

1859
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:15.910
we're gonna sit down with her next week and they'll treat her like wikileaks.

1860
01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:20.350
Well,
it goes to that thing about with the family on the train tracks,

1861
01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.930
it's too obvious at this point.
It's too obvious.
It's too,

1862
01:43:22.931 --> 01:43:25.450
it's too obvious that they're censorship when there's issues,

1863
01:43:25.451 --> 01:43:27.670
especially like the National Defense Authorization Act,

1864
01:43:27.671 --> 01:43:31.420
which is really an unconstitutional act.
It's,

1865
01:43:31.421 --> 01:43:33.400
it's horrifying when you read what they can do.

1866
01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.570
A indefinite detention of American civilians who uh,

1867
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:42.070
essentially have no recourse,
no right to trial.
They can just detain you.

1868
01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.270
You don't have rights anymore.

1869
01:43:43.271 --> 01:43:46.990
It's like the whole idea of this country is innocent until proven guilty.

1870
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:50.770
And the reason that is the case is because there's a lot of people that got

1871
01:43:50.771 --> 01:43:53.600
accused something that weren't guilty.
It's that simple.

1872
01:43:53.601 --> 01:43:58.130
Think about trusting the TSA,
the guys at Tsa that you walk up on cause that,

1873
01:43:58.131 --> 01:44:00.110
that that's who is going to enforce this stuff.

1874
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:04.750
Are People like that then a detention under those rules.
Drooling.

1875
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:07.910
They can't control what they eat,
they can't control anything.

1876
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:10.730
Their flatulence is,
is,
is more widespread than mine.

1877
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:14.510
And their idea behind this is that what they're doing is preparing for a fucking

1878
01:44:14.511 --> 01:44:16.970
Arab spring tide.
Right?
And we're going to,

1879
01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:20.630
we're going to be able to have these things so we can legally do the things that

1880
01:44:20.631 --> 01:44:24.560
are horrible and immoral.
But with,
since we wrote them down on paper,

1881
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:26.630
we can do it now.
So we're going to do,
right.

1882
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:29.030
So we're just going to set it up nice and slow.
Well,

1883
01:44:29.031 --> 01:44:32.570
we changed the country and literally turn everything into a police state.
Oh,

1884
01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:35.350
and by the way,
we're going to have drones.
Do you mind if we have drones?
We're,

1885
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:37.940
we're just thinking of Pat labs.
Pass it.
We know what we're doing.
Don't,

1886
01:44:37.941 --> 01:44:38.330
don't worry.

1887
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:41.390
We're going to have 30,000 of them floating in the sky in the next 10 years

1888
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:45.500
talking to people last week about this and there.
And the thing is,

1889
01:44:45.501 --> 01:44:49.580
is like with the people that did vote for whoever,
whoever your candidate is,

1890
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:53.660
whatever.
But the people that are so easily fleeced in the country,

1891
01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:57.930
the you go,
um,
if,
if it's,
you know,

1892
01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.490
we pass a law,
it's a,
it's okay to fuck your kids now.
It's totally okay.

1893
01:45:01.491 --> 01:45:05.540
You can have intersects intercourse with a child.
Then they go,
well,
it's legal.

1894
01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:06.860
At least it's not illegal.
It's like,

1895
01:45:06.861 --> 01:45:09.800
it's such a fucking battle cry for numbskulls.
Yeah.

1896
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:14.090
Well the passed a law in New York City recently saying that rabbis have to get

1897
01:45:14.091 --> 01:45:19.091
consent from the parents before the Moyle sucks on the kid's Dick after

1898
01:45:20.151 --> 01:45:20.984
circumcision.

1899
01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:24.620
Because a couple kids have died over the past few years because of herpes.

1900
01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:29.090
So these asshole rabbis and kill you.
Yes.
When you're a baby,
yes,

1901
01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.133
herpes can kill you.

1902
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:35.180
So these rabbi assholes with cold sores are sucking off baby Dick's and giving

1903
01:45:35.181 --> 01:45:38.720
them,
this is not,
I'm not making any of this as part of the thing.

1904
01:45:38.721 --> 01:45:40.160
So they pass a law.

1905
01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:43.490
So now there's a law that says we have to just get the parents' consent and you

1906
01:45:43.491 --> 01:45:44.031
can still do it.

1907
01:45:44.031 --> 01:45:49.031
You can still suck a baby's deck because it's a religious practice because it's

1908
01:45:49.671 --> 01:45:53.120
a religious act and they do it because it says that in the Torah that you know

1909
01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:56.030
he's supposed to do it with your mouth because it's the closest thing to it.

1910
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:58.430
And because saliva has antiseptic properties,

1911
01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:01.160
because this is how people lived thousands of years ago.

1912
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:04.750
So when they perform the circumstances and the traditional method,
the island,

1913
01:46:04.770 --> 01:46:06.710
yeah,
it was plenty of antiseptics.

1914
01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.970
Although put in pure on a baby's Dick after he cut it seems rather cruel body.

1915
01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:15.350
There's going to be fine.
Toughen them up.
Toughen up that boy,

1916
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:19.340
he's scared of pure oil on the deck.
I don't know all that shit that's out there.

1917
01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.480
Then what do you do with it?

1918
01:46:20.481 --> 01:46:23.900
What's the recourse when you've got like there's nothing you can do to make that

1919
01:46:23.901 --> 01:46:28.310
illegal first of all,
but you can't,
you can't fight maybe sticks.
You can't,

1920
01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:30.410
you can't fight that.
Well,
I just,

1921
01:46:30.411 --> 01:46:34.760
it's so disappointing that a guy like Obama was the one who came up with this.

1922
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:37.250
So then what's the recourse or not just came up with this rather,

1923
01:46:37.251 --> 01:46:41.480
but approve this in in office.
He had a stand.
He had to do a JFK there.

1924
01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:44.060
He had a stand up for that.
If you're going to be a real president,

1925
01:46:44.210 --> 01:46:47.210
you have to stand up for that and you have to expose it to the public and say,

1926
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:50.790
look,
this is an issue that I can sign and this is why.

1927
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
And make a stand and say,
listen,
you guys can make a lot of money,

1928
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:57.450
but you can't do this.
You can make plenty of money still.

1929
01:46:57.451 --> 01:46:58.570
You'll have plenty of control.

1930
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.650
Why aren't you talking about that at a state of the Union address?

1931
01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.130
You know what I mean?
It's like why isn't it?
Why?
Why isn't everybody?

1932
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:09.210
Why isn't it?
Why isn't it a huge issue?
Then the whole,
there's no power.
Yeah,

1933
01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:12.500
there is.
He just turned off my power though.
Really?

1934
01:47:13.650 --> 01:47:18.440
What went off my laptop.
My laptop is not getting any power.
Oh,

1935
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:20.790
now it does.
So it wasn't working,
dude.

1936
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:24.840
I was getting no power for some reason when I turned it off,

1937
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:29.550
that's the switch is probably
not in the connection,

1938
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:32.730
but I just turned that off and back on and now it works.

1939
01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:36.390
I didn't touch it before that and it wasn't on magic.

1940
01:47:36.710 --> 01:47:38.820
It's probably that mag shit's going to blow up.
Well,

1941
01:47:38.821 --> 01:47:41.850
this is a building that's super crazy old.

1942
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.750
This place has been here since like 1961 really?
Yeah.

1943
01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:48.840
So the electrical system in Harris really wonky.
Was the,

1944
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:53.740
was the cannabis shop,
was that here before you guys came in after you got no,

1945
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:57.050
they were,
they were here before us.
We've only been,
I started up there,

1946
01:47:57.070 --> 01:48:01.860
I did my first show here in 94 but we've only been like hanging out here on a

1947
01:48:01.861 --> 01:48:06.000
regular for like what,
two years?
Probably two years doing shows here.

1948
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:10.580
So the,
you know,
this,
the weed store was already here kid,
this whole area.

1949
01:48:10.581 --> 01:48:13.830
It's like very weedy.
There's a lot of weed going on in this area.
Yeah,

1950
01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.360
I think it's real weird.

1951
01:48:15.361 --> 01:48:18.420
Like where you can get away with certain things where you can like teach people

1952
01:48:18.421 --> 01:48:21.720
how to grow and Shit and they have hydroponic shops and they don't come down on

1953
01:48:21.721 --> 01:48:25.710
you.
But this is areas like,
but then you go,
you were in San Diego,

1954
01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:29.280
you can't rock that shit in San Diego and,
and Palm Beach.
They just,

1955
01:48:29.281 --> 01:48:32.030
they're closing down in Palm Beach.
They're trying to stop.

1956
01:48:32.031 --> 01:48:34.890
But then for this stop they put a moratorium on him that you can't open any
more.

1957
01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:38.550
There were so many,
it was so crazy.
That was awesome.
In New Mexico,

1958
01:48:38.551 --> 01:48:43.170
they opened them up and uh,
they said that they legalized it for Matt,

1959
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:45.420
but there's like 10 prescriptions they gave out.

1960
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:48.960
They will give anybody a card and then there's not really any,

1961
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.280
they didn't think it out really.

1962
01:48:50.281 --> 01:48:53.220
It doesn't seem like anywhere where they go dispensary's have to meet these

1963
01:48:53.221 --> 01:48:56.010
criteria and then,
or any of that kind of stuff.
And so they're like,

1964
01:48:56.011 --> 01:48:59.370
nobody can be a dispensary or maybe anybody can or they're not sure.

1965
01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:01.440
I think it's at 13 states now.

1966
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:05.010
I think 13 states out of 50 have some sort of medical marijuana program.

1967
01:49:05.011 --> 01:49:06.840
The interesting one was Rhode Island,

1968
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:10.350
we're Rhode Island's said they would use their state police to fight off federal

1969
01:49:10.351 --> 01:49:13.380
agents if they came down to close the lowly shit.
Yeah.

1970
01:49:13.381 --> 01:49:16.650
Rhode Island saying you're not going to arrest you Rhode Island citizens for

1971
01:49:16.651 --> 01:49:19.860
this.
And I was like,
wow.
Rhode Island went gangster with the Fed.
Good.

1972
01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:22.890
Because they were coming in and just arresting people for who are not violating

1973
01:49:22.891 --> 01:49:26.390
state law,
which is unconstitutional,
which is more shit.
It's a,

1974
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:28.560
there's a reason why it's set up this way.

1975
01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:31.230
So for the federal government to come in and say that,
you know,

1976
01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:33.600
we're a superseding your state government,
that's,

1977
01:49:33.601 --> 01:49:36.420
this is a reason why there's a state in the first place.

1978
01:49:36.421 --> 01:49:39.900
It's so the federal government can't do that.
And the only time starve,

1979
01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:43.800
the only time it was supposed to be where the federal government has power was

1980
01:49:43.801 --> 01:49:48.040
when we were in a state of war.
So we're in a constant state war all the time.

1981
01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:49.540
It's just been a constant state of war.

1982
01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:54.541
So we always can have the cities like there's real problems and like Sacramento,

1983
01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.470
uh,
where,
where is it?
Uh,
to macro myth.

1984
01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.860
The hat right then with the [inaudible] are bankrupt that now their pensions of

1985
01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:05.650
all the firefighters there,
all the cops that have retired,
sorry,

1986
01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:09.950
we can't fucking pay.
You were bankrupt.
Like who is that fucking accountant?
Like,

1987
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:14.620
like you're just stealing so much that the state is not that the,

1988
01:50:14.630 --> 01:50:17.050
that the state can't take care of this city that's bankrupt.

1989
01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:19.810
That's a major metropolitan.
Like that's crazy.

1990
01:50:19.811 --> 01:50:21.430
There's like three in California right now,

1991
01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:24.220
but we're going to go ahead and send federal money after some guys smoking weed.

1992
01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:27.760
What was really important is that we police Afghanistan,

1993
01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.240
we're going to make sure that everything's okay over there.
We went,

1994
01:50:32.250 --> 01:50:35.140
they got their training people and then the people were just turned their guns

1995
01:50:35.141 --> 01:50:38.890
on the American troops just gunning him down.
Thanks.
So getting freebies.

1996
01:50:38.891 --> 01:50:41.950
They get a good to give them a gun and they just gone down American troops.

1997
01:50:41.951 --> 01:50:43.840
I mean it's,
it's happening on a regular basis now.

1998
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:48.850
Suicide bombings and all kinds of craziness over there.
Dude,
we had this guy,

1999
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:53.851
Shane Smith from vice vice.com on who told us about interviewing these guys who

2000
01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:56.920
had kids strapped with dynamite.

2001
01:50:57.130 --> 01:51:02.130
They're talking about how they use kids as devices to to to to detonate bombs

2002
01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:06.550
like a vehicle.
Yeah.
It use it as a vehicle for delivering a bomb that's a child.

2003
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:11.290
I mean it's scary shit and we're like,
well we need to be over that.
We need to,

2004
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.680
we need to keep that place in line.
Like what,
what,

2005
01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:17.640
what kind of a shit job are we doing of keeping that place in line if they've

2006
01:51:17.641 --> 01:51:19.930
got children,
suicide bombers on the regular site,

2007
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.850
is there anybody that doesn't love their kids?

2008
01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:25.600
Like everybody that has kids loves kids unless they're really fucked up.

2009
01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:28.330
It's not like you can't sell me on the whole thing.
Afghanis,

2010
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:30.400
they just don't like their kids.
That's the way Afghanis are like,

2011
01:51:30.401 --> 01:51:31.300
that's fucking silly.

2012
01:51:31.301 --> 01:51:34.240
It's like in North Africa where my friends would go on merchant marine boats and

2013
01:51:34.241 --> 01:51:37.180
they'd go,
dude,
there's people just,
they're fucking limbs cut off.

2014
01:51:37.210 --> 01:51:38.920
And I thought it was an epidemic,
but they said,
no,

2015
01:51:38.921 --> 01:51:42.880
it makes them better beggars like in India and so they'll disfigure main

2016
01:51:42.881 --> 01:51:46.050
children because the best place you're going to get in life is as a beggar.

2017
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:49.690
Like that's how some places in the world are.
And so the the the best,

2018
01:51:49.691 --> 01:51:53.530
they're so frustrated and so fucked in Afghanistan or if you want to talk about

2019
01:51:53.531 --> 01:51:56.110
anywhere in the Middle East where they're like little strap bombs on people and

2020
01:51:56.111 --> 01:51:58.180
go,
it's like,
that's not crazy people.

2021
01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:02.590
Those are people that are so fucking frustrated with their empty position that

2022
01:52:02.591 --> 01:52:05.200
they're either going to kill themselves like the 2000 people that are doing over

2023
01:52:05.201 --> 01:52:06.160
Monsanto in India,

2024
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:10.030
or they're going to fucking try to make a statement while they do it.
Yeah,

2025
01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:12.580
that's fucking crazy.
Let's look at that shit.

2026
01:52:12.581 --> 01:52:15.340
Roll the dice being born there.

2027
01:52:15.370 --> 01:52:19.290
Imagine being born in Kabul and what are you going to do for those people?
Yeah.

2028
01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:23.170
A couple of guys at the m 16 are going to get take care of that problem.
Really?

2029
01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:26.950
Yay.
Seems above their pay grade.
He ain't getting out,
bitch.

2030
01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:29.020
You ain't going nowhere,
right?

2031
01:52:29.650 --> 01:52:34.150
Where the fuck are you going to go if you're born and like Somalia?
What?
How?

2032
01:52:34.151 --> 01:52:38.980
What is the best you can do be a pirate?
You think so?
Yeah.
That's the best shit,

2033
01:52:38.981 --> 01:52:40.600
right?
And there's nothing else.

2034
01:52:40.730 --> 01:52:43.900
You're going to starve or you're going to be like Tommy Lee at the club.
Like,

2035
01:52:43.901 --> 01:52:48.901
I'm going to be a pirate and it's gotta be a way to figure out a way to have an

2036
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:54.521
impact on people to the point where politicians are force to recognize that we

2037
01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.900
need another sort of a,

2038
01:52:59.901 --> 01:53:03.890
another reconsideration of the way we're running things that we need to like,
uh,

2039
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:08.000
like to sit down and like really plan this thing out because the corruption that

2040
01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:11.630
we have,
it's not,
it's,
it's not that it's necessary,
it's just,

2041
01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:14.060
it's corruption is necessary the way it's run right here.

2042
01:53:14.150 --> 01:53:15.020
You got to figure out a way,

2043
01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:18.140
if you could figure out a way to get the internet wirelessly and throw it

2044
01:53:18.141 --> 01:53:18.830
through the air,

2045
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:23.670
how can we can't figure out a way to navigate humanity,
right?

2046
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:26.100
How can we can't figure out a way to make things fair for cause they,

2047
01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.690
both of those,
the unfair is what they like.
I know,
but isn't it funny?

2048
01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.270
There's the just pussies that want,
they,
they,

2049
01:53:32.271 --> 01:53:35.030
it's like they want the cheat codes to the video games.
You know what I mean?

2050
01:53:35.031 --> 01:53:38.000
They don't want to actually play the games.
Who Runs Shit?
It's amazing.

2051
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:39.050
It really is amazing.

2052
01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:41.990
It's mainly looking at like Tesla and you look at what happened with like,

2053
01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:45.080
he's like,
I can take electricity from the air and give it to everybody for free.

2054
01:53:45.081 --> 01:53:48.830
They're like the fuck you can.
Yeah.
And then all his shit gets destroyed.

2055
01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:54.190
Like that's crazy.
Well Tesla apparently was really nuts too though.
Yeah,

2056
01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:54.860
they say that he had,

2057
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:58.700
well he had a relationship with a pigeon who was in love with a pigeon.

2058
01:53:58.990 --> 01:54:00.980
We can't judge.
I'm not judging,

2059
01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:06.070
but I'm just saying I think in order to have the kind of mind that can create so

2060
01:54:06.441 --> 01:54:09.320
many things,
I mean Tesla was involved and it wasn't it either.

2061
01:54:09.321 --> 01:54:12.680
It was telling me about that though about like when like that he thought that

2062
01:54:12.681 --> 01:54:16.330
sex was such a distraction that he had to destroy his sexuality.
Yeah.

2063
01:54:16.690 --> 01:54:19.040
That's a guy like a fucking wicked genius.

2064
01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:23.680
He thought of the radio like they could do that.
Like that guy.
What?

2065
01:54:23.681 --> 01:54:25.340
What does destroying his sexuality mean?

2066
01:54:25.341 --> 01:54:28.340
Like that's crazy and that that wasn't encumbrance.
Like,
I'm sorry,

2067
01:54:28.341 --> 01:54:29.720
I'm thinking about science too much.

2068
01:54:29.721 --> 01:54:33.560
To think about my dick ever that's had some sort of little relationship with a

2069
01:54:33.561 --> 01:54:36.170
woman that really rectum and it was like really,

2070
01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:39.740
he was really twisted and confused by it and it really fucked him up.

2071
01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:43.550
So there was a quote that Tesla had destroyed his sexuality.

2072
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:49.220
That was the,
um,
hmm.
That was the quote that he had destroyed his sexuality,

2073
01:54:49.221 --> 01:54:51.980
which is really fascinating,
man.
I don't know what that means,

2074
01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:55.190
but I guess he made a conscious decision.
He liked to said,
you know what?

2075
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:59.540
This is obviously,
this is a problem.
This thing is fucking my life up.

2076
01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:02.330
And he was willing to put his money where his mouth is and,
and,
and,

2077
01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:06.980
and stop the ball flow.
I know a scientist,
she was,
uh,
he,

2078
01:55:07.170 --> 01:55:11.120
he like made all kinds of shit.
He was on like monster garage that,
that,
uh,

2079
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:13.310
what's his name,
Sean.
And um,

2080
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:17.510
wrote for like scientific American and shit does all kinds of different shit but

2081
01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.500
thought I'm an I'm an experiment and I want to change myself into a woman and

2082
01:55:21.501 --> 01:55:24.920
did it like a homemade,
that would be a fascinating one for your show.

2083
01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:28.620
This fucking lady did a homemade sex change and became a woman.
Ooh,

2084
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:31.190
who's like homemade.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Like with,

2085
01:55:31.191 --> 01:55:35.780
no I don't think did any hormones or maybe self administered hormones and like

2086
01:55:35.781 --> 01:55:37.490
self surgery too crazy.

2087
01:55:37.491 --> 01:55:40.790
I don't know if it is a self surgery fully but I ended up getting it.

2088
01:55:40.791 --> 01:55:42.800
It doesn't feel the same and it smells different

2089
01:55:44.410 --> 01:55:49.030
<v 0>and they said that a Unix,
there's a study,
a study that just came out,</v>

2090
01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:53.110
a study of over 80 unix from the Cho Sun Dynasty,

2091
01:55:53.111 --> 01:55:57.610
which ruled in Korea from 1392 to a 1897.

2092
01:55:57.790 --> 01:56:01.690
They looked at the world's only record of Unix lives and compared them to

2093
01:56:01.691 --> 01:56:06.080
genealogical records of other men of similar social rank and the research cross

2094
01:56:06.090 --> 01:56:09.550
check the results with other royal records and what they found was the average

2095
01:56:09.551 --> 01:56:12.940
lifespan of a unit and a unit because someone has their Dick and balls cut off

2096
01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.740
was around 70 years,

2097
01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:19.770
14 to 19 years higher than those of a non castrated man of similar social

2098
01:56:19.841 --> 01:56:24.100
standing.
So what do you think it is?
They were just like in less danger.

2099
01:56:24.130 --> 01:56:26.710
Less stress is probably just dealing with women.

2100
01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:31.630
Probably just dealing with the stress of chasing pussy.

2101
01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:35.200
It's like really bad in your heart.
These crazy fuck

2102
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:38.390
<v 5>well how many people would even get out of bed really if it wasn't for some</v>

2103
01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:42.110
pussy at the mother to go work out or whether to go make money.

2104
01:56:42.111 --> 01:56:46.820
It's like it kind of drives a lot of us guys to get out and do stuff.

2105
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:49.850
Yeah.
Becomes the main motivating factor for a lot of people,

2106
01:56:49.851 --> 01:56:53.200
especially early in life.
And then I wonder how like Unix start,
why,

2107
01:56:53.201 --> 01:56:56.270
why were they made units to get taken care of?
There was something on servitude.

2108
01:56:56.271 --> 01:56:59.450
Right?
And so they're taken care of if they're like on welfare in a way they're,

2109
01:56:59.451 --> 01:57:03.890
they're a completely socialists unit so they don't have any stress about money

2110
01:57:03.891 --> 01:57:07.120
or about who's going to steal their pigs or any of that shit.
Right,

2111
01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:12.170
<v 0>right.
They're probably,
I mean it said dynasty,
so I'm assuming that's like kings,</v>

2112
01:57:12.171 --> 01:57:16.070
right?
Right.
So the,
that's interesting.
Castration,

2113
01:57:16.071 --> 01:57:19.700
which removes the source of the male hormones and clean crease increases

2114
01:57:19.701 --> 01:57:24.230
lifespan and animals.
Try it guys.
I'll tell you what man,

2115
01:57:24.231 --> 01:57:27.020
I had my dog fix when he was five and he,
he changed,

2116
01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:31.130
he got real tired all the time.
He got lazy.
He just wanted to lay down.

2117
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.450
It was sad.
I was sad to watch and sad.
He was always horny and shit.

2118
01:57:35.451 --> 01:57:37.220
So I was like,
ah,
I think I need to get them fixed.

2119
01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:41.270
It's just poor guys like using,
you know,
the doctors will tell you,
yeah,

2120
01:57:41.271 --> 01:57:44.210
the doctors are telling you it's important.
One point in time.
His,
uh,

2121
01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:46.060
his balls were aching.
I thought he was,

2122
01:57:46.190 --> 01:57:47.330
I thought there's something wrong with them.

2123
01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:49.550
Who's like going down the stairs and he was Yiping.
I was like,

2124
01:57:49.551 --> 01:57:52.410
what's the matter buddy?
So I wound up taking him to the vet and the vet,

2125
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:56.600
the vet said there's a dog in heat your neighborhood.
And he was,

2126
01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.860
his dick and balls were hurting so bad because the dog and heat that he couldn't

2127
01:58:00.861 --> 01:58:04.190
walk downstairs.
He would.
Yep.
Yep.
And I was like,
this poor guy's tortured.

2128
01:58:04.191 --> 01:58:06.200
It's not,
you're got steady pussy around them all the time.

2129
01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.560
<v 5>The vet,
the don't give him a release date.
I don't think so.
I'll be the bet.</v>

2130
01:58:09.630 --> 01:58:14.010
The bet.
Imagine if that's what they do.
Why wouldn't you?
That's a towel.
Yeah.

2131
01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:16.000
Well the vet supposed to suck the penis.

2132
01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:22.590
Yeah.
Imagine if there was like,
dude,
I had a bully.

2133
01:58:22.610 --> 01:58:25.390
Just things for that motherfucker has not came out,
you know,

2134
01:58:25.391 --> 01:58:28.300
the knot and the penis,
the dog that connects them to like,

2135
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:31.490
so they ensure and sedation and fucking,
uh,

2136
01:58:31.810 --> 01:58:34.900
it came out past the sheath of his skin.
I just,

2137
01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:38.340
I looked at that poor fucker and he's just,
hey,
hey,
hey.

2138
01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:43.060
Not Happy at all.
I'm like,
good luck with it.
You know,

2139
01:58:43.061 --> 01:58:45.880
like I just got to wait until the swelling goes down and gets and goes in.

2140
01:58:45.881 --> 01:58:49.930
But it's like you could see it almost tearing the skin back to fucking go back

2141
01:58:49.931 --> 01:58:50.440
and like,

2142
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:53.620
<v 1>oh,
you know,
this is a funny thing about animals that,</v>

2143
01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:58.000
that crazy desire to breed in bees,
especially in honeybees.

2144
01:58:58.270 --> 01:59:02.740
The male honeybee has sex with a female honeybee and his dick explodes.

2145
01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:05.710
Okay.
His Dick Lodges inside of her breaks,

2146
01:59:05.711 --> 01:59:08.950
off pops his balls literally burst.

2147
01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:12.940
His testicles bursts and his penis breaks off inside her and he dies.

2148
01:59:12.941 --> 01:59:17.740
He like bleeds out the honeybee.
He's driven to fuck.
Okay,

2149
01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:20.770
right.
He fucks and when he fucks,
he dies.
It's amazing,

2150
01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.800
honey bees get like one shot at fucking the one shot at killing.

2151
01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:27.670
They get one shot.
If they sting you,
the,
the Stinger is,
it's,

2152
01:59:27.671 --> 01:59:32.050
it rips off that from their abdomen and they die.
They die,
they die,
they die.

2153
01:59:32.051 --> 01:59:34.930
When they sting you like it gives me constellation.
Isn't that crazy though?

2154
01:59:34.931 --> 01:59:38.900
Widow?
What a shit design man.
What does that,
what do you watch?
Elephant Titus.

2155
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:40.240
[inaudible] this is a sketch.

2156
01:59:40.770 --> 01:59:44.230
<v 5>Remember your testes in you?
What is his from,</v>

2157
01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:48.700
from member Johnny dangerously or whatever.
Oh,

2158
01:59:48.701 --> 01:59:52.510
that's funny.
That's what it's from.
You are a mad researcher,
sir.
Yeah.

2159
01:59:52.511 --> 01:59:56.140
How could you remember that?
Uh,
this was my favorite as a kid.
All right.

2160
01:59:56.141 --> 01:59:57.550
Cut it off.
Make sense?

2161
01:59:59.570 --> 02:00:03.590
<v 1>That was a good movie though.
That was back when Michael Keaton was like the man.</v>

2162
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:07.970
What happened to that guy?
You think he just like moved to Malibu and just,

2163
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:10.250
I feel like he got a little throwback from Michael J.
Fox.

2164
02:00:10.251 --> 02:00:12.730
I always get those confused and maybe there's a little ill.
Well,

2165
02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:16.550
one of them was Batman.
It's hard to remember.

2166
02:00:16.551 --> 02:00:20.060
Even Michael Keaton was a good fucking Batman.
It was a good bag,

2167
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:23.860
<v 5>but I just watched it like four months ago and it totally wasn't,</v>

2168
02:00:23.861 --> 02:00:26.200
that goes home or you know,
it was a real,
it doesn't hold up.

2169
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:29.200
But wasn't Jack Nicholson the a,
the job that,

2170
02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:33.630
oh,
I watched the one with Denado's.
The Penguin?
Yeah.

2171
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:36.700
Oh and Mike and Michael Keaton was in that one too.

2172
02:00:37.090 --> 02:00:39.910
He was the Batman more than once.
Yeah,
twice.

2173
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:42.340
If you've seen the picture of Val Kilmer,

2174
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:46.620
<v 1>well his head,
the size of a pumpkin and it just says lol.
I used to be Batman.</v>

2175
02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:53.110
That fucking poor guy isn't he live in New Mexico to guys.

2176
02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:56.580
He's got a ranch out there apparently gets mad at people for going on his ranch

2177
02:00:56.670 --> 02:01:01.110
and go fishing on his ranch.
It's like New Mexico is like Hawaii.

2178
02:01:01.111 --> 02:01:04.560
Kinda like you can't,
if you're not from there,
like that's one of the questions.

2179
02:01:04.561 --> 02:01:07.650
Like if there's beef with somebody or you're on the road,
like there's like,

2180
02:01:08.010 --> 02:01:11.000
where are you from?
Like is like,
we're going to fight now.
Right.

2181
02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:14.820
You know what I mean?
And,
and uh,
like if you walk around like a Wahoo at night,

2182
02:01:14.821 --> 02:01:17.310
like that's,
if you're,
you're going to scrap with somebody.

2183
02:01:17.311 --> 02:01:19.110
It's just going to happen.
Um,

2184
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:22.740
in New Mexico is kind of like that and fucking he lives out in this place in

2185
02:01:22.741 --> 02:01:27.060
Raton,
whereas like,
I don't like,
you want to,

2186
02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.193
you want to,

2187
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:30.290
<v 5>it's like all families,
old families.</v>

2188
02:01:30.291 --> 02:01:33.560
It's the same families that have had different families and they're all kind of,

2189
02:01:33.561 --> 02:01:37.460
that's the,
that's the community.
And He,
I guess just pisses those people off,

2190
02:01:37.461 --> 02:01:40.280
drives through crazy and the whole or parties

2191
02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:43.220
<v 1>and really it seems like very unwise.</v>

2192
02:01:43.221 --> 02:01:48.170
Like that's an indicator of how fucked up he is that he's not even aware of the

2193
02:01:48.171 --> 02:01:52.490
danger that he's in.
Yeah.
He's got a,
I think some bad demons.
You know,

2194
02:01:52.491 --> 02:01:53.930
he's a movie star,

2195
02:01:53.931 --> 02:01:58.931
a big time movie star and he's living amongst like real humble folk folks that

2196
02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:03.080
maybe make 12 grand a year.
Yeah.
And he's kind of floating it around.

2197
02:02:03.081 --> 02:02:06.560
That's a fascinating and loaded a lot.
Does he have,

2198
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:09.470
does he have like handlers or security?

2199
02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:12.590
One of my friends who used to work for them and uh,

2200
02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:16.400
it would procure ship for him,
but I don't,
I procure shit for him.

2201
02:02:17.170 --> 02:02:19.900
Like I don't know exactly what his life is.

2202
02:02:19.930 --> 02:02:23.480
Liking statement cure shift for him.
Yeah.
What happened?

2203
02:02:23.481 --> 02:02:26.680
He just decided to like take is a movie star money and just asked,

2204
02:02:26.690 --> 02:02:30.970
check out for a few years.
I did a show called a felon.

2205
02:02:31.190 --> 02:02:33.860
He was the star,
but he was like absent the whole time.

2206
02:02:33.861 --> 02:02:38.861
And then I saw him on some Indian Grammy's type shit and he could barely get

2207
02:02:39.711 --> 02:02:41.360
sentences together.
It was like Washington.

2208
02:02:41.361 --> 02:02:45.440
It was like watching Bob Dylan performed.
It was just like,
oh,
sad man.

2209
02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:49.580
Oh Wow.
But they are talking,
they're intoxicated.

2210
02:02:49.630 --> 02:02:52.640
Bob Dylan can't get sentences.
Last time I saw him perform,

2211
02:02:52.641 --> 02:02:57.590
it was like a slobbery drunk,
like prob dealing was,
come on.
Really?

2212
02:02:58.250 --> 02:03:01.370
Bob Dylan gets hammered.
Oh,
he was at that time.
Where was,

2213
02:03:01.371 --> 02:03:04.820
this is on some big award show was like the Emmys or the grammys or something

2214
02:03:04.821 --> 02:03:06.730
like that that he was performing.
And I know,

2215
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:10.520
I remember there was a huge black woman that was singing backup that ended up

2216
02:03:10.521 --> 02:03:14.260
taking,
taking over kind of force.
It was embarrassingly so,
yeah.

2217
02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.910
Why have I not heard this?
Bob Dylan drunk.

2218
02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:21.260
Dylan sings trunk.
I've never heard this.

2219
02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:24.470
I've never heard a bad word about Bob Dylan.
That's one of the weird things.

2220
02:03:24.650 --> 02:03:28.520
He's one of those dudes.
It's like,
you know,
yeah,
he had a couple drinks,
you know,

2221
02:03:28.521 --> 02:03:32.540
let's give them a break.
Okay.
Brian go to Bob Dylan singing drunk on stage.

2222
02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:37.520
On Youtube?
Yeah.
Maybe just old dude.

2223
02:03:37.521 --> 02:03:41.180
Old dudes.
Don't tell us.
I could be,
who knows?
Get to a certain level.

2224
02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:43.253
You see it?

2225
02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:47.433
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2226
02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.930
<v 1>Let's see how drunk he sounds.
Oh,
can you get some volume?</v>

2227
02:03:49.931 --> 02:03:53.620
Business seems like a fake video.
Why do you say that?
Because it's all right.

2228
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.513
We'll see.

2229
02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:55.560
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2230
02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.300
<v 1>What is that Brian?
I'll suss it out.</v>

2231
02:03:59.450 --> 02:04:03.780
Do you know how to get noise out of it this time he gets loaded up

2232
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:10.020
and it's got,
what?
What's the tip off that?

2233
02:04:10.021 --> 02:04:12.390
It's fake Brian.
Uh,
the,
here it goes.

2234
02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:14.613
<v 6>Oh,</v>

2235
02:04:28.110 --> 02:04:29.380
<v 1>that's just someone being old.</v>

2236
02:04:32.530 --> 02:04:35.470
But there was something else.
Well,
if you Google it,

2237
02:04:35.471 --> 02:04:39.630
there's apparently a bunch of them.
Bob Dylan drunk.

2238
02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:42.930
Another one.
So tell me about your kettle bells.

2239
02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:47.670
What about if you want to know?
I want to,
I want to know a,
are they shaping

2240
02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:51.990
<v 5>like mom
can't talk.</v>

2241
02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:57.230
<v 1>Oh,
really?
I can't tell you that man.</v>

2242
02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.740
You just cause I need to buy kettle bells for the gym.
I gave you some.
Okay.
Yeah,

2243
02:05:00.741 --> 02:05:04.910
we'll,
uh,
get you to thumb through on it.
But it's um,
the um,

2244
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:10.070
uh,
the kettle bells that we have are the same ones from Troy.
You know,

2245
02:05:10.071 --> 02:05:14.180
those big fat handles.
They're,
they're excellent cause a shit.

2246
02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:18.920
What do you still have that?
Um,
Kettlebell,
um,
got across to the Omg to Jim.

2247
02:05:18.921 --> 02:05:23.210
Like my Santa Fe 10th planet satellite has got a crossfit gym.
It and Santa Fe.

2248
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:25.310
Are you going to train down here while you're,
while you're in town?
Yeah,

2249
02:05:25.330 --> 02:05:30.260
I usually have my down at Scotty's usually.
Cool.
Donna Pico.
Where's he at?

2250
02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:33.290
He's like Pico and Doheny.
Okay.
Yeah,

2251
02:05:33.291 --> 02:05:38.291
I don't get down there and that plan@westlapolo.com west La Scott Epstein,

2252
02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:42.590
many different satellites now.
All how many?
50?
I don't know.

2253
02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:45.530
He's got a lot of them.
I want to go see alders too,
dude.
I really want to,

2254
02:05:45.531 --> 02:05:50.120
I haven't seen all,
is that a good Moitai Jim too?
Which is a nice little nice.

2255
02:05:50.450 --> 02:05:52.790
He's got a lot of fighters there.
Yeah.

2256
02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:55.550
I got to find a good Muay Thai gym someplace to do some more time.

2257
02:05:55.551 --> 02:05:56.810
I need to mix it up a little bit.

2258
02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:01.040
Do you want to spar or what do you want to do is get the guy the whole sheds.

2259
02:06:01.450 --> 02:06:06.380
Yeah.
That's good.
I like to do drills to just the,
just the rattling of the dome.

2260
02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:10.610
It was not good for you.
Nope.
I know too many dudes who uh,

2261
02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:14.920
who are getting a little weird just for foreign.
Don't quit soon enough.
Yeah.

2262
02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:19.700
Yeah.
It's a,
it's a tricky thing in it.
I mean,

2263
02:06:19.701 --> 02:06:22.010
you retired for folks who don't know,

2264
02:06:22.011 --> 02:06:26.270
Tate was on the season to the ultimate fighter three,
three,
three.

2265
02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:30.730
Michael Bisping's a year.
You're your best friend.
One take was on that and uh,

2266
02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:35.010
you had a couple of fights after that and you're like,
you know,
it's just,
yeah,

2267
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.940
it's,
you know,

2268
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:38.780
you just get diminishing returns after a while and you've got to make that

2269
02:06:38.781 --> 02:06:41.690
choice I think and go,
what I'm,

2270
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:45.830
<v 5>what's the payoff here?
And even,
even if you're really getting really big,</v>

2271
02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:48.950
big payoffs,
like,
like Kukla del money at that time or something like that,

2272
02:06:48.951 --> 02:06:52.550
it's like,
what is the pay off of forever kind of happen.
Like,

2273
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:54.350
like thinking everything clearly.

2274
02:06:54.351 --> 02:06:56.790
Cause I haven't been knocked out a couple of times and,
and uh,

2275
02:06:57.350 --> 02:07:01.550
and there's times after that where you know that you're not enunciating,

2276
02:07:01.551 --> 02:07:03.560
you're not,
or you have to really think,

2277
02:07:03.561 --> 02:07:08.000
you have to really put thought into your mechanisms to get the words out
clearly.

2278
02:07:08.001 --> 02:07:10.100
And you're like,
but you're thinking it clearly,

2279
02:07:10.101 --> 02:07:11.910
but it's just not going to your mouth and you're like,
whoa.

2280
02:07:12.070 --> 02:07:13.970
Like when I thought that I'd be like,
Holy Fuck.

2281
02:07:13.971 --> 02:07:16.280
And I talked to Jordan about it a lot and he's like,
Yo,

2282
02:07:16.281 --> 02:07:17.990
I'm doing crossword puzzles.
I'm like,
me too.

2283
02:07:17.991 --> 02:07:20.420
Like every morning we're doing crossword puzzles after sparring,

2284
02:07:20.590 --> 02:07:23.090
but it's fucking crazy dude.

2285
02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:27.740
But that's what George Foreman said to really?
Yeah.
I don't know that it helped,

2286
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:32.600
um,
not gorge for myself.
You know,
like you,
you wonder,

2287
02:07:33.110 --> 02:07:36.400
you wonder what that is and like you,
you would talk,
it always rang in my head,

2288
02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:40.930
you know,
that they don't even know till 10 years after the concussion,

2289
02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:44.130
what the damages.
And then I start thinking about residual damage.

2290
02:07:44.150 --> 02:07:46.870
Like not even knockouts,
but dudes that are just getting jarred.

2291
02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:51.760
It's like you'd get in fucking jarred all the time.
And like,
even just wrestlers,

2292
02:07:51.761 --> 02:07:54.060
man,
like our football players,
everybody gets it.

2293
02:07:54.061 --> 02:07:57.430
It's not just people with head trauma,
uh,
that's directly,
it's like,

2294
02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:00.640
it's the vibration in your body and the shaking of the head,
you know?
I mean,

2295
02:08:00.641 --> 02:08:03.520
I know stunt men that have it too,
but yeah,
it's,
uh,

2296
02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:06.750
it's a real dangerous thing and it's something to really be cognitive about and

2297
02:08:06.751 --> 02:08:07.561
to go,
what,

2298
02:08:07.561 --> 02:08:11.050
what is enough and where do I go from here and what will the rest of my life

2299
02:08:11.051 --> 02:08:14.110
being in?
The big thing I think with fighters especially as like,

2300
02:08:14.111 --> 02:08:15.730
here's a bunch of dudes that,
you know,

2301
02:08:15.731 --> 02:08:18.160
there's not everybody that's a Kenny Florian or something like that,

2302
02:08:18.161 --> 02:08:22.300
that's like a,
and by that I mean like a,
a career in law perhaps,

2303
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:25.060
that he was going to have.
Right.
Wasn't he a law student at one time?

2304
02:08:25.061 --> 02:08:28.330
I'm not sure.
But you know,
he's a bunch of highly educated fighters,

2305
02:08:28.331 --> 02:08:30.550
you know what I mean?
That,
that are out there.
And now he,
yeah,

2306
02:08:30.551 --> 02:08:33.730
he's got a great job as a,
as a,
uh,
analyst and all that.
But

2307
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:35.960
<v 0>he also has a gym,
you know,
he has his own gym.</v>

2308
02:08:35.961 --> 02:08:37.700
I know he still had his brother runs right.

2309
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:41.150
I think he opened up a place in Beverly hills to where he's going to Oh,

2310
02:08:41.151 --> 02:08:44.330
right on.
Yeah,
he knows what to do.
I mean,
Kenny Florian is a really smart guy.

2311
02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:47.670
<v 5>There's,
there's that kind of thing and that's only so many guys.</v>

2312
02:08:47.671 --> 02:08:49.740
And so then you think,
you know,

2313
02:08:49.741 --> 02:08:52.890
all these guys that were working construction or that we're working as bouncers

2314
02:08:52.891 --> 02:08:55.200
or whatever,
what,
what am I,
because now I'm a fighter.

2315
02:08:55.201 --> 02:08:57.960
It's kind of a herald of thing you get and people are like in the store and they

2316
02:08:57.961 --> 02:09:01.260
go,
oh look,
he's a fighter.
And like,
what are you now though?

2317
02:09:01.261 --> 02:09:04.530
And that kind of getting to the root of yourself at the end of your career and

2318
02:09:04.531 --> 02:09:06.510
going,
who am I without this?
Or,

2319
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:09.930
or if you move to a new place like a new city and you don't have the same job,

2320
02:09:09.931 --> 02:09:12.540
you don't have the same friends,
you don't have the same girlfriend,
you're broke.

2321
02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:15.210
Like who are you?
Not without any money in your pocket without,

2322
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:16.490
without in any of that.

2323
02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:19.600
And really getting to the base of yourself as a human and a,
and it's,

2324
02:09:19.601 --> 02:09:20.820
it's a scary question.

2325
02:09:20.821 --> 02:09:24.690
I think that that is the reason that guys stay too long in those sports is

2326
02:09:24.691 --> 02:09:27.300
because they're like,
well,
fuck,
what would I be without this?

2327
02:09:27.550 --> 02:09:29.220
And to me that always seemed like a prison.

2328
02:09:29.221 --> 02:09:32.490
Like I never wanted to be in a position where I was going,
oh,

2329
02:09:32.491 --> 02:09:36.030
well I'm a slave to this because I don't know what else would be possible.

2330
02:09:36.031 --> 02:09:38.890
And I'm like,
I want to live in that infinite possibility that,

2331
02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:40.350
that anything's possible.
And let's,

2332
02:09:40.351 --> 02:09:42.840
let's go jump off the cliff and see what's down there.
You know,

2333
02:09:43.110 --> 02:09:47.190
<v 0>apparently Bob Dylan was in a motorcycle accident really?
And,
uh,</v>

2334
02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:51.490
he was talked into by,
uh,
his,
uh,
his,
uh,

2335
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:55.560
band and to getting speech therapy because he was in sort of denial about

2336
02:09:55.561 --> 02:09:58.110
slurring of the words after the motorcycle accident.

2337
02:09:58.260 --> 02:10:03.260
How dare that's apparently the story online for according to some dude on my

2338
02:10:04.651 --> 02:10:07.890
message board named Kiam design.

2339
02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:11.490
My apologies to Bob Dylan and his family thinking,
Bob.

2340
02:10:11.730 --> 02:10:14.640
But I think a good guys that create it probably has some demons probably just

2341
02:10:14.641 --> 02:10:16.350
getting lit up every night.
Maybe you just can't,

2342
02:10:16.351 --> 02:10:19.960
it's drunk and he's got a head injury.
It's great publicity maybe.

2343
02:10:19.961 --> 02:10:21.630
And maybe he was getting hammered and he's like,

2344
02:10:21.631 --> 02:10:26.040
I need a good excuse and motorcycle accident,
son.
I'm a victim.

2345
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:32.250
Well,
I remember clearly when a fucking crazy man had that,
uh,

2346
02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:34.280
the motorcycle accident where he hit,

2347
02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.800
<v 1>um,
the fuck's his name,
the guy who's a,</v>

2348
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:40.820
it's always crazy on those reality shows.
The older guy,

2349
02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:45.250
lethal weapon.
Oh,
Gary,
Gary Busey.
Uh,

2350
02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:50.280
Gary BC had a legit serious impact with a curb and his fucking head and almost

2351
02:10:50.571 --> 02:10:54.790
died and his head change shape.
Like,
if you look at his face,
oh,

2352
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:57.320
curry motorcycle accident post motorcycle accident.

2353
02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:02.420
One of his eyes moved up or moved down.
I saw it got fall out of the car today.

2354
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:06.170
Oh,
they're taking it right off of Olympic and uh,

2355
02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.740
and I saw the door was open on the car and then they go to start taking the

2356
02:11:09.741 --> 02:11:14.270
right and the se a hand reach out to grab the door and he bends the corner and

2357
02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:17.270
I'm kind of looking back and,
but book dude falls on it.
I was like,

2358
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:19.130
how does that even happen?

2359
02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:20.880
<v 9>It's still way the acids.</v>

2360
02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:25.710
In the last week I've seen maybe three or four people fall on the ground.

2361
02:11:25.890 --> 02:11:29.100
Like I'm driving and I just see like a woman fall.

2362
02:11:29.670 --> 02:11:32.710
I've had three or four times this week.
I've seen it like,

2363
02:11:32.730 --> 02:11:34.800
have you noticed any people falling lately?

2364
02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:40.680
I guess it's just like a coincidence falling through the chem trails.

2365
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:41.820
I don't know man.

2366
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:46.440
<v 1>Howard [inaudible] Bravo,
Bravo.
See if there's a,
a fallen conspiracy,</v>

2367
02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:47.820
he'll tell you it's orbs,

2368
02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:53.370
something in the air chem trails making people fall.
I Dunno.
I mean,

2369
02:11:53.371 --> 02:11:54.950
do you think that there's a,

2370
02:11:54.951 --> 02:11:57.270
you really think there's a conspiracy that people are falling?

2371
02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:58.950
<v 9>I don't know.
I'm just saying like this week,
I,</v>

2372
02:11:58.951 --> 02:12:02.250
for some reason I've seen so many people fall where I'm just like driving by

2373
02:12:02.251 --> 02:12:05.850
like,
should I help this person?
Oh,
there's like an ambulance,
right?
Terrible

2374
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:10.910
<v 1>photo of a person in China today that was run over by a street flattening truck.</v>

2375
02:12:11.371 --> 02:12:15.670
They were trying to get protesters out and the guy what stood his ground saver.

2376
02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:19.590
Yeah.
They ran over him.
Holos yeah,
it's horrific.

2377
02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:24.240
It's like 10 and I'm at square all over it.
Yeah,
it is.
It is.
Yeah.
The,
in China,

2378
02:12:24.241 --> 02:12:26.310
they'll still run you over,
man.
You getting,
you know,

2379
02:12:26.311 --> 02:12:30.180
they're not quite there yet and though your course did not quite that yet here,

2380
02:12:30.181 --> 02:12:34.160
but as long as the government keeps passing shit,
like the NDA that's around,

2381
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:35.250
that's around the corner,

2382
02:12:35.370 --> 02:12:39.630
the flattening you with a steam roller and now you can't,

2383
02:12:40.170 --> 02:12:44.220
you can't even,
you can't occupy Wall Street,
goddammit.
It's like you can't,

2384
02:12:44.370 --> 02:12:47.330
he made that a felony.
Tuh Tuh Tuh uh,

2385
02:12:47.370 --> 02:12:49.820
peaceably protest without a permit.
Yeah.

2386
02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:54.850
And so now that's a felonious act to go and assemble to protest corporations,

2387
02:12:55.170 --> 02:12:59.760
which are fucking government is simply a shadow for anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,

2388
02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:05.040
it's weird.
Gross.
We,
it's like how much Kenya,

2389
02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:09.930
how much can you just enjoy it and just live life and try to,
you know,
to,

2390
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:14.360
to be cool in your own community and be surrounded by Arab you,

2391
02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:16.710
you tried to only rock it that way,

2392
02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:21.090
but you got to always think that these motherfuckers could come in and fuck up

2393
02:13:21.091 --> 02:13:23.670
your shit and think that they're allowed to.

2394
02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:28.140
It's like you really aren't that much connected to someone who lives in

2395
02:13:28.141 --> 02:13:31.860
Washington DC.
You're just not,
they're too far away.
It's really crazy.
But

2396
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:37.070
<v 0>someone who's got a boner for you in Washington DC that has power could decide</v>

2397
02:13:37.651 --> 02:13:42.120
to use it and find some reason to fuck you over and come after you.

2398
02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:45.930
Especially if you're involved in something that they've written down on paper.

2399
02:13:46.110 --> 02:13:47.010
It says you're not allowed to,

2400
02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:50.170
<v 5>or even if you're not and you're opposed to that thing publicly,</v>

2401
02:13:50.410 --> 02:13:51.970
then you're vilified and another,
you know,

2402
02:13:51.971 --> 02:13:54.100
they could do whatever they want to get behind that.

2403
02:13:54.250 --> 02:13:57.040
And it makes me think those people just haven't had like some nice steamed

2404
02:13:57.041 --> 02:14:01.090
Broccoli and a steak would get yourself a good ribeye medium and go and help

2405
02:14:01.091 --> 02:14:01.711
some people will,

2406
02:14:01.711 --> 02:14:04.870
it feels fucking better than helping people like go out and help.

2407
02:14:04.871 --> 02:14:07.090
Like as far as like,
like Calma,

2408
02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:10.270
we can shove people down how we can control people.
How about you help people?

2409
02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.970
There's an enrichment there and then when everybody does better,

2410
02:14:12.971 --> 02:14:16.590
everybody fucking does better.
And it's a fucking universal law.
You Cock sock.

2411
02:14:16.591 --> 02:14:17.980
It is.
But the problem is

2412
02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:23.060
<v 0>you're dealing with people that first of all are completely unenlightened and</v>

2413
02:14:23.150 --> 02:14:27.830
again,
they're operating.
Did the people that are empowered now besides Obama,

2414
02:14:27.831 --> 02:14:30.710
who's essentially a child of the Internet,
I mean he,

2415
02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:32.870
he will existed before the Internet,

2416
02:14:32.871 --> 02:14:36.650
but he's had massive amounts of access to it since the 1990s when it was around.

2417
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:41.180
So He's,
he's basically grown and maybe not grown up but grown with it.

2418
02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:43.220
But the other people that are in,
like,

2419
02:14:43.221 --> 02:14:46.060
if you look at it like a Newt Gingrich type character,
I worked Dick Cheney,

2420
02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:50.510
those guys are operating on the old way.

2421
02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:52.910
They're operating the old way of corruption.

2422
02:14:52.911 --> 02:14:55.670
When you can get away with Shit like on Ran Contra,

2423
02:14:55.671 --> 02:14:59.150
you could bribe off judges and figure out a way to sneak shit under the door and

2424
02:14:59.270 --> 02:15:02.420
change the law.
So it makes what you're doing legal and they,

2425
02:15:02.421 --> 02:15:04.910
that is the way they've been rocking it since the beginning of time.

2426
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:08.740
It's going to take the next generation coming up.
It's going to take a hit.

2427
02:15:08.741 --> 02:15:12.710
This guy,
David Seaman on the podcast who was a congressional candidate or is it

2428
02:15:12.711 --> 02:15:16.280
congressional candidate who's 26 years old and he's a,
you know,

2429
02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:19.970
trying to expose all the bullshit that's going on in,
in,
in,
in,

2430
02:15:20.450 --> 02:15:24.950
in politics and with the lobbyists and just,
it's,

2431
02:15:25.010 --> 02:15:29.840
it's so much for a young guy to take on.
If you really want a career in,

2432
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:34.400
in cleaning up corruption and you want to actually live and not get sniped,

2433
02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:35.593
you got to,

2434
02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:39.220
<v 5>you know,
you become a pedophile or whatever else they put on you.
I mean,</v>

2435
02:15:39.221 --> 02:15:41.980
they can make him whatever,
you know,
that's the stuff.
Sure.
Yeah.

2436
02:15:41.981 --> 02:15:46.450
They can easily go criminal.
We'll give you $5 million.
Like we have that.

2437
02:15:46.451 --> 02:15:49.540
That's easy money.
Just get on,
get on,
get on board.
Yeah.

2438
02:15:49.541 --> 02:15:52.420
And they can figure out a way to compromise your nice and slow lip,
you know,

2439
02:15:52.570 --> 02:15:56.140
nicely and slowly.
They just slow cook.
Didn't they do that with them?
Kennedy,

2440
02:15:56.141 --> 02:15:59.630
they brought him down to Cuba and got him some hookers and shit and Marilyn,

2441
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:02.830
Marilyn,
they paid from paid her like,

2442
02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:07.270
I think you're making shit up on the dollar.
I see that face.
That's the,

2443
02:16:07.271 --> 02:16:10.650
I'm making shit up
that expensive.

2444
02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:13.240
What do you think a thousand bucks is worth in the Marilyn Monroe days?

2445
02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:17.260
It's probably like,
could you get a car for 1000 bucks?
That six grand really?

2446
02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:19.960
Well,
they were talking about what?
It's like a brand new Mustang.

2447
02:16:19.961 --> 02:16:23.410
Like when the fastback came out like six [inaudible] five like 3,500 bucks or

2448
02:16:23.411 --> 02:16:24.160
something like that.
Ooh,

2449
02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:27.030
<v 0>Mustang 19th pricing.</v>

2450
02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.100
Let's go with 1963

2451
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:31.270
<v 1>because I think a fastback,</v>

2452
02:16:31.330 --> 02:16:33.820
if you've got a fast back or he could have Maryland for a week,

2453
02:16:33.850 --> 02:16:37.090
like that's probably comparable.
Yeah.

2454
02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:41.170
I don't know what a fastback or Maryland for a week.
No,

2455
02:16:41.171 --> 02:16:42.820
you need a fleshlight in a Mustang.

2456
02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:47.230
That's what you need is pretend week you kill yourself.
You'd be like,

2457
02:16:47.231 --> 02:16:50.440
I can't believe I've got to have a fucking 1960 you gotta have a stash light.

2458
02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:57.070
I could add a VA.
I'm going to have a flashlight party tomorrow.
Oh,

2459
02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:01.090
are you really fascinating?
Are you going to are going to talk to girls there?

2460
02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:03.010
Bronx.
This Texas is going to be there.
Oh,

2461
02:17:03.011 --> 02:17:07.120
the big old booty on her on film.

2462
02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.890
Proof that we,

2463
02:17:08.891 --> 02:17:13.891
that men don't give a fuck about skinny like stick figure type chick,

2464
02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:16.810
thick legs and as much.

2465
02:17:16.811 --> 02:17:20.940
At least five pounds while we're not having a smile.
Oh yeah.
In what?

2466
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:23.560
She's blowing guys.
She's smiling,
always wanting to meet her.

2467
02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:27.610
These are all mustangs for sale.
It doesn't really say what it costs back then.

2468
02:17:29.250 --> 02:17:33.400
Oh wait a minute.
If we do like a price circa,
there's a bunch of different sites.

2469
02:17:33.401 --> 02:17:37.480
See Martinez?
I don't know who that is.
Who's Missy Martinez?
My new CEO.

2470
02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:40.060
You know like you're ahead of the curve kid.

2471
02:17:40.810 --> 02:17:44.240
He's got the ones that just moved from Arkansas had been here three weeks.

2472
02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:48.390
Kayden Kross you know her?
She's hot.
Yeah,

2473
02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:51.930
I've seen her before.
Sam Aaa.
Sam Aaa is the,

2474
02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:55.060
he going to be there with the twins.
I hear Bryan County is going to be there.

2475
02:17:55.061 --> 02:17:56.110
That seems like a bad idea.

2476
02:17:58.990 --> 02:18:02.950
Why is that Brian?
Why is it a bad idea?
Just so many hot chicks.

2477
02:18:02.951 --> 02:18:06.730
He's going to go crazy,
man.
He's a handsome guy.

2478
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:09.700
He's going to kill him with his comedy.
Who's better looking than Brock?

2479
02:18:09.701 --> 02:18:13.330
Callen really romantic.
And then next in line,
Brian,

2480
02:18:15.850 --> 02:18:19.510
I'm still waiting for Brian to take me to olive garden.
Oh,
it can happen.

2481
02:18:20.290 --> 02:18:21.790
And what's going to happen when you get that tape?

2482
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:26.470
We're going to have a hell of a sensible meal.
We're going to have butter,
coffee,

2483
02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:28.330
and what happens at all?
I've got,

2484
02:18:28.331 --> 02:18:30.010
I don't even know what happens behind those doors.

2485
02:18:30.011 --> 02:18:35.011
Brian evade at all the garden east soldier with Hick.

2486
02:18:35.141 --> 02:18:36.880
A soldier had hiccups.
Okay.

2487
02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:42.180
And one soldier was trying to scare this soldier out of his hiccups and the way

2488
02:18:42.701 --> 02:18:45.730
he did it was shooting him in the face.
That would work,

2489
02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:47.320
I guess to cure the hiccups.

2490
02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:50.440
That seems like the worst excuse for shooting your buddy ever.

2491
02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:54.970
And he's being charged with manslaughter.
This is just murder.
No,

2492
02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.740
because he had a stupid excuse.

2493
02:18:56.770 --> 02:19:01.300
He pulled out a gun in order to scare him and stop the hiccups and the gun went

2494
02:19:01.301 --> 02:19:04.000
off.
It's crazy.
And he blew the guy's brains off.

2495
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:07.210
I feel like if you make that poor decision,
we should put you in prison anyway,

2496
02:19:07.211 --> 02:19:09.670
regardless if it's manslaughter or whatever.

2497
02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:13.540
When you think about these guys that had been over there and I've seen action,

2498
02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:14.440
you know,
if you've,

2499
02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.040
if you've ever seen some of those soldiers against the Iraq war with a,
uh,
they,

2500
02:19:18.310 --> 02:19:18.640
they,

2501
02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.120
they talk about all the different shit that they're commanding officers told

2502
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:22.871
them to do.

2503
02:19:22.871 --> 02:19:26.740
And the first guy who gets a knife kill gets like days off and like you to kill

2504
02:19:26.741 --> 02:19:28.950
people with knives.
And um,

2505
02:19:29.230 --> 02:19:34.210
do you go from that to like the regular world?
It's true,
yeah.
Thing.
Yeah,

2506
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:37.490
you can't,
it's almost like you have to,
as it were like in,

2507
02:19:37.491 --> 02:19:41.300
in black water or that were forced recon marines and Shit.

2508
02:19:41.301 --> 02:19:45.680
And it's like that's a,
it's a different thing that they live with.
And the years,

2509
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:48.980
I think like maybe,
maybe never six years or something before,

2510
02:19:48.981 --> 02:19:53.010
like my one buddy didn't want to shoot himself in the face like every day

2511
02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:56.950
afterwards and you lived through shit like that.
You're,
you're,
you're at a year,

2512
02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:59.960
you at a young age and you're asked to do horrific,

2513
02:19:59.961 --> 02:20:04.280
unimaginable things for a cause that then it comes to light eventually.

2514
02:20:04.281 --> 02:20:07.420
If you're a thinking person all like,
we're not even supposed to do,
like,

2515
02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:11.690
this is unjust.
Isn't it amazing how our depictions of,
uh,

2516
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:14.700
like if you look at like theatrical depictions or you know,

2517
02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:17.480
a romantic movies about war,

2518
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:21.740
very little of them dealt with the real horrors of war.

2519
02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:23.030
Look at our fucking news.

2520
02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:26.840
I mean if you go to Spain or something and look at the news,
there's bodies,

2521
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:30.290
there's body parts,
there's,
there's the horror of what death is.

2522
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:33.190
And here in America we don't have any of that stuff we've got,

2523
02:20:33.191 --> 02:20:37.520
that's why we have 9% unemployment in Spain has 25% is that why?

2524
02:20:37.521 --> 02:20:40.580
That's the reason it's bad.
It keeps people out of work.
I have no idea.

2525
02:20:40.610 --> 02:20:44.570
If you want to see violence on TV and reality on TV,
you hate America.
Oh,

2526
02:20:44.930 --> 02:20:48.980
we're not ready for that.
Oh,
that makes sense.

2527
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:54.500
Who do I vote for?
You imagine what it's like for people that have this like,

2528
02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:56.120
well,
I've talked to a fucking guy.

2529
02:20:56.121 --> 02:20:59.330
I talked to a guy who was at the ice house a couple of weeks ago who came and

2530
02:20:59.331 --> 02:21:04.280
told me about,
uh,
he actually joined the army to,
uh,
to try to pay for school.

2531
02:21:04.430 --> 02:21:08.120
And then a month later,
September 11th happened.
Oh yeah.

2532
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:13.150
So he got shipped off to Iraq and he was telling me about what an insane cluster

2533
02:21:13.461 --> 02:21:16.970
fuck it is and then how when he first got there right when he got there.

2534
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.460
So I was like,
Yep.
He was like,
well,
you know,

2535
02:21:19.461 --> 02:21:22.790
I guess at least we're coming over here getting rid of a dictator,
you know,

2536
02:21:22.791 --> 02:21:25.160
getting rid of stopping something like September 11th happen again.

2537
02:21:25.161 --> 02:21:28.820
And then his commanding officer said,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2538
02:21:28.850 --> 02:21:31.130
We're here to get oil.
That's what we're here for.

2539
02:21:31.470 --> 02:21:33.980
His commanding officer broke it down for them on the way.

2540
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:36.980
My step mom was like that.
She was like,
well,
we're,
you know,

2541
02:21:36.981 --> 02:21:39.300
we're given freedom to those people and this and that.
I'm like,
yeah,

2542
02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:41.060
if that were even true.

2543
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:46.420
Tell the mom in Minnesota who just fucking got her boy back in the bag.

2544
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:50.600
Yeah,
about Iraqi Freedom.
Like he doesn't know who gives a fuck.

2545
02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:52.280
These are dead people.

2546
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:56.990
Like we're going to push freedom at the end of a gun.
That don't make sense.

2547
02:21:56.991 --> 02:22:00.620
The ultimate irony too is cause we,
we got that guy in power,

2548
02:22:00.690 --> 02:22:03.590
you know the idea that this dictator,
how did you become a dictator?

2549
02:22:03.591 --> 02:22:06.590
You got to dictate it cause he's back like an orange states and then Noriega

2550
02:22:06.591 --> 02:22:07.760
says I'm not playing ball.
And they said,

2551
02:22:07.761 --> 02:22:10.500
well we're going to kidnap you then a sovereign leader from another country.
We,

2552
02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:13.880
we send in special ops and kidnapping.
The only place where they,
they,

2553
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:17.180
they rocket in a healthy way is places like,

2554
02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:20.540
like fucking Iceland and shit.
You gotta go,

2555
02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:23.600
you gotta go where it's really cold and no one wants to go.

2556
02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:26.310
And those people are down for the country.
You would never have.

2557
02:22:26.340 --> 02:22:28.530
You don't have fucking food that's bad for you that you know,

2558
02:22:28.531 --> 02:22:31.470
you know what I mean?
You can eat shit,
but it's like there's,
there's not,

2559
02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:33.780
there's not like a conspiracy to hurt the populous.

2560
02:22:33.781 --> 02:22:35.880
It's like the government is for the populace there.

2561
02:22:36.030 --> 02:22:37.350
I think it's cause it's small enough.

2562
02:22:37.351 --> 02:22:39.710
There's only like 300,000 people in Iceland or something like that.

2563
02:22:40.580 --> 02:22:44.160
You could throw bankers in jail,
shit like that.
Yeah.
Well,

2564
02:22:44.161 --> 02:22:47.730
I just watched a lawless.
It's fucking,
what does that Rad,

2565
02:22:47.731 --> 02:22:50.640
it's a movie about moonshiners and,
and during prohibition,

2566
02:22:50.641 --> 02:22:54.510
like Tom Hardy's in it.
Oh yeah.
That's good.
Moving dude is fun,
man.

2567
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:56.940
It's just come out.
Yeah.
I just saw it last night.

2568
02:22:56.970 --> 02:22:59.220
I haven't heard shit about that.
You heard anything about that?
It was good.

2569
02:22:59.221 --> 02:23:02.310
You're going to like it and fucking and like the way they deal with the law,

2570
02:23:02.311 --> 02:23:05.520
they're like a couple sheriffs come through and there you try trying,

2571
02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:06.360
you're not trying to,

2572
02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:09.780
you're trying to intimidate us and fucking the brass knuckles come out and shit.

2573
02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:12.750
And it's like,
it's like,
as long as you're righteous,
everything's cool.
Well,
yeah,

2574
02:23:12.751 --> 02:23:14.880
we'll honor that bad.
But if you try to get silly,

2575
02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:18.300
you want to extort money from us.
All right.
We're going to talk with a bat.

2576
02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:21.390
It's a as how people live back then.

2577
02:23:21.550 --> 02:23:26.190
I mean if there was really a time where it was fair,
right,
exactly.

2578
02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:27.830
And we look at it,
you know,

2579
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:31.770
it was like good guys and bad guys know it's bad guys in other bad guys.

2580
02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:36.990
It's all bad.
It's all bad guys or bad guys and that's,
you know,

2581
02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:41.610
we're,
we're the end that where we are as far as humanity has ever gone.

2582
02:23:41.611 --> 02:23:44.490
What we are today.
It's September,
what is it,

2583
02:23:44.491 --> 02:23:47.400
27th or something and 20 what is it,

2584
02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:52.200
25 or six seven or 25th September 25th,

2585
02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:57.200
2012 where we are today is the accumulation of error upon error of human error

2586
02:23:58.290 --> 02:24:03.210
learning and improving upon that and society moving forward,

2587
02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:06.240
technological innovation,
conquering different countries.

2588
02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:07.680
We're at the end of that line.

2589
02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:12.120
This is like as good as people have ever been ever.
Like right now,

2590
02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:15.900
the most capable we've ever best when we think that's the most information

2591
02:24:15.901 --> 02:24:17.490
accent about all the sand people.

2592
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:20.760
All those motherfuckers know that people that have turned to sand like the

2593
02:24:20.761 --> 02:24:24.870
iPhone.
What about all the other civilizations?
Oh,

2594
02:24:24.871 --> 02:24:29.040
the people that go whacked out,
you mean?
Yeah.
I mean they were the most advanced.

2595
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:31.110
They didn't make it.
Um,
yeah.
I wonder,

2596
02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:34.800
I wonder if there's been other civilizations.
They keep finding shit

2597
02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:41.210
telescope.
You ever listen to that dude?
A black guy used to work for NASA.
Um,

2598
02:24:42.690 --> 02:24:47.460
Tyson Degrassi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Neil Tyson degrasse.

2599
02:24:47.490 --> 02:24:51.150
That motherfucker is bad and you get him on the podcast trying to get,
oh,

2600
02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:53.820
going back and forth with him.
Oh Dude,
I'll give him a foot massage

2601
02:24:55.410 --> 02:24:59.980
oil or dry.
If you wanted oil,
I would do that motion.
You know?

2602
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.220
It was nice.
For sure.
Yeah.
I mean,

2603
02:25:02.221 --> 02:25:04.950
in my hands are like promised him jerking off of them.
It's like torture.

2604
02:25:04.951 --> 02:25:07.440
But I think if there was oily,
advanced societies,

2605
02:25:07.441 --> 02:25:12.380
it's very unlikely that they reached this level except for some of the giants

2606
02:25:12.381 --> 02:25:13.260
don't constructions.

2607
02:25:13.261 --> 02:25:15.690
That's the only thing that makes you like really step back and go,
man,

2608
02:25:15.770 --> 02:25:16.740
I'm not sure about that.

2609
02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:20.100
Or that it was intercontinental that the same construction existed in different

2610
02:25:20.101 --> 02:25:23.010
continents.
That that's crazy.
But he was talking to anyone who's listening,

2611
02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:23.893
that dude

2612
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:26.370
<v 5>the grass or Degrassi.
Yeah,</v>

2613
02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:30.520
and he was saying that they have a telescope.
It's like,

2614
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:32.170
I don't know if it's a hundred or a thousand.

2615
02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:36.250
What he said times the Hubble telescope was that they could construct,

2616
02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:39.940
but it would be $10 billion and that they just wouldn't fund it.
And he said,

2617
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.220
to put it in perspective,
what $10 billion was,

2618
02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:45.040
is what from 1956 or whenever NASA was created,

2619
02:25:45.430 --> 02:25:48.520
what has been in that program since then?
It's been about that.

2620
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:52.120
Or what one month in Afghanistan is,
is $10 billion.

2621
02:25:52.300 --> 02:25:54.100
But they won't fucking make this telescope,

2622
02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:58.360
which they say they think they could see the origins of fucking time.

2623
02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:01.240
That you could look back through space and see the origins,

2624
02:26:01.390 --> 02:26:04.570
but we don't want that.
That would upset the apple cart.
Well,

2625
02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:08.950
why isn't there an easy good contract to be made in building that thing,

2626
02:26:08.951 --> 02:26:11.280
that $10 billion it would cost today?

2627
02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:14.830
Wouldn't there be like a company that can profit off of it then you got to get

2628
02:26:14.831 --> 02:26:18.040
them on.
He would be fascinating.
Yeah.
Fuck.
That is an amazing thing.

2629
02:26:18.041 --> 02:26:19.360
When you really look at that number,

2630
02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:22.060
like how much money that is and what it is really.
I mean,

2631
02:26:22.061 --> 02:26:24.230
and these guys are talking about,
oh,
the president,

2632
02:26:24.250 --> 02:26:26.080
whoever's the Naysayer against whatever president is,

2633
02:26:26.290 --> 02:26:29.770
there's trillions of dollars.
That doesn't even mean anything to me.

2634
02:26:29.980 --> 02:26:32.770
He might as well say we're headphones in debt like,
okay,

2635
02:26:32.771 --> 02:26:36.820
like I don't like cool when,
yeah,
when you get to like be 13 trillion,

2636
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:38.920
it's insurmountable,
right?

2637
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:43.000
I mean is 100,000 ampules in debt like I don't know what any of that shit looks

2638
02:26:43.001 --> 02:26:47.030
like.
Okay.
How is it that work again,
the federal reserves,

2639
02:26:47.130 --> 02:26:49.910
what is the Federal Reserve?
No,
nobody understands really.

2640
02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.960
I used to think they understood it until the crash and then I was like,
oh,

2641
02:26:52.961 --> 02:26:54.010
you guys don't get it either.

2642
02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:57.070
I got a bunch of their fucking a hundred dollar bills.
The old school,

2643
02:26:57.071 --> 02:26:59.650
little small head,
they smell or bills,
dude,

2644
02:26:59.651 --> 02:27:01.630
they're all in the Louisiana and that.
I'm thinking,

2645
02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:05.350
what is all the old ass money that's around here that's just buried and in

2646
02:27:05.351 --> 02:27:08.890
mattresses,
like those are mansions fucking everywhere.

2647
02:27:09.310 --> 02:27:11.530
At one point in time.
Is it worth anything?

2648
02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:15.640
Like when your money goes out of print,
like if you had some civil war era money,

2649
02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:16.690
it's not good anymore.

2650
02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:20.350
It's gotta be in real good shape if it's good cause I watch pawn wars.
Yeah,

2651
02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:22.390
but even then someone has to buy it,
you know what I'm saying?

2652
02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.720
It's not like you can go in the bank and go,
Hey,
can you give me $1 million?

2653
02:27:25.721 --> 02:27:26.050
Right.

2654
02:27:26.050 --> 02:27:30.580
This is my million dollars in 1919 no two like they had totally different money

2655
02:27:30.581 --> 02:27:34.060
back then.
It's weird.
The gold still has value in that way since it's like,

2656
02:27:34.090 --> 02:27:37.660
since it doesn't back in within anymore.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

2657
02:27:37.661 --> 02:27:41.740
What does it mean?
Well,
it's still good for things.
Conducting.
It's a gun.
Aki,

2658
02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:45.460
the Ohana knock.
It's good as a conductor,
it's good to,

2659
02:27:45.461 --> 02:27:48.490
if you want to have better looking teeth,
he could blink them up.

2660
02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:52.960
Do you ever thought of a rock and a gold right here and I was thinking of Dan

2661
02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:55.060
Platinum or shot right after the side.
Do you have any dope?

2662
02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:58.840
That'd be kind of pirate.
Like people are like,
oh,
your career would be fucked up.

2663
02:27:58.841 --> 02:28:02.320
I'm like,
Eh,
like as if looking like Cindy Crawford has ever been my career,

2664
02:28:02.321 --> 02:28:04.710
like being more fucked up looking.
Would it be bad?
I look at it,

2665
02:28:04.711 --> 02:28:07.840
I got a big old pumpkin head and tattoos everywhere.
Your career.

2666
02:28:07.930 --> 02:28:08.890
Isn't that hilarious.

2667
02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:12.430
People are so funny about what they think will and won't ruin your career.

2668
02:28:12.431 --> 02:28:14.260
Like they got it figured out.
I love that line.

2669
02:28:14.261 --> 02:28:17.920
Those that say that tell you how to do it and never did it.
Like there's so many.

2670
02:28:17.930 --> 02:28:20.020
It's such an uncharted territory.
The whole thing.

2671
02:28:20.021 --> 02:28:23.660
If you want to live a different,
then it's like get up,
go to work,
fucking go,

2672
02:28:23.690 --> 02:28:26.770
go back to get married,
go to church.
All that shit take.

2673
02:28:26.771 --> 02:28:28.930
You should go super crazy and gets impressed in plants.

2674
02:28:29.370 --> 02:28:33.260
My lady that I'm talking about,
she did.
Why would you even say that?

2675
02:28:33.261 --> 02:28:35.870
And that doesn't even this,
why would a man want,

2676
02:28:35.871 --> 02:28:37.850
cause he's so attracted to me already.
Yeah.

2677
02:28:37.970 --> 02:28:39.660
He wants you to be a woman that he wants me to.

2678
02:28:39.690 --> 02:28:44.420
He must have had a relationship with Tate.
You would be the woman?
No,

2679
02:28:44.890 --> 02:28:48.500
the most of my,
are you kidding me Brian?
We could prove that right now.

2680
02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:53.210
I don't know who you think's coming through the door to help you.
Well,

2681
02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:58.950
if you want to show off in front of Joe,
oh,
we all know,

2682
02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:04.090
we all know where you love lies.
Dog Tait Fletcher Fall,

2683
02:29:04.091 --> 02:29:06.700
Tate,
Twitter Tatum,

2684
02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:09.320
mess maximus on Twitter and a,

2685
02:29:09.321 --> 02:29:12.260
if people are in Santa Fe and they want to go to your gym,
what's The gym?

2686
02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:17.320
Undisputed Fitness and find that undisputed fitness.com or crossfit Santa fe.com

2687
02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:21.480
and look for Tate and on Friday night to Santa Fe.
Powerful 10 plans.
Did you?

2688
02:29:21.481 --> 02:29:24.710
To Santa Fe.
I saw Taten fright night.
It does a good goddamn movie.

2689
02:29:24.711 --> 02:29:27.510
That was a good was fun,
Huh?
Fun.
Good vampire movie.

2690
02:29:27.511 --> 02:29:30.740
It was like it was a real vampire and not some fucking pussy that can go outside

2691
02:29:30.741 --> 02:29:34.730
and sparkle.
I like that it was real dude.
But the big things coming up,

2692
02:29:34.731 --> 02:29:38.480
the dude that Arnold Schwarzenegger,
they just started doing a for expendables.

2693
02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:42.140
They did the trailer and he's called the last stand and there's a awesome,

2694
02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:45.370
there's some awesome shit that I did in there fucking wrecking myself.

2695
02:29:45.371 --> 02:29:47.300
But like it's fucking fun dude.

2696
02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:51.290
And that's in [inaudible] coming up in January?
No,
no,

2697
02:29:51.291 --> 02:29:54.650
they just did the trailer for it during the expendables.
Oh,
what is,

2698
02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:57.810
what does that name of that moving the last stand.
Oh yeah,
I heard about that.

2699
02:29:57.830 --> 02:30:02.090
Schwartz niggers come back to film.
Is it good?
Is it fun?
Is it was fun to do?

2700
02:30:02.091 --> 02:30:04.970
I don't.
Who knows what it looks like after they,
did you hang with him?
Yeah,

2701
02:30:04.971 --> 02:30:08.380
he was cool as shit dude.
He was funny as,
I mean he like,

2702
02:30:08.410 --> 02:30:11.780
he's got jokes about Maria,
he's like really?
Like he's in the bus,

2703
02:30:11.781 --> 02:30:15.590
we're filming the scene and the phone's supposed to ring and it's supposed to be

2704
02:30:15.591 --> 02:30:19.050
the terrorist.
Like my boss is supposed to be calling them and,

2705
02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:22.490
and they're rolling and I dunno dude,
when like the way I look at it,

2706
02:30:22.491 --> 02:30:26.750
like I'm nobody and like when they're like to have a shot fucked up because you

2707
02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:29.640
are,
it'd be like mortified,
you know,
he's there.
And their,

2708
02:30:29.641 --> 02:30:32.300
their role and they got it going and everything's going good and Dah,
Dah,
Dah,

2709
02:30:32.301 --> 02:30:36.620
Dah.
And the phone rings and he's,
he's like,
hello.
And uh,
he says,

2710
02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:39.710
Maria,
I told you to never call me here.
Was like right,

2711
02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:43.770
right in front of production on fit.
Like he's,
he's funny man.
He's a funny guy.

2712
02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:47.990
He's sensitive tension,
cool,
laid back,
just sets everybody at ease.

2713
02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:51.770
He eats in the cafeteria with like,
he's just a fucking cool guy,
man.

2714
02:30:51.860 --> 02:30:54.350
Well he's spanking house with me,

2715
02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:57.470
housekeepers and maids and shit on the regular.

2716
02:30:57.471 --> 02:31:00.530
I heard he was getting back together with the,
that's what I've heard.

2717
02:31:00.531 --> 02:31:02.900
I don't know,
but he's super kind,
man.

2718
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:05.970
I don't have a bad thing to say about that dude.
That's an,

2719
02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:09.500
he's an interesting cat,
that's for sure.
And all his people were super cool man.

2720
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:12.740
Yeah,
everybody was dope around and we were always definitive sperm.

2721
02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:17.660
This constantly something calming all the time.
All the time.

2722
02:31:17.661 --> 02:31:19.770
I'm calming,
calming,
calming.

2723
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.640
<v 0>They're either thought about,
I'm like,
what?
What do you call them?</v>

2724
02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:24.750
Like Mr Schwartzenegger Arnold,
the governor.

2725
02:31:24.751 --> 02:31:27.390
Like cause most people that are in office like they're the governor or the

2726
02:31:27.391 --> 02:31:31.320
president forever.
Right.
Then I'm like,
fuck that.
Anybody can be the governor.

2727
02:31:31.530 --> 02:31:34.950
Arnold is like,
that's a whole establishment unto itself,
man.

2728
02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:39.000
As a boss brand.
Oh,
certainly a brand new.
All right,

2729
02:31:39.001 --> 02:31:41.070
well tomorrow we've got Ian Edwards,
Ladies and gentlemen,

2730
02:31:41.071 --> 02:31:44.700
very funny comic from New York who's now living here in Los lace.

2731
02:31:44.910 --> 02:31:47.940
He will be with us tomorrow and a again this weekend.

2732
02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:51.760
I'm with the Duncan Trussell.
Joey Diaz is a no show though.

2733
02:31:51.761 --> 02:31:54.330
Some new thing came up that he had to do so he can't make it,

2734
02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:58.380
but you can find him mad flavor.
Contact him.

2735
02:31:58.470 --> 02:32:02.460
