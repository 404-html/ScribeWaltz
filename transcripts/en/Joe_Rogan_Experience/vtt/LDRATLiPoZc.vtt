00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches were,</v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've heard of these guys.</v>

3
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Astrophysicist John mattise and Daniel Whitmore from the University of Louisiana</v>

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>came up with a theory that said that something smaller than a Jovian mass would</v>

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>not be strong enough to perform this task.</v>

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>They believe that there's something up to 25% of them.</v>

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>It's four times as big as Jupiter could be responsible for sending these objects</v>

9
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:26.094
<v Speaker 1>and art direction.</v>

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>This is just a random theory that these guys put together.</v>

11
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't completely accepted what they're doing.</v>

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

13
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:31.651
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

14
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

15
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

16
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>there's no known such object what you,</v>

17
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>what people are doing,</v>

18
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>and I don't fault them for it.</v>

19
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:37.224
<v Speaker 1>It's creative.</v>

20
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>It would make awesome science fiction.</v>

21
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Storytelling is,</v>

22
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>there's something you need to explain here on earth.</v>

23
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Somebody went extinct.</v>

24
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>There were some wave of comets.</v>

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>There's some observation that was never repeated.</v>

26
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>There's some thing you got to come up with and so you say,</v>

27
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:52.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>we know the Oort cloud exists.</v>

29
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>We know you can perturb those orbits and,</v>

30
00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>and send them careening down towards the inner solar system and those,</v>

31
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>that Jupiter doesn't bat away like batting practice,</v>

32
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>those that get through Jupiter's gravitational shield could wreak havoc on</v>

33
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

34
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

37
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

38
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

39
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

40
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>it's inventing a lot to explain something you don't know.</v>

41
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>And so it's inventing more of what you don't know.</v>

42
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>That could be true to explain what you don't</v>

43
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>that which you don't have any other evidence to support.</v>

44
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's fun,</v>

45
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:29.574
<v Speaker 1>speculation,</v>

46
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.413
<v Speaker 1>fun speculation.</v>

47
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

48
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that to say,</v>

49
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.011
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

50
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:32.551
<v Speaker 1>it's real,</v>

51
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:33.331
<v Speaker 1>it must be happening.</v>

52
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

53
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.081
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

54
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just let someone write a good Scifi story on it.</v>

55
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's fun about it and this is why I bring it up.</v>

56
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>most people I've talked to this about this subject to many,</v>

58
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>many people and,</v>

59
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:45.061
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:45.301
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

61
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>myself personally,</v>

62
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm not immune to this.</v>

63
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I find it very fascinating.</v>

64
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.781
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

65
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>how much have I looked into the actual planets that we absolutely know are real?</v>

66
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.803
<v Speaker 1>Not that much,</v>

67
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>but I'm worried about this fucking fake planet that may or may not exist.</v>

68
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Do they might've found another planet.</v>

69
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's this idea of something hidden and mysterious,</v>

70
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>which is so compelling and attractive.</v>

71
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Eczema,</v>

72
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>fascinating psychological observation.</v>

73
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

74
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>We want to believe there's something mysterious that we don't understand and</v>

75
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.271
<v Speaker 1>could be there,</v>

76
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know anything about yet where there's plenty of things we do know</v>

77
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>something about,</v>

78
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>but we want to know more.</v>

79
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.353
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you help?</v>

80
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

81
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

82
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

83
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>the universe is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine.</v>

84
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

85
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>so to say,</v>

86
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I need your creativity and you know,</v>

87
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

89
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>to keep your life interesting.</v>

90
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.661
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

91
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:44.661
<v Speaker 1>we got black holes that are flaying stars layer by layer.</v>

92
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>We've got,</v>

93
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>do you realize that if you fall into a black hole,</v>

94
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you will see the entire future of the universe unfold in front of you in a</v>

95
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>matter of moments.</v>

96
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And you will emerge into another space time created by the singularity of the</v>

97
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>black hole you just fell into.</v>

98
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Just broke the internet,</v>

99
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.533
<v Speaker 1>broke the Hogan.</v>

100
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

101
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about that.</v>

102
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

103
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:05.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>why are we wasting time talking about whether the Saturn five rocket,</v>

106
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>cause we're fascinating to buy shit that's unproven,</v>

108
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>mysterious shit.</v>

109
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.601
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

110
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I got a broken brain.</v>

111
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.831
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for me.</v>

113
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
