1
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we live just like that.</v>

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like to man.</v>

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with George Perez and right</v>

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>when I was coming here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my neighbor right over here,</v>

5
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just told me there's some black suv</v>

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>drive it down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got battering rams,</v>

7
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>a black helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Jamie said there's swat crews.</v>

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Some shit's going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Perez A.</v>

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let people know you're in the era.</v>

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you have location services turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

11
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You've got to turn that shit off man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find you.</v>

12
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>They find you probably will find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably do.</v>

13
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>That's why Aria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that's why art should</v>

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went to a flip phone.</v>

15
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Has Gps on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want them tracking them.</v>

16
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Those mushroom drops and he leaves</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

17
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's something going on.</v>

18
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:53.781
<v Speaker 1>So while this podcast is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit is going on very close to us</v>

19
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in woodland hills.</v>

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in this area,</v>

22
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One eight.</v>

23
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 2>I was nervous coming over here because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the area.</v>

24
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.331
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been here since like</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 98.</v>

26
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 2>This is a fucked up area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

27
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 2>we used to sell speed to people</v>

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>received a</v>
<v Speaker 1>visit.</v>

29
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

30
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>don't turn right to not go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to go back to see</v>

31
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>what what you planted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

32
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>it's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's here.</v>

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Speed is a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

34
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>You know they had this statistic the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day on how many fucking people are</v>

35
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

36
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>She's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speed is just fucking speed.</v>

37
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a statistic that I posted</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday that's the most disturbing one</v>

38
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda.</v>

39
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Patrick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rhonda.</v>

40
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:42.111
<v Speaker 1>Patrick put it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more people on pain pills today.</v>

41
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Then use tobacco foc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

42
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>That's how crazy the pain pill business</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gone.</v>

43
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Think about all the dip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people that chew all the people</v>

44
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>that smoke cigars and cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that combined.</v>

45
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>There's more people on pain pills</v>

46
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's weird because they took</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes away from baseball.</v>

47
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Remember the use of smoke in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties?</v>

48
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 2>You could smoke in baseball and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could dip.</v>

49
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember you could dip.</v>

50
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Can't dip anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

51
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

52
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about professional.</v>

53
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I know you can't dip in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but days to smoke cigarettes in the</v>

54
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 2>games in the dugouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

55
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And I only know because sometimes I stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>up late and watch espn and I'm like,</v>

56
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could smoke back then.</v>

57
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>So you watch like an old game and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll show him still smoking.</v>

58
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.450
<v Speaker 2>It was like espn has classics and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a classics like world series and I</v>

59
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 2>think it was Reggie Jackson smoking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dug out.</v>

60
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that right there.</v>

61
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

62
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Joy's a dugout cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What years that from?</v>

63
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Jamie says 1987.</v>

64
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 87 game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 2>They used to smoke cigarettes and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>spit.</v>

66
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Always chewing and spitting and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're popping pills and getting</v>

67
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 2>concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they definitely are popping pills</v>

68
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another big problem.</v>

69
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Adderall is a big problem with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball.</v>

70
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>It helps them focus and concentrate on</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting the ball better.</v>

71
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 2>That's just fucking crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they prescribe you speed to get</v>

72
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:11.971
<v Speaker 2>smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It accelerates well for apparently when</v>

73
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.060
<v Speaker 2>who's does that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that mean that's not a thought?</v>

74
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 2>A Dang somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

75
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

76
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>when you have add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is real debatable whether or not</v>

77
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>that shit's real or how many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

78
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it just people with energy?</v>

79
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Is it just people were bored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to concentrate on</v>

80
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck you want them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on.</v>

81
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know what add really is</v>

82
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's severely obese over</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribed by everyone's measures.</v>

83
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 2>But when you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you give them speed,</v>

84
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 2>it helps them calm down somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

85
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems it must be like a,</v>

86
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>a focus speed they give or like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>special something they found in there</v>

87
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 2>because I'm back in my days and I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

88
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't focus on shit.</v>

89
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's because you don't have it</v>
<v Speaker 2>though because you don't have add</v>

90
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if add doesn't exist and maybe it's</v>

91
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 2>just something that makes everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus.</v>

92
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Well I think add most likely is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of behaviors.</v>

93
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different ways people</v>
<v Speaker 2>behave and there's a bunch of ways their</v>

94
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.811
<v Speaker 2>mind works and some people they like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay calm and focus on one thing and be</v>

95
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 2>like peace and quiet and other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are scattered as fuck and they're</v>

96
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 2>thinking about a million different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and they can't concentrate speed</v>

97
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 2>apparently for those people helps them</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate.</v>

98
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>But the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone is like,</v>

99
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I had a next door neighbor and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this next door neighbor,</v>

100
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 2>his kid was just a regular fucking kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they put the kid on Prozac.</v>

101
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

102
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:47.971
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

103
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 2>you can't concentrate.</v>

104
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's all over the place.</v>

105
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:51.251
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 2>we put them on and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even talk to the dude.</v>

107
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

108
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 2>You're medicating a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like an eight or nine year old</v>

109
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a fucking kid.</v>

110
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Most kids when they go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to pay attention to</v>

111
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck the teacher's talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

112
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

113
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 2>I woulda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I woulda got prescribed.</v>

114
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Or was that district called diagnosed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got diagnosed as kindergarten.</v>

115
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would have to for sure if I</v>

116
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 2>had that guy for a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely would have put me on some</v>

117
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

118
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I heard of</v>
<v Speaker 2>add,</v>

119
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>like I thought it was a gang and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

120
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>can we get along with those foods?</v>

121
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

122
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>foe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a focusing shit.</v>

123
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

124
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A focusing shit.</v>

125
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>So the kind of speed that you would sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people out here,</v>

126
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.130
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of speed was at back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>

127
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>They used to be called crank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember?</v>

128
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Do remember crying?</v>

129
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think crank is just like the best part</v>

130
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>of the strict nine because it's made out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

131
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Am I right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best part of.</v>

132
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we used to sell the peanut butter</v>

133
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a peanut butter one.</v>

134
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was weird because like back in those</v>

135
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed had a taste that was just awful.</v>

136
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 2>It was like rotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cactus cooler.</v>

137
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what it tasted like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a rotten cactus cooler.</v>

138
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 2>You ever left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cactus cooler out.</v>

139
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

140
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was made with a peanut butter taste.</v>

141
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 2>That was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't remember who we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting it from.</v>

143
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 2>I just remember the guy going</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] we used to hit it out of a</v>

144
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 2>bong so it was due.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were crazy.</v>

145
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this shit.</v>

146
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Tastes like peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

147
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I started focusing on peanut butter</v>
<v Speaker 2>sandwiches.</v>

148
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 2>You focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so bizarre.</v>

149
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you would do that back then,</v>

150
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to like how,</v>

151
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 2>how do you get into the speed business?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd have to find somebody who's</v>

152
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 2>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

156
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 2>like a crazy one and then it just got me</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved and be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's just pretty where a guy will be</v>

165
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pay for whatever you want and she's</v>

<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

167
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm just happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the first one and I got out.</v>

168
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird one.</v>

169
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people that are on speed,</v>

170
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I hung out with a dude recently that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>on speed.</v>

171
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want him and he was on speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could tell because he would do</v>

172
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:37.090
<v Speaker 2>things like he was saying that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to him.</v>

173
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 2>He turned like real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of collect themselves and turn real</v>

174
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 2>quick and like why we were meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of my buddies were like,</v>

175
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 2>why is he moving so fast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then trying to calm himself down and</v>

176
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 2>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was driving us and when he was</v>

177
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>driving he would make like these quick</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns.</v>

178
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm incorrect trying to calm himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy's on fucking speed,</v>

179
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going on as if he made a move and then</v>

180
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 2>he looked at shoe to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

181
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:02.091
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on it.</v>

182
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:02.924
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

183
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't look at the way he was</v>

184
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 2>turning it was like he heard a loud</v>
<v Speaker 2>noise,</v>

185
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.440
<v Speaker 2>like a for everything he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All your senses are up,</v>

186
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 2>senses are up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're alert to anything and everything.</v>

187
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 2>It's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

188
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Hitler gave it to his troops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

189
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

190
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 2>They say he invented it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true.</v>

191
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was invented during that</v>

192
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was Hitler.</v>

193
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Hitler was in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got it.</v>

194
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 2>That's why as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just so little results.</v>

195
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I've got to keep this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean.</v>

196
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they invented it during that</v>

197
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 2>era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

198
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I know they gave it to the kamikaze is</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

199
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.970
<v Speaker 2>That's how they got the kamikaze is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly those planes into battle ships.</v>

200
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 2>They would just jacked up on math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

201
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little math speed,</v>

202
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is just,</v>

203
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 2>just those accelerants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those things that just they fuck</v>

204
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.144
<v Speaker 2>with your judgment.</v>

205
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was Gq.</v>

206
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this article about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was a lawyer and he was this</v>

207
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 2>real successful lawyer and he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved somehow or another with a</v>

208
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 2>client that was a meth dealer and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden he starts getting</v>

209
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 2>into the math business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just realized there's a lot of</v>

210
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 2>fucking money in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

211
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I guess he started doing meth and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started selling math and then one of</v>

212
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 2>the things they say is when you do a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Meth,</v>

213
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 2>you start making like really poor</v>
<v Speaker 2>judgement calls.</v>

214
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:31.021
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

215
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 2>this is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fine.</v>

216
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 2>This is going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he started a stockpile and meth in</v>

217
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 2>his fucking basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just stank and like as he opened</v>

218
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 2>the door to his basement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

219
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is down?</v>

220
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 2>They're just big paint buckets filled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with math everywhere and that that can</v>

221
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 2>burn your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll like jack you up.</v>

222
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 2>If you put it on your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will burn through it within an hour.</v>

223
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

224
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 2>That's why those guys have those day</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch it when they cut it up and then</v>

225
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 2>they touch their face and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get those holes in their face.</v>

226
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I thought they started itching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they would start scratching</v>

227
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 2>themselves right now it's the touch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the touch becomes the crater of the</v>

228
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:08.270
<v Speaker 2>pimple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they start picking up that.</v>

229
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy he'd walk around with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>bandaids everywhere.</v>

230
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

231
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:14.730

<v Speaker 2>you need to chill.</v>

232
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 2>So this girl was all hopped up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craig's mom,</v>

233
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.060
<v Speaker 2>the girl when you were 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what's weird about speed is?</v>

250
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in prison,</v>

251
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 2>you could tell that these people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>still tweakers because you know how you</v>

<v Speaker 2>because you're spinning it.</v>

274
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.900

<v Speaker 2>still wanting to know in prison.</v>

275
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Two years out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

276
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feening it.</v>

277
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feening couldn't wait.</v>

278
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a guy that just can't get it.</v>

279
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he's gotten sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just can't get it.</v>

280
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of those guys.</v>

281
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean like there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go to prison,</v>

282
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 2>they're not druggies because to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>druggie and prison is to be looked</v>

283
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:24.820
<v Speaker 2>frowned upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're a man in there and when you're</v>

284
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 2>in there you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

285
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be strong.</v>

286
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 2>And then when you get out it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>temptation.</v>

287
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 2>You're good looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're healthy again.</v>

288
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 2>You're getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the weird part of prison.</v>

289
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.140
<v Speaker 2>So most of the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

290
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.170
<v Speaker 2>when a guy's a junkie and he goes into</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison,</v>

291
00:12:40.171 --> 00:12:43.150
<v Speaker 2>did they try to clean up or they try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it while you have to clean up?</v>

292
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't clean up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to call you a Jay cat.</v>

293
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 2>A Jay cat is like equivalent of a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in prison,</v>

294
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 2>if you're a Jay cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get picked on.</v>

295
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 2>People are going to laugh at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to like,</v>

296
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 2>you want to be clean and healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

297
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because that's</v>

298
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 2>contrary to what a lot of people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about prison.</v>

299
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.461
<v Speaker 2>They would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>you go to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gave up hope and now you just let</v>

301
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:09.610
<v Speaker 2>yourself go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's what you think because</v>

302
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:11.020
<v Speaker 2>you're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're in there,</v>

303
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>you notice people look at you and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want people to like ice look at falls on</v>

304
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 2>drugs and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking dude.</v>

305
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.680
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Here's the soap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't got money because</v>

307
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 2>you're wasting it on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a soup.</v>

308
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be that guy that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

309
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He takes care of himself.</v>

311
00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a man of his word and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want is when you get out,</v>

312
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like one of the bigger</v>

313
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 2>misconceptions about prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you talk to people that</v>

314
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 2>haven't been to prison that don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about prison,</v>

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 3>you would have been a butcher too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we would get up at 4:00,</v>

350
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 3>take a shower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean our room,</v>

351
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 3>clean ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd go to work,</v>

352
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 3>come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then eat with our people quarter yard,</v>

353
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 3>fuck around for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find a cigarette or something.</v>

354
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Go back to yard and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back to the cell.</v>

355
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it,</v>

356
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a program,</v>

357
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 3>another life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

358
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I took college courses in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

359
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I was a janitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

360
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can just sit back and be like,</v>

361
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I miss it.</v>

362
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I wish I was on the yard</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out with these guys and playing</v>

363
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 3>basketball because the camaraderie of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

364
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.630
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just awesome.</v>

365
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was fun sometimes.</v>

366
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

367
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 3>it was fun until like 12:00 hit or 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>

368
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:03.591
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

369
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:05.690
<v Speaker 3>I want to go do a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me the fuck Outta here.</v>

370
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm just like,</v>

371
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I can't go home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't go home.</v>

372
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.010
<v Speaker 3>I can't go home.</v>

373
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 3>And then my last prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a park like 50 yards away from</v>

374
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:16.780
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're just looking out the window.</v>

375
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.451
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

376
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I want to go play the catch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

377
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was moments.</v>

378
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately the big thing is the lack</v>

379
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:27.330
<v Speaker 3>of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

380
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 3>you can have fun while you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't choose what you can do.</v>

381
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

382
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Lack of freedom and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison cops are completely different</v>

383
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.380
<v Speaker 3>from cops on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're called correction officers and</v>

384
00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 3>in there there's a respect like when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see you,</v>

385
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:42.741
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good morning,</v>

386
00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 3>how you doing today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody gets a good morning and if you</v>

387
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're fucking up his program to make</v>

388
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 3>them go out of his way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your fault.</v>

389
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.340
<v Speaker 3>But if he wants to be tested then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to do what you gotta do.</v>

390
00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.680
<v Speaker 3>If he wants to be tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>

391
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.400
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

392
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.050
<v Speaker 3>there's these cops that go in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

393
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.420
<v Speaker 3>they've had a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

394
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see why racism exist in prison</v>

395
00:17:07.301 --> 00:17:10.690
<v Speaker 3>because maybe there's this cop that came</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Solidad and now he's going to</v>

396
00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:11.850
<v Speaker 3>another prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he held,</v>

397
00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:15.130
<v Speaker 3>the reason you left solid dad is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the Mexicans jumped his ass.</v>

398
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.550
<v Speaker 3>So he's going to have a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

399
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.160
<v Speaker 3>All right motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got me over there?</v>

400
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

401
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.810
<v Speaker 3>They transfer them like that and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you don't jump in,</v>

402
00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I've seen cops talk shit on other cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all fuck that fool.</v>

403
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:30.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do shit.</v>

404
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it looks a lot like prisoners in some</v>

405
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:34.870
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

406
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.350
<v Speaker 3>they are too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're there 18 hours a day or</v>

407
00:17:38.351 --> 00:17:40.690
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mean they just get to go home.</v>

408
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.520
<v Speaker 3>They do that long as shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

409
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:43.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a 12 hour shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

410
00:17:43.871 --> 00:17:48.370
<v Speaker 3>They do such a long shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their union and they get a lot of</v>

411
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they only work four days</v>

412
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.080
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

413
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 2>That's probably better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably rather work 12 hours a day,</v>

414
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:58.680
<v Speaker 2>four days a week than eight hours a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and five day and Kevin a whole extra day</v>

415
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 2>to do whatever the fuck you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you feel like your day's kind of</v>

416
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 2>wrecked anyway when you work eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

417
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:06.810
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get anything in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a construction worker</v>

418
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 2>before this and I hated that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before comedy,</v>

419
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I did construction when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My my stepfather was an architect,</v>

420
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 2>so I got a lot of jobs on USS Cole</v>
<v Speaker 2>construction sites and I just remember</v>

421
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 2>being exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing that I remember most.</v>

422
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Was it like residential housing tracks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it was residential,</v>

423
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:28.870
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally we would do like we did</v>
<v Speaker 2>a knights of Columbus Hall,</v>

424
00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working with my friend Jimmy and</v>

425
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

426
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 2>his boss.</v>

427
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 2>It was a different construction company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was the hardest job I've ever</v>

428
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 2>had in my life because all I did the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole summer was a.</v>

429
00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only survived for a couple of weeks.</v>

430
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

431
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was carrying cement bags and pressure,</v>

432
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 2>treated lumber all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 that I remember.</v>

433
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking that was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivating because I was thinking like,</v>

434
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.710
<v Speaker 2>this is not gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't do this for my life.</v>

435
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 19.</v>

436
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.700
<v Speaker 2>You're at the peak of your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.070
<v Speaker 2>and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was in the summer so it was hot,</v>

438
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Boston.</v>

439
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:05.460
<v Speaker 2>So it was muggy bald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

440
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have a shaved head or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

441
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 2>not back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

442
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Because the sun beats you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

443
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a beautiful head of hair back then.</v>

444
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 2>How's was lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm all day carrying bags of cement</v>

445
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 2>and pressure treated lumber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is heavy as fuck.</v>

446
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd get these splinters in</v>

447
00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 2>your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get all infected because the</v>

448
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.280
<v Speaker 2>pressure treated lumber has some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals in it.</v>

449
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has like a something.</v>

450
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 2>So the board doesn't bend because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>board bends with the sun.</v>

451
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brutal.</v>

452
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 2>But I remember thinking this is a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesson because now because I used to</v>

453
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 2>think God just get a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work all day.</v>

454
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Then after work I'll do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck I want to do.</v>

455
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.850
<v Speaker 2>But I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

456
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.770
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to have any fucking</v>

457
00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna have any energy.</v>

458
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be a cement finisher.</v>

459
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.400
<v Speaker 2>That was some shit we used to do curb</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gutter,</v>

460
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 2>but we do it out of a machine.</v>

461
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 2>You've ever seen those current machines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

462
00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:58.500
<v Speaker 2>it was a good Maaco remember at $1,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to poor 40 fucking trucks a day.</v>

463
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

509
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you back someone in at the park,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is how I used to think back.</v>

517
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Then Joe,</v>

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean I'm sorry,</v>

523
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've gone up four or five times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

542
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be a comic and a,</v>

543
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a good break.</v>

544
00:23:25.331 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good guy,</v>

545
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 3>man picked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

546
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:28.780
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're my new opener.</v>

547
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

548
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:32.800
<v Speaker 3>So I was like four months in the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm doing the Improv.</v>

549
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Not even knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like talking to the crowd and</v>

550
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:39.720
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm probably like the best salesman</v>

551
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.960
<v Speaker 3>making people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm doing now.</v>

552
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know jokes yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying them.</v>

553
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.890
<v Speaker 3>Then I get jokes and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at roasting and MTV,</v>

554
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 3>your Mama comes out and I get picked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that show and I win my first</v>

555
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 3>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking guy that I beat up sees me on TV</v>

556
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

557
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 3>she had cash money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole God's money.</v>

558
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.220
<v Speaker 3>So this is the crazy part is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

559
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a statute of limitations and all</v>

560
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:11.600
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since it's a John Doe crime,</v>

561
00:24:11.601 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know who beats you up,</v>

562
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:20.150
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a limited restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So until they find out who beat you up,</v>

563
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 3>then the statute of limitations case in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

564
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 3>That's how horrible my lawyer was.</v>

565
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems crazy.</v>

566
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 3>So if you beat somebody up 50 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just found out your name,</v>

567
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.430
<v Speaker 3>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could still sue you or take you to</v>

568
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:35.264
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

569
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think it's,</v>

570
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably like five.</v>

571
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 3>So what year is this when this is all</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on?</v>

572
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>2,000?</v>

573

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is 2000.</v>

574
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:49.160

575
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 3>because my brother bailed me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still filming an MTV.</v>

576
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my brother bells me out.</v>

577
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.031

579
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

580
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.980
<v Speaker 3>I remember just going to court who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just that whole like,</v>

581
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped.</v>

582
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm not you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They offered me eight years.</v>

583
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it,</v>

584
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 3>take eight years because he has a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodily injury.</v>

585
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.560
<v Speaker 3>This guy that I beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a metal plate and he's all fucked</v>

586
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 3>up and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take eight years.</v>

587
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:22.130
<v Speaker 3>And I was like a metal plate in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheek.</v>

588
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

589
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Orbital fracture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

590
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot of those.</v>

591
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

592
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I caught them good.</v>

593
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Like I think I caught them like just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

594
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff around the eyes breaks</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty easy.</v>

595
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

596
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Orbital stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super common in mma especially.</v>

597
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.120
<v Speaker 3>It was weird because they were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say I used a weapon.</v>

598
00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:45.860
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way you could have done that.</v>

599
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:46.450
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

600
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 3>he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

601
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't use a weapon.</v>

602
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 3>So I bail out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a comic.</v>

603
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Being a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to win this case.</v>

604
00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:57.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the funny part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I was like,</v>

605
00:25:57.801 --> 00:25:58.840
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody was there.</v>

606
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.790
<v Speaker 3>Nobody seen me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I have to admit that you beat</v>

607
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 3>him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

608
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.010
<v Speaker 3>See I couldn't even take the stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I already knew if I take the</v>

609
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 3>stand that makes me look like a snitch</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to go into prison.</v>

610
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:15.230
<v Speaker 3>So if you take the stand and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight and makes you look like a</v>

611
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:16.280
<v Speaker 3>snitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

612
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:18.620
<v Speaker 3>Because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started it.</v>

613
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 3>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the,</v>

614
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the politics of I had to accept the</v>

615
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 3>fact where I was coming from and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the punishment that was like when I</v>

616
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 3>started realizing in my head like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright dog,</v>

617
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.730
<v Speaker 3>you chose this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you have to accept this.</v>

618
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

619
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:34.730
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

620
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:36.080
<v Speaker 3>rats and mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get away with it.</v>

621
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.870
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't take the stand and they're</v>

622
00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 3>last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

623
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Well if you did take the stand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

624
00:26:42.661 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 3>what could you possibly have said you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

625
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I think I would have incriminated myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>

626
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean in my head I remember like</v>

627
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've never been to court so when you</v>

628
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:59.210
<v Speaker 3>go to court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they assign a jury and when you go</v>

629
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 3>they give you like a lunch break and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go eat my stupid ass when and ate like</v>

630
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 3>where the jury was eating and I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell the way they're looking at me</v>

631
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:08.010
<v Speaker 3>because I'm in a suit and I go to Burger</v>
<v Speaker 3>King,</v>

632
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 3>I take my suit off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like fuck this,</v>

633
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm all tatted up now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look at this guy,</v>

634
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they just threw judgment on me and</v>

635
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I remember my brother telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you looked like you had no remorse.</v>

636
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 3>You were in there laughing and court and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

637
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

638
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

639
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's court cases.</v>

640
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine it would be so difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>to because no one wants to do fucking</v>

641
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:32.964
<v Speaker 3>jury duty.</v>

642
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 3>I got my friend Andreas Antonopoulos was</v>
<v Speaker 3>here the other day,</v>

643
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:39.960
<v Speaker 3>was talking about how he got out of jury</v>
<v Speaker 3>duty by just explaining how much he</v>

644
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:42.990
<v Speaker 3>knows about the judicial system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how corrupt he thinks it is and how</v>

645
00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:45.060
<v Speaker 3>fucked up he thinks it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

646
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 3>get outta here out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to do jury duty.</v>

647
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.190
<v Speaker 3>If you like your job and you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that you enjoy now you're</v>

648
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 3>going to spend eight hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

649
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.070
<v Speaker 3>trying to deliberate and figure out why</v>
<v Speaker 3>people make such quick judgements.</v>

650
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a terrible way to decide</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not someone's guilty or</v>

651
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:03.030
<v Speaker 3>innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

652
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:05.940
<v Speaker 3>you're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's weird because like the jury,</v>

653
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they wanted it.</v>

654
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 3>It was a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like an ex cop and I was like,</v>

655
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.140
<v Speaker 3>why did you let this ex cop get on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>panel?</v>

656
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm already guilty because of my look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

657
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

658
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like imagine if these cops that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting people the whole panels.</v>

659
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

660
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 3>That'd be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

661
00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:30.090
<v Speaker 3>A good luck</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So now I'm out,</v>

664
00:28:34.411 --> 00:28:36.090

<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

665
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz calls me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

666
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.500
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do showtime comedy slam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

667
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets me off my ass all comedy slim.</v>

668
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get on showtime.</v>

669
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a comedy central.</v>

670
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:55.020
<v Speaker 3>I did like a sketch comedy and then I go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to court bone.</v>

671
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.033
<v Speaker 3>I lose</v>

672
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't usually when you lose they</v>
<v Speaker 3>let you go home.</v>

673
00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:01.130
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll come back.</v>

674
00:29:01.131 --> 00:29:04.910
<v Speaker 3>But since I was a high risk inmate now</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took me right there,</v>

675
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.300
<v Speaker 3>like from court in a suit straight to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the holding tank.</v>

676
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

677
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 3>that was a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

678
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.010
<v Speaker 3>And my showtime hasn't even come out</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

679
00:29:16.011 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't even seen this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like everything I've worked for</v>

680
00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.510
<v Speaker 3>got took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I looked at it at that time.</v>

681
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I won't forget that day I walked down</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

682
00:29:25.611 --> 00:29:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I had his fucking suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever everybody looking at me like,</v>

683
00:29:28.971 --> 00:29:30.320
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a baller.</v>

684
00:29:30.321 --> 00:29:30.950
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

685
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I just lost my case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't on the street.</v>

686
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.430
<v Speaker 3>And then from there you go to the county</v>
<v Speaker 3>because now they got to give you a</v>

687
00:29:37.431 --> 00:29:39.900
<v Speaker 3>sentencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The judge has to come up with a</v>

688
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 3>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kind of familiar with this.</v>

689
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>a month in the county jail,</v>

690
00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.240
<v Speaker 3>a riot breaks out.</v>

691
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Now I have to involve myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know where I'm at,</v>

692
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.070
<v Speaker 3>I know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now they put me in the hole and I got</v>

693
00:29:59.071 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 3>to go to court to get sentenced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to involve yourself.</v>

694
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Meaning you have to pick a side,</v>

<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I was just like Oh my God.</v>

812
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.280
<v Speaker 3>And in my head I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you only do half time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So I'm gonna get out year and a half</v>

<v Speaker 3>good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somebody got hurt.</v>

815
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.353
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

816
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:57.290
<v Speaker 3>So boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit Wasco while skulls or reception</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bakersfield,</v>

819
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:10.200
<v Speaker 3>and I think some part of Riverside they</v>
<v Speaker 3>send you to that yard for reception.</v>

820
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 3>It's where you for 90 days you're on</v>
<v Speaker 3>lockdown,</v>

821
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 3>23 hour lockdown and you only get like</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour of day room and they're</v>

822
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:21.210
<v Speaker 3>evaluating you to see how you act with</v>
<v Speaker 3>other inmates.</v>

823
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Where are they going to put you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they're going to put you on a level</v>

824
00:36:23.131 --> 00:36:24.750
<v Speaker 3>four yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A level three yard.</v>

825
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:25.710
<v Speaker 3>I love a two yard.</v>

826
00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you don't want to level four?</v>

827
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Level three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two is now give me the difference.</v>

828
00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:38.020
<v Speaker 3>A level four yard is for people that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of points like violent crime.</v>

829
00:36:39.201 --> 00:36:39.741
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

830
00:36:39.741 --> 00:36:42.650
<v Speaker 3>he's in here for carjacking kidnapping</v>
<v Speaker 3>on all that.</v>

831
00:36:42.651 --> 00:36:46.150
<v Speaker 3>You're going on to level four yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be on a 23 hour lockdown</v>

832
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.260
<v Speaker 3>and you're there with killers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lifers,</v>

833
00:36:48.261 --> 00:36:53.261
<v Speaker 3>people doing 10 to 15 to 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A level three yard is the same thing,</v>

834
00:36:53.901 --> 00:36:55.960
<v Speaker 3>but your programming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting your own.</v>

835
00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 3>It goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes down,</v>

836
00:36:58.161 --> 00:37:01.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a level two yard where it's</v>

837
00:37:01.281 --> 00:37:01.611
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

838
00:37:01.611 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 3>this guy got three years left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

839
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.100
<v Speaker 3>we try to get them an outside job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little more money and then level one</v>

840
00:37:07.101 --> 00:37:10.460
<v Speaker 3>yard is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go walk around in sandals.</v>

841
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been on that.</v>

842
00:37:11.811 --> 00:37:16.811
<v Speaker 3>I heard you go walk around in sandals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a microwave in the day room has</v>

843
00:37:17.271 --> 00:37:20.030
<v Speaker 3>an ice machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that for like white collar</v>

844
00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:21.500
<v Speaker 3>crime?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

845
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:26.590
<v Speaker 3>a level one yard would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's been locked up for 10 years</v>

846
00:37:28.361 --> 00:37:29.950
<v Speaker 3>on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going home.</v>

847
00:37:29.951 --> 00:37:33.790
<v Speaker 3>He's done all nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One year left permanent level one yard</v>

848
00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.380
<v Speaker 3>because he's proven he can program as</v>
<v Speaker 3>long as you're not causing problems.</v>

849
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:44.380
<v Speaker 3>The point system makes you drop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's from one to 17 is level one</v>

850
00:37:44.381 --> 00:37:49.381
<v Speaker 3>yard and 17 to 32 is a level two yard</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 32 to 40 something or is a level</v>

851
00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.330
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it goes far enough up to life.</v>

852
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

853
00:37:56.391 --> 00:37:59.650
<v Speaker 3>I knew buddies that were like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many points you got to go?</v>

854
00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky I'm going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

855
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.760
<v Speaker 3>They sent me to a level two yard after I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on a three yard.</v>

856
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Now he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

857
00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Like these inmates treated like you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to a level two.</v>

858
00:38:10.691 --> 00:38:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause they're like,</v>

859
00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:16.540
<v Speaker 3>you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have a TV in your cell.</v>

860
00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:17.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

861
00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like a heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

862
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The food's better.</v>

863
00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much shit about prison.</v>

864
00:38:27.221 --> 00:38:28.630

<v Speaker 3>I miss food now in there.</v>

865
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.520
<v Speaker 3>You miss food in prison.</v>

866
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:34.930
<v Speaker 3>What kind of food did you get in prison?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to make food spreads and I</v>

867
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.400
<v Speaker 3>worked in the butcher shop so I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>sneak meat in my socks.</v>

868
00:38:38.401 --> 00:38:41.200
<v Speaker 3>I'd wrap it up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Saran wrap and I'd put it in my</v>

869
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 3>boots and this boot I had big old</v>
<v Speaker 3>firemen,</v>

870
00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:49.231
<v Speaker 3>boots and I would fit to like two</v>
<v Speaker 3>sandwiches in each booth.</v>

871
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.070
<v Speaker 3>And that's like eight bucks in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking nuts.</v>

872
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Money,</v>

873
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 3>cents an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'd bring it back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This time I'm living in a dorm hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>man dorm and we will bring it back and</v>

<v Speaker 3>my people,</v>

876
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.150

<v Speaker 3>Everyone would have a job.</v>

877
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:09.820
<v Speaker 3>I already dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't got nothing to pitch in but I'll</v>

<v Speaker 3>prepare the food and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll clean all the dishes are done.</v>

00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:25.660
<v Speaker 3>We put like a big piece of paper and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know what we're doing.</v>

893
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.240
<v Speaker 3>So they don't have a problem with it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

894
00:39:56.330 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 3>As long as what I noticed in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't want no one to overdose</v>

895
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.170
<v Speaker 3>or fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

896
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.140
<v Speaker 3>I remember this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

897
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:10.070
<v Speaker 3>we're not a lot of talk to guards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could hear them talking to each other.</v>

898
00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:11.600
<v Speaker 3>This one guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

899
00:40:11.601 --> 00:40:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I hate my job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the fucking most overpriced</v>

900
00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:17.660
<v Speaker 3>babysitter in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I have to do is make sure these guys</v>

901
00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:20.120
<v Speaker 3>don't kill each other and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting here for killing each other.</v>

902
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

903
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.260
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty crazy.</v>

904
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.320
<v Speaker 3>And what did you cook it on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

905
00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:30.800
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good idea.</v>

906
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good question.</v>

907
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:32.743
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

908
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:37.380
<v Speaker 3>we get this thing called a stinger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's so many brilliant like</v>

909
00:40:37.381 --> 00:40:41.120
<v Speaker 3>inventions people make in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy would get a cord for the radio,</v>

910
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.390
<v Speaker 3>cut it in half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a metal piece and connect like some</v>

911
00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:47.990
<v Speaker 3>we'd make like this thing and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>plug it into the wall,</v>

912
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.410
<v Speaker 3>drop it into like a five gallon water</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucket,</v>

913
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.370
<v Speaker 3>like those buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we put all the food in a</v>

914
00:40:55.371 --> 00:40:57.530
<v Speaker 3>plastic bags so the water wouldn't hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

915
00:40:57.531 --> 00:41:00.800
<v Speaker 3>but it would steam cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we would cook.</v>

916
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was even by size that can make</v>

917
00:41:04.401 --> 00:41:07.700
<v Speaker 3>grills like because there's a metal shop</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>

918
00:41:07.701 --> 00:41:08.950
<v Speaker 3>like you work metal</v>

919
00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.350
<v Speaker 3>us as prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the prison doesn't call plumbing to</v>

920
00:41:15.351 --> 00:41:17.660
<v Speaker 3>fix the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have our own plumbing crews,</v>

921
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.930
<v Speaker 3>like inmates are plumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inmates are everything.</v>

922
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:25.931
<v Speaker 3>So we learned to fix all this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when it's there you're like</v>

<v Speaker 3>So where we were at,</v>

925
00:41:32.601 --> 00:41:36.380
<v Speaker 3>they had those heaters that are metal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get your bread and you put it in</v>

926
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:39.720
<v Speaker 3>the Brown bag and you just put it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and 20 minutes later to Melton and</v>

927
00:41:39.721 --> 00:41:42.200
<v Speaker 3>it is a grilled cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

928
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 3>What is the fine art of cooking in</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison?</v>

929
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 3>What is this champion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to find out the Stinger.</v>

930
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.340

<v Speaker 3>but this is a better picture of.</v>

931
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:50.181
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:53.740
<v Speaker 3>So he's got wires attached to toenail</v>
<v Speaker 3>clippers.</v>

933
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.190
<v Speaker 3>That's another way to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the toenail clippers get get hot</v>

934
00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.960
<v Speaker 3>electrified and they boiled the ramen</v>
<v Speaker 3>noodles.</v>

935
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 3>The Stinger is the one on the far left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one right there.</v>

936
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 3>You see how it's in there and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did it,</v>

937
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:09.980
<v Speaker 3>but we did it with the five gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

938
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lowery's is addressing right sauce.</v>

940
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would pick a spice route.</v>

941
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:23.020
<v Speaker 3>He would get the spice and he would put</v>
<v Speaker 3>water in it and he would plug it into</v>

942
00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:27.510
<v Speaker 3>the fucking wall for somehow and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>little spring,</v>

943
00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:32.511
<v Speaker 3>like spring with light up like and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's isolated cigarettes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>A lighter</v>

947
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 3>where they make their own tattoo guns</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

948
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.710
<v Speaker 3>That's all my tattoos are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent of my tattoos are from</v>

949
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:47.060
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

950
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Now is that legal in prison?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

951
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.091
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

952
00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:53.880
<v Speaker 3>because that's how you get infections</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

953
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.580
<v Speaker 3>That's the other big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

957
00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Like hepatitis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

958
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Hepatitis is huge because everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharing needles,</v>

959
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 3>but no one does that really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get your own needle and you</v>

960
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:14.880
<v Speaker 3>take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have my,</v>

961
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.670

<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

962
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your same tattoo needle and did you make</v>

963

<v Speaker 3>guitar string is what they use,</v>

965
00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:28.340
<v Speaker 3>but that's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you see how this is way thicker.</v>

966
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:33.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the guitar string and not hurt</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is more of like we use like the</v>

967
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:38.030
<v Speaker 3>wire because wire brush on the brooms so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just take the little things off and</v>

968
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 3>sharpen them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanitize it.</v>

969
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

970
00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Like how are they doing a tattoo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is tapping the ink in it?</v>

971
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.440
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it by hand.</v>

972
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a,</v>

973
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:55.510
<v Speaker 3>a motor from a Walkman or like a Walkman</v>
<v Speaker 3>in prison tapes and cds or there's no</v>

974
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:57.020
<v Speaker 3>fucking downloads in there.</v>

975
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 3>you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>cassette tape because that same presence</v>

976
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.160
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have the beastie boys and I</v>

977
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 3>sold that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave it to my boy and I laughed.</v>

978
00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

979
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 3>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like fucking being locked</v>

980
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 3>up in American pickers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like old technologies existing hardcore</v>

981
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:14.990
<v Speaker 3>in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

982
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.890
<v Speaker 3>And so Walkman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the Walkman messes up,</v>

983
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:23.891
<v Speaker 3>they take the motor out and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it like there's just like the shop,</v>

984
00:44:23.991 --> 00:44:26.510
<v Speaker 3>they got a little gas pedal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they just wire it up.</v>

985
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

986
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

987
00:44:29.781 --> 00:44:32.490
<v Speaker 3>That looks like an ink pen while it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pencil.</v>

988
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.930
<v Speaker 2>And then he's just that right there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motor in the back.</v>

989
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 2>That's the motor for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a button.</v>

990
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 2>So the button attaches to the motor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

991
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 2>And is a string on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it goes up and down.</v>

992
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 2>So forces the needle to go up and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit here,</v>

993
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 2>goes drive pin on top of the motor turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spindle.</v>

994
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.380
<v Speaker 2>The spindle causes the connecting pin to</v>
<v Speaker 2>rotate as the back end of the draw of</v>

995
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 2>the drive rod rotates with the pin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the needle moves backwards and forwards.</v>

996
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to make your own ink.</v>

997
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 2>So what are you doing for ink?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get the newspaper and you burn it</v>

998
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 2>in a brown bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just let it burn in the sun.</v>

999
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:19.010
<v Speaker 2>The ink from the paper is becomes ashes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get all these ashes and you put</v>

1000
00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 2>it in like a like this or like a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>like advil or like a little aspirin</v>

1001
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:27.180
<v Speaker 2>thing and he put two little rocks in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there at three and then a little bit of</v>

1002
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 2>water and shake that shit for three or</v>
<v Speaker 2>four days and it will become the ink</v>

1003
00:45:31.741 --> 00:45:32.070
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1004
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Three or four days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1005
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a long process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to figure out how you got.</v>

1006
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:38.280
<v Speaker 2>You got all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get plenty of time.</v>

1007
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you don't do it for 24 hours,</v>

1008
00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you just come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is it,</v>

1009
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 2>that it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've had tattoos that fall off</v>

1010
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 2>like the ink on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't done right.</v>

1011
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's faded off because they didn't</v>

1012
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 2>let it sit in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we took it and that wasn't a little</v>

1043

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't let you have lysol wipes it</v>

1044
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.550
<v Speaker 2>out because it worried you spray it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are like on fire.</v>

1045
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.350

00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Set Cold Turkey.</v>

1152
00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And that was the first time I stopped.</v>

1153
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get a cigarette for the first</v>

1154
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 2>10 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1155
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had a sally that came from</v>

1156
00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They let you have cigarettes in their</v>

1157
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:06.050
<v Speaker 2>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So homey snuck it.</v>

1158
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he did it,</v>

1159
00:52:08.031 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 2>but probably represent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're farming,</v>

1160
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.750
<v Speaker 2>like you're out there farming in Santa</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbara,</v>

1161
00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 2>then you can have cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1162
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 2>because it's an outside facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1163
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:20.840
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not in trapped in the building.</v>

1164
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.033
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1165
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 2>So was the idea about smoking in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>building that you don't want people to</v>

1166
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:26.570
<v Speaker 2>get secondhand smoke or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1167
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's what they said.</v>

1168
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.350
<v Speaker 2>This is 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happened in 2006,</v>

1169
00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 2>2007.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there laws might've changed.</v>

1170
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.730
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting because when I first</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved here in 94,</v>

1171
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.730
<v Speaker 2>you could still smoke in bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could smoke everywhere,</v>

1172
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:44.900
<v Speaker 2>everywhere had cigarettes.</v>

1173
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 2>I believe that comedy store had</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes,</v>

1174
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:50.030
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that ash trays on every table,</v>

1175
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1176
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:54.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correctly,</v>

1177
00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of clubs I worked at had</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking until the two thousands.</v>

1178
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Dallas was one of the last holdouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do the Addison Improv and they</v>

1179
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:06.790
<v Speaker 2>would still have smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would have like.</v>

1180
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Then they started having like an 8:00 PM</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsmoking show,</v>

1181
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:13.280
<v Speaker 2>toddlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't mind it,</v>

1182
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's probably bad for you,</v>

1183
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:19.700
<v Speaker 2>but then I started hearing about women</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be like waitresses and bars</v>

1184
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:22.700
<v Speaker 2>and they would work there for 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>now get lung cancer and it's like,</v>

1185
00:53:22.701 --> 00:53:23.160
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>

1186
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.440
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>That's when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was</v>

1188
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.180
<v Speaker 3>against it to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1189
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I can't smoke because America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're like,</v>

1190
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking her up.</v>

1191
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.813
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My bad.</v>

1192
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you went away,</v>

1193
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 3>how hard was it to quit cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that one of the hardest things to</v>

1194
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:37.240
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

1247
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:47.380
<v Speaker 3>So when you're in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have jumpsuits and everyone was big</v>

1248
00:55:47.381 --> 00:55:49.680
<v Speaker 3>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you cut the leg off your jumpsuit and</v>

1249
00:55:49.681 --> 00:55:53.820
<v Speaker 3>you sold the bottom and you sold the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sides and then you get the other leg and</v>

1250
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 3>you do the same thing and then you fill</v>
<v Speaker 3>it up with sand.</v>

1251
00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Now you have a heavy bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's probably like 40 pound bag and</v>

1252
00:56:01.051 --> 00:56:04.440

<v Speaker 3>you know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can put two little handles and now</v>

1254
00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:09.120
<v Speaker 3>you can do curls or you can do for and</v>
<v Speaker 3>raises.</v>

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything water rates.</v>

1256
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.480

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1258
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:17.970
<v Speaker 3>So when you were there and you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out,</v>

1259
00:56:17.971 --> 00:56:19.160
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't any weights?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1260
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:21.070
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to allow loud at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1261
00:56:21.071 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 3>how many people were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much people were killing each other</v>

1262
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:24.780
<v Speaker 3>with weights?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine you owe money and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing fucking bench press and somebody</v>

1264
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:30.700

<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1265
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a one hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was always the scenes in the</v>

1266
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:37.990
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Manage weight room or a,</v>

1267
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 3>it looked dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to do it.</v>

1268
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Imagine it was all little benches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1269
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:45.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1270
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 3>But they do have them on level one</v>
<v Speaker 3>yards.</v>

1271
00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Really fire camp now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made it like a privilege.</v>

1272
00:56:51.371 --> 00:56:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're in fire camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire camp,</v>

1273
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:57.490
<v Speaker 3>fire camp is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the inmates,</v>

1274
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.670
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make them go brush the fire follows me</v>

1275
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 3>all these huge fires.</v>

1276
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1277
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 3>All the inmates are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fighting the fires and then</v>

1278
00:57:06.761 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only do one third of their time.</v>

1279
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't be a violent offender in</v>

1280
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was disqualified from that.</v>

1281
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 3>So they do that so that you could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>more robust physically so you can do the</v>

1282
00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:19.110
<v Speaker 3>job better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1283
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like to privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't live in cells.</v>

1284
00:57:21.881 --> 00:57:24.910
<v Speaker 3>They live like in a room like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1285
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.620
<v Speaker 3>And they got bunks and they have like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little white badge,</v>

1286
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.180
<v Speaker 3>crowbar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if anything happens immediately took</v>

1287
00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every race decides not to cut.</v>

1288
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Ever happen here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need this for all of us.</v>

1289
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:38.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 3>we need this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not fuck this up.</v>

1344
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:49.320
<v Speaker 3>the inmates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I go to yard the next day the</v>

1345
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 3>inmates were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can go to your dorm.</v>

1351
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:06.410

<v Speaker 3>all right everybody give him an item and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go in there and perform an item.</v>

1353
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.220
<v Speaker 3>An item is like a soup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hot chocolate,</v>

1354
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.920
<v Speaker 3>and that's how people paid to see.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it got to the point where I did</v>

1356
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.440
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone on,</v>

1357
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.810

<v Speaker 3>I assembled like a little crew.</v>

1358
01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I taught this guy had to open for me</v>

1359
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.860
<v Speaker 3>because he was cool as Druggie from</v>
<v Speaker 3>whittier.</v>

1360
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:35.990
<v Speaker 3>He was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was stupid,</v>

1361
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught him how to do standup and he knew</v>

1362
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:40.340
<v Speaker 3>it but didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew it.</v>

1363
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:42.230
<v Speaker 3>He knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he never did it Jack.</v>

1364
01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember he'd be like a dog when I'm</v>

1365
01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:46.280
<v Speaker 3>on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has fucked up teeth.</v>

1366
01:00:46.281 --> 01:00:48.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like I called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called girls and I'm like,</v>

1367
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.460

<v Speaker 3>how's your body?</v>

1368
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:51.470

<v Speaker 3>I just smiled like Chisel.</v>

1369
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.353
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1370
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.240
<v Speaker 3>that's a setup right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're just,</v>

1371
01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.560
<v Speaker 3>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1372
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.940
<v Speaker 3>the look on his face was cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just remember he was like,</v>

1373
01:01:01.941 --> 01:01:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Hey dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna hit you up when I get out,</v>

1374
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:04.490
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go on the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1375
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.650

1376
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine because people that can make</v>

1377
01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 3>people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I always tell people,</v>

1378
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.940
<v Speaker 3>like if you can make your friends laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make people,</v>

1379
01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:17.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh.</v>

1380
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:21.050
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that you could be</v>

1440
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:58.590

<v Speaker 1>about war to men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1443
01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 1>amount of struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you experienced that</v>

1444
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 1>struggle than the non struggle feel so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>

1445
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1446
01:04:12.201 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>there's moments where I've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this before,</v>

1447
01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm hike,</v>

1448
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:19.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm hunting in Alaska on this</v>

1449
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 1>island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince of Wales,</v>

1450
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:23.850
<v Speaker 1>and it rained every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were there for six days.</v>

1451
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Pouring rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drenched her hunting.</v>

1452
01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst,</v>

1453
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>like as far as like getting wet and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>being soaked and cold all the time.</v>

1454
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the worst experiences you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever go through because you're just,</v>

1455
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.940
<v Speaker 1>it's always like 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 degrees pouring rain and you know,</v>

1456
01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you're sleeping bags with the inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tents.</v>

1457
01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's wet.</v>

1458
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:49.290
<v Speaker 1>But when I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was sunny out and I called</v>

1459
01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:50.760
<v Speaker 1>my friend Steve Rinella who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1460
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.570
<v Speaker 1>took me with him on this trip I go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been happier in my life.</v>

1461
01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Like the sun is shining like what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally just totally take for granted.</v>

1462
01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1463
01:04:58.741 --> 01:05:00.540
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1464
01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm driving on the street.</v>

1465
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think I've ever been happier,</v>

1466
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.830
<v Speaker 1>but I was that happy because I had gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the struggle,</v>

1467
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:10.170
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to do that on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

1468
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're kind of forced into a</v>

1469
01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>situation I would imagine like being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

1470
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Then when you get that Kentucky Fried</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicken and you get that soda,</v>

1471
01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1472
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.510
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're fucking live in it</v>

1473
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.940
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1474
01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1475
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I came from a place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this thing,</v>

1476
01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:27.420

<v Speaker 3>I forgot what it's called,</v>

1477
01:05:27.421 --> 01:05:31.620
<v Speaker 3>but you have money in your books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has money and they do like a</v>

1478
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.480
<v Speaker 3>sell off or they'll go to the local vons</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the prison and they'll buy.</v>

1479
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:38.940
<v Speaker 3>You can buy sodas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cookies and pizza.</v>

1480
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:43.070
<v Speaker 3>But nobody ever had Kentucky Fried</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicken in that bitch.</v>

1481
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Like to this day,</v>

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Scared of what the will we be scared?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared.</v>

1503
01:06:39.301 --> 01:06:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1504
01:06:40.951 --> 01:06:43.350
<v Speaker 3>like I'm scared like the deer's fucker</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me and like there's like someone</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like I'm in their world.</v>

1506
01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1507
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 3>It feels like</v>

1508
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:50.050
<v Speaker 5>their world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the weirdest part about the</v>

1509
01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:51.660
<v Speaker 5>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're hunting in the woods,</v>

1510
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.140
<v Speaker 5>you lock eyes with an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1511
01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:56.710
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like it's almost psychedelic</v>

1512
01:06:56.711 --> 01:06:58.620
<v Speaker 5>in some sort of a weird way like brings</v>
<v Speaker 5>you to another.</v>

1513
01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 5>It's like you feel like you're in</v>
<v Speaker 5>another dimension.</v>

1514
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that sounds so stupid when I say</v>

1515
01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:04.060
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even I hear it myself,</v>

1516
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 5>but when you lock eyes and then when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're hunting,</v>

1517
01:07:06.551 --> 01:07:10.300
<v Speaker 5>you lock eyes an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole world changes.</v>

1518
01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:13.210
<v Speaker 5>It's like the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're in there and you're in a totally</v>

1519
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:15.820
<v Speaker 5>different environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An environment that doesn't give a fuck</v>

1520
01:07:15.821 --> 01:07:17.920
<v Speaker 5>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't care if you look like you're</v>

1521
01:07:17.921 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 5>used to your street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1522
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:22.600
<v Speaker 5>this is the deli that I eat at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is where I do my laundry,</v>

1523
01:07:22.601 --> 01:07:24.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all normal stuff.</v>

1524
01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:28.990
<v Speaker 5>Like you have these patterns and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>just see people and you see cars and</v>

1525
01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 5>like this is my world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then when you're in their world you</v>

1526
01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:32.560
<v Speaker 5>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1527
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:35.800
<v Speaker 5>this is a totally different world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like I went to another planet.</v>

1528
01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah.</v>

1529
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean people try to get me to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>camping.</v>

1530
01:07:39.481 --> 01:07:40.111
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

1531
01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>

1532
01:07:41.371 --> 01:07:42.204
<v Speaker 3>you'd love it.</v>

1533
01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:45.500
<v Speaker 5>This thing about it is you get used to</v>
<v Speaker 5>it after awhile and it becomes normal</v>

1534
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:48.470
<v Speaker 5>and then once it becomes normal you</v>
<v Speaker 5>realize like how peaceful it is.</v>

1535
01:07:48.471 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 5>Like we just sitting down in the grass</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1536
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.830
<v Speaker 5>like on a top of a mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like looking out at a valley and you go,</v>

1537
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:57.680
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is so like you would pay like fuck</v>

1538
01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.680
<v Speaker 5>museums,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like go to the La County Museum of art</v>

1539
01:08:00.681 --> 01:08:02.780
<v Speaker 5>and they see these bullshit exhibits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have their.</v>

1540
01:08:02.781 --> 01:08:05.630
<v Speaker 5>They're terrible to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do a goddamn thing for you.</v>

1541
01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:09.590
<v Speaker 5>Most of the modern abstract art,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking ridiculous stupid.</v>

1542
01:08:09.591 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 5>But I challenge anyone to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to Colorado,</v>

1543
01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 5>go to boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Colorado and at the mountains,</v>

1544
01:08:16.161 --> 01:08:18.260
<v Speaker 5>go into the mountains and look at some</v>
<v Speaker 5>of those peaks.</v>

1545
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.710
<v Speaker 5>Look at the continental divide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the most incredible piece of</v>

1546
01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:26.020
<v Speaker 5>art you could ever see and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature does something to you.</v>

1547
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 5>You had me and red van just got back</v>
<v Speaker 5>from Denver and it was,</v>

1548
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 5>it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Denver's the shit.</v>

1549
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.190
<v Speaker 5>I was first time there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I wasn't used to like,</v>

1550
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 5>I guess somebody told me there's no</v>
<v Speaker 5>water around,</v>

1551
01:08:36.471 --> 01:08:38.240
<v Speaker 5>so you get headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1552
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:41.450
<v Speaker 5>it's not that there's no water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a year at a very high altitude and</v>

1553
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.780
<v Speaker 5>dehydration comes quicker for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>

1554
01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:47.870
<v Speaker 5>So you have to keep yourself hydrated is</v>
<v Speaker 5>super important.</v>

1555
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 5>I guess he's just dry out the</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>

1556
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.640
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are cool as fuck.</v>

1557
01:08:52.641 --> 01:08:56.300
<v Speaker 5>And Denver is like one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was always cool,</v>

1558
01:08:56.450 --> 01:09:00.020
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Denver for a long time the city of</v>

1559
01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 5>Denver just didn't have weed laws.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1560
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:04.010
<v Speaker 5>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't give a fuck.</v>

1561
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.550
<v Speaker 5>You smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do whatever you want to do.</v>

1562
01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.150
<v Speaker 5>We don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was like when I first started</v>

1563
01:09:08.151 --> 01:09:10.010
<v Speaker 5>working there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I don't even know when I first</v>

1564
01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 5>started working,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a long time ago,</v>

1565
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 5>but I remember the club owners will tell</v>
<v Speaker 5>you like,</v>

1566
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:16.730
<v Speaker 5>this city is essentially made.</v>

1567
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:18.590
<v Speaker 5>We'd decriminalized like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't,</v>

1568
01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:20.870
<v Speaker 5>you won't get arrested for weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just don't arrest people for weed.</v>

1569
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a long time ago.</v>

1570
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Then the state was the first to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>gangster and say,</v>

1571
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:29.150
<v Speaker 5>fuck you federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's legal,</v>

1572
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:31.400
<v Speaker 5>so you could buy weed everywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Denver.</v>

1573
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 5>Now in Colorado there are weeds stores</v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere now.</v>

1574
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 5>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the economy's booming.</v>

1575
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:41.810
<v Speaker 5>Real estate prices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they went up 14 or 16 percent</v>

1576
01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:45.380
<v Speaker 5>inside of two years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drunk driving deaths dropped to an all</v>

1577
01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 5>time low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Violent crime dropped to an all time</v>

1578
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:49.640
<v Speaker 5>low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

1579
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:52.070
<v Speaker 5>Pills,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pill and opiod addiction dropped to an</v>

1580
01:09:52.071 --> 01:09:53.460
<v Speaker 5>all time low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Fuck those days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1582
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:56.450
<v Speaker 5>that's what's going on right now in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arizona.</v>

1583
01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:57.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've been paying</v>
<v Speaker 5>attention,</v>

1584
01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 5>but they're trying to pass it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arizona.</v>

1585
01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.590
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to pass legal weed in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arizona and the opposition has been</v>

1586
01:10:03.591 --> 01:10:05.660
<v Speaker 5>alcohol companies and pain pills.</v>

1587
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.050
<v Speaker 5>Those are the ones who spend the most</v>
<v Speaker 5>money trying to keep weed illegal.</v>

1588
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:14.910
<v Speaker 5>My buddy grows like legally and he told</v>
<v Speaker 5>me that they invented this new light</v>

1589
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:20.450
<v Speaker 5>that makes sure we'd grow faster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but all the tobacco companies got</v>

1590
01:10:20.451 --> 01:10:25.190
<v Speaker 5>together and bought all those lights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every time this guy puts out new</v>

1591
01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:27.560
<v Speaker 5>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tobacco company buys them all.</v>

1592
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

1593
01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't looked into it and then he</v>

1594
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:33.020
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only other reason we can't make it</v>

1595
01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:37.640
<v Speaker 5>legal here is because every time they</v>
<v Speaker 5>put the thc in the rolling things to</v>

1596
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:39.230
<v Speaker 5>mix,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to put them in cigarettes,</v>

1597
01:10:39.231 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 5>it gets too sticky and it misses the</v>
<v Speaker 5>machines up.</v>

1598
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:43.400
<v Speaker 5>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never even thought of that.</v>

1599
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.840
<v Speaker 5>So just hire people to do it by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to Gino La.</v>

1600
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 5>That's why they have these tubes folks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See people don't understand people that</v>

1601
01:10:52.611 --> 01:10:56.570
<v Speaker 5>live in other barbaric parts of America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's hard to get weed,</v>

1602
01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:00.170
<v Speaker 5>we get these joints and they're exactly</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same every time.</v>

1603
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.970
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's God damn perfect.</v>

1604
01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.200
<v Speaker 5>Got a little paper tube at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd all sits in the top.</v>

1605
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 5>The problem with this stuff is like you</v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

1606
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:10.520
<v Speaker 5>this is medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like medicine for life,</v>

1607
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 5>but if you smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people think you're loser.</v>

1608
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:17.330
<v Speaker 5>That's me out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they think that you're a druggie and</v>

1609
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.200
<v Speaker 5>you're a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something's wrong with.</v>

1610
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 5>You fucked her</v>
<v Speaker 5>chart of Bullshit George for.</v>

1611
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:29.370
<v Speaker 5>You know what's weird is I have a 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>year old son and he smokes weed and I</v>

1612
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 5>kind of feel like an asshole because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1613
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:33.900
<v Speaker 5>you can't smoke that shit around me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1614
01:11:33.901 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said just cause like I just always</v>

1615
01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 5>want to feel like your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just give me.</v>

1616
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 5>I gave that to my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to let it go.</v>

1617
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:45.300
<v Speaker 5>I've got a 20 year old daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She smokes weed.</v>

1618
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 5>Wrong with it in front of you.</v>

1619
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:49.910
<v Speaker 5>And like not really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's had wine in front of me once.</v>

1620
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:52.590
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he wants me to roll it for him and</v>

1621
01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 5>it looks and I don't think there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything wrong with it.</v>

1622
01:11:55.261 --> 01:11:57.000
<v Speaker 5>I think I'd be a hypocrite if I said</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was,</v>

1623
01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:59.610
<v Speaker 5>she's a smart girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she knows what the fuck is up,</v>

1624
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:01.800
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when she was younger her mother</v>

1625
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 5>caught her with it and there's like this</v>
<v Speaker 5>big deal.</v>

1626
01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:03.931
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitch,</v>

1627
01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:05.790
<v Speaker 5>you smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why you getting mad at her?</v>

1628
01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.430
<v Speaker 5>But it's one of those things where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like you're supposed to get mad at</v>

1629
01:12:08.431 --> 01:12:10.110
<v Speaker 5>people I suppose to tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1630
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:11.760
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not bad for you,</v>

1631
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.160
<v Speaker 5>but there are drugs that are bad for</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1632
01:12:14.161 --> 01:12:17.670
<v Speaker 5>so if I told you that this is bad for</v>
<v Speaker 5>you and you realized it wasn't bad for</v>

1633
01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:18.610
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1634
01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:21.570
<v Speaker 5>it would be a massive hypocrite because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have tattooed on my body</v>

1635
01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:25.800
<v Speaker 5>massive hypocrite and plus I knew she's</v>
<v Speaker 5>on Youtube.</v>

1636
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.890
<v Speaker 5>She's seen videos mean it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talk about weed all the time,</v>

1637
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:33.000
<v Speaker 5>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she wouldn't trust me about things that</v>

1638
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:34.140
<v Speaker 5>are bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

1639
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:39.141
<v Speaker 5>stay the fuck away from that peanut</v>
<v Speaker 5>butter crank is actually bad for you.</v>

1640
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:40.810
<v Speaker 5>And I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1641
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.990
<v Speaker 5>we had a nice long discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1642
01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.850
<v Speaker 5>I've never done anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>addictive other than alcohol and I don't</v>

1643
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:51.510
<v Speaker 5>have whatever genetic predisposition to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get addicted to alcohol,</v>

1644
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:54.570
<v Speaker 5>but I've never fuck with coke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never fucked with crank.</v>

1645
01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:57.390
<v Speaker 5>I've never fucked with heroin because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want to ruin my life.</v>

1646
01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are some drugs that they're</v>

1647
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:01.620
<v Speaker 5>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you're using them in</v>

1648
01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:03.750
<v Speaker 5>moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

1649
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:06.090
<v Speaker 5>with trying mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you do it in a safe setting,</v>

1650
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:08.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 5>with smoking a little weed.</v>

1651
01:13:08.641 --> 01:13:12.210
<v Speaker 5>I think there's plenty of things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people would throw under the same</v>

1652
01:13:12.211 --> 01:13:16.500
<v Speaker 5>classification as drugs that they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>just not bad for you,</v>

1653
01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1654
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.330
<v Speaker 5>They're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1655
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:19.680
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

1656
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.240
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's like a little Mexican thing.</v>

1658
01:13:24.121 --> 01:13:26.340
<v Speaker 5>It's like the machismo illness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my dad was like,</v>

1659
01:13:26.341 --> 01:13:28.040

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>His mom was the wild one.</v>

1684
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:26.830
<v Speaker 2>She's the crazy one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy because you still keep in touch</v>

1685
01:14:26.831 --> 01:14:28.030
<v Speaker 2>with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean now.</v>

1687
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean he sees her once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have had custody of him ever since</v>

1688
01:14:33.851 --> 01:14:34.960
<v Speaker 2>he was five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He live with,</v>

1689
01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:36.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lived with me ever since he was</v>

1690
01:14:36.911 --> 01:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>five because you want to do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did for a little bit,</v>

1691
01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:42.570
<v Speaker 2>but he is more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1692
01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:47.580
<v Speaker 2>like he's more like both of my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could have been them because</v>

1693
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't.</v>

1694
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I felt like I was a follower</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a teenager because I want it</v>

1695
01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:55.840
<v Speaker 2>to be like a surfer skater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also wanted to be a gangster</v>

1696
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1697
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Surfers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skaters and their living life.</v>

1698
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Like they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it,</v>

1699
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.690
<v Speaker 2>and my son lives by the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He serves.</v>

1700
01:15:02.691 --> 01:15:03.281
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1701
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:04.300
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1702
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:06.850
<v Speaker 2>he works at in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My other son does choir,</v>

1703
01:15:06.851 --> 01:15:08.830
<v Speaker 2>like all the things I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing,</v>

1704
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:11.020
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1705
01:15:11.021 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 2>you will honest and you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>things real honestly.</v>

1706
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And from that they can see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes.</v>

1707
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then not have to go through them</v>

1708
01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:24.520
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I think parents that aren't</v>

1709
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 2>honest about mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they do themselves a disservice</v>

1710
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:31.450
<v Speaker 2>the way they raise their kids because</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kid doesn't get to learn from your</v>

1711
01:15:31.451 --> 01:15:32.470
<v Speaker 2>own fuck ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1712
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I think kids need to know that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>infallible or that you're not</v>

1713
01:15:36.971 --> 01:15:38.800
<v Speaker 2>infallible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you make mistakes.</v>

1714
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Speaker 2>You're just a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1715
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I think I used to do this bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really does kind of apply is that</v>

1716
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:48.460
<v Speaker 2>when you were little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like remember when you were little used</v>

1717
01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:51.850
<v Speaker 2>to think that they were real grownups</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he used to like get upset about</v>

1718
01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:52.090
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1719
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 2>You go one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be a grownup and</v>

1720
01:15:53.831 --> 01:15:56.110
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's never going to make sense.</v>

1721
01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm 49 years old.</v>

1722
01:15:58.871 --> 01:16:01.150
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this makes sense to me.</v>

1723
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1724
01:16:03.701 --> 01:16:06.880
<v Speaker 2>It's the life to this day still so</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre.</v>

1725
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 2>There's no grownups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get older and then one day you</v>

1726
01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:12.580
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

1727
01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I just gotta find out how to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you have to do.</v>

1728
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:18.850
<v Speaker 2>How to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be happy and create comradery,</v>

1729
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.930
<v Speaker 2>like create comradery amongst your</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends and amongst your family and</v>

1730
01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 2>amongst the people that you love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spread as much as you can.</v>

1731
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight up.</v>

1732
01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Just try to enjoy it as much as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever this is,</v>

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:33.040
<v Speaker 2>enjoy as much as you can.</v>

1734
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Everything else is a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else is a trap.</v>

1735
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:40.960
<v Speaker 2>All the other thoughts or traps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collecting the most shit and having the</v>

<v Speaker 2>just go out on missions.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But shorter than me and just super</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1771
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever get involved in martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts?</v>

1772
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1773
01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:19.650
<v Speaker 5>Probably should have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably would have been as</v>

1774
01:18:19.651 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Speaker 5>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He probably could have like maybe like</v>

1775
01:18:24.211 --> 01:18:27.160
<v Speaker 5>alleviated some of that stress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that tension that he has,</v>

1776
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:28.960
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird as they hit,</v>

1777
01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.650
<v Speaker 3>he coached his kids now and like he's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>different and like he,</v>

1778
01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:34.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he got his mellow.</v>

1779
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you had kids of his own.</v>

1780
01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1781
01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful little son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:18:40.211 --> 01:18:43.060
<v Speaker 3>But that'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so competitive to this day.</v>

1783
01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember somebody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1784
01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.260
<v Speaker 3>I seen your comedy central roles bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1785
01:18:47.261 --> 01:18:48.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I graduated from Chapman.</v>

1786
01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.040
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1787
01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:55.160
<v Speaker 3>can I have something that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't just want to say you did</v>

1788
01:18:55.161 --> 01:18:56.200
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1789
01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.600
<v Speaker 3>It held time and like I did good on</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

1790
01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:00.270
<v Speaker 5>You know what I usually think I used to</v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

1791
01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:03.780
<v Speaker 5>oh well that guy just fuck those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those guys are pains in the ass is too</v>

1792
01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:07.680
<v Speaker 5>hard to deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I realized what those guys are is</v>

1793
01:19:07.681 --> 01:19:11.250
<v Speaker 5>like super winters that never found a</v>
<v Speaker 5>venue.</v>

1794
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.200
<v Speaker 5>Like sometimes there's super winters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's certain people I really</v>

1795
01:19:16.201 --> 01:19:21.201
<v Speaker 5>think in order to be a Michael Jordan or</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody that's like a super winter,</v>

1796
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.060
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you almost have to be imbalanced to the</v>

1797
01:19:24.061 --> 01:19:27.060
<v Speaker 5>point where you want to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want it all about you way more than</v>

1798
01:19:27.061 --> 01:19:30.870
<v Speaker 5>the average person and that creates a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of like relationship,</v>

1799
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.540
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

1800
01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:37.980
<v Speaker 5>a block in the harmony because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're always thinking about yourself.</v>

1801
01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Like I think a lot of those guys don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>find the venue.</v>

1802
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:44.980
<v Speaker 5>They don't find it a real thing to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>competitive with it,</v>

1803
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.490
<v Speaker 5>but if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would get all those lumps.</v>

1804
01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:49.680
<v Speaker 5>Especially with martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with Jujitsu.</v>

1805
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:53.550
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu is a big one man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you can get through that,</v>

1806
01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:57.210
<v Speaker 5>you get all those lumps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get choked down all the time.</v>

1807
01:19:57.211 --> 01:20:00.450
<v Speaker 5>You get your ass kicked all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 5>through getting your ass kicked all the</v>

1808
01:20:00.451 --> 01:20:02.310
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting strangled and tapped out.</v>

1809
01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.920
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you learn how to control your ego better</v>

1810
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 5>and then you learn like what's actual</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what</v>

1811
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.420
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just talk and shit.</v>

1812
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Like how much of this is real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1813
01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.060
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1814
01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:20.061
<v Speaker 1>because like had Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just soaring from college all the</v>

1815
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>way up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that when you get your</v>

1816
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1817
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:24.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still,</v>

1818
01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can compete.</v>

1819
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:26.700
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could certainly.</v>

1820
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guys who were the best in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1821
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:33.210
<v Speaker 1>all of them are completely obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing and training in Jujitsu,</v>

1822
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but I think just for men sometimes it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to have some sort of an avenue for</v>

1823
01:20:37.681 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 1>aggressive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get it out of the way so you can</v>

1824
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:42.070
<v Speaker 1>chill out car raiders games.</v>

1825
01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I really think that that's what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douchey guys are missing in their life.</v>

1826
01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.290
<v Speaker 1>They're missing that outlet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you to the in some girls</v>

1827
01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.860
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls now are just a VC.</v>

1828
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I've seen more girls fight each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I've seen guys fight each other at</v>

1829
01:20:58.591 --> 01:20:59.071
<v Speaker 1>clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1830
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I go to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to clubs.</v>

1831
01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I've watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough from a distance,</v>

1832
01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls beat the fuck out of each other.</v>

1833
01:21:04.921 --> 01:21:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Now that they've seen all these mma</v>

1860
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 1>They taught you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have poor habits.</v>

1861
01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Their patterns like how they fight is</v>
<v Speaker 1>too predictable to know,</v>

1862
01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:20.610
<v Speaker 1>have a well rounded game or you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky.</v>

1863
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.400
<v Speaker 1>You could go to like for us a hobby and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal.</v>

1864
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.141
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few guys,</v>

1865
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:28.200
<v Speaker 1>a handful of guys that are like the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in the world and you meet them and</v>

1866
01:22:28.201 --> 01:22:29.280
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1867
01:22:29.281 --> 01:22:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I got really lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found someone with like this deep</v>

1868
01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:37.251
<v Speaker 1>reservoir of martial arts knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's only like 20 or 30 of those</v>

1869
01:22:37.831 --> 01:22:42.240
<v Speaker 1>guys on the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's such a small number of really</v>

1870
01:22:42.241 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 1>good mixed martial arts in particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>instructors this other.</v>

1871
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:50.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of really good a</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional martial arts instructors</v>

1872
01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:52.680
<v Speaker 1>like Jujitsu instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of really good ones,</v>

1873
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 1>a ton a taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same a lot for Moitai,</v>

1874
01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.290
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the full like what martial arts</v>

1875
01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:05.380
<v Speaker 1>really are today is the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to separate.</v>

1876
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It's good to separate</v>

1877
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:10.530
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like understanding who's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>best at each individual skill,</v>

1878
01:23:10.531 --> 01:23:13.450
<v Speaker 5>like who's the best Jujitsu guy on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>planet is not necessarily who the best</v>

1879
01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:17.020
<v Speaker 5>mma fighter on the planet is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a difference and if the best MMA</v>

1880
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 5>fighter on the planet competed in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu against the best Jujitsu guys,</v>

1881
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:24.370
<v Speaker 5>they'd probably lose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if the best Jujitsu guy competed</v>

1882
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:27.850
<v Speaker 5>against the MMA fighter in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would most likely lose.</v>

1883
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:30.520
<v Speaker 5>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real balance.</v>

1884
01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:31.860
<v Speaker 5>You got to get as more right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1885
01:23:31.861 --> 01:23:33.730
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a balance and put that balance</v>

1886
01:23:33.731 --> 01:23:35.350
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a handful of people on the</v>

1887
01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:36.870
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Well this whole area is a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Contrary to what people would think is a</v>

1937
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:45.700
<v Speaker 5>great place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's also because the comedy</v>

1938
01:25:45.701 --> 01:25:50.610
<v Speaker 5>store has so many comics that went from</v>
<v Speaker 5>being like door people to being</v>

1939
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:53.590
<v Speaker 5>headliners.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody who's a comic at the</v>

1940
01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:55.680

1944
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you do stand up comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do stand up comedy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1949
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:19.550

<v Speaker 3>like felt like I was told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh did they don't take Mexicans there?</v>

1954
01:26:29.611 --> 01:26:30.180
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1979
01:27:30.451 --> 01:27:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God and if it's a guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been through a lot of shit you can tell</v>

1980
01:27:34.771 --> 01:27:36.920
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly and it talking to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1981
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:40.980
<v Speaker 1>They've legitimately seen a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>character testing shit.</v>

1982
01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Like getting involved in prison riots</v>
<v Speaker 1>are beating the fuck out of a guy and</v>

1983
01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:46.110
<v Speaker 1>break his orbital bone or a basketball</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1984
01:27:46.111 --> 01:27:48.840
<v Speaker 1>How these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have done shit like that,</v>

1985
01:27:48.841 --> 01:27:52.260
<v Speaker 1>they have like a field to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I saw you doing</v>

1986
01:27:52.261 --> 01:27:53.011
<v Speaker 1>your Rosebud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1987
01:27:53.011 --> 01:27:58.011
<v Speaker 1>you were very funny things like sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny well-worded insults,</v>

1988
01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:00.900
<v Speaker 1>which is like what [inaudible] is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1989
01:28:00.901 --> 01:28:02.930
<v Speaker 1>It's really what they've done is created</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1990
01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.390
<v Speaker 1>an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1991
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:07.360
<v Speaker 1>sort of a writer's show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Really about performing and coming up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with good ideas and good jokes.</v>

1993
01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:16.370
<v Speaker 3>And it's cool because it gives a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>like me a chance to go against people</v>

1994
01:28:16.371 --> 01:28:20.300
<v Speaker 3>that I will never meet or ever hang out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with and like dude,</v>

1995
01:28:20.301 --> 01:28:24.800
<v Speaker 3>like they get to be in front of you raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all these guys that get to see</v>

1996
01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:27.080
<v Speaker 3>them instead of seeing them at a coffee</v>
<v Speaker 3>shop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>could mine into to it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets even crazier because like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He wants to answer calls anymore.</v>

2021
01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.280

2022
01:29:38.281 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of weird shit about getting out.</v>

2023
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:44.130
<v Speaker 3>It was the fucking transition of</v>
<v Speaker 3>transitions.</v>

2024
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:47.040
<v Speaker 3>And so you were institutionalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Institutionalized.</v>

2025
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Straight up.</v>

2026
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:50.670
<v Speaker 3>And they were only in there for three</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2027
01:29:50.671 --> 01:29:52.220
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you were in there for 20,</v>

2028
01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.020
<v Speaker 3>25.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2029
01:29:55.170 --> 01:30:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Well it's Kinda like how you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's who you affiliate yourself with and</v>

2030
01:30:00.991 --> 01:30:04.230
<v Speaker 3>then you know when you come from your</v>
<v Speaker 3>street,</v>

2031
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:07.530
<v Speaker 3>there's codes that just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taught from the beginning of</v>

2032
01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:12.210
<v Speaker 3>they're going to follow you in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's Kinda like I was taught by the</v>

2033
01:30:12.211 --> 01:30:16.530
<v Speaker 3>right people in the codes to go in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just to come out and to finally</v>

2034
01:30:16.531 --> 01:30:17.251
<v Speaker 3>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2035
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:19.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even going to gang bang no more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even give a fuck.</v>

2036
01:30:19.951 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 3>You can call me what you want to call</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2037
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm living life now for my kids and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me and then I need this new</v>

2038
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

2039
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.010
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was the whole weird transition</v>

2040
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:34.470
<v Speaker 3>as well as just like being on parole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2041
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:37.050
<v Speaker 3>That was embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dissolve.</v>

2042
01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Is there a feeling like hoping that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could pull it off?</v>

2043
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you.</v>

2044
01:30:41.370 --> 01:30:43.260
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>parole,</v>

2045
01:30:43.261 --> 01:30:47.640
<v Speaker 3>one of the big issues would be that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that someone's watching you and</v>

2046
01:30:47.641 --> 01:30:50.310
<v Speaker 3>checking up on you all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>evaluating you all the time,</v>

2047
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.490
<v Speaker 3>that puts almost additional pressure on</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to fuck up.</v>

2048
01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:57.500
<v Speaker 3>There's like a psychological thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to people when you,</v>

2049
01:30:57.501 --> 01:31:00.660
<v Speaker 3>you know what you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brother putting all that pressure</v>

2050
01:31:00.661 --> 01:31:03.270
<v Speaker 3>on you and then you respond from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a,</v>

2051
01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.390
<v Speaker 3>there's a pressure that you put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone when you're monitoring their</v>

2052
01:31:06.391 --> 01:31:08.220
<v Speaker 3>behavior and I understand that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it,</v>

2053
01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:11.860
<v Speaker 3>especially if someone's committed</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent crimes and you gotta make sure</v>

2054
01:31:11.861 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 3>that they're doing all right and not do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything stupid.</v>

2055
01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:15.390
<v Speaker 3>You let them free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2056
01:31:15.391 --> 01:31:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I can understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying that psychologically</v>

2057
01:31:18.631 --> 01:31:21.270
<v Speaker 3>it probably has an adverse effect on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

2058
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:23.600
<v Speaker 3>Like that's gotTa fuck with your head</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2059
01:31:23.670 --> 01:31:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2060
01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:26.500
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>different person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't that gangster that,</v>

01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I think you have like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could stay in there.</v>

2094
01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:56.620
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to stay there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and just paying the bills and my parole</v>

2097
01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:04.481
<v Speaker 3>officers.</v>

<v Speaker 3>normal person.</v>

2102
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:22.780
<v Speaker 3>He confessed to me once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:24.040
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a fucking divorce.</v>

2105
01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:29.620
<v Speaker 3>He was getting divorced too and I guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were cutting all the parole</v>

2106
01:33:29.621 --> 01:33:31.810
<v Speaker 3>officers there are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing a cut.</v>

2107
01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.540
<v Speaker 3>So Cincinnati,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had bad credit.</v>

2108
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:38.320
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't be a casino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2109
01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Bad credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:33:40.151 --> 01:33:42.990
<v Speaker 3>If you have bad credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be a casino cup.</v>

2111
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:45.060
<v Speaker 3>I wonder why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they think that you're too</v>

2112
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:49.090
<v Speaker 3>desperate for money probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we might be able to accept</v>

2113
01:33:49.091 --> 01:33:51.730
<v Speaker 3>bribes from people or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

2114
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:56.140
<v Speaker 3>But that was the only time that guy ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>like talked to me besides just like.</v>

2115
01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.040

<v Speaker 3>those visitors.</v>

<v Speaker 3>your finger now or the special thing</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said he put it.</v>

2123
01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:17.800
<v Speaker 3>He put the clorox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2124
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.900
<v Speaker 3>under the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skin of his dick.</v>

2125
01:34:19.901 --> 01:34:24.190
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I one time he said he put Draino there</v>

2126
01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.024
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2127
01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:31.210
<v Speaker 3>I used to put coffee on my balls when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to court coffee.</v>

2128
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.500
<v Speaker 3>I put it in a plastic bag and a rubber</v>
<v Speaker 3>band and wrap it around my and go to</v>

2129
01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:37.180
<v Speaker 3>court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he looked like a pimp.</v>

2130
01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:40.930
<v Speaker 3>It's going to court everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Urine like 50 people in a jail cell.</v>

2131
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:42.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're just right there and nothing</v>

2132
01:34:42.671 --> 01:34:47.671
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want some coffee on me for real.</v>

2133
01:34:48.650 --> 01:34:51.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone was shooting it.</v>

2134
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.480
<v Speaker 3>And it's like when you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want it to be just like this a man.</v>

2135
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:59.930
<v Speaker 3>There's no responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just to be cool and be strong and</v>

2136
01:34:59.931 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking let's have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dog.</v>

2137
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.030
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you knew to keep coffee on your ball</v>

2138
01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:06.800
<v Speaker 3>so you could have it once he'd be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison?</v>

2139
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is when I</v>

2140
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 3>know that I'm already in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes you've got to go to court.</v>

2141
01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.200
<v Speaker 3>So I was going to court to get my</v>
<v Speaker 3>license back because you have the right</v>

2142
01:35:21.201 --> 01:35:23.690
<v Speaker 3>to get your license back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you're in prison,</v>

2143
01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.070
<v Speaker 3>you still have the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're like,</v>

2144
01:35:25.071 --> 01:35:25.581
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

2145
01:35:25.581 --> 01:35:29.180

<v Speaker 3>So I tied it because knowing like Ada,</v>

2146
01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:30.680
<v Speaker 3>there's not going to be no coffee for</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

2147
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:32.840
<v Speaker 3>but when I pull up to this and the home</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be like,</v>

2148
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:36.050
<v Speaker 3>because you don't get in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sneaking coffee.</v>

2149
01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:39.350
<v Speaker 3>They'll just like a stupid ass talk shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

2150
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:41.390
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like bragging,</v>

2151
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:42.740
<v Speaker 3>having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2152
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's funny though.</v>

2154
01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:50.120
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about balls and coffee together</v>

2155
01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:54.800
<v Speaker 3>and no one's even like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh watch out is no one gives a phone</v>

01:36:41.841 --> 01:36:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm your friend and like they're still</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friends.</v>

2175
01:36:44.481 --> 01:36:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people.</v>

2176
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:48.810
<v Speaker 3>This is what I've been told by a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people at.</v>

2177
01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:51.010
<v Speaker 3>You're the only format that when he got</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2178
01:36:51.170 --> 01:36:54.590
<v Speaker 3>answered my fucking phone call and</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like people forget about you.</v>

2179
01:36:54.591 --> 01:36:57.810
<v Speaker 3>They don't want nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened to me where I've caught up</v>

2180
01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.690
<v Speaker 3>with La Homie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just prison dog.</v>

2181
01:36:59.691 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

2182
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 3>My bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

2183
01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get out of prison.</v>

2184
01:37:04.371 --> 01:37:06.170
<v Speaker 3>They don't want have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2185
01:37:06.171 --> 01:37:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see people wanting to move on</v>

2186
01:37:07.971 --> 01:37:09.500
<v Speaker 3>with their lives to man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think.</v>

2187
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.160
<v Speaker 3>But prison itself is so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be so devastating.</v>

2188
01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.070
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy how many people we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked up.</v>

2189
01:37:16.071 --> 01:37:19.470
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the numbers are telling</v>
<v Speaker 3>you the truth.</v>

2190
01:37:19.471 --> 01:37:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I did not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now they got t bunks now like the.</v>

2191
01:37:23.331 --> 01:37:24.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't even have day room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more.</v>

2192
01:37:24.681 --> 01:37:27.560
<v Speaker 3>So you're in a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This just say this is a prison right</v>

2193
01:37:27.561 --> 01:37:31.570
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Along the wall there it'd be cells and</v>

2194
01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.080
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of where to be where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>

2195
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Now they have t bunks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have bunks that are screwed into</v>

2196
01:37:36.681 --> 01:37:41.660
<v Speaker 3>the concrete and people sleep like with</v>
<v Speaker 3>no protection.</v>

2197
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2198
01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:48.110
<v Speaker 3>You and 50 other inmates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just an a bunk in someone's big living</v>

2199
01:37:48.111 --> 01:37:49.950
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:54.950
<v Speaker 3>It's getting overpopulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The numbers are so insane though.</v>

2201
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:56.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's crazy.</v>

2202
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean to cut you off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is,</v>

2203
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.310
<v Speaker 5>this is what trips me out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2204
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:03.720
<v Speaker 5>I had friends that I was locked up with</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like in Wasco reception,</v>

2205
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.640
<v Speaker 5>so people come in and out and my friends</v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

2206
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody on this side,</v>

2207
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 5>they get sent to Mississippi and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>they send all those like they're sending</v>

2208
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:14.430
<v Speaker 5>our inmates to Mississippi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alabama,</v>

2209
01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:19.431
<v Speaker 5>Michigan and Michigan and never getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>a check from us and then at the end they</v>

2210
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 5>bring us back and they send us home from</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere over here.</v>

2211
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's never been a time in history</v>

2212
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.840
<v Speaker 5>where a country is locked up more with</v>
<v Speaker 5>citizens 10 right now.</v>

2213
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.550
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine there's ever been a</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2214
01:38:32.551 --> 01:38:34.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm saying that pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>confidently,</v>

2215
01:38:34.471 --> 01:38:39.471
<v Speaker 5>but I think they said that United States</v>
<v Speaker 5>has more prisoners than it was a giant</v>

2216
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.110
<v Speaker 5>number when they compared it to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world.</v>

2217
01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:46.560
<v Speaker 5>Like how many prisoners?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The will just look it up like the United</v>

2218
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.310
<v Speaker 5>States prisoners in comparison to</v>
<v Speaker 5>prisons combined the rest of the world</v>

2219
01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:52.470
<v Speaker 5>because it's insane how many we have</v>
<v Speaker 5>locked up.</v>

2220
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:55.980
<v Speaker 5>We got more prisoners and illegal</v>
<v Speaker 5>immigrants in California,</v>

2221
01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:58.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

2222
01:38:58.590 --> 01:38:59.570
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2223
01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:02.760
<v Speaker 5>but what the fuck is the solution to</v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

2224
01:39:02.761 --> 01:39:06.630
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a broken society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have a million people locked up</v>

2225
01:39:06.631 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 5>or whatever the hell we have locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't we have something like a million?</v>

2226
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:14.070
<v Speaker 5>How many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like where does the funding come</v>

2227
01:39:14.071 --> 01:39:14.970
<v Speaker 5>from?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is What trips me out?</v>

2228
01:39:14.971 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are they getting so much money off</v>

2229
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:17.610
<v Speaker 5>of it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2230
01:39:17.610 --> 01:39:19.320
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

2231
01:39:19.321 --> 01:39:22.440
<v Speaker 5>it's a business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whenever a company is getting paid</v>

2232
01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:25.290
<v Speaker 5>because people are in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a business.</v>

2233
01:39:25.410 --> 01:39:29.220
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's a state business or if it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a private business,</v>

2234
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 5>there's still businesses because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>cost money and they cost money and</v>

2235
01:39:33.331 --> 01:39:34.650
<v Speaker 5>people get paid to work there.</v>

2236
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:36.300
<v Speaker 5>So as soon as people get paid to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

2237
01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:39.180
<v Speaker 5>they want to keep those jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's always going to be a problem and</v>

2238
01:39:39.181 --> 01:39:42.210
<v Speaker 5>people get paid to work in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to keep those jobs also.</v>

2239
01:39:42.211 --> 01:39:46.200
<v Speaker 5>They lobby the lobby hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The prison guard union lobby,</v>

2240
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.560
<v Speaker 5>cops lobby 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>220,300 adults were incarcerated</v>

2241
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:55.080
<v Speaker 5>in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2242
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:56.940
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Additionally,</v>

2243
01:39:56.941 --> 01:39:58.200
<v Speaker 5>4 million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>750.</v>

2244
01:39:58.201 --> 01:40:03.201
<v Speaker 5>One thousand 400 adults in 2013 were on</v>
<v Speaker 5>probation or parole.</v>

2245
01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.300
<v Speaker 5>So that's a lot do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one in every 51 people is on</v>

2246
01:40:09.301 --> 01:40:11.490
<v Speaker 5>parole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is fucking crazy.</v>

2247
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:14.670
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now once you're on parole,</v>

2248
01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:18.930
<v Speaker 5>like you stay in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is a crazy number,</v>

2249
01:40:18.931 --> 01:40:20.400
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

2250
01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.640
<v Speaker 5>There's obviously too many things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are illegal.</v>

2251
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.470
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that want to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>

2252
01:40:25.471 --> 01:40:28.320
<v Speaker 5>We've got to figure out what's violent</v>
<v Speaker 5>crime,</v>

2253
01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.391
<v Speaker 5>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2254
01:40:29.391 --> 01:40:31.680
<v Speaker 5>what's crime?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's violent crime?</v>

2255
01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:33.110
<v Speaker 5>What's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's.</v>

2256
01:40:33.170 --> 01:40:35.580
<v Speaker 5>What does everybody agree?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't do camp kill people.</v>

2257
01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:39.650
<v Speaker 5>Everybody agrees like certain Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Figuring out what that is and now all</v>

2258
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.330
<v Speaker 5>that other shit you're locking people up</v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

2259
01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.710
<v Speaker 5>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop it.</v>

2260
01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get paid.</v>

2261
01:40:44.821 --> 01:40:47.280
<v Speaker 5>It's like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like every public defender gets what?</v>

2262
01:40:47.281 --> 01:40:51.190
<v Speaker 5>800 bucks for every time someone signs</v>
<v Speaker 5>for time and.</v>

2263
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:55.820
<v Speaker 5>But then there's also private prisons</v>
<v Speaker 5>was also prisons that get paid to the</v>

2264
01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 5>mean they are a business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They start a prison so that they can</v>

2265
01:40:58.930 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 5>make money by having people locked in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their cages.</v>

2266
01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:05.500
<v Speaker 5>That's probably sub them out and do work</v>
<v Speaker 5>around the highway and stuff and make</v>

2267
01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 5>money off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

2268
01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.880
<v Speaker 5>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably don't.</v>

2269
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would imagine if they made people</v>

2270
01:41:10.511 --> 01:41:13.810
<v Speaker 5>work in your prison and we've always</v>
<v Speaker 5>seen people working in prisons.</v>

2271
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:16.450
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would always assume that that's a big</v>

2272
01:41:16.451 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 5>part of it.</v>

2273
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 5>And you could make boots you make every.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We make our own boots,</v>

2274
01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.240
<v Speaker 5>our own clothes in there too because one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of my earliest jokes when I was like,</v>

2275
01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.910
<v Speaker 5>it was probably a hack joke and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>even know it,</v>

2276
01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.950
<v Speaker 5>but when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a live free or die was on the New</v>

2277
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.500
<v Speaker 5>Hampshire license plate and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine that.</v>

2278
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:38.500
<v Speaker 5>Live free or die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's fucked up about it as those</v>

2279
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:43.560
<v Speaker 5>plates are being made by prisoners so</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're in jail and they were right in</v>

2280
01:41:43.631 --> 01:41:48.631
<v Speaker 5>live free or die on a plate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck that was to be.</v>

2281
01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:51.640
<v Speaker 5>Kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kill Yourself,</v>

2282
01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 5>kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of my earliest jokes.</v>

2283
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 5>Probably one of 10 guys to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 5>it though,</v>

2284
01:41:58.061 --> 01:42:01.360
<v Speaker 5>because it's so obvious that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was always the big thing,</v>

2285
01:42:01.361 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>License plates.</v>

2327
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:49.780
<v Speaker 5>Pop Point in history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the people then didn't know that</v>

2328
01:43:49.781 --> 01:43:52.180
<v Speaker 5>they had slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't.</v>

2329
01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.410
<v Speaker 5>They didn't think slavery existed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

2330
01:43:54.411 --> 01:43:56.120
<v Speaker 5>slavery doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't.</v>

2331
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:59.930
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile that is exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 5>slavery is.</v>

2332
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:03.620
<v Speaker 5>Regardless of what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone murdered someone and someone</v>

2333
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.120
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is an argument that they should be</v>

2334
01:44:05.121 --> 01:44:07.760
<v Speaker 5>locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when they're working for thirty</v>

2335
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:11.330
<v Speaker 5>eight cents an hour because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>murdered somebody and they're making</v>

2336
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 5>shit that people are buying their</v>
<v Speaker 5>slaves.</v>

2337
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If just the government's buying it,</v>

2338
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.500
<v Speaker 5>that's a slave,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2339
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just thought of that right now.</v>

2340
01:44:20.511 --> 01:44:21.201
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I feel as a slave for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a slave.</v>

2342
01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:26.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people have always said slavery</v>

2343
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:30.140
<v Speaker 5>as barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you didn't know our culture and you</v>

2344
01:44:30.141 --> 01:44:32.840
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we accept this form of slavery as being</v>

2345
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:37.280
<v Speaker 5>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>restitution and you didn't know that.</v>

2346
01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.820
<v Speaker 5>Some people that are in there absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't deserve to be in there or were</v>

2347
01:44:40.821 --> 01:44:44.690
<v Speaker 5>railroaded on fault trumped up charges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's there's a percentage,</v>

2348
01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.120
<v Speaker 5>whether it's 100 or whatever the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

2349
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:51.590
<v Speaker 5>That person's a real person in jail</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now and they're working as a slave</v>

2350
01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:55.190
<v Speaker 5>to make body armor that's thirty eight</v>
<v Speaker 5>cents an hour.</v>

2351
01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:59.150
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That slavery is slavery.</v>

2352
01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.310
<v Speaker 5>Just figured out a way to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2353
01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 5>I figured out a way to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2354
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:08.300
<v Speaker 5>look at this.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Other Colorado programs help craft those</v>

2360
01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:26.900
<v Speaker 5>ubiquitous college dormitory desks and</v>
<v Speaker 5>bookshelves.</v>

2371
01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:08.030
<v Speaker 5>America right now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just just becoming aware of the</v>

2372
01:46:08.031 --> 01:46:11.480
<v Speaker 5>issue of wild horses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a wild horse issue in America.</v>

2373
01:46:11.770 --> 01:46:16.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean like they have gotten free and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've gone feral and they're wild and</v>

2374
01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.620
<v Speaker 5>apparently this tens of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2375

<v Speaker 5>What are they attacking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything.</v>

2376
01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hacking.</v>

2377

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:28.190
<v Speaker 5>They're encroaching on farmland and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're becoming a new.</v>

2379
01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:32.240
<v Speaker 5>We'll look at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horses roamed wild on the planes.</v>

2380
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:33.980
<v Speaker 5>That was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>

2381
01:46:33.981 --> 01:46:34.814
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long time ago.</v>

2382
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:38.180
<v Speaker 5>Then they actually went extinct in North</v>
<v Speaker 5>America and they were brought here from</v>

2383
01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:41.510
<v Speaker 5>other parts of the world where the rigid</v>
<v Speaker 5>originated in North America,</v>

2384
01:46:41.511 --> 01:46:45.110
<v Speaker 5>but they brought them other places so</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a point in time somewhere in</v>

2385
01:46:45.111 --> 01:46:47.420
<v Speaker 5>history or horses did run wild around</v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

2386
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.740
<v Speaker 5>but they killed a lot of them.</v>

2387
01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:52.500
<v Speaker 5>They killed them and they used them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They filled them with strychnine and fed</v>

2388
01:46:52.501 --> 01:46:55.770
<v Speaker 5>them to wolves to kill off the wolf</v>
<v Speaker 5>population because they were trying to</v>

2389
01:46:55.771 --> 01:47:00.420
<v Speaker 5>make everything safe for cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Raising that fucking crazy dude.</v>

2390
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:05.310
<v Speaker 5>Our country used to be this like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>wild area world is animals roam free,</v>

2391
01:47:05.490 --> 01:47:07.590
<v Speaker 5>but when cattlemen moved across the</v>
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

2392
01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.130
<v Speaker 5>they started doing these wild horses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're showing US Jamie in Nevada,</v>

2393

2394
01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:17.130
<v Speaker 5>but people see them there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2395
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 5>it's a common occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean these are like,</v>

2396
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:23.640
<v Speaker 5>like deer or like anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are giant wild animals.</v>

<v Speaker 5>things now because they're killing them.</v>

<v Speaker 5>there were doing it in the,</v>

2400
01:47:33.841 --> 01:47:34.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2401
01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:39.420
<v Speaker 5>the early 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would kill them and make a dog food</v>

2402
01:47:39.421 --> 01:47:43.290
<v Speaker 5>out of them because they needed meat for</v>
<v Speaker 5>pets.</v>

2403
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:47.100
<v Speaker 5>Like people really didn't have pets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there wasn't like a pet food</v>

2404
01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 5>industry the way there is today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2405
01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:52.200
<v Speaker 5>people just fed their pet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck they fed up,</v>

2406
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:53.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted a dog,</v>

2407
01:47:53.671 --> 01:47:56.940
<v Speaker 5>you feed him scraps or there was like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>big thing and a feed into your dog table</v>

2408
01:47:56.941 --> 01:47:59.100
<v Speaker 5>scraps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they started feeding them these</v>

2409
01:47:59.101 --> 01:48:01.050
<v Speaker 5>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they started killing all these horses</v>

2410
01:48:01.051 --> 01:48:05.970
<v Speaker 5>and they would kill horses for dog food</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they would kill horses and feed them</v>

2411
01:48:05.971 --> 01:48:07.770
<v Speaker 5>to the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for whatever reason,</v>

2412
01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:10.740
<v Speaker 5>we didn't eat horses over here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:48:10.741 --> 01:48:12.030
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2414
01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:15.630
<v Speaker 5>so they were doing this in Denver or in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nevada.</v>

2415
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.950
<v Speaker 5>That's in Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>

2416
01:48:16.951 --> 01:48:20.570
<v Speaker 5>those wild horses right there in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>video is wandered around the debt,</v>

2417
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.960
<v Speaker 5>the high country desert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

2418
01:48:22.230 --> 01:48:23.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we have that problem with a</v>

2419
01:48:23.431 --> 01:48:25.800
<v Speaker 5>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking flip out if it was horses in</v>

2420
01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:27.390
<v Speaker 5>the front of my fucking yard like that.</v>

2421
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.580
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you live out there,</v>

2422
01:48:29.581 --> 01:48:30.041
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

2423
01:48:30.041 --> 01:48:31.110
<v Speaker 5>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2424
01:48:31.111 --> 01:48:34.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many there are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is not like there's too</v>

2425
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.330
<v Speaker 5>many horses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is there's too many</v>

2426
01:48:36.331 --> 01:48:39.810
<v Speaker 5>horses that are going on with these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people's land that raised cattle and the</v>

2427
01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:42.780
<v Speaker 5>horses are grazing probably on the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>fields that cattle are and they're</v>

2428
01:48:42.781 --> 01:48:44.840
<v Speaker 5>getting pissed off taking the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2429
01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:47.340
<v Speaker 5>that's most likely what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I had to guess,</v>

2430
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:50.310
<v Speaker 5>it's just a bunch of greedy cattle guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>who don't know.</v>

2431
01:48:50.311 --> 01:48:52.740
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to lose greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2432
01:48:52.741 --> 01:48:55.680
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to protect their industry</v>
<v Speaker 5>to protect their interest.</v>

2433
01:48:55.681 --> 01:48:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like at a certain point in time,</v>

2434
01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:00.240
<v Speaker 5>we have to step in I think as humans and</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2435
01:49:00.241 --> 01:49:02.580
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it a bad thing to have these horses?</v>

2436
01:49:03.110 --> 01:49:04.050
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2437
01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.270
<v Speaker 5>what are they hurting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think they seem pretty cool.</v>

2438
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:08.130
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of cool to have wild horses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

2439
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:10.310
<v Speaker 5>Can we all agree?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of bad.</v>

2440
01:49:10.930 --> 01:49:14.700
<v Speaker 5>They seem to be thriving and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have to,</v>

2441
01:49:14.730 --> 01:49:18.030
<v Speaker 5>they're going to have to figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to manage their population because,</v>

2442
01:49:18.031 --> 01:49:18.850
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2443
01:49:18.850 --> 01:49:21.510
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to get jacked by too</v>
<v Speaker 5>many mountain lions.</v>

2444
01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:25.650
<v Speaker 5>The way a deer do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a horse that big animal and</v>

2445
01:49:25.651 --> 01:49:27.020
<v Speaker 5>then they kick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2446
01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm sure a mountain lion could</v>

2447
01:49:28.571 --> 01:49:30.030
<v Speaker 5>kill a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong,</v>

2448
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.980
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that'd be a lot of fun</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the Mountain Lion Entirety Ensemble.</v>

2449
01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:38.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think they'd bike back each other</v>

2450
01:49:38.101 --> 01:49:38.901
<v Speaker 5>up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get the horse.</v>

2451
01:49:38.901 --> 01:49:41.850
<v Speaker 5>Would they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would they do in Africa like,</v>

2452
01:49:41.851 --> 01:49:43.800
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm that different hood to</v>

2453
01:49:43.801 --> 01:49:48.000
<v Speaker 5>different hoods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is still cats and pray Predator</v>

2454
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>carnivores and herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The buffaloes in Africa,</v>

2455
01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.990
<v Speaker 2>they gang up and they go after lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lions are attacking one of their own.</v>

2456
01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wild to see.</v>

2457
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was little.</v>

2458
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.920
<v Speaker 2>My parents had a ranch in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a horse.</v>

2459
01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I love horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to tend to advice the</v>

2460
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:09.220
<v Speaker 2>right that fucker once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that?</v>

2461
01:50:09.221 --> 01:50:12.040
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know the Aztecs or so tripped</v>

2462
01:50:12.041 --> 01:50:14.380
<v Speaker 2>out by horses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to cut their heads off to.</v>

2463
01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2464
01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I learned because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2465
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:22.060
<v Speaker 2>that was the ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were offering a blood to the Sun</v>

2466
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:22.893
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2467
01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:26.650
<v Speaker 2>so they would cut your head off and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw you down those steps.</v>

2468
01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>
<v Speaker 2>Linda Cortez came.</v>

2469
01:50:30.671 --> 01:50:32.290
<v Speaker 2>That's what they did to the people at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>

2470
01:50:32.291 --> 01:50:35.380
<v Speaker 2>And they did it to the horses will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Cortez came,</v>

2471
01:50:35.381 --> 01:50:38.260
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that the first time they had ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen a person on a horse and they</v>

2472
01:50:38.261 --> 01:50:39.850
<v Speaker 2>thought the person was a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse?</v>

2473
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:44.420
<v Speaker 2>It never ceases wise in that crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you,</v>

2475
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen someone ride a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever written an animal.</v>

2476
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then also these dudes showed up riding</v>

2477
01:50:52.181 --> 01:50:55.720
<v Speaker 2>animals on a boat with like jackets on</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

2478
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:59.920
<v Speaker 2>That would be like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be the biggest baller ever in</v>

2479
01:50:59.921 --> 01:51:02.590
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled up in a boat and you stepped</v>

2480
01:51:02.591 --> 01:51:05.110
<v Speaker 2>off the boat and a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2481
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.310
<v Speaker 2>you got a sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2482
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:10.810
<v Speaker 2>who fucking dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he imagined those days.</v>

2483
01:51:10.811 --> 01:51:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Must have been so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what the crazy part is is they</v>

2484
01:51:15.011 --> 01:51:17.650
<v Speaker 2>say that Cortez tripped out when he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2485
01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:21.730
<v Speaker 2>these fuckers have irrigation perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sewers per.</v>

2486
01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Everything's bill perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why are they cutting people's heads</v>

2487
01:51:25.421 --> 01:51:27.850
<v Speaker 2>off and throwing these guys down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>steps?</v>

2488
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the Mayan Pyramids and</v>

2489
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:34.390
<v Speaker 2>some of the Aztec architecture that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed in that part of the world,</v>

2490
01:51:34.391 --> 01:51:39.391
<v Speaker 2>like they were on some crazy level that</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few civilizations have ever been on</v>

2491
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:43.750
<v Speaker 2>the Mayan temples all aligned</v>
<v Speaker 2>constellations or at least most of them</v>

2492
01:51:43.751 --> 01:51:44.290
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2493
01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:47.340
<v Speaker 2>So they had some sort of a deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and understanding of the.</v>

2494
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:50.770
<v Speaker 2>What they were seeing in the solar</v>
<v Speaker 2>system is also a lot of evidence</v>

2495
01:51:50.771 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 2>apparently that they understood about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wobble.</v>

2496
01:51:53.231 --> 01:51:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Like the earth has a wobble called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>procession of equinoxes and this wobble.</v>

2497
01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:00.640
<v Speaker 2>It still like the earth doesn't spin in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a perfect circle.</v>

2498
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:02.290
<v Speaker 2>There are standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2499
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:06.580
<v Speaker 2>in this 26,000 year wobble and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 26,000 years,</v>

2500
01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:10.210
<v Speaker 2>but the point is it doesn't spin</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly in the stars.</v>

2501
01:52:10.211 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Change their position in the sky</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending upon where in that cycle you</v>

2502
01:52:14.051 --> 01:52:14.681
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2503
01:52:14.681 --> 01:52:17.950
<v Speaker 2>the Mayans knew that they had outlined</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2504
01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they developed some sort of a calendar</v>

2505
01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 2>that has accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not more accurate than the calendar</v>

2506
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:26.660
<v Speaker 2>we use today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had,</v>

2507
01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:29.710
<v Speaker 2>they had figured out some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2508
01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

2509
01:52:31.111 --> 01:52:33.430
<v Speaker 2>That was like the thing you study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was crazy.</v>

2510
01:52:33.431 --> 01:52:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of tattoos of gods from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Aztec.</v>

2511
01:52:37.670 --> 01:52:41.770
<v Speaker 2>This is a certain God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're all certain gods and yeah,</v>

2512
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:43.630
<v Speaker 2>it's all in that calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy.</v>

2513
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Like I got the God on my of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was</v>

2514
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.900
<v Speaker 1>born on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what God is at Sochi socially.</v>

2515
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Both law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because he was like,</v>

2516
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:55.490
<v Speaker 1>he's a weird looking at your nipple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to let go.</v>

2517
01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that a prison one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2518
01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good work.</v>

2519
01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was solid right here.</v>

2520
01:53:02.931 --> 01:53:04.550
<v Speaker 1>He was with the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2521
01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:05.384
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2522
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:09.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a few moments in history that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would really love to go back and just be</v>

2523
01:53:09.261 --> 01:53:12.890
<v Speaker 1>like live in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an invisible bulletproof bubble.</v>

2524
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I just be able to sit in the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and just watch these people,</v>

2525
01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:18.160
<v Speaker 1>but one of the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ones.</v>

2526
01:53:18.161 --> 01:53:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I think if I had to choose one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd have to take the Egyptian</v>

2527
01:53:21.441 --> 01:53:24.680
<v Speaker 1>pyramid two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would love to see what the fuck</v>

2528
01:53:24.681 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 1>that looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right up there is I went to um,</v>

2529
01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.420
<v Speaker 1>a cheech and Anita went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the staff here.</v>

2530
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:32.630
<v Speaker 1>It's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2531
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:34.880
<v Speaker 1>like close to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2532
01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken Kuhn.</v>

2533
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe an hour and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of Toronto.</v>

2534
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

2535
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Yucatan,</v>

2536
01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:42.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2537
01:53:42.351 --> 01:53:44.330
<v Speaker 1>You done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of them down there.</v>

2538
01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:49.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of different sites that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these Mayan ruins,</v>

2539
01:53:49.461 --> 01:53:51.870
<v Speaker 1>but we went to teach nita and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around,</v>

2540
01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck inspired them to do this?</v>

2541
01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:59.160
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the pyramid that we went up and</v>

2542
01:53:59.230 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 1>you got to realize we're talking more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a thousand years ago.</v>

2543
01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:07.040
<v Speaker 1>They built this fucking thing and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they do it?</v>

2544
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that they were really</v>
<v Speaker 1>infatuated by the sun.</v>

2545
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would always like,</v>

2546
01:54:13.041 --> 01:54:17.840
<v Speaker 1>they felt when you gave the son blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were so scared of dark,</v>

2547
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:20.690
<v Speaker 1>they always wanted light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that structure.</v>

2548
01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

2549
01:54:22.131 --> 01:54:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I remember going there and seeing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and going,</v>

2550
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.670
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck are these people?</v>

2551
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Why they do this construction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every joint it's locked in.</v>

2552
01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Like our construction nowadays can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock joins huddles.</v>

2553
01:54:33.650 --> 01:54:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Joints are locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they did an amazing job,</v>

2554
01:54:36.201 --> 01:54:38.600
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The engineering is impeccable because</v>

2555
01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.630
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at it in perfect form</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially except for a little bit</v>

2556
01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 1>aware more than a thousand years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just beautiful.</v>

2557
01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the construction of it</v>

2558
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:47.900
<v Speaker 1>and you walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2559
01:54:47.901 --> 01:54:51.620
<v Speaker 1>this is some serious engine on and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the highest site.</v>

2560
01:54:51.621 --> 01:54:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So no flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the way it faces the sun</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2562
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed a lot of fucking people on</v>

2563
01:54:59.721 --> 01:55:02.000
<v Speaker 1>that thing right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was where they would cut dudes</v>

2564
01:55:02.001 --> 01:55:03.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking hearts out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2565
01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Right on top of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would do it right on top of.</v>

2566
01:55:05.871 --> 01:55:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Is he like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a little tray for human</v>

2567
01:55:08.181 --> 01:55:09.760
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually,</v>

2568
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:11.300
<v Speaker 1>he's actually a god.</v>

2569
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:14.180
<v Speaker 1>They believed that he took those hearts</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the underworld.</v>

2570
01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.480
<v Speaker 1>You should check it out at some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad drawings.</v>

2571
01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guide when I was there.</v>

2572
01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:24.540
<v Speaker 1>We hired this guy who was a professor at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a local university and he.</v>

2573
01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:28.370
<v Speaker 1>He doubled as a god and he gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical lesson about the entire</v>

2574
01:55:28.371 --> 01:55:29.930
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing,</v>

2575
01:55:29.931 --> 01:55:32.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing because this guy knew so</v>

2576
01:55:32.421 --> 01:55:36.710
<v Speaker 1>much about Mayan history and he also</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that they were really into eating</v>

2577
01:55:36.711 --> 01:55:39.460
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that there was this place that</v>

2578
01:55:39.461 --> 01:55:43.290
<v Speaker 1>would go that had something had like</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] acid in it and they would,</v>

2579
01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:48.320
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the elements in the LSD</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently like what is a lsd stand for</v>

2580
01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:50.380
<v Speaker 1>life surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2581
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but allergic acid is in there,</v>

2582
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:56.820
<v Speaker 1>but he was saying that they believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whatever they had was some sort of</v>

2583
01:55:56.821 --> 01:56:01.470
<v Speaker 1>a psychedelic lsd like compound and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had this room and he took us to this</v>

2584
01:56:01.471 --> 01:56:03.340
<v Speaker 1>room where they would do it in there.</v>

2585
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:07.410
<v Speaker 1>They had like a specific one of those in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the structures,</v>

2586
01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.650
<v Speaker 1>this specific room where they would do</v>
<v Speaker 1>their psychedelic rituals.</v>

2587
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:13.500
<v Speaker 1>They were tripping their balls off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they saw that shit.</v>

2588
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:18.750
<v Speaker 1>They're cutting people's heads off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And have you ever seen apocalypto the</v>

2589
01:56:18.751 --> 01:56:20.250
<v Speaker 1>little kids right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling them mom,</v>

2590
01:56:20.251 --> 01:56:21.720

<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2591
01:56:21.721 --> 01:56:26.721
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy time in the world.</v>

2592
01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

2593
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:30.390
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You said Mayan.</v>

2595
01:56:32.630 --> 01:56:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Then you said the Egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you wanted to go to another</v>

2596
01:56:35.761 --> 01:56:38.180
<v Speaker 1>place another time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaviscon.</v>

2597
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2598
01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what the fuck that was</v>

2599
01:56:42.241 --> 01:56:44.840
<v Speaker 1>like because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take them on or to join.</v>

2600
01:56:44.890 --> 01:56:45.691
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2601
01:56:45.691 --> 01:56:46.560
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Watch.</v>

2602
01:56:46.561 --> 01:56:48.480
<v Speaker 1>See how crazy life was back then.</v>

2603
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to live in any of those</v>

2604
01:56:50.731 --> 01:56:51.750
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would want to,</v>

2605
01:56:51.751 --> 01:56:54.540
<v Speaker 1>if I could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone does legitimately one day</v>

2606
01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 1>come up with a time machine and say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2607
01:56:56.701 --> 01:56:57.690
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 10 grand.</v>

2608
01:56:57.691 --> 01:57:02.691
<v Speaker 1>But you can go back to Egypt for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>our pal people would totally save up.</v>

2609
01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about it costs a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand bucks if you're going to go to</v>

2610
01:57:07.111 --> 01:57:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2611
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Plane Fare and hotel room and then your</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

2612
01:57:10.981 --> 01:57:11.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2613
01:57:11.421 --> 01:57:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you're into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2614
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2615
01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:14.370
<v Speaker 1>10 grand more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For how long,</v>

2616
01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:19.080
<v Speaker 1>how long are you in our one hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hour and like this one hour in Egypt</v>

2617
01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:22.320
<v Speaker 1>during like some sort of ceremony and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be there and get a chance to</v>

2618
01:57:22.321 --> 01:57:24.320
<v Speaker 1>see it when Moses was in the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2619
01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:31.640
<v Speaker 1>imagine what it would be like to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sacrifices that like when they</v>

2620
01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:32.940
<v Speaker 1>built.</v>

2621
01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:35.670
<v Speaker 1>What was it the pyramid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say it too?</v>

2622
01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:37.140
<v Speaker 1>To ICAN?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say that?</v>

2623
01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:41.210
<v Speaker 1>The Aztec pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find that that much shit</v>

2624
01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:46.220
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed 80,000 people inside of a</v>

2625
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 1>few days and sacrifices not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the religion.</v>

2626
01:57:51.691 --> 01:57:56.490
<v Speaker 1>That belief and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing to do,</v>

2627
01:57:56.491 --> 01:57:57.810
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2628
01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop and think of that number.</v>

2629
01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:03.450
<v Speaker 1>80,000 people and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was within a few days,</v>

2630
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I think they killed all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on the pyramid.</v>

2631
01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:08.430
<v Speaker 1>All the slaves that worked on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid,</v>

2632
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.170
<v Speaker 1>all of them got the knife I get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to pay.</v>

2633
01:58:13.171 --> 01:58:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Social security</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the first ones are like,</v>

2634
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you fuckers getting work comp or</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2635
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:26.090
<v Speaker 1>How insane is that time of life like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that humans had agreed to that,</v>

2636
01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:28.850
<v Speaker 1>that that was going to be the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

2637
01:58:28.851 --> 01:58:29.684
<v Speaker 1>that was the plan.</v>

2638
01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.220
<v Speaker 1>We got these slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got into build this thing and then</v>

2639
01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cut their hearts out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2640
01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:34.381
<v Speaker 1>We're cool with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2641
01:58:34.381 --> 01:58:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2642
01:58:35.331 --> 01:58:36.164
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2643
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's cut their hearts out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is people.</v>

2644
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 1>This is human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a totally different time in the</v>

2645
01:58:42.431 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 1>world and really not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2646
01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:48.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of weird because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even care.</v>

2647
01:58:48.071 --> 01:58:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Like if there was no more people left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do they know there's not other</v>

2648
01:58:51.971 --> 01:58:53.170
<v Speaker 1>people left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2649
01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David will be the last people down</v>

2650
01:58:56.150 --> 01:58:59.530
<v Speaker 1>cutting 85,000 dudes or 80,000 dudes</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearts out.</v>

2651
01:59:00.130 --> 01:59:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the guys I had to clean up all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit though.</v>

2652
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 1>80,000 bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2653
01:59:04.961 --> 01:59:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I bet they did a shitty job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

2654
01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I bet they weren't very motivated to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking kill me too,</v>

2655
01:59:10.121 --> 01:59:10.954
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2656
01:59:11.650 --> 01:59:13.300
<v Speaker 1>take your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take your time.</v>

2657
01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is the body cleaner?</v>

2658
01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things they said</v>

2659
01:59:15.851 --> 01:59:19.060
<v Speaker 1>about gangs con that when Genghis Kahn</v>
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>

2660
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:24.010
<v Speaker 1>they buried him and then they killed all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that buried him and then they</v>

2661
01:59:24.011 --> 01:59:26.260
<v Speaker 1>killed the people that killed the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that buried him.</v>

2662
01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a super</v>

2663
01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:33.370
<v Speaker 1>gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets you kill everybody.</v>

2664
01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that has any idea where he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>buried.</v>

2665
01:59:35.471 --> 01:59:40.260
<v Speaker 1>So no one could ever find the great con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So only the guy that ordered the hit</v>

2666
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:44.320
<v Speaker 1>nosa even he doesn't know far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's dead.</v>

2667
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:46.270
<v Speaker 1>The people that ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed them too.</v>

2668
01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:48.640
<v Speaker 1>They killed everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no one knows.</v>

2669
01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:52.000
<v Speaker 1>No one knows where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just put a burn the body and acid and</v>

2670
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:54.400
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good call.</v>

2671
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:56.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have to have rituals.</v>

2672
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to you,</v>

2673
01:59:58.781 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Mongol order to make it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next stage of life,</v>

2674
02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>you probably have.</v>

2675
02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:07.330
<v Speaker 1>They probably have some crazy rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to come back with a</v>

2676
02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that point in history seems like it</v>

2677
02:00:10.690 --> 02:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>would be pretty insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said the gang is con killed like 10</v>

2678
02:00:13.571 --> 02:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>percent of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a New York Times article about</v>

2679
02:00:16.121 --> 02:00:21.121
<v Speaker 1>it that he killed 10 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world's population and he apparently</v>

2680
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>changed the carbon footprint of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human race.</v>

2681
02:00:26.890 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Meaning it killed so many fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2682
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>There was less soot in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was less carbon because of fires.</v>

2683
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changed far away the foot.</v>

2684
02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.050
<v Speaker 1>What are residue on earth is when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do those core samples.</v>

2685
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:44.860
<v Speaker 1>That's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2686
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody listening to this,</v>

2687
02:00:46.511 --> 02:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>if you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've might have heard this before,</v>

2688
02:00:48.191 --> 02:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>but I have to say it to people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't hardcore history.</v>

2689
02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Dan Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on last week.</v>

2690
02:00:53.591 --> 02:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the best ever at like doing history</v>

2691
02:00:57.521 --> 02:00:59.350
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a monster.</v>

2692
02:00:59.410 --> 02:01:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Him and Danielle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ebola.</v>

2693
02:01:00.431 --> 02:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>

2694
02:01:02.770 --> 02:01:06.430
<v Speaker 1>he's got a series on the Gig is con days</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the wrath of the con.</v>

2695
02:01:06.610 --> 02:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a five part series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get it on itunes.</v>

2696
02:01:09.181 --> 02:01:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dollar 99 a show or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

2697
02:01:12.341 --> 02:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's hours and hours long folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are.</v>

2698
02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't run,</v>

2699
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it used to be free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he does like the first x amount of</v>

2700
02:01:19.571 --> 02:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>free and then because he only does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2701
02:01:21.970 --> 02:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it takes months to put one of these out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like asking someone to pay for</v>

2702
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>a regular podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an audio book.</v>

2703
02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he go out to all these places?</v>

2704
02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2705
02:01:31.421 --> 02:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He studied,</v>

2706
02:01:32.941 --> 02:01:34.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mongols ever since he was in</v>

2707
02:01:34.691 --> 02:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did a,</v>

2708
02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>wrote a report about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was part of the,</v>

2709
02:01:38.711 --> 02:01:40.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2710
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 5>podcast series that he does on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He talks about his history with the</v>

2711
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:47.480
<v Speaker 5>history of the Mongols,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's amazing and that's what got me</v>

2712
02:01:47.481 --> 02:01:49.460
<v Speaker 5>excited about the Mongols and starting</v>
<v Speaker 5>to check it out.</v>

2713
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:54.461
<v Speaker 5>But I just would love to see what crazy</v>
<v Speaker 5>points in time looked like.</v>

2714
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:59.060
<v Speaker 5>Like how as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how we evolved with thinking and</v>

2715
02:01:59.061 --> 02:02:00.430
<v Speaker 5>fighting and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2716
02:02:00.730 --> 02:02:03.560
<v Speaker 5>you mean there's levels of craziness in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this world right now,</v>

2717
02:02:03.561 --> 02:02:05.600
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like somewhere there's some dudes that</v>

2718
02:02:05.601 --> 02:02:08.000
<v Speaker 5>are working as slaves making blue jeans</v>
<v Speaker 5>for some company,</v>

2719
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.841
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2720
02:02:08.841 --> 02:02:10.450
<v Speaker 5>and they're prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2721
02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:13.760
<v Speaker 5>there's that world is a world that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience when you're in the county and</v>

2722
02:02:13.761 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 5>a riot breaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This world is very different than the</v>

2723
02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:19.910
<v Speaker 5>world that most people experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But our world itself,</v>

2724
02:02:19.911 --> 02:02:21.890
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the variables that we know that are</v>

2725
02:02:21.891 --> 02:02:24.590
<v Speaker 5>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's prison or or war or all</v>

2726
02:02:24.591 --> 02:02:25.940
<v Speaker 5>these things we know to be possible.</v>

2727
02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:29.960
<v Speaker 5>They are very different than it was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>thousand years ago or 2000 or whatever.</v>

2728
02:02:29.961 --> 02:02:34.640
<v Speaker 5>The Egypt was 4,500 plus years ago that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were building the great pyramid.</v>

2729
02:02:34.641 --> 02:02:38.270
<v Speaker 5>Apparently fucking life would have been</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy and insane.</v>

2730
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't even imagine what they say.</v>

2731
02:02:40.161 --> 02:02:43.730
<v Speaker 5>The Great Pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they said it's 2,500 BC when</v>

2732
02:02:43.731 --> 02:02:46.760
<v Speaker 5>they carbon tested to some of the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>in it,</v>

2733
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:52.030
<v Speaker 5>which is 4,000 plus years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to like hold your head how</v>

2734
02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.860
<v Speaker 5>you would hurt your head to think of how</v>
<v Speaker 5>long ago that was.</v>

2735
02:02:55.150 --> 02:02:59.420
<v Speaker 5>Hundreds and hundreds of years and</v>
<v Speaker 5>people living and dying and change</v>

2736
02:02:59.421 --> 02:03:02.810
<v Speaker 5>occurring and things in the climate</v>
<v Speaker 5>shifts and the,</v>

2737
02:03:02.811 --> 02:03:03.471
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2738
02:03:03.471 --> 02:03:05.710
<v Speaker 5>the earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings,</v>

2739
02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:09.560
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much craziness and it's so long and</v>

2740
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:13.670
<v Speaker 5>if you go that far back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these motherfuckers built some insane</v>

2741
02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:17.990
<v Speaker 5>shit that we can't barely built today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would have to have a team of</v>

2742
02:03:17.991 --> 02:03:22.100
<v Speaker 5>engineers from all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest cranes ever to try to put</v>

2743
02:03:22.101 --> 02:03:24.150
<v Speaker 5>together one of those in just a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2744
02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:26.480
<v Speaker 5>in a decade or two decades.</v>

2745
02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:30.470
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that like the machines wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>even work in that climate.</v>

2746
02:03:30.510 --> 02:03:32.450
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't even know how to adjust to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sand.</v>

2747
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.030
<v Speaker 5>They'd have to make better machines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mean it could be done.</v>

2748
02:03:35.090 --> 02:03:36.890
<v Speaker 5>I think it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not,</v>

2749
02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:41.360
<v Speaker 5>it's not simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they did was so spectacular and the</v>

2750
02:03:41.361 --> 02:03:44.870
<v Speaker 5>idea that they did it 2,500 BC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>4,000,</v>

2751
02:03:44.871 --> 02:03:47.330
<v Speaker 5>500 plus years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking crazy.</v>

2752
02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.150
<v Speaker 5>Hard to imagine they did that shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>before Jesus.</v>

2753
02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:51.590
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2754
02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:54.290
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just love to see what it looked</v>

2755
02:03:54.291 --> 02:03:57.770
<v Speaker 5>like back then like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the first day there were done.</v>

2756
02:03:57.771 --> 02:04:01.130
<v Speaker 5>Imagine how that just what it would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>like to live in that era.</v>

2757
02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.740
<v Speaker 5>Like what were their markets like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2758
02:04:02.741 --> 02:04:05.090
<v Speaker 5>how smart were they?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I would love to be able to speak</v>

2759
02:04:05.091 --> 02:04:08.540
<v Speaker 5>their language and talked to one of them</v>
<v Speaker 5>from back then because I just think that</v>

2760
02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:12.500
<v Speaker 5>someone who builds that they must have</v>
<v Speaker 5>been insanely smart.</v>

2761
02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.750
<v Speaker 5>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But also.</v>

2762
02:04:14.751 --> 02:04:17.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean I agree with what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there were kind of like assholes</v>

2763
02:04:17.661 --> 02:04:19.580
<v Speaker 5>because they have slaves as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2764
02:04:19.581 --> 02:04:22.640
<v Speaker 5>that was a common misconception.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They thought that they had slaves until</v>

2765
02:04:22.641 --> 02:04:25.820
<v Speaker 5>pretty recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now they realized by the quality of</v>

2766
02:04:25.821 --> 02:04:30.290
<v Speaker 5>the food and the pottery that they had</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their shelters,</v>

2767
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:35.330
<v Speaker 5>that they were highly paid workers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the new theory is to get someone</v>

2768
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:39.630
<v Speaker 5>to build something like that you to see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is it's so hard to know.</v>

2769
02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:41.190
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might've been slaves that were</v>

2770
02:04:41.191 --> 02:04:44.070
<v Speaker 5>taken care of really well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so hard to know because it's so</v>

2771
02:04:44.071 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 5>long ago and they're basing it just on</v>
<v Speaker 5>pottery and bones,</v>

2772
02:04:47.311 --> 02:04:49.830
<v Speaker 5>like the type of food that they ate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They ate well,</v>

2773
02:04:50.010 --> 02:04:52.920
<v Speaker 5>but you would have to eat well if you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>moving these giant stones to you.</v>

2774
02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:56.520
<v Speaker 5>It would be within your best interest to</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep your slave super healthy.</v>

2775
02:04:56.670 --> 02:05:00.600
<v Speaker 5>They have to move stones all day and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny because we just have a theory</v>

2776
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:03.720
<v Speaker 5>of how they did it with ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They really do it.</v>

2777
02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:05.820
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of different theories</v>

2778
02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 5>making ramps and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of them are really very good</v>

2779
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:14.870
<v Speaker 5>because I think none of them address the</v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility that they had some kind of</v>

2780
02:05:15.330 --> 02:05:17.850
<v Speaker 5>technology or understanding that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have anymore.</v>

2781
02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:21.420
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's some sort of a machine they</v>
<v Speaker 5>created or some sort of a lever system</v>

2782
02:05:21.421 --> 02:05:23.870
<v Speaker 5>they created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is entirely possible that like,</v>

2783
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.620
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're talking about your time in</v>

2784
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:29.820
<v Speaker 5>prison or people making tattoo guns out</v>
<v Speaker 5>a wire and you know,</v>

2785
02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:33.040
<v Speaker 5>taking something from a broom and</v>
<v Speaker 5>sharpen it and sterilizing it and then</v>

2786
02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:36.660
<v Speaker 5>making the suit and doing it for days</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that kind of ingenuity just in</v>

2787
02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:41.840
<v Speaker 5>three years of prison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine 3000 plus years of people trying</v>

2788
02:05:42.481 --> 02:05:47.481
<v Speaker 5>to get by and make do during this weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>time where there's no electricity,</v>

2789
02:05:47.671 --> 02:05:49.790
<v Speaker 5>there's no engines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no they,</v>

2790
02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.440
<v Speaker 5>they have the same kind of mind that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have today that I have today that we're</v>

2791
02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:58.290
<v Speaker 5>like modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they lived in this time where there</v>

2792
02:05:58.291 --> 02:06:01.110
<v Speaker 5>was no modern inventions and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>figured out how to make pyramids.</v>

2793
02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll point and then I guess there's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say that the way that their son</v>

2794
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:10.670
<v Speaker 3>like hits a certain thing in there.</v>

2795
02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:12.600
<v Speaker 5>Well some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2796
02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:14.640
<v Speaker 5>but it depends on what time of year</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2797
02:06:14.641 --> 02:06:16.440
<v Speaker 5>because of that procession of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>equinoxes,</v>

2798
02:06:16.441 --> 02:06:20.280
<v Speaker 5>the way the earth wobbles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it depends on what time of year depends</v>

2799
02:06:20.281 --> 02:06:23.670
<v Speaker 5>on what year the cycle is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2800
02:06:23.671 --> 02:06:27.940
<v Speaker 5>like this procession of the equinox is</v>
<v Speaker 5>also points to the fact that that's</v>

2801
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:31.830
<v Speaker 5>finks at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably I think something like 10,000,</v>

2802
02:06:31.831 --> 02:06:33.810
<v Speaker 5>500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>face the sun,</v>

2803
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.300
<v Speaker 5>the face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Constellation Leo.</v>

2804
02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:40.710
<v Speaker 5>So there's a reason why the lion was</v>
<v Speaker 5>facing in that direction because they</v>

2805
02:06:40.711 --> 02:06:42.620
<v Speaker 5>had apparently the Zodiac</v>
<v Speaker 5>constellations.</v>

2806
02:06:42.621 --> 02:06:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even like way as back as I'm the</v>

2807
02:06:45.391 --> 02:06:48.270
<v Speaker 5>Sumerians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they had all the signs of the</v>

2808
02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:52.170
<v Speaker 5>Zodiac way back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they had the fish and the lady with</v>

2809
02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:53.220
<v Speaker 5>the skate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scales,</v>

2810
02:06:53.221 --> 02:06:55.440
<v Speaker 5>all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure they had those</v>

2811
02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:56.970
<v Speaker 5>constellations way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

2812
02:06:56.971 --> 02:06:58.200
<v Speaker 5>way the fuck back then.</v>

2813
02:06:58.720 --> 02:06:59.620
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2814
02:06:59.621 --> 02:07:00.454
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said</v>

2815
02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:03.400
<v Speaker 3>I could barely put my tent up.</v>

2816
02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:06.561
<v Speaker 5>That's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2817
02:07:06.561 --> 02:07:07.970
<v Speaker 5>You were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2818
02:07:07.971 --> 02:07:10.700
<v Speaker 5>living in prison data you would adapt</v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

2819
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:11.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

2820
02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:13.770
<v Speaker 3>like see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

2821
02:07:13.771 --> 02:07:16.290
<v Speaker 3>You made me understand something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was kind of like to me I</v>

2822
02:07:16.291 --> 02:07:19.290
<v Speaker 3>felt like they were in prison to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only reason I adapted to it because I</v>

2823
02:07:19.291 --> 02:07:22.110
<v Speaker 3>had nothing else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was there.</v>

2824
02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like they have like what's there.</v>

2825
02:07:24.601 --> 02:07:27.600
<v Speaker 3>But like now that like I have all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend told me this,</v>

2826
02:07:27.601 --> 02:07:29.430
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry I talk,</v>

2827
02:07:29.431 --> 02:07:30.720
<v Speaker 3>we're going to jump in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2828
02:07:30.721 --> 02:07:32.340
<v Speaker 3>hey dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in prison,</v>

2829
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>you have nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you always want to</v>

2830
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 5>do something but you can't because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're confined.</v>

2831
02:07:38.410 --> 02:07:42.000
<v Speaker 5>But now that you're home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't sit at the fucking house called do</v>

2832
02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:44.170
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] you been wanting to do</v>

2833
02:07:44.171 --> 02:07:46.210
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I catch myself sitting at home</v>

2834
02:07:46.211 --> 02:07:49.120
<v Speaker 5>like</v>
<v Speaker 5>so used to this,</v>

2835
02:07:49.121 --> 02:07:50.170
<v Speaker 5>get out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get out.</v>

2836
02:07:50.171 --> 02:07:52.990
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to get arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The trap.</v>

2837
02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:57.400
<v Speaker 5>So fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can imagine that they were just like,</v>

2838
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:59.950
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's build a pyramid.</v>

2839
02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:02.470
<v Speaker 5>And their world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The world was a prison.</v>

2840
02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean think of how barbaric the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>was 4,500 plus years ago.</v>

2841
02:08:07.361 --> 02:08:10.720
<v Speaker 5>How barbaric was the world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How was the weather?</v>

2842
02:08:10.721 --> 02:08:11.710
<v Speaker 5>We do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we do.</v>

2843
02:08:11.711 --> 02:08:16.711
<v Speaker 5>We have proof of how the weather was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think that up until around 9,000 bc</v>

2844
02:08:18.730 --> 02:08:22.000
<v Speaker 5>it was a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well from 9,000 BC rather back,</v>

2845
02:08:22.150 --> 02:08:25.630
<v Speaker 5>it was a tropical rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really interesting.</v>

2846
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:30.610
<v Speaker 5>They think that it resembled the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>rain forest you see in like the Amazon</v>

2847
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:31.230
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2848
02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 5>It was beautiful rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the climate shifted for whatever</v>

2849
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:37.810
<v Speaker 5>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's one of the main arguments</v>

2850
02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:41.860
<v Speaker 5>that the sphinx is way older than people</v>
<v Speaker 5>think it is because it has all this</v>

2851
02:08:41.861 --> 02:08:44.230
<v Speaker 5>water erosion all throughout the outside</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

2852
02:08:44.231 --> 02:08:48.160
<v Speaker 5>It's a very hotly debated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's some archeologists that</v>

2853
02:08:48.161 --> 02:08:51.880
<v Speaker 5>refuse to believe it because that would</v>
<v Speaker 5>indicate that it was made somewhere,</v>

2854
02:08:52.210 --> 02:08:56.410
<v Speaker 5>not just 9,000 bc but thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 5>before that because it has like</v>

2855
02:08:56.411 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years of water erosion on</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and they think that erosion is wind</v>

2856
02:09:00.761 --> 02:09:03.650
<v Speaker 5>and sand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real hotly debated subjects and</v>

2857
02:09:03.651 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really smart enough or educated</v>
<v Speaker 5>enough to make a call either way,</v>

2858
02:09:06.761 --> 02:09:10.600
<v Speaker 5>but when I look at it and you listened</v>
<v Speaker 5>to geologists like this guy,</v>

2859
02:09:10.601 --> 02:09:15.250
<v Speaker 5>Dr Robert Schoch from Boston University</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of staked his reputation on it</v>

2860
02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:18.010
<v Speaker 5>because he's received a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>criticism,</v>

2861
02:09:18.011 --> 02:09:20.230
<v Speaker 5>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is thousands of years of rainfall</v>

2862
02:09:20.231 --> 02:09:21.970
<v Speaker 5>that's made this a road like this.</v>

2863
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.910
<v Speaker 5>Which means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means they built that thing</v>

2864
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:26.980
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even before that,</v>

2865
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:29.710
<v Speaker 5>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to think that the Egyptian</v>

2866
02:09:29.711 --> 02:09:34.711
<v Speaker 5>civilization neatly arrived around 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>BC and there's no way it can be any</v>

2867
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:37.660
<v Speaker 5>earlier than that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people back then didn't know anything.</v>

2868
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:39.160
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck did they know how to do it?</v>

2869
02:09:39.161 --> 02:09:41.920
<v Speaker 5>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make any sense either.</v>

2870
02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:43.990
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make less sense that people</v>

2871
02:09:43.991 --> 02:09:48.130
<v Speaker 5>knew how to do it at 9,000 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all crazy with whatever they did</v>

2872
02:09:48.131 --> 02:09:49.150
<v Speaker 5>was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2873
02:09:49.151 --> 02:09:52.630
<v Speaker 5>They and they live like ballers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They always gold if gold everywhere.</v>

2874
02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:58.330
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at King Tut sarcophagus.</v>

2875
02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.660
<v Speaker 5>Sarcophagus covered in fucking gold leaf</v>
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

2876
02:10:01.690 --> 02:10:03.490
<v Speaker 5>They were a great artist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2877
02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:08.050
<v Speaker 5>Well they wrote in symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had these weird ways of writing</v>

2878
02:10:08.370 --> 02:10:11.960
<v Speaker 5>where they like images or symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

2879
02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:16.930
<v Speaker 5>we look at a word like you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>look of the word sandwich and okay see</v>

2880
02:10:16.931 --> 02:10:20.440
<v Speaker 5>those letters laid out and they have an</v>
<v Speaker 5>image in your mind and that becomes your</v>

2881
02:10:20.650 --> 02:10:22.360
<v Speaker 5>form of language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's your written language.</v>

2882
02:10:22.750 --> 02:10:26.770
<v Speaker 5>But they had like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had an image based language,</v>

2883
02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:30.550
<v Speaker 5>so it's a very different way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 5>like so did,</v>

2884
02:10:30.551 --> 02:10:32.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Mayans had another one,</v>

2885
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 5>image based kind</v>

2886
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 1>of a language to those imaged based</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are very bizarre because you</v>

2887
02:10:38.211 --> 02:10:43.211
<v Speaker 1>gotta realize like language and the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's used shapes the world and one of</v>

2888
02:10:43.761 --> 02:10:48.761
<v Speaker 1>the big problems that we're having as</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians is the subtlety of the English</v>

2889
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:53.990
<v Speaker 1>language and the things that people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can't be offended by.</v>

2890
02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>So instead of conveying pure intent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of anything you're saying,</v>

2891
02:10:58.251 --> 02:11:03.251
<v Speaker 1>conveying pure intent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this giant variable of what you</v>

2892
02:11:03.321 --> 02:11:05.300
<v Speaker 1>can and can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you shouldn't,</v>

2893
02:11:05.301 --> 02:11:07.190
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2894
02:11:07.191 --> 02:11:09.740
<v Speaker 1>what is offensive to some people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

2895
02:11:09.810 --> 02:11:10.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2896
02:11:10.730 --> 02:11:14.720
<v Speaker 1>what you think is okay because you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and you feel that there's so much</v>

2897
02:11:14.721 --> 02:11:17.990
<v Speaker 1>going on with the English language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to think that if your</v>

2898
02:11:17.991 --> 02:11:22.991
<v Speaker 1>language was based in images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would probably have a different feel</v>

2899
02:11:23.271 --> 02:11:25.280
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would wonder what would that feel</v>

2900
02:11:25.281 --> 02:11:26.114
<v Speaker 1>would be like.</v>

2901
02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:27.980
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting how you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2902
02:11:27.981 --> 02:11:30.080
<v Speaker 1>because we sound shit out over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2903
02:11:30.081 --> 02:11:31.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it means.</v>

2904
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>They must have obviously have a spoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

2905
02:11:34.131 --> 02:11:37.160
<v Speaker 1>That's really weird too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the Egyptian spoke.</v>

2906
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I want to say they probably spoke at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they speak.</v>

2907
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:43.430
<v Speaker 1>If you ask people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the Egyptian,</v>

2908
02:11:43.431 --> 02:11:45.020
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Egyptians speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

2909
02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:46.370
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of that.</v>

2910
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Egypt would have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2911
02:11:49.491 --> 02:11:53.360
<v Speaker 1>apparently they had a gigantic library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the library of Alexandria,</v>

2912
02:11:53.361 --> 02:11:55.880
<v Speaker 1>and it was burned a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

2913
02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Coptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2914
02:11:57.531 --> 02:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2915
02:11:58.990 --> 02:12:02.090
<v Speaker 1>17th until late 17th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Dot d,</v>

2916
02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:04.490
<v Speaker 1>the form of Coptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a gypsy.</v>

2917
02:12:04.610 --> 02:12:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The national language of modern day</v>

2918
02:12:07.791 --> 02:12:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian is Egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic,</v>

2919
02:12:09.381 --> 02:12:12.650
<v Speaker 1>which gradually replaced Coptic as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language of daily life.</v>

2920
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:13.820
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2921
02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the Muslims conquest in Egypt,</v>

2922
02:12:17.121 --> 02:12:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Coptic is still used as the literal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>drew litterer.</v>

2923
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Litterer liturgical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The typical liturgical language of the</v>

2924
02:12:26.210 --> 02:12:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Coptic Church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2925
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have had a hard time with that</v>

2926
02:12:30.261 --> 02:12:33.650
<v Speaker 1>word to what does this King Tut's dagger</v>
<v Speaker 1>made from iron from the sky.</v>

2927
02:12:33.651 --> 02:12:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found a dagger.</v>

2928
02:12:35.630 --> 02:12:37.550
<v Speaker 1>That was King Tut's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That came from a media,</v>

2929
02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:40.430
<v Speaker 1>they took them beat here and hammered it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out</v>

2930
02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:42.450
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

2931
02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy who does that today.</v>

2932
02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:46.970
<v Speaker 1>He makes custom knives made out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meteors.</v>

2933
02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:52.130
<v Speaker 1>If you Google Anthony Bordain had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>knife made out of a media,</v>

2934
02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:54.770
<v Speaker 1>how do you get the meteor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2935
02:12:54.970 --> 02:12:58.490
<v Speaker 1>you can collect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's enough of them land in places</v>

2936
02:12:58.491 --> 02:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>where people have collected them and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually buy media rights.</v>

2937
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Literally iron iron from space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they take this iron from space and I</v>

2938
02:13:08.070 --> 02:13:10.640
<v Speaker 1>fell in to say his name is Klein Klein</v>
<v Speaker 1>knives,</v>

2939
02:13:11.090 --> 02:13:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but he's Steve Klein said his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2940
02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:14.353
<v Speaker 1>that's not his name.</v>

2941
02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:17.413
<v Speaker 1>Kramer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2942
02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Steve Kramer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Kramer.</v>

2943
02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Steve Klein is a awesome pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cue Maker.</v>

2944
02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:23.260
<v Speaker 1>My bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2945
02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Bob Kramer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>

2946
02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:26.330
<v Speaker 1>How do they melt it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a certain degree.</v>

2947
02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put it inside of this crazy furnace</v>

2948
02:13:29.691 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 1>and see this is what he's doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down there so we could look at</v>

2949
02:13:32.251 --> 02:13:33.570
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

2950
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:38.750
<v Speaker 1>That's him hammering down these bars of</v>
<v Speaker 1>steel that came from a media.</v>

2951
02:13:40.341 --> 02:13:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they make a knife.</v>

2952
02:13:42.811 --> 02:13:45.870
<v Speaker 1>They take it and they keep hammering it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they keep throwing it to the fire</v>

2953
02:13:45.871 --> 02:13:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and hammering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy,</v>

2954
02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Bob Kramer does it all himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he does it like the old school</v>

2955
02:13:52.441 --> 02:13:57.441
<v Speaker 1>way with obviously with new equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all from the beginning,</v>

2956
02:13:57.630 --> 02:14:02.400
<v Speaker 1>like he takes the metal and crafts it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turns it into this insane looking</v>

2957
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>knife and at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2958
02:14:04.411 --> 02:14:09.411
<v Speaker 1>you're cutting your food with a meteor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something from space to space.</v>

2959
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that were most</v>

2960
02:14:14.461 --> 02:14:19.461
<v Speaker 1>terrified of when it comes to asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some asteroids are just made out of</v>

2961
02:14:19.770 --> 02:14:22.620
<v Speaker 1>iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slice right through.</v>

2962
02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine an asteroid that's the size</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Manhattan and it's all iron and a</v>

2963
02:14:28.571 --> 02:14:31.170
<v Speaker 1>half coming at us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty 5,000 miles an hour.</v>

2964
02:14:31.710 --> 02:14:33.000
<v Speaker 6>Sure,</v>

2965
02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2966
02:14:37.630 --> 02:14:42.630
<v Speaker 1>and it just rips the ocean and half go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they said that if an asteroid</v>

2967
02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>that size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the one that killed the dinosaurs,</v>

2968
02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:50.380
<v Speaker 1>the one that hit the Yucatan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that within seconds it was</v>

2969
02:14:50.381 --> 02:14:54.430
<v Speaker 1>miles deep into the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles deep.</v>

2970
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:57.370
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how</v>

2971
02:15:00.710 --> 02:15:03.550
<v Speaker 1>mile deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine.</v>

2972
02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine that like the impact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>something has to have that don't put</v>

2973
02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:16.180
<v Speaker 1>some of the size of a city to go miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep in the earth within seconds.</v>

2974
02:15:16.630 --> 02:15:19.840
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to see that for some,</v>

2975
02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:22.840
<v Speaker 1>like my sick mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to see that just to look</v>

2976
02:15:22.841 --> 02:15:24.710
<v Speaker 1>down to see what's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2977
02:15:24.730 --> 02:15:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those animated ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do online.</v>

2978
02:15:26.891 --> 02:15:28.990
<v Speaker 1>You get to look at like an ad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know that's not really</v>

2979
02:15:28.991 --> 02:15:31.480
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really have the same effect.</v>

2980
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2981
02:15:32.361 --> 02:15:32.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2982
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I get that's what it would look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think seeing it happen,</v>

2983
02:15:36.491 --> 02:15:40.810
<v Speaker 1>seeing that thing coming down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's fucked up is man,</v>

2984
02:15:40.811 --> 02:15:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you look up at the moon and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in craters covered.</v>

2985
02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:47.140
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the moon is just,</v>

2986
02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:48.910
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the moon keep getting hit?</v>

2987
02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:51.940
<v Speaker 1>We keep getting hit too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just covered in plants and shit.</v>

2988
02:15:51.941 --> 02:15:55.600
<v Speaker 1>We don't see it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got water and plants that have made</v>

2989
02:15:55.601 --> 02:15:57.970
<v Speaker 1>us forget the moon doesn't have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere too,</v>

2990
02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
<v Speaker 1>so it burns up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lose a lot of the asteroids that are</v>

2991
02:16:01.001 --> 02:16:03.910
<v Speaker 1>coming in because of the atmosphere or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the asteroids,</v>

2992
02:16:03.911 --> 02:16:04.810
<v Speaker 1>meteorites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2993
02:16:04.811 --> 02:16:07.750
<v Speaker 1>They are media whores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the moon doesn't have any of that</v>

2994
02:16:07.751 --> 02:16:11.890
<v Speaker 1>shit so it comes crashing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think that we put out a bunch</v>

2995
02:16:11.891 --> 02:16:14.830
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been hit a bunch of times.</v>

2996
02:16:14.831 --> 02:16:15.664
<v Speaker 1>We just forgot.</v>

2997
02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never even thought of that.</v>

2998
02:16:17.711 --> 02:16:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm tripping out on there right now like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2999
02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:21.460
<v Speaker 1>That sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the Swedes good,</v>

3000
02:16:21.850 --> 02:16:23.130
<v Speaker 1>but like I'm fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3001
02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:24.640
<v Speaker 1>He's very sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

3002
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And like speaking to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like remember the Mayans discovered that</v>

3003
02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.880
<v Speaker 1>the rabbit was on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>

3004
02:16:30.881 --> 02:16:34.120
<v Speaker 1>That's their signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they say there's a rabbit face on</v>

3005
02:16:34.121 --> 02:16:36.520
<v Speaker 1>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem here is don't we always see</v>

3006
02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.920
<v Speaker 1>the same side of the moon to the moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't spin,</v>

3007
02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:40.750
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it does.</v>

3008
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I think the moon does not spin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon faces us the same way all the</v>

3009
02:16:45.161 --> 02:16:46.780
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure.</v>

3010
02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So that'll make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man on the moon,</v>

3011
02:16:52.890 --> 02:16:55.030
<v Speaker 1>there was some science thing from a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago,</v>

3012
02:16:55.031 --> 02:16:56.680
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they thought they saw canals on</v>

3013
02:16:56.681 --> 02:16:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were convinced when this first</v>

3014
02:16:58.601 --> 02:17:01.180
<v Speaker 1>started looking at Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was canals and they were like,</v>

3015
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:02.590
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they thought.</v>

3016
02:17:02.590 --> 02:17:05.140
<v Speaker 1>They thought they were not right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were like,</v>

3017
02:17:05.170 --> 02:17:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at a civilization on Mars.</v>

3018
02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Like people were preparing themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make contact with the Martians.</v>

3019
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I trip out on us as humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always want to go find something else</v>

3020
02:17:15.581 --> 02:17:17.470
<v Speaker 1>and go kick it with something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

3021
02:17:17.590 --> 02:17:18.251
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3022
02:17:18.251 --> 02:17:20.710
<v Speaker 1>there's someone over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's someone at Mars.</v>

3023
02:17:20.711 --> 02:17:22.390
<v Speaker 1>We keep knocking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how open.</v>

3024
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time I had this thought</v>

3025
02:17:27.011 --> 02:17:30.250
<v Speaker 1>where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if humans are so smooth that we've</v>

3026
02:17:30.251 --> 02:17:34.270
<v Speaker 1>already been on Mars and Saturn and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and we just fuck them up so we</v>

3027
02:17:34.271 --> 02:17:36.850
<v Speaker 1>can't live there no more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we're here and that's why</v>

3028
02:17:36.851 --> 02:17:40.450
<v Speaker 1>we keep looking for other ones to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3029
02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we found someone over there and they</v>

3030
02:17:42.491 --> 02:17:43.890
<v Speaker 1>talk shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely fuck them.</v>

3031
02:17:44.530 --> 02:17:47.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tell me we fuck up people in</v>

3032
02:17:47.291 --> 02:17:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't fuck up people on the moon.</v>

3033
02:17:49.151 --> 02:17:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Does the moon rotate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3034
02:17:50.211 --> 02:17:51.100
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

3035
02:17:51.101 --> 02:17:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It spins synchronous rotation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3036
02:17:54.131 --> 02:17:57.590
<v Speaker 1>it spins as we spin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't see it spinning.</v>

3037
02:17:57.720 --> 02:17:58.553
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3038
02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:01.980
<v Speaker 1>So we see the same side every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I was</v>

3039
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.823
<v Speaker 1>going to.</v>

3040
02:18:04.570 --> 02:18:09.130
<v Speaker 1>The moon orbits the Earth once every 27</v>
<v Speaker 1>point three to two days.</v>

3041
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It also takes apparently 27 days to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon to rotate one on its access.</v>

3042
02:18:13.601 --> 02:18:15.940
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon does not seem to be spinning,</v>

3043
02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 1>but appears to observers from earth to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be keeping almost perfectly still.</v>

3044
02:18:20.921 --> 02:18:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Scientists call this synchronous</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotation.</v>

3045
02:18:22.931 --> 02:18:25.300
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking cool.</v>

3046
02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.360
<v Speaker 1>How does all that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And stay in sequence and rock and roll</v>

3047
02:18:29.361 --> 02:18:30.310
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't love it.</v>

3048
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's it float up there?</v>

3049
02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:33.640
<v Speaker 1>How come it's not Lenna are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

3050
02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.480
<v Speaker 1>None of that makes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like explain that.</v>

3051
02:18:37.481 --> 02:18:39.940
<v Speaker 1>How come the fucking asteroids come</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying in?</v>

3052
02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon just hovers.</v>

3053
02:18:41.890 --> 02:18:46.420
<v Speaker 1>What if the moon just decided to jack us</v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred forever.</v>

3054
02:18:46.421 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers and takes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3055
02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.020
<v Speaker 1>But they say that the moon is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>residue of when the earth was created,</v>

3056
02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:56.830
<v Speaker 1>that there was earth one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientists have a model of earth and</v>

3057
02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:58.450
<v Speaker 1>earth to an earth.</v>

3058
02:18:58.450 --> 02:19:02.350
<v Speaker 1>One was like this giant ball of fire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gases,</v>

3059
02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:06.040
<v Speaker 1>and we got hit with another planet like</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early days of development of the</v>

3060
02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:08.590
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like another planet collided with</v>

3061
02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what created the moon.</v>

3062
02:19:10.570 --> 02:19:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's what stabilized its orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reason why apparently we</v>

3063
02:19:14.081 --> 02:19:16.750
<v Speaker 1>can survive is because if it wasn't for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

3064
02:19:16.810 --> 02:19:19.870
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have a steady atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't have a steady temperature,</v>

3065
02:19:19.871 --> 02:19:22.720
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have a steady orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would vary too widely.</v>

3066
02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And we would have never developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd all be like tardigrades in the</v>

3067
02:19:26.051 --> 02:19:31.010
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some weird little indisputable nuclear</v>

3068
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:35.750
<v Speaker 1>single cell multicellular organisms or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something at his fucking crazy.</v>

3069
02:19:36.290 --> 02:19:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3070
02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:38.210
<v Speaker 1>what's now somehow Jana.</v>

3071
02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:41.740
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to find that the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 7>that comes up when I type in earth and</v>

3072
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:44.260
<v Speaker 7>earth to is a lot of stuff about DC</v>
<v Speaker 7>comics.</v>

3073
02:19:44.650 --> 02:19:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was from um,</v>

3074
02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:47.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3075
02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:47.711
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3076
02:19:47.711 --> 02:19:49.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth wanted earth to.</v>

3077
02:19:50.710 --> 02:19:52.780
<v Speaker 1>They actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually talked about it in the</v>

3078
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Sumerian tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really kind of fascinating.</v>

3079
02:19:55.210 --> 02:19:58.240
<v Speaker 1>The Sumerian texts talked about Earth's</v>
<v Speaker 1>collision,</v>

3080
02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:00.390
<v Speaker 1>that there was a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called,</v>

3081
02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:05.080
<v Speaker 1>like things called the planet's Tmr and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marduke and they collided and it created</v>

3082
02:20:05.081 --> 02:20:08.080
<v Speaker 1>a earth and one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also created the moon.</v>

3083
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:10.540
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about that is that</v>

3084
02:20:10.541 --> 02:20:14.290
<v Speaker 1>they had figured this out 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>something years ago.</v>

3085
02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Like this is even older than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramids.</v>

3086
02:20:16.660 --> 02:20:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3087
02:20:18.641 --> 02:20:22.630
<v Speaker 1>it's really old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ancient Sumerians were the oldest as</v>

3088
02:20:22.631 --> 02:20:25.150
<v Speaker 1>far as like what we currently know of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

3089
02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:27.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes all the time.</v>

3090
02:20:27.551 --> 02:20:31.240
<v Speaker 1>They find new stuff all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as what the archeologists</v>

3091
02:20:31.241 --> 02:20:34.390
<v Speaker 1>know of today is the oldest written</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

3092
02:20:34.391 --> 02:20:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the oldest mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a gang of that stuff is thought to</v>

3093
02:20:38.261 --> 02:20:39.580
<v Speaker 1>be from that part of the world.</v>

3094
02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:44.760
<v Speaker 1>So the same part of the world also knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all the planets in the right,</v>

3095
02:20:44.861 --> 02:20:49.060
<v Speaker 1>order it in the right size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange that a telescope</v>

3096
02:20:49.090 --> 02:20:50.800
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what they knew,</v>

3097
02:20:51.310 --> 02:20:55.450
<v Speaker 1>but they have had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had these drawings in clay tablets</v>

3098
02:20:55.570 --> 02:20:57.310
<v Speaker 1>where they had the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>

3099
02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:00.050
<v Speaker 1>and they would picture it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have earth who'd had Venus had</v>

3100
02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter have all these planets like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ones.</v>

3101
02:21:02.681 --> 02:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Where were the big ones were the smaller</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones where they're the right size.</v>

3102
02:21:06.490 --> 02:21:09.070
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck did they know?</v>

3103
02:21:09.071 --> 02:21:10.630
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all right,</v>

3104
02:21:10.810 --> 02:21:13.510
<v Speaker 1>make a right over there and go like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going somewhere,</v>

3105
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:17.560
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could see them.</v>

3106
02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:21.160
<v Speaker 1>How they could see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

3107
02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:22.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they figured out.</v>

3108
02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:25.030
<v Speaker 1>They figured out something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

3109
02:21:25.031 --> 02:21:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Jamie</v>

3110
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:30.550
<v Speaker 7>says Zacharias petitions or a diagram of</v>
<v Speaker 7>what happened.</v>

3111
02:21:31.470 --> 02:21:33.480
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem with switching though.</v>

3112
02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously not a fucking scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ones who are,</v>

3113
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:40.110
<v Speaker 1>they go over his stuff and they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them don't agree with it and</v>

3114
02:21:40.111 --> 02:21:42.810
<v Speaker 1>there's an actual website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called [inaudible] is wrong,</v>

3115
02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:47.970
<v Speaker 1>might be.org or.com and it's all like</v>
<v Speaker 1>poking holes in his stuff.</v>

3116
02:21:47.971 --> 02:21:50.910
<v Speaker 1>His stuff is fun as fuck though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to believe because he thinks</v>

3117
02:21:50.911 --> 02:21:55.650
<v Speaker 1>that we were created by aliens and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens came from a planet called Nibiru</v>

3118
02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:59.310
<v Speaker 1>and they came down here and they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic manipulations with lower</v>

3119
02:21:59.311 --> 02:22:03.240
<v Speaker 1>primates and they created human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty crazy.</v>

3120
02:22:03.250 --> 02:22:05.130
<v Speaker 1>As the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun.</v>

3121
02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I tripped out how people say that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians were having sex with aliens</v>

3122
02:22:11.461 --> 02:22:14.910
<v Speaker 1>because of the old highly griffes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found like the aliens with their</v>

3123
02:22:14.930 --> 02:22:17.850
<v Speaker 1>penises out with like they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

3124
02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I think you might've been breeding some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3125
02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:22.031
<v Speaker 1>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3126
02:22:22.031 --> 02:22:24.360
<v Speaker 1>We had alien penises and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hieroglyphs.</v>

3127
02:22:24.370 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought</v>

3128
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I seen it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3129
02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:29.620
<v Speaker 2>and I read this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read a book in prison,</v>

3130
02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:31.940
<v Speaker 2>caught the biggest secret by David</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steiner,</v>

3131
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3132
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:36.660
<v Speaker 2>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they show you the pictures in there?</v>

3133
02:22:37.170 --> 02:22:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that.</v>

3134
02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was it.</v>

3135
02:22:41.211 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 2>David Ike wasn't David.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have been.</v>

3136
02:22:43.921 --> 02:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>It's been a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just because you only got certain</v>

3137
02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:48.720
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but David likes that guy that thinks if</v>

3138
02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I was him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if he thinks it's</v>

3139
02:22:51.061 --> 02:22:53.610
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he used to think that the top</v>

3140
02:22:53.611 --> 02:22:55.830
<v Speaker 2>leaders of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all the reptilians.</v>

3141
02:22:55.890 --> 02:22:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy.</v>

3142
02:22:56.761 --> 02:22:57.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3143
02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:01.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just tell you what,</v>

3144
02:23:01.441 --> 02:23:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I tripped out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

3145
02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Those are three times for sure that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would want to go back to.</v>

3146
02:23:08.610 --> 02:23:11.700
<v Speaker 2>If you had to choose a place in time</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can go back and just check it</v>

3147
02:23:11.701 --> 02:23:12.900
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it be?</v>

3148
02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to go back to the dinosaur time</v>

3149
02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:21.840
<v Speaker 2>was a good call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>

3150
02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I should give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my stores are going to give up</v>

3151
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.270
<v Speaker 2>gangs for the dinosaur days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

3152
02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Genghis Gangsta to give up somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want to go back.</v>

3153
02:23:32.970 --> 02:23:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just this fucked</v>

3154
02:23:36.910 --> 02:23:41.700
<v Speaker 2>it was their land and then um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I'm Mexican,</v>

3155
02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to go back to like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cortez came.</v>

3156
02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got done</v>

3157
02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:52.910
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montezuma days?</v>

3158
02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3159
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:55.780
<v Speaker 2>At all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3160
02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:56.501
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy,</v>

3161
02:23:56.501 --> 02:23:58.510
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever they're building shit in Mexico</v>

3162
02:23:58.510 --> 02:24:00.190
<v Speaker 2>City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like digging into the ground</v>

3163
02:24:00.191 --> 02:24:01.840
<v Speaker 2>and they got to halt construction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stopped,</v>

3164
02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:03.570
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find something funny.</v>

3165
02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found a temple.</v>

3166
02:24:04.991 --> 02:24:06.730
<v Speaker 2>They find jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find something.</v>

3167
02:24:06.820 --> 02:24:09.910
<v Speaker 2>It's all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's this new,</v>

3168
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:12.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane that shoots.</v>

3169
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.903
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3170
02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:16.340
<v Speaker 2>you could do an ultrasound on a body</v>
<v Speaker 2>that at the airplane radar does an</v>

3171
02:24:16.341 --> 02:24:18.820
<v Speaker 2>ultrasound on the dirt or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The floor,</v>

3172
02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.000
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to find temples over</v>

3173
02:24:22.001 --> 02:24:23.680
<v Speaker 2>there now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo is right.</v>

3174
02:24:23.681 --> 02:24:26.110
<v Speaker 2>There's that bonus was raised when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sky try to find money.</v>

3175
02:24:26.170 --> 02:24:29.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just wrong with the method man.</v>

3176
02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:31.690
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a gang of shit under</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3177
02:24:31.691 --> 02:24:33.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy because it's not that</v>
<v Speaker 2>long ago.</v>

3178
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:34.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

3179
02:24:34.390 --> 02:24:35.223
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3180
02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Cortez was one that was a 14 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did Cortez come here now would save</v>

3181
02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:43.600
<v Speaker 2>the 14 hundreds and then the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the temple's ain't even there no more is</v>

3182
02:24:43.601 --> 02:24:47.200
<v Speaker 2>because Catholicism took it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholicism who came in and then they</v>

3183
02:24:47.470 --> 02:24:50.410
<v Speaker 2>buried the temples and built churches</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the temple's not crazy.</v>

3184
02:24:50.411 --> 02:24:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Like they built churches over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big thing in Egypt to they're</v>

3185
02:24:55.181 --> 02:24:59.830
<v Speaker 2>finding like one period of construction</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then on top of that period of</v>

3186
02:24:59.831 --> 02:25:02.440
<v Speaker 2>construction there's some newer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more modern shit.</v>

3187
02:25:02.610 --> 02:25:04.590
<v Speaker 2>And as they go onto the monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3188
02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:06.700
<v Speaker 2>well they built the modern shit on top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the older shit.</v>

3189
02:25:06.730 --> 02:25:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck were they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they did it a gang of times in</v>

3190
02:25:09.971 --> 02:25:11.200
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

3191
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:13.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we doing it right now?</v>

3192
02:25:13.601 --> 02:25:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Like are we building a new coliseum over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old fucking coliseum?</v>

3193
02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:19.270
<v Speaker 2>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tear down houses.</v>

3194
02:25:19.271 --> 02:25:21.820
<v Speaker 2>People literally by what they call a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tear down house.</v>

3195
02:25:22.090 --> 02:25:23.610
<v Speaker 2>He bought a house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's and,</v>

3196
02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's on a</v>

3197
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.590
<v Speaker 5>nice lot and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a big investment honey.</v>

3198
02:25:26.591 --> 02:25:29.410
<v Speaker 5>But I think a tear downs the right move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tear down that house and build a</v>

3199
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:33.250
<v Speaker 5>beautiful house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that spot as an original foundation.</v>

3200
02:25:33.370 --> 02:25:35.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a sad thing because um,</v>

3201
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:37.270
<v Speaker 5>when I was doing construction on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>east coast,</v>

3202
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:41.740
<v Speaker 5>you would run across these buildings</v>
<v Speaker 5>that had these old school nails.</v>

3203
02:25:42.090 --> 02:25:43.870
<v Speaker 5>Their nails galvanized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3204
02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:44.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was there were,</v>

3205
02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:48.130
<v Speaker 5>there were like a wedge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like a circle with a straight</v>

3206
02:25:48.131 --> 02:25:50.020
<v Speaker 5>line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

3207
02:25:50.021 --> 02:25:53.620
<v Speaker 5>a nail has a point at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then it's a perfect kind of a</v>

3208
02:25:53.770 --> 02:25:56.740
<v Speaker 5>perfect cylinder all the way up to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>top and it's got a flathead.</v>

3209
02:25:56.770 --> 02:25:58.600
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These old nails weren't like that.</v>

3210
02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:01.900
<v Speaker 5>These old nails were like a wedge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a steel wedge because they</v>

3211
02:26:01.901 --> 02:26:06.700
<v Speaker 5>were making them in a blacksmith so the</v>
<v Speaker 5>nails had like a top flat part where you</v>

3212
02:26:06.701 --> 02:26:09.640
<v Speaker 5>could hammer it in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but instead of having like a long</v>

3213
02:26:09.641 --> 02:26:13.900
<v Speaker 5>straight cylinder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was actually a wedge and the pointy</v>

3214
02:26:13.901 --> 02:26:17.890
<v Speaker 5>end was the bottom of the wedge and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>would tap it in like that and that.</v>

3215
02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:21.700
<v Speaker 5>That's what a nail was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I was doing construction and you</v>

3216
02:26:21.701 --> 02:26:24.070
<v Speaker 5>would pull these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could tell when you were going into</v>

3217
02:26:24.071 --> 02:26:26.010
<v Speaker 5>an old ass building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3218
02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:27.240
<v Speaker 5>that's what it looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3219
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:31.330
<v Speaker 5>that's an old nail like that sales I</v>
<v Speaker 5>get.</v>

3220
02:26:31.350 --> 02:26:33.520
<v Speaker 5>I pulled a gang of those out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>buildings when I was a kid,</v>

3221
02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:38.700
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of sad in a way because</v>
<v Speaker 5>these houses that were made this way,</v>

3222
02:26:38.831 --> 02:26:42.280
<v Speaker 5>like some day people would love to see</v>
<v Speaker 5>that and go,</v>

3223
02:26:42.281 --> 02:26:44.950
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like a piece of history to see</v>

3224
02:26:44.951 --> 02:26:48.790
<v Speaker 5>an old house that was built with the way</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would do the,</v>

3225
02:26:48.791 --> 02:26:50.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>insulation to.</v>

3226
02:26:50.771 --> 02:26:54.610
<v Speaker 5>They have this like white shit that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in between these boards.</v>

3227
02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:56.110
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't.</v>

3228
02:26:56.290 --> 02:26:59.050
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have a fiberglass back then</v>
<v Speaker 5>or anything,</v>

3229
02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:00.360
<v Speaker 5>so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's white plaster.</v>

3230
02:27:00.361 --> 02:27:02.290
<v Speaker 5>He Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like pink,</v>

3231
02:27:02.810 --> 02:27:03.940
<v Speaker 5>no pink stuff.</v>

3232
02:27:03.940 --> 02:27:05.530
<v Speaker 5>The fiberglass stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3233
02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:08.050
<v Speaker 5>That's the stuff that you have to put in</v>
<v Speaker 5>addicts and shit.</v>

3234
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:10.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did construction that inside that</v>

3235
02:27:10.901 --> 02:27:13.660
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gut Shit inside the house is not fun if</v>

3236
02:27:13.661 --> 02:27:16.270
<v Speaker 5>you're doing an attic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did an addict once that,</v>

3237
02:27:16.330 --> 02:27:20.050
<v Speaker 5>that had the fiberglass shit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get it in your skin.</v>

3238
02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:23.860
<v Speaker 5>You get all itchy everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're itchy and you sweat and sweat</v>

3239
02:27:23.861 --> 02:27:26.560
<v Speaker 5>opens up your pores and the fiberglass</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit gets in there.</v>

3240
02:27:27.210 --> 02:27:29.800
<v Speaker 5>Can I ask you a question?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you were stripping the nails from</v>

3241
02:27:29.801 --> 02:27:32.170
<v Speaker 5>the woodwork,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why were you taking the nails out where</v>

3242
02:27:32.171 --> 02:27:34.450
<v Speaker 5>you were working?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were tearing something down,</v>

3243
02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:37.450
<v Speaker 5>putting something in its place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember whether or not it was</v>

3244
02:27:37.451 --> 02:27:38.050
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3245
02:27:38.050 --> 02:27:42.040
<v Speaker 5>a remodel or whether or not they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting an addition on or something like</v>

3246
02:27:42.041 --> 02:27:43.750
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But whenever you'd have to go into the</v>

3247
02:27:43.751 --> 02:27:46.690
<v Speaker 5>walls of these buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could tell right away because they</v>

3248
02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:47.950
<v Speaker 5>had these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget,</v>

3249
02:27:47.951 --> 02:27:51.880
<v Speaker 5>I forget what you would call those long</v>
<v Speaker 5>thin boards that were stacked on top of</v>

3250
02:27:51.881 --> 02:27:52.300
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>

3251
02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:54.970
<v Speaker 5>As soon as you go through the plaster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel the plaster and you would know</v>

3252
02:27:54.971 --> 02:27:58.310
<v Speaker 5>as the old house because it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>plaster instead of a wall board.</v>

3253
02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:01.270
<v Speaker 5>When you go to a new house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have that wall wallboard stuff</v>

3254
02:28:01.271 --> 02:28:01.870
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3255
02:28:01.870 --> 02:28:03.280
<v Speaker 5>gypsum board,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of thin.</v>

3256
02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:05.620
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have a lot of like mass to</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3257
02:28:05.621 --> 02:28:09.070
<v Speaker 5>And then behind that you would have all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other stuff and then insulation and</v>

3258
02:28:09.071 --> 02:28:11.470
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in these old houses it wasn't like</v>

3259
02:28:11.471 --> 02:28:12.450
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like these.</v>

3260
02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:17.950
<v Speaker 5>I can't call them thin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just really thin long boards and in</v>

3261
02:28:17.951 --> 02:28:21.330
<v Speaker 5>between there's this white plaster he</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit and there was plaster over the of</v>

3262
02:28:21.430 --> 02:28:25.360
<v Speaker 5>shingles shingles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like little thin boards like a,</v>

3263
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:25.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3264
02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:30.880
<v Speaker 5>not even a half inch thick by like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>an interest so wide and they had those</v>

3265
02:28:31.491 --> 02:28:34.040
<v Speaker 5>kinds of nails that put them into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>studs.</v>

3266
02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:35.040
<v Speaker 5>I got you now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3267
02:28:35.041 --> 02:28:38.050
<v Speaker 5>And so he'd pull those nails out and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't always recognize.</v>

3268
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.451
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3269
02:28:38.451 --> 02:28:40.550
<v Speaker 5>there's an old fucking house because New</v>
<v Speaker 5>England,</v>

3270
02:28:40.551 --> 02:28:42.230
<v Speaker 5>that was an old place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3271
02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:46.010
<v Speaker 5>You could go to England today and see</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's graves that you could visit that</v>

3272
02:28:46.011 --> 02:28:48.900
<v Speaker 5>are from like the 17 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3273
02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:50.720
<v Speaker 5>They have a grape still there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3274
02:28:50.721 --> 02:28:51.680
<v Speaker 5>they're still there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3275
02:28:51.780 --> 02:28:55.700
<v Speaker 5>it's slowly but surely the numbers are</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting more eroded by the atmosphere</v>

3276
02:28:55.701 --> 02:28:56.810
<v Speaker 5>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's still there.</v>

3277
02:28:56.811 --> 02:28:59.150
<v Speaker 5>You still read them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them are kind of faint.</v>

3278
02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:02.770
<v Speaker 5>You think in 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're going to have to like</v>

3279
02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:07.760
<v Speaker 5>discover a new method for burying us</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's stupid to bury people.</v>

3280
02:29:07.850 --> 02:29:09.500
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only reason why we should bury</v>

3281
02:29:09.501 --> 02:29:11.000
<v Speaker 5>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3282
02:29:11.001 --> 02:29:15.980
<v Speaker 5>it's also what we're doing is we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're keeping the natural process of us</v>

3283
02:29:15.981 --> 02:29:20.810
<v Speaker 5>becoming useful to the world because</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when things die,</v>

3284
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:23.450
<v Speaker 5>those things are absorbed by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>

3285
02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:27.680
<v Speaker 5>There's a system in place set up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you just buried someone,</v>

3286
02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:30.410
<v Speaker 5>if you just opened up a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them in the ground and bury them.</v>

3287
02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:33.890
<v Speaker 5>The natural course of order would take</v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

3288
02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:36.440
<v Speaker 5>The bacteria and their body would break</v>
<v Speaker 5>down their body.</v>

3289
02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:38.420
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the soil would absorb their body.</v>

3290
02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:42.890
<v Speaker 5>They'd become fertilizer like every</v>
<v Speaker 5>animal has from the beginning of time.</v>

3291
02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:46.700
<v Speaker 5>But we're so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want to fill our dead bodies up with</v>

3292
02:29:46.701 --> 02:29:50.780
<v Speaker 5>some shit that keeps them from rotting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we put makeup on them and dress</v>

3293
02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:53.390
<v Speaker 5>them up in their best clothes with Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my grandfather,</v>

3294
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:54.820
<v Speaker 5>when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they put one of those,</v>

3295
02:29:54.821 --> 02:29:57.160
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crucifixes with the,</v>

3296
02:29:57.161 --> 02:30:00.110
<v Speaker 5>what are those things called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The crucifix with the Rosary,</v>

3297
02:30:00.210 --> 02:30:03.800
<v Speaker 5>with the rosary about and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he never even went to church.</v>

3298
02:30:03.801 --> 02:30:04.730
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing here?</v>

3299
02:30:04.731 --> 02:30:05.564
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

3300
02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:07.960
<v Speaker 5>He's clutching his face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got this.</v>

3301
02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:11.060
<v Speaker 5>He's so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this does no feel to him,</v>

3302
02:30:11.090 --> 02:30:13.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's gone and they're going to take him</v>

3303
02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:17.360
<v Speaker 5>and they're going to put them in a box</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they're going to buried in the</v>

3304
02:30:17.361 --> 02:30:20.420
<v Speaker 5>ground and it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go dig it out today if I probably</v>

3305
02:30:20.421 --> 02:30:23.450
<v Speaker 5>wanted to go in there today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his body still in there because those</v>

3306
02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:27.830
<v Speaker 5>things don't rot because they're filled</v>
<v Speaker 5>up with formaldehyde and all crazy.</v>

3307
02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:30.560
<v Speaker 5>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only reason why it makes sense as to</v>

3308
02:30:30.561 --> 02:30:33.320
<v Speaker 5>prove murder cases and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

3309
02:30:33.350 --> 02:30:36.650
<v Speaker 5>that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe if the death is weird,</v>

3310
02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:38.660
<v Speaker 5>the death is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should probably like,</v>

3311
02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:42.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

3312
02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:44.690
<v Speaker 5>he thought like you can't prove it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but something,</v>

3313
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:48.080
<v Speaker 5>something went down because they've</v>
<v Speaker 5>caught people for murders by going and</v>

3314
02:30:48.081 --> 02:30:50.810
<v Speaker 5>digging up the bodies and finding</v>
<v Speaker 5>arsenic and their system or something</v>

3315
02:30:50.811 --> 02:30:51.860
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've done that.</v>

3316
02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:53.660
<v Speaker 5>That's weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

3317
02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:56.240
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's Kinda like a case close homies.</v>

3318
02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:59.660
<v Speaker 5>I should've got away with it now if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>bear it and you can't bring them back.</v>

3319
02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:00.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if they catch you,</v>

3320
02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:06.160
<v Speaker 5>so you're thinking layer convict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't get away.</v>

3321
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:07.131
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3322
02:31:07.131 --> 02:31:10.030
<v Speaker 5>I beat the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's in the ground that.</v>

3323
02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:11.120
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3324
02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:14.480
<v Speaker 5>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a barbaric way of.</v>

3325
02:31:14.590 --> 02:31:15.120
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3326
02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:16.600
<v Speaker 5>it's an inhumane way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

3327
02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:19.380
<v Speaker 5>It's not a smart thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a custom plus.</v>

3328
02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>

3329
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:23.640
<v Speaker 1>a giant racket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge financial racket.</v>

3330
02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz as the first one to explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me,</v>

3331
02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:29.790
<v Speaker 1>it goes dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wars fucking racket that nobody ever</v>

3332
02:31:29.791 --> 02:31:32.700
<v Speaker 1>talks about funerals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

3333
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:35.310
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you going to do?</v>

3334
02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:38.810
<v Speaker 1>You're going to spend that money though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes to that cheap box.</v>

3335
02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:41.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like $1,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$2,000.</v>

3336
02:31:41.131 --> 02:31:44.310
<v Speaker 1>You've got to pay the funeral costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to pay for this service,</v>

3337
02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and he's explaining everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a plot of land.</v>

3338
02:31:47.011 --> 02:31:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3339
02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about that.</v>

3340
02:31:49.220 --> 02:31:51.090
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it obliterates people.</v>

3341
02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:53.280
<v Speaker 1>It obliterates them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts them in massive debt.</v>

3342
02:31:54.210 --> 02:31:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of dollars in debt like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandatories.</v>

3343
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's mandatory and it's mandatory.</v>

3344
02:31:59.430 --> 02:32:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there must be some sort of</v>

3345
02:32:00.751 --> 02:32:03.810
<v Speaker 1>programs in place to take care of bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people can't afford anything.</v>

3346
02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would imagine there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the practice itself,</v>

3347
02:32:07.231 --> 02:32:09.930
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's not just common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's standard.</v>

3348
02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the standard practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy way to take care of bodies,</v>

3349
02:32:13.171 --> 02:32:14.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

3350
02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember like telling my kids</v>

3351
02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:19.740
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's any way you can make it</v>

3352
02:32:19.741 --> 02:32:21.920
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be buried in this fucking</v>

3353
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:25.290
<v Speaker 1>backyard right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could make it happen,</v>

3354
02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but then they're gonna go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3355
02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:30.960
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's like certain walls.</v>

3356
02:32:31.020 --> 02:32:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Well the should be because if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and you put your body and your body</v>

3357
02:32:38.431 --> 02:32:40.890
<v Speaker 1>rots into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it gets people sick.</v>

3358
02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 1>People have died from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is something where I used to</v>

3359
02:32:44.761 --> 02:32:45.950
<v Speaker 1>live in Burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

3360
02:32:46.410 --> 02:32:50.160
<v Speaker 1>a gravestone of a dead baby that</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the steps going up to our</v>

3361
02:32:50.161 --> 02:32:52.800
<v Speaker 1>apartment buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seven apartment Jesus random street</v>

3362
02:32:52.801 --> 02:32:53.634
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3363
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:56.310
<v Speaker 1>the birth and the death date or seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>days apart.</v>

3364
02:32:57.460 --> 02:32:58.890
<v Speaker 1>It was like 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years.</v>

3365
02:32:58.891 --> 02:33:01.080
<v Speaker 1>He goes a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like it just happened either.</v>

3366
02:33:01.420 --> 02:33:04.500
<v Speaker 1>It's super weird that just built stairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>over top of it.</v>

3367
02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:07.890
<v Speaker 1>We're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really weird spot.</v>

3368
02:33:07.930 --> 02:33:09.210
<v Speaker 1>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

3369
02:33:10.030 --> 02:33:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you know what else is strange?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your voice coming through that shitty</v>

3370
02:33:12.451 --> 02:33:15.600
<v Speaker 1>wire active before and it worked even</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

3371
02:33:15.601 --> 02:33:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It was working fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to just replace it.</v>

3372
02:33:17.730 --> 02:33:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>

3373
02:33:19.460 --> 02:33:20.530
<v Speaker 1>It was weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3374
02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:22.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3375
02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing when you drive by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful plot of land and saw</v>

3376
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:27.630
<v Speaker 1>these cement stone sticking out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

3377
02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Let the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also weird too that it has to be</v>

3378
02:33:31.051 --> 02:33:34.320
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to like your dad has to be buried</v>

3379
02:33:34.321 --> 02:33:38.970
<v Speaker 1>in some giant field with all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's dead people like why?</v>

3380
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have to all be together in</v>
<v Speaker 1>death?</v>

3381
02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Only</v>
<v Speaker 1>death only.</v>

3382
02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:48.510
<v Speaker 1>You get a small spot and then a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of feet overs another person and you</v>

3383
02:33:48.511 --> 02:33:52.770
<v Speaker 1>have to be buried in these areas where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we designate that people go to cry and</v>

3384
02:33:52.771 --> 02:33:57.771
<v Speaker 1>drop flowers is goofy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things.</v>

3385
02:33:58.201 --> 02:34:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always done it that way so we</v>

3386
02:34:00.391 --> 02:34:03.990
<v Speaker 1>don't stop and think like what kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like marriage.</v>

3387
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.430
<v Speaker 1>He's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar.</v>

3388
02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep the death.</v>

3389
02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:08.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3390
02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:12.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird that nobody does</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

3391
02:34:13.050 --> 02:34:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could not get married if you choose</v>

3392
02:34:15.031 --> 02:34:15.481
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go,</v>

3393
02:34:15.481 --> 02:34:16.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck marriage,</v>

3394
02:34:16.411 --> 02:34:19.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be legally entangled</v>

3395
02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:20.710
<v Speaker 1>with some person if I want to break up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

3396
02:34:20.711 --> 02:34:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to be able to just leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>one at my own choice.</v>

3397
02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of the same way.</v>

3398
02:34:26.111 --> 02:34:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Like when when people die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to give them,</v>

3399
02:34:28.570 --> 02:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to either cremate them.</v>

3400
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think even when you cremate them,</v>

3401
02:34:32.891 --> 02:34:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to do the formaldehyde</v>
<v Speaker 1>think first.</v>

3402
02:34:34.961 --> 02:34:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of scared.</v>

3403
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I kinda told my kids I want them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cremate me too because I was,</v>

3404
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be maggots eating meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit like that.</v>

3405
02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:44.170
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know.</v>

3406
02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:46.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maggots is the way to go.</v>

3407
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:50.620
<v Speaker 1>The way to go is the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>formaldehyde because Formaldehyde,</v>

3408
02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:53.590
<v Speaker 1>like whatever use that you would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

3409
02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:58.591
<v Speaker 1>Although the organisms that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally devour any sort of dead living</v>

3410
02:34:59.261 --> 02:35:01.630
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a creature that becomes dead,</v>

3411
02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:03.790
<v Speaker 1>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get to eat anymore.</v>

3412
02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:06.730
<v Speaker 1>For some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've decided that they don't get to</v>

3413
02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:10.060
<v Speaker 1>consume your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your body is more important than</v>

3414
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:12.520
<v Speaker 1>all the other things that it consumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're part of the ECO.</v>

3415
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:16.390
<v Speaker 1>It's one more way that we've separated</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves from the system.</v>

3416
02:35:16.450 --> 02:35:18.580
<v Speaker 1>This natural system that we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

3417
02:35:18.581 --> 02:35:20.380
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're delusional.</v>

3418
02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Like we think we're not a part of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>system because we have houses and air</v>

3419
02:35:23.291 --> 02:35:25.630
<v Speaker 1>conditioning and I go to the supermarket</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our food.</v>

3420
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:29.860
<v Speaker 1>We're a part of the system for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one more way we separate</v>

3421
02:35:29.861 --> 02:35:32.710
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if animals had cemeteries and</v>

3422
02:35:32.711 --> 02:35:36.280
<v Speaker 1>shit that would be fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be no room for anything.</v>

3423
02:35:36.281 --> 02:35:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Then they're dying like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the cemeteries are just all the</v>

3424
02:35:39.701 --> 02:35:41.320
<v Speaker 1>birds that cats kill.</v>

3425
02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:49.000
<v Speaker 1>You will realize what kind of mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder of monsters you're living with.</v>

3426
02:35:50.390 --> 02:35:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go,</v>

3427
02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:53.140
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>

3428
02:35:53.141 --> 02:35:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Like this is all the cats killing birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just look everywhere.</v>

3429
02:35:57.430 --> 02:35:59.160
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to walk everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would walk.</v>

3430
02:35:59.161 --> 02:36:02.200
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like a little gravestone for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bird that was killed by a cat.</v>

3431
02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:04.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3432
02:36:04.271 --> 02:36:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you now as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

3433
02:36:06.971 --> 02:36:09.490
<v Speaker 1>don't get cremated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made process.</v>

3434
02:36:09.491 --> 02:36:12.550
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to go in there and just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the way it goes.</v>

3435
02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is diseases though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they're worried about is</v>

3436
02:36:15.911 --> 02:36:18.030
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think if you're.</v>

3437
02:36:18.610 --> 02:36:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I guess if they formaldehyde you up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they drop you in the ground,</v>

3438
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't rot so you don't leak into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water system.</v>

3439
02:36:26.770 --> 02:36:31.030
<v Speaker 1>He just sorta like just sit there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>prune up.</v>

3440
02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're right for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass time,</v>

3441
02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but if you did rot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that.</v>

3442
02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:38.620
<v Speaker 1>If you somehow or another gotten a water</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

3443
02:36:39.650 --> 02:36:40.270
<v Speaker 1>if there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3444
02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:41.710
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dealing with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

3445
02:36:42.010 --> 02:36:43.990
<v Speaker 1>that's when it becomes impractical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3446
02:36:43.991 --> 02:36:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're like New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small spot less than,</v>

3447
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:50.110
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does New York have like 7</v>

3448
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:51.640
<v Speaker 1>million or 8 million people live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

3449
02:36:51.641 --> 02:36:54.820
<v Speaker 1>something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all stuffed into this area,</v>

3450
02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way smaller than La and they were just</v>

3451
02:36:58.211 --> 02:36:59.320
<v Speaker 1>jammed in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3452
02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:01.510
<v Speaker 1>What would they do if they had dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies?</v>

3453
02:37:01.511 --> 02:37:02.920
<v Speaker 1>They're all stacked on top of each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

3454
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:04.090
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do with the dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies?</v>

3455
02:37:04.091 --> 02:37:07.000
<v Speaker 1>They almost have to cremate them or have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to embalm them.</v>

3456
02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't burry him anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to take them out of town and</v>

3457
02:37:10.031 --> 02:37:12.370
<v Speaker 1>throw them in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do?</v>

3458
02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be all thrown in the</v>

3459
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:17.690
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3460
02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Should have a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you only get out.</v>

3461
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.000
<v Speaker 2>You got to be 10 miles off shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to get eaten in there</v>

3462
02:37:25.161 --> 02:37:26.390
<v Speaker 2>by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug,</v>

3463
02:37:26.410 --> 02:37:27.440
<v Speaker 2>ed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my crabs,</v>

3464
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:30.440
<v Speaker 2>lobsters and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in turn you'll find a good spot</v>

3465
02:37:30.441 --> 02:37:34.180
<v Speaker 2>to catch lobsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it used to.</v>

3466
02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I remember my Grandpa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made the best stone crabs.</v>

3467
02:37:38.470 --> 02:37:43.070
<v Speaker 2>We've caught stone crabs right where</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandpa died or were we dropped his body</v>

3468
02:37:43.071 --> 02:37:45.380
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they did with Osama bin</v>

3469
02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Laden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3470
02:37:45.730 --> 02:37:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Chuck them in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3471
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:48.650
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

3472
02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:49.880
<v Speaker 2>That's why I trip out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3473
02:37:49.881 --> 02:37:50.714
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

3474
02:37:50.930 --> 02:37:52.430
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our president is not black.</v>

3475
02:37:52.431 --> 02:37:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he killed that full and throw them over</v>

3476
02:37:54.051 --> 02:37:57.710
<v Speaker 2>the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gangster as full kill someone.</v>

3477
02:37:57.711 --> 02:38:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Takes them and get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

3478
02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who made the decision to do it that way?</v>

3479
02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Because it was a two day decision was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I guess Muslim,</v>

3480
02:38:07.310 --> 02:38:12.200
<v Speaker 2>they have like a real special ritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two days after the body has to be</v>

3481
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:14.100
<v Speaker 2>done something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3482
02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:16.550
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they did it quick.</v>

3483
02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:18.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole.</v>

3484
02:38:18.410 --> 02:38:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Well you're not supposed to do that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim faith.</v>

3485
02:38:21.711 --> 02:38:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're supposed to throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bodies overboard.</v>

3486
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it.</v>

3487
02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:28.760
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those ones that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go down in history.</v>

3488
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:32.900
<v Speaker 2>You know when people are going to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>back at historical moments there just</v>

3489
02:38:32.901 --> 02:38:36.350
<v Speaker 2>seem crazy in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just killed them and thrown in the</v>

3490
02:38:36.351 --> 02:38:37.610
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

3491
02:38:37.700 --> 02:38:39.050
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dark.</v>

3492
02:38:39.350 --> 02:38:40.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3493
02:38:40.011 --> 02:38:43.370
<v Speaker 2>I guess they said they didn't want him</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a mortar or they didn't want to</v>

3494
02:38:43.430 --> 02:38:46.700
<v Speaker 2>martyr martyr know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3495
02:38:46.701 --> 02:38:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

3496
02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean they would understand it better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I would.</v>

3497
02:38:50.031 --> 02:38:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I would just be speculating as to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should and shouldn't do with the</v>

3498
02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:56.720
<v Speaker 2>body of a mastermind terrorist that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just killed.</v>

3499
02:38:57.020 --> 02:39:00.200
<v Speaker 2>They've been looking for for years that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was living in the house.</v>

3500
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that his took his brain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been working on probably what</v>

3501
02:39:04.611 --> 02:39:05.600
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Saddam.</v>

3502
02:39:06.090 --> 02:39:06.641
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hunting.</v>

3503
02:39:06.641 --> 02:39:10.010
<v Speaker 2>That motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably fed to his dogs.</v>

3504
02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:11.533
<v Speaker 2>They're smart.</v>

3505
02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That what they did.</v>

3506
02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3507
02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Saddam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his sons used to have dogs.</v>

3508
02:39:17.390 --> 02:39:19.760
<v Speaker 2>They would throw people to the dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed them to the dogs.</v>

3509
02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:22.640
<v Speaker 2>He was like Ramsay Bolton from game of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrones,</v>

3510
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:27.040
<v Speaker 2>like legitimately is his kids were</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths,</v>

3511
02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:29.060
<v Speaker 2>total murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass murderers.</v>

3512
02:39:29.061 --> 02:39:31.820
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would find women that we're about</v>

3513
02:39:31.821 --> 02:39:33.380
<v Speaker 2>to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take them from their husbands,</v>

3514
02:39:33.381 --> 02:39:35.210
<v Speaker 2>rape them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then feed them to the dogs.</v>

3515
02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I think I've seen that in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3516
02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Probably buried his body near the</v>
<v Speaker 2>graves.</v>

3517
02:39:40.941 --> 02:39:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Of his other family members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got lucky.</v>

3518
02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:47.780
<v Speaker 2>It's hard part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3519
02:39:47.781 --> 02:39:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we were talking about that</v>

3520
02:39:49.611 --> 02:39:52.280
<v Speaker 2>part of the world so much different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Monica.</v>

3521
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3522
02:39:55.791 --> 02:39:58.100
<v Speaker 2>and it really is a perspective thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3523
02:39:58.480 --> 02:39:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a trip like</v>

3524
02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:03.440
<v Speaker 2>everyone's all talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3525
02:40:03.441 --> 02:40:05.480
<v Speaker 2>over there in Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women in them,</v>

3526
02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:07.640
<v Speaker 2>women don't have rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women don't do this.</v>

3527
02:40:07.641 --> 02:40:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Or women do is cook and clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

3528
02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:13.610
<v Speaker 2>be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are where you are there not</v>

3529
02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 2>tripping.</v>

3530
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:15.550
<v Speaker 1>They're living their life over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do what?</v>

3531
02:40:15.570 --> 02:40:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Am I against it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:40:16.621 --> 02:40:19.290
<v Speaker 1>But they haven't changed what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do.</v>

3533
02:40:19.650 --> 02:40:22.080
<v Speaker 1>They might be tripping hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just can't do shit about it.</v>

3534
02:40:22.530 --> 02:40:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I understand that people on the outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it and see it's horrible and uh,</v>

3535
02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:31.200
<v Speaker 1>it'll all because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of people's attitudes.</v>

3536
02:40:31.201 --> 02:40:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what changes things</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people get upset at it because</v>

3537
02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:37.260
<v Speaker 1>then that word gets back to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the world,</v>

3538
02:40:37.290 --> 02:40:39.780
<v Speaker 1>chicks can go to school the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that can drive.</v>

3539
02:40:39.781 --> 02:40:41.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to dress up in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>outfits.</v>

3540
02:40:41.851 --> 02:40:44.460
<v Speaker 1>They can do whatever the fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're treated just like regular people</v>

3541
02:40:44.461 --> 02:40:46.620
<v Speaker 1>like the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the rest of the world.</v>

3542
02:40:46.650 --> 02:40:49.110
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are stuck in a bad spot.</v>

3543
02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you see the thing that happened with</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea?</v>

3544
02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:56.640
<v Speaker 1>They let the world accidentally opened</v>
<v Speaker 1>up their websites.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That they have 28 websites.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like what they had?</v>

3553
02:41:15.811 --> 02:41:17.420
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if anybody's translated</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

02:41:34.711 --> 02:41:39.711
<v Speaker 1>A website for Kim Il Sung University</v>
<v Speaker 1>website for the Voice of Korea news</v>

3560
02:41:39.721 --> 02:41:42.540
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a news website for the government of</v>

3561
02:41:42.541 --> 02:41:46.800
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That place is fucking crazy that that</v>

02:41:46.801 --> 02:41:47.730
<v Speaker 1>exists today.</v>

3563
02:41:47.730 --> 02:41:52.730
<v Speaker 1>That there is a country that is right</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to another country that looks</v>

3564
02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:56.700
<v Speaker 1>exactly like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like North Koreans and South Koreans are</v>

3565
02:41:56.701 --> 02:41:57.840
<v Speaker 1>fucking Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3566
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:59.610
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

3567
02:41:59.670 --> 02:42:03.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Mexicans and Africans.</v>

3568
02:42:03.690 --> 02:42:07.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not like two distinctly different</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking kinds of people know that</v>

3569
02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:09.420

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3570
02:42:09.630 --> 02:42:13.440
<v Speaker 1>But above them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have North Korea and they're living</v>

3571
02:42:13.530 --> 02:42:16.350
<v Speaker 1>in a dictatorship,</v>

<v Speaker 1>plastic surgery.</v>

3583
02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't shouldn't say huge problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then it's not like they die.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

3588
02:42:58.470 --> 02:43:00.970
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things they're doing is</v>

<v Speaker 1>and cut down there and then you can see</v>

3602
02:43:32.891 --> 02:43:35.710
<v Speaker 1>what she looks like when it's all done,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just makes this incredible work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puts the memory foam back in.</v>

3644
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they've ever done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if anybody's ever had like a</v>

3645
02:45:49.311 --> 02:45:51.740
<v Speaker 1>vaginal implant to make your vagina</v>
<v Speaker 1>tighter.</v>

3646
02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:53.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they'll get boob jobs,</v>

3647
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:55.030
<v Speaker 1>like you get a breast implant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3650
02:45:59.121 --> 02:46:01.310
<v Speaker 1>But I think they just tighten up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

3651
02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the inside they cut.</v>

3652
02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I think the way they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is going to sound horrible</v>

3653
02:46:06.201 --> 02:46:09.380
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they cut you and then they the</v>

3654
02:46:09.381 --> 02:46:14.381
<v Speaker 1>two sides and stitch you the fuck up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it hurts like a mother fucker.</v>

3655
02:46:15.170 --> 02:46:18.260
<v Speaker 1>The things people are doing to satisfy</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

3656
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We need more constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constantly has to get better,</v>

3658
02:46:22.791 --> 02:46:25.700
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more tart or plus a magnetometer.</v>

3659
02:46:27.430 --> 02:46:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time for surgery,</v>

3660
02:46:29.690 --> 02:46:31.580
<v Speaker 1>increase in vaginal tightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeries,</v>

3661
02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:34.990
<v Speaker 1>worries doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God worries him.</v>

3662
02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:40.620
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make Dick Shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should let natural selection tickets</v>

3663
02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:42.220
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3664
02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

3665
02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it.</v>

3666
02:46:46.971 --> 02:46:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was one of those girls and I had a</v>

3667
02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:52.390
<v Speaker 1>crazy big fucked up John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shrank it down and all of a sudden</v>

3668
02:46:52.391 --> 02:46:54.860
<v Speaker 1>now it became hot as fuck and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk to me.</v>

3669
02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I think I spend my money wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go for that.</v>

3670
02:46:57.710 --> 02:46:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean exactly.</v>

3671
02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had to do it,</v>

3672
02:47:00.801 --> 02:47:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it bizarre that there's a very</v>

3673
02:47:04.281 --> 02:47:09.200
<v Speaker 1>specific shape that we like and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when it comes to people,</v>

3674
02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:12.200
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the shape of the nose or</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape of the jaw,</v>

3675
02:47:12.410 --> 02:47:14.900
<v Speaker 1>like we agree so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much.</v>

3676
02:47:14.930 --> 02:47:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Too much jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much job.</v>

3677
02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't like long hair.</v>

3678
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Long hair doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shorter.</v>

3679
02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Short doesn't and bottom either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either one's okay.</v>

3680
02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Like those characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of room.</v>

3681
02:47:26.661 --> 02:47:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has curls.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She shaved her head.</v>

3685
02:47:31.220 --> 02:47:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Does she look good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3686
02:47:33.470 --> 02:47:36.200
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like a big judge.</v>

3687
02:47:36.201 --> 02:47:37.700
<v Speaker 1>He got a big job.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Can't deal with that.</v>

3690
02:47:39.591 --> 02:47:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for whatever reason that looked</v>

3691
02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:44.510
<v Speaker 1>freaks us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the hair.</v>

3692
02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:46.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like inconsequential because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

3693
02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:48.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of you sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you cut it.</v>

3694
02:47:48.681 --> 02:47:50.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't even feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird that it even grows in</v>

3695
02:47:50.901 --> 02:47:53.300
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of weird lion's mane.</v>

<v Speaker 1>can you get money from my son's team and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's 13.</v>

3759
02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving this kid create a teen.</v>

3760
02:50:30.250 --> 02:50:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's even healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably an unhealthy.</v>

3761
02:50:33.490 --> 02:50:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think 13 year old kids are</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be lifting weights.</v>

3762
02:50:36.251 --> 02:50:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're only supposed to do like a</v>

3763
02:50:38.830 --> 02:50:42.640
<v Speaker 1>calisthenics and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they think that weight itself can</v>

3764
02:50:42.641 --> 02:50:45.700
<v Speaker 1>actually fuck with their bone growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their bodies aren't designed to.</v>

3765
02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's been disproven.</v>

3766
02:50:48.940 --> 02:50:50.350
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just talking with my dad about</v>

3767
02:50:50.351 --> 02:50:53.290
<v Speaker 7>that the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>literally because there's a kid my age</v>

3768
02:50:53.350 --> 02:50:55.810
<v Speaker 7>that when we were growing up started</v>
<v Speaker 7>lifting a little earlier than everyone</v>

3769
02:50:55.811 --> 02:50:57.400
<v Speaker 7>else and he just all through high</v>
<v Speaker 7>school.</v>

3770
02:50:57.401 --> 02:50:58.690
<v Speaker 7>You fucked everyone up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was,</v>

3771
02:50:58.691 --> 02:51:01.750
<v Speaker 7>because he was that he had to write.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She was ahead of us all.</v>

3772
02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:06.280
<v Speaker 7>He was a monster because of just because</v>
<v Speaker 7>of that and I don't think he would have</v>

3773
02:51:06.281 --> 02:51:08.910
<v Speaker 7>been smaller now than he was then.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>

3774
02:51:09.180 --> 02:51:09.841
<v Speaker 7>his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 7>small.</v>

3775
02:51:09.841 --> 02:51:11.050
<v Speaker 7>He would have been small as whole life</v>
<v Speaker 7>anyway.</v>

3776
02:51:11.240 --> 02:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3777
02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

3778
02:51:14.090 --> 02:51:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a bullshit meth or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

3779
02:51:15.591 --> 02:51:18.830
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find out has the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>mill and they don't play,</v>

3780
02:51:18.831 --> 02:51:20.780
<v Speaker 1>but don't shoot the ball after you work</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3781
02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't shoot around and misses up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump shot.</v>

3782
02:51:22.701 --> 02:51:23.201
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3783
02:51:23.201 --> 02:51:25.310
<v Speaker 1>it's the best thing because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting tired.</v>

3784
02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:27.560
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that look at it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3785
02:51:27.980 --> 02:51:30.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what they would say about archery</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

3786
02:51:30.410 --> 02:51:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't do archery after you lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>

3787
02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

3788
02:51:33.411 --> 02:51:35.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have control of your</v>

3789
02:51:35.451 --> 02:51:39.970
<v Speaker 1>muscles and your muscles are fatigued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to control fatigue game</v>

3790
02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:42.110
<v Speaker 1>fourth quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see both.</v>

3791
02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:45.860
<v Speaker 1>That was a philosophy and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu schools you would do a lot of</v>

3792
02:51:45.970 --> 02:51:47.780
<v Speaker 1>calisthenics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially old school schools.</v>

3793
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You do a lot of calisthenics and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fucking completely worn out before</v>

3794
02:51:51.291 --> 02:51:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you ever start sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3795
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:58.510
<v Speaker 1>so before the beginning of class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we push ups and hip scoots hip escapes</v>

3796
02:51:58.610 --> 02:52:02.210
<v Speaker 1>and go down the Mat and back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be doing while crab bear walks,</v>

3797
02:52:02.211 --> 02:52:04.340
<v Speaker 1>walk on your hands and feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit,</v>

3798
02:52:04.341 --> 02:52:08.350
<v Speaker 1>and you get completely pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit ups and by burning you out with</v>

3799
02:52:08.351 --> 02:52:10.390
<v Speaker 1>calisthenics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were forced to use technique when</v>

3800
02:52:10.391 --> 02:52:11.224
<v Speaker 1>you rolled</v>

3801
02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:14.400
<v Speaker 1>and then that you would spar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all that.</v>

3802
02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would do technique,</v>

3803
02:52:15.531 --> 02:52:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you would do drills and then you'd wind</v>
<v Speaker 1>up sparring,</v>

3804
02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most places don't do it that way</v>

3805
02:52:20.391 --> 02:52:22.520
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most places believe the best way to</v>

3806
02:52:22.521 --> 02:52:27.521
<v Speaker 1>learn is actually just warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do drills go over the technical aspects</v>

3807
02:52:27.831 --> 02:52:29.780
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then just spar hard and that you should</v>

3808
02:52:29.781 --> 02:52:32.030
<v Speaker 1>be fresh when you practice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>

3809
02:52:32.180 --> 02:52:35.120
<v Speaker 1>What does that saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an article from live strong and</v>

3810
02:52:35.121 --> 02:52:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I just went to dismissing the myths,</v>

3811
02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:41.880
<v Speaker 7>get to the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it basically says that lets you read</v>

3812
02:52:41.890 --> 02:52:42.280
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

3813
02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contrasts with suggestions of stunted</v>

3814
02:52:44.411 --> 02:52:47.380
<v Speaker 1>growth among young weightlifters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Betsy Keller points out that</v>

3815
02:52:47.381 --> 02:52:50.620
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting may be more effective than</v>
<v Speaker 1>other forms of exercise in promoting</v>

3816
02:52:50.621 --> 02:52:53.380
<v Speaker 1>bone growth and density among</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescents.</v>

3817
02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it actually might be healthier for</v>

3818
02:52:55.091 --> 02:52:56.890
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These researchers found that</v>

3819
02:52:56.891 --> 02:53:00.910
<v Speaker 1>testosterone injections increase both</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone length and density,</v>

3820
02:53:00.911 --> 02:53:05.230
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that weightlifting's impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>on testosterone may be beneficial.</v>

3821
02:53:05.950 --> 02:53:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Veterans Administration Medical Center</v>

3822
02:53:08.711 --> 02:53:13.000
<v Speaker 1>supports evidence in 2008 study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3823
02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:16.910
<v Speaker 7>It says it might allow you to grow</v>
<v Speaker 7>taller than you would have.</v>

3824
02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3825
02:53:19.460 --> 02:53:20.293
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

3826
02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3827
02:53:22.891 --> 02:53:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Who knows man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't want to fuck your kid</v>

3828
02:53:24.551 --> 02:53:25.261
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

3829
02:53:25.261 --> 02:53:26.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3830
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people that have their kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally jacked at an early age.</v>

3831
02:53:30.421 --> 02:53:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

3832
02:53:31.230 --> 02:53:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much pressure you put on that</v>

3833
02:53:33.001 --> 02:53:34.410
<v Speaker 1>little guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he wants to do?</v>

3834
02:53:34.470 --> 02:53:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Your kid wants to do squats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3835
02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I kinda think they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3836
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I had all that pressure on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3837
02:53:41.170 --> 02:53:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably used to wake me up like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixth grade.</v>

3838
02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>

3839
02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:46.560
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go watch the freshmen</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

3840
02:53:46.561 --> 02:53:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I gotta go to this practice?</v>

3841
02:53:50.310 --> 02:53:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Older brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3842
02:53:51.301 --> 02:53:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Make tough kids though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at a kid who was like the</v>

3843
02:53:54.151 --> 02:53:56.280
<v Speaker 1>youngest brother has got a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers at fuck with them.</v>

3844
02:53:56.460 --> 02:53:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Those dudes usually not a handle</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because you'd grown up in a</v>

3845
02:53:59.461 --> 02:54:02.100
<v Speaker 1>combat situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brothers are fucking with you</v>

3846
02:54:02.101 --> 02:54:03.750
<v Speaker 1>constantly have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all yet.</v>

3847
02:54:03.780 --> 02:54:07.230
<v Speaker 1>We're all a year apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>

3848
02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:09.630
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

3849
02:54:10.370 --> 02:54:13.010
<v Speaker 7>It's that little Hercules' guy from a</v>
<v Speaker 7>couple of years ago.</v>

3850
02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he looks like now.</v>

3851
02:54:15.090 --> 02:54:17.550
<v Speaker 1>You grew up and gave up on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave up on lifting weights</v>

3852
02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:19.720
<v Speaker 7>inside edition story on him last year.</v>

3853
02:54:19.910 --> 02:54:20.743
<v Speaker 1>Poor little guy.</v>

3854
02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:22.270
<v Speaker 7>So it looked like</v>

3855
02:54:23.330 --> 02:54:25.980
<v Speaker 1>those myostatin inhibitor things or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe or.</v>

3856
02:54:26.090 --> 02:54:27.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that.</v>

3857
02:54:27.281 --> 02:54:32.281
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of like a supplement w w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people born with mild stat</v>

3858
02:54:32.591 --> 02:54:35.290
<v Speaker 1>inhibitors and makes a grow much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

3859
02:54:35.291 --> 02:54:37.660
<v Speaker 1>You bought as or regulate the growth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle the way ours does.</v>

3860
02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:41.900
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some weird genetic freak that they</v>

3861
02:54:41.901 --> 02:54:46.901
<v Speaker 1>found in dogs called whippets and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>cows that somehow or another,</v>

3862
02:54:47.141 --> 02:54:49.750
<v Speaker 1>when they're breeding these dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

3863
02:54:49.780 --> 02:54:54.780
<v Speaker 1>they develop this genetic variation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called a milestone and inhibitor.</v>

3864
02:54:55.060 --> 02:54:58.390
<v Speaker 1>And it allows for some strange reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a real dog,</v>

3865
02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:03.900
<v Speaker 1>this is a whippet that has this mild</v>
<v Speaker 1>staten inhibitor issue and these are</v>

3866
02:55:03.921 --> 02:55:06.800
<v Speaker 1>some cows that have a two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it is is they just grow way</v>

3867
02:55:06.801 --> 02:55:08.870
<v Speaker 1>more muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at the size of that cow.</v>

3868
02:55:08.910 --> 02:55:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3869
02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:13.580
<v Speaker 1>So they figured out how to do it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mice.</v>

3870
02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Like they figured out how to introduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>these genes to mice and they develop</v>

3871
02:55:17.761 --> 02:55:19.700
<v Speaker 1>these mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live longer,</v>

3872
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:22.670
<v Speaker 1>they are much more muscular,</v>
