00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head's not to get as opposed to get</v>

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 2>jostled around too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it goes every direction except it</v>

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 2>goes right except down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy of mine who's a professor</v>

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 2>who's 49 or 50 and he kick boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's bars and I'm like,</v>

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand this like you're into</v>

7
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

8
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 2>he's a history professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you understand that this is</v>

9
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 2>dangerous shoe brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get so much enjoyment out of the</v>

10
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 2>thrill of being primal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've actually been in their sparring.</v>

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we,</v>

12
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that calcium storico thing in Italy</v>

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>bs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bare knuckled football with bare</v>

15
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>knuckle boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

16
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was going to go make that</v>

17
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

18
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And Berg I think ended up making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

19
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>but we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just broken up.</v>

20
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I making a documentary of my ex</v>

21
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really self abusive,</v>

22
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's apparently the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the month that it happens,</v>

23
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 1>violence in the area goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

24
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's something interesting about</v>

25
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>these guys who want to go spar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they're sexually harassing</v>

26
00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>less women at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're having less bar fights.</v>

27
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>This calcium storico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was invented in the 16 hundreds to</v>

28
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>entertain kings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was stopped because so many people</v>

29
00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>were dying and then I want to say 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they brought it back.</v>

30
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>They keep it low profile because so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get concussions and sick group</v>

31
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 20 on 20 a the only rule is no</v>

32
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>two on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are grown men.</v>

33
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>These are not young like athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not professional athletes.</v>

34
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>They're butchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're lawyers,</v>

35
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 1>they're whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exchange</v>

36
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 2>partners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like guys just moved,</v>

37
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>a new guy moved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just touched hands.</v>

38
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Like one guy was duking it out with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and then for some reason they</v>

39
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>changed their knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also</v>

40
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>by region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like neighborhoods against</v>

41
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of it's like fathers against</v>

42
00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers against brothers,</v>

43
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>the change teammates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two guys were fighting and then</v>

44
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 2>another guy steps in and takes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

45
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys have dog shit skill,</v>

46
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are not a guy just stepped in.</v>

47
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>These professional athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are literally guys that have other</v>

48
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>jobs once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just agree to fucking just fight</v>

49
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets pretty far.</v>

50
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Which one is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What number minute are you in?</v>

51
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.733
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should see the ball.</v>

53
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 1>It actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal is to get the ball into the</v>

54
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you dog shit skills and so</v>

55
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just allowing me that when the</v>

56
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>person's scores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get this so hit so hard that no one</v>

57
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>wants to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone's like,</v>

58
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.651
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it.</v>

59
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:47.420
<v Speaker 1>You do it because as soon as you score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just pummel you and then you see</v>

60
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>these guys in the corners with</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretchers.</v>

61
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker 1>They just carry people off the field the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire time.</v>

62
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is holding this guy down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could grapple to.</v>

63
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only rule you can bite.</v>

64
00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>You can kick in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do anything.</v>

65
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you can't do is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one,</v>

66
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the only rule you can bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only rule is no two on one.</v>

67
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>You can kick in the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

68
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that's like a general,</v>

69
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.380
<v Speaker 2>like two guys are the only two guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are humping will these two guys.</v>

70
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.680
<v Speaker 2>This guy's got this guy's back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people fucking lolly</v>

71
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>gag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cherry pickers.</v>

72
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.850
<v Speaker 2>They need to get out there and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

73
00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a family.</v>

74
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Let's knock these guys out one at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

75
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are we doing here guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

76
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.360
<v Speaker 2>someone got smacked in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes down.</v>

77
00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:38.361
<v Speaker 2>He's got the ball and went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then another guy took his place is just</v>

78
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 2>sort of avoiding the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This ball guy looks gay as far.</v>

79
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.990
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>

80
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.801
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

81
00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:45.390
<v Speaker 2>this is the guy gets knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

82
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.810
<v Speaker 2>as soon as he gets knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another guy steps in and fights the guy</v>

83
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>that he was fighting before he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked down.</v>

84
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a bizarre stupid.</v>

85
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Turns into just like a melee of madness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just.</v>

86
00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:00.860
<v Speaker 1>It's actually interesting to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clusters happen.</v>

87
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Like the energy going into one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only one black guy.</v>

88
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

89
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so boring.</v>

90
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these guys are professional</v>

91
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

92
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like they trained for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

93
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that thing the iron man?</v>

94
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:24.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like a voluntary thing that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

95
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It's tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do it,</v>

96
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>if your dad did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

97
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stupid.</v>

98
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 1>And so rediculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

99
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of tradition in it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see everyone wears like joker uniform.</v>

100
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that guys that are humping?</v>

<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

104

113
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>then they have to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 2:20 minute quarters and</v>

114
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:18.660
<v Speaker 1>then the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winters have to play again the next</v>

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get money.</v>

119
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:32.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't get endorsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing I like about it,</v>

120
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>that attracted me to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no endorsement deals.</v>

121
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's been promoted.</v>

122
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just people that want to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight each other</v>

123
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand is where's the leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks?</v>

124
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys not understand about leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks?</v>

125
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Their Italian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

126
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:49.260
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few kicks being thrown,</v>

127
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.670
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Tony Lake kicks.</v>

128
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.930
<v Speaker 2>They're standing right in front of each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

129
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.350
<v Speaker 2>but there's no takedowns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no takedown tabs.</v>

130
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.060
<v Speaker 2>It's just shitty boxing would the</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasional kick this is.</v>

131
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>It's basically just like a giant street</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

132
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these guys have a little bit of</v>

133
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.360
<v Speaker 2>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm looking at the way these.</v>

134
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.640
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a takedown like this,</v>

135
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 2>but nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can take a guy down,</v>

136
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.680
<v Speaker 2>but look at the way these guys are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing in front of each other,</v>

137
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.693
<v Speaker 2>like chicken.</v>

138
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably get out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like are like,</v>

139
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>

140
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's just pace around and see if we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get through this 40 minutes</v>

141
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird because they just exchange</v>

142
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:22.390
<v Speaker 1>partners.</v>

143
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.070
<v Speaker 2>They move back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

144
00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:26.710
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they square off and then they decide I</v>

145
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:28.000
<v Speaker 2>don't want to fight you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fight your friend.</v>

146
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Well it's so interesting because think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

147
00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:33.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are not trained guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like if you put 20 people</v>

148
00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:35.550
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no pressure to do it right away.</v>

149
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

150
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like when do you decide it's time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take you to,</v>

151
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

152
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.690
<v Speaker 1>this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this guy?</v>

153
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 1>But the ball's going to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to get through.</v>

154
00:06:45.241 --> 00:06:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're just talking shit like</v>

155
00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:48.564
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

156
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.190
<v Speaker 2>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you get.</v>

157
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Does no one know how to kick?</v>

158
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.400
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people,</v>

159
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:55.870
<v Speaker 1>unless they're in Thailand probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

160
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I went and saw those fights in Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to watch those,</v>

161
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
